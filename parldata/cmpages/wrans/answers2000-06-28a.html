<a name="00628w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the shooting dead of James Alfred Cornhill on 19 April.  [123057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No. The matter is currently under investigation and the investigation is being supervised by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what was the result of the ICPC inquiry into the shooting dead of Robin Charles Scott Maxwell in January 1994; and what were the findings of the coroner's inquest.  [123056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints issued a statement of satisfaction as to the conduct of the investigation.
<P>

<a name="00628w01.html_para0">A Coroner's inquest found that, on the evening of 27 January 1994 two masked men entered the High Trees Garage with the intention of robbing the premises. The owner, Mr. Weir, spotted the robbers and alerted two policemen who were hidden in the store at the rear of the shop. On entering the shop the policemen were confronted by the two robbers, one carrying a cudgel and one holding a firearm to Mr. Weir's head. The policemen issued a warning and the robber who held the cudgel fled from the premises pursued by Constable Fox. The other robber, Robin Charles Scott Maxwell, turned and pointed a weapon in the direction of Constable 'A', who, fearing that his and the owner's life was in danger, discharged his firearm, killing Mr. Maxwell almost instantaneously. The jury found that the police had no plan to intercept or arrest the robbers before their arrival at the premises.

<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many persons sought by the <i>(a)</i> RUC and <i>(b)</i> other UK police forces were extradited from the Irish Republic to the UK in (i) each of the previous three years and (ii) the current year.  [125543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The table provides details of the numbers of persons sought by the RUC and other UK police forces who have been extradited from the Irish Republic to the UK in the last three years and the current year. The figures include both terrorist and non-terrorist cases. It should be noted that the figures for England and Wales are not necessarily complete, as the information is not collated centrally.

<P>

<a name="00628w01.html_para1">Given the complex nature of extradition proceedings, it is not possible to compare directly the number of extradition requests with the number of individuals extradited in any given year. With appeal proceedings the process may take a number of years to be completed.

<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on how arrangements for Best Value will be made within the proposed new structure for policing under the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill.  [126577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Police (Northern Ireland) Bill will provide for the new Policing Board to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement, or 'Best Value', in the way in which its functions are exercised. The Policing Board, in its capacity as a high level regulatory body, will have lead responsibility for economy, efficiency and effectiveness arrangements. 'Best Value' will provide a framework for the Board to deliver continuous improvement, and the Board will be held accountable to the people of Northern Ireland for ensuring that they achieve 'Best Value' from the police service.
<P>

<a name="00628w01.html_para2">The Government do not wish to be prescriptive about the exact arrangements. It will be for the Policing Board, in association with the Chief Constable, to determine the precise arrangements for managing 'Best Value', in accordance with best practice elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> Officials of my Department have been contacted by members of the Harvard University Center for Risk Analysis team, and have assisted them by providing information on request. The team also visited the UK in 1999 and spoke to both officials and external experts. We understand that they were gathering information to determine their own approach to BSE; not undertaking a risk analysis of the UK situation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had with his EU counterparts about the inspection of their farm production methods with particular reference to welfare, hygiene and environmental aspects of production; and if he will make a statement.  [126954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 EU standards are negotiated and adopted in these areas by the Council of Ministers. Once EU measures have been adopted, checking that member states have taken proper steps to implement and enforce them is the responsibility of the European Commission. There have been no discussions with ministers from other member states on these matters recently, although at last week's Council of Ministers my right hon. Friend the Minister strongly urged his colleagues to enforce EU rules on the welfare of livestock in transit strictly, as we do in the United Kingdom.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the EU intervention level for milk.  [126958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There is no intervention price for milk under the CAP milk regime. The market is supported by means of intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder. The intervention price for butter is 3,282 euros per tonne and 2,055.2 for skimmed milk powder. The intervention prices expressed in sterling can vary on a daily basis since they are converted into national currency using the daily sterling/euro market rate of exchange.

 There is currently no commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops in the UK. Compensation for any detriment to a farmer as a result of activity on a neighbouring farm would be a matter between the farmer and those responsible for the activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what the position of the United Kingdom will be at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission.  [128441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The International Whaling Commission (IWC) will be holding its 52nd Annual Meeting in Adelaide between 3 and 6 July. I will be attending.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para0">At this meeting I will be confirming that the UK remains strongly opposed to whaling, and that our ultimate aim is to secure a permanent, worldwide ban on all whaling, other than some limited aboriginal subsistence whaling. We will be seeking to build upon the successful outcome of the recent CITES meeting where all whale downlisting proposals were rejected and the primacy of the IWC reaffirmed.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para1">There will be further discussions of proposals put forward by Ireland in 1997 for a package of measures on whaling. The Irish proposals would involve a ban on all whaling, including scientific whaling, outside coastal waters (in effect creating a global ocean sanctuary), with a possibility that countries might authorise whaling under IWC rules within their own coastal waters; there would be a ban on international trade in whale products. In these discussions we will maintain our previous position on these ideas: while we are prepared to discuss constructively all ideas for improving whale conservation, and strongly support some elements of these proposals, we have significant reservations about others, in particular those relating to coastal whaling. Nevertheless we are prepared to consider interim solutions on the way to our ultimate destination provided that these deliver very real benefits to whale conservation.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para2">It is, however, unlikely that any progress will be made on the Irish proposals, as the whaling countries and their allies remain opposed to key aspects of them. Japan, in particular, has demonstrated that it is not prepared to consider ending scientific whaling or a ban on international trade in whale products. In these circumstances, the United Kingdom will continue to support the alternative ways of achieving our aims that we outlined at least year's meeting and subsequently reported to the House on 9 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 348-50W.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para3">A key element of our approach is support for the creation of regional sanctuaries, and we will be strongly supporting a proposal put forward by Australia and New Zealand to create a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary. The proposed sanctuary will afford greater protection to whales in a highly important breeding and feeding area, and one through which many other great whales migrate. The proposal has been endorsed by South Pacific Forum leaders.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para4">At previous IWC meetings the UK, together with a majority of IWC members, has consistently criticised the whaling operations authorised by Japan under special permits--so called "scientific" whaling. It is, therefore, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jun 2000 : Column: 500W</I><P>
very disappointing that Japan has presented proposals, for discussion in the IWC Scientific Committee, to extend these whaling operations to cover two further species, Sperm and Bryde's whales. Under the IWC's parent convention, IWC approval for these proposals is not needed and it is for Japan to authorise whaling under special permit., We will, nevertheless, be registering the Government's strong objection to these proposals and will be urging Japan to withdraw them.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para5">There will be further discussion of The Revised Management Scheme (RMS), which is being developed to regulate all aspects of any future commercial whaling. The IWC meeting will be preceded by a two day working group focusing, in particular, on the Inspection and Observation Scheme which would form an integral part of the RMS. It is important for the credibility of the IWC for it to be seen to be making progress on the development of the RMS, and the UK will continue to participate constructively in this work. We will be seeking a comprehensive RMS that would ensure that, if commercial whaling was ever authorised in future, it could not pose a threat to whale conservation and that catch limits and other rules would be strictly observed. The Government will also be making it clear that our participation in this work is without prejudice to our opposition in principle to commercial whaling.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para6">As we have at previous meetings, the UK will again be expressing its concern about the cruelty involved in whaling; we also intend to raise the inhumane methods used and lack of regulation in the hunts for small cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises, that take place in some countries. Other topics on which we hope to make progress include the impact of environmental change and pollution on whales and other cetaceans and the encouragement of whalewatching.
<P>

<a name="00628w02.html_para7">We will report the outcome of the meeting to Parliament.

<a name="00628w02.html_para8"><i>Letter from Robert Walmsley to Mr. Mike Hancock, dated 28 June 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence on the collaborative Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement (TRACER) programme. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The joint programme with the United States to develop TRACER was formally launched with the signature of the programme Memorandum of Understanding in July 1998. Contracts for the current Project Definition phase were awarded to two UK/US industrial consortia in January 1999. These contracts will be of 42 month duration and are due to complete in July 2002. This phase of the programme is proceeding to schedule and within budget. UK expenditure on the joint programme to 31 March 2000 amounted to &#163;30 million and the current estimate of the overall cost to the UK of this phase is &#163;120M at current prices.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>UK involvement in phases beyond Project Definition will be subject to further approval and will take account of parallel studies into the use of Unmanned Air Vehicles for battlefield reconnaissance. A realistic estimate of the total cost of the project is not possible in advance of the decisions on the balance of investment between platforms ie armoured reconnaissance and Unmanned Air Vehicles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A feature of defence procurement is the need to accommodate new sophisticated systems within the resources expected to be available. Conflicting demands on the available resources inevitably lead to priorities being kept under review. The current budgetary review process in the US, which could have implications for the TRACER programme, is being closely monitored, and we are in regular contact with the US DoD.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the percentage of GNP spent on defence procurement in each of the last 10 years; and if he will make a statement.  [127176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Changes introduced under the European System of Accounts (ESA) 95 mean that GNP is no longer calculated. Gross National Income (GNI) is now recognised as the accepted, more accurate, standard and this has been used to provide the comparison with expenditure on Defence Equipment set out in the table. The GNI figure for 1999-2000 will not be available until the end of June and an updated reply will be made available at that time.

 As laid down in the Statutes and Royal Warrants which govern official British awards and at the discretion of the Defence Council, arrangements exist for the forfeiture of awards by any officer or member of the military forces, or former officer or member of the military forces. These include Orders, decorations and medals. Normally, forfeiture may be liable after conviction of offences by court-martial or by the Civil Power. The awards forfeited vary according to the gravity of the offence. The Statutes and Royal Warrants are reproduced in the Queen's Regulations for the Armed Services, copies of which are in the Library of the House.

<a name="00628w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 June 2000]:</i> Under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, emissions to air, water and land from larger plant regulated by the Environment Agency and emissions to air from medium and small plant regulated by local authorities are controlled through permits which impose emission limits on the basis of the site-specific BATNEEC principle (Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost) and relevant European legislation specifying emission limits. There are currently two municipal waste incineration Directives (89/369/EEC and 89/429/EEC) and a hazardous waste incineration Directive (94/67/EC) which specify emission limits, and a further Directive (Common Position (EC) No 7/2000) which will replace these earlier Directives and cover virtually all incineration plant is currently in the final stages of negotiations.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jun 2000 : Column: 503W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00628w03.html_para0">This latest proposed Directive would result in a ten-fold tightening of the municipal waste incinerator dioxins standard so that incinerators covered by it would be required to emit no more than 1 billionth of a gram of dioxins in a cubic metre of emissions to air.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 One of the main objectives of national planning policy for housing (PPG3) is that authorities make far better use of previously developed land and buildings for meeting the country's housing needs. The Government have set a target that by 2008 60 per cent. of additional housing should be provided this way. It is not possible to forecast precisely how much of the previously-developed land used by 2016 will be contaminated land, nor how that land will be remediated.
<P>

<a name="00628w03.html_para1">However, the Environment Agency has carried out a survey of remediation activity in England and Wales from January 1996 until December 1999. Information was collected from local authorities, industry and the National House-Building Council (NHBC). The survey was not statistically representative of all the remediation which took place during that time, but it does give an indication of current practice.
<P>

<a name="00628w03.html_para2">Of the 367 sites identified from local authority and industry sources, 75 per cent. involved excavation and disposal off site and 21 per cent. involved process based methods.

<a name="00628w03.html_para3">Of the 1,189 sites recorded by the NHBC, civil engineering techniques (including excavation and off site disposal, site re-grading and containment) were used on 95 per cent. of sites. Process based methods were used on 5 per cent. of sites.

 Installations covered by the draft Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations may also require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the planning system. The Regulations require the regulator to take account of any information supplied in the context of an EIA in determining the permit application. We are considering the case for reviewing the links between the planning and pollution control systems. A Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment for the Regulations has been placed in the Library of each House of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The licensing of hackney carriages--taxis--is a matter for individual local licensing authorities. Many of them have policies which require all or part of their fleet to be accessible to disabled people, for example all London taxis (some 19,000) were required to be accessible from 1 January 2000. Information on the number of vehicles that are accessible is not, however, held centrally.

<a name="00628w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Responsibility for the regulation of rail fares lies with the Franchising Director not the Rail Regulator. Under the Railways Act 1993, the Franchising Director has powers to regulate fares where it is in the interests of passengers to do so. He has imposed a cap on the price of key fares, and operators are not able to increase those fares overall above the rate of inflation. Since January 1999, the key fares have been capped at 1 per cent. below the rate of inflation for each of the next four years. The key fares include all Saver tickets, unrestricted standard returns where there are no Savers, and all standard weekly season tickets. Other fares, including discounted fares for off-peak travel, are set by the train operators.

 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2000]:</i> The problem of begging is a concern to all public transport operators and in particular the railways and London Underground. They are trying to increase public awareness of the associated problems and announcements are made on stations and trains requesting that the public refrain from giving money to beggars.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00628w04.html_para0">Various powers are available to the police forces dealing with both begging and busking under the Vagrancy Act, the Children and Young Persons Act and specialist railway legislation. Police forces adopt a proactive approach, especially where issues of safety are concerned, and have an agreed policy with the Crown Prosecution Service to charge and prosecute first time offenders where safety may be compromised.

<a name="00628w04.html_para10">Regeneration in Coventry will be further supported through the development of a healthy living centre (HLC), subject to the success of the bid which was submitted at the end of May. HLCs are funded through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and are aimed at mobilising community activity in improving health and reducing inequalities. The HLC bid arose from extensive partnership working and more than 300 information packs were distributed to voluntary, community and statutory groups across Coventry. Coventry's bid is designed to complement other initiatives such as the HImP and the community plan and will focus on young people, their families and carers.

A relevant example here is the production of a DETR leaflet "Air Pollution--what it means for your health", published in July 1998. This was designed as a guide to the Air Pollution Information Service which DETR Ministers relaunched in October 1997. The service is available by freephone, Ceefax, Teletext and via the internet. The leaflets and an accompanying poster were distributed in general practitioners' surgeries, asthma and heart clinics, Citizen's Advice Bureaux and libraries.

 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2000]:</i> The National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) provides a service to health care professionals. It consists of six poison information centres situated at Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Newcastle, and the Tablet and Capsule Identification System (TICTAC) at St. George's. The UK Departments of Health, (in Wales the Specialist Health Services Commission on behalf of health authorities), commission the NPIS Centres to provide information and, on request, clinical advice to health care staff on the diagnosis, treatment and management of patients who have, or are suspected to have, been poisoned. The service is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
<P>

<a name="00628w05.html_para7">The NPIS Board was set up to advise the UK Health Departments on matters such as policy and the strategic direction of the service, and to scrutinise its work. The Board's membership consists of representatives from the four UK Health Departments who have executive powers and nine non-executive members representing health professionals. The Board aims to meet quarterly (providing there is sufficient business to warrant a meeting). It is an internal management committee and as such its agendas and minutes are not published.
<P>

<a name="00628w05.html_para8">Formal agreements have existed between the Secretary of State for Health and providers of poisons information services over the period 1995 to 1999. The exact terms of these agreements will have varied between each year and between each NPIS Centre. Broadly, such agreements will have set out details of the levels and quality of service to be provided as well as financial arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00628w05.html_para9">For the calendar year 1998, NPIS Centres were required to compile a report to the Department of Health to comply with the provisions of EC Resolution 90/C 329-03. All Centres met with this requirement. Under the terms of agreements with the Secretary of State for Health for the financial year 1999-2000, the three English NPIS Centres were required to submit information for management purposes. To date, one of the Centres has submitted a written report for the year 1999-2000 and the two other Centres have been requested to provide written reports by the end of June.

 Clinical governance is central to our plans to provide a health service that continually improves the overall standard of clinical care it delivers, reduces unacceptable variations in treatment outcomes, and ensures that clinical decision making is supported by evidence of effectiveness. It represents a systematic approach to clinical quality assurance and improvement, but does not dictate how services should be managed or delivered. This is the responsibility of local commissioners who must ensure that high quality surgical services are provided safely, taking into account local circumstances such as geography and the need for remote smaller services to be linked into wider clinical networks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he has taken to provide protection to patients who utilise the Internet for health information services and products.  [127883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w06.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> The success of the Internet has been partly due to the ease with which people can access and create information. While it is not possible to restrict what patients see on the Internet, we recognise the need to signpost information sources, and to give easy access to relevant quality information that the public and patients can rely on, and which is presented in a clear and intelligible way.
<P>

<a name="00628w06.html_para14">A number of information initiatives are being put in place to improve the quality and range of information available about health and health services:
<P>

<a name="00628w06.html_para15"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Health Service Executive has set up the Centre for Health Information Quality (CHiQ). The role of CHiQ is to work with the producers of information for the patients and the public to improve its quality, accessibility and evidence base. The CHiQ work uses the DISCERN tool for evaluating health literature. DISCERN was developed by the UK academic sector in collaboration with healthcare professionals and is funded by the NHS Executive.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00628w06.html_para16"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>NHS Direct Online (www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk) is a highly successful gateway to health information on the Internet attracting 25,000 users a week and complementing the NHS Direct telephone advice service. NHS Direct Online is managed by the CHiQ on behalf of the NHS Executive.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00628w06.html_para17"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>nhs.uk will provide a strongly branded gateway (www.nhs.uk) to NHS websites and licensed or accredited websites and services. Close working relationships with the Department of Health, NHS Executive, other NHS Information Authority programmes and the NHS are in place.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00628w06.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Electronic Library for Health (NeLH) will provide a common point of public access to a wide range of health knowledge bases. The NeLH will emphasise the need for all clinical practitioners to critically evaluate sources.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00628w06.html_para19">There is currently no formal process of NHS accreditation of the vast amount of clinical and health related reference material already available on the Internet. Feedback from the consultation exercise on the NHS National Plan has indicated that there is a need to identify NHS approved quality resources by means of a NHS "kitemark". The work being undertaken by CHiQ and the NHS Information Authority to develop NHS Direct Online and the National Electronic Library for Health will help to identify practical options for achieving this.
<P>

<a name="00628w06.html_para20">Ultimately however the responsibility rests on individual clinicians, patients and members of the public to make their own judgments about the validity of the material they access.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that non-human primates are only used in scientific procedures if no other species is suitable. In deciding whether to grant a licence for any regulated procedure, the 1986 Act requires that the likely benefits of the programme be weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment) and that there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures to minimise suffering. We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.

Detective Constable Longshaw, a serving officer with the Metropolitan Police Service, who was enjoying an outing with his family in the company of Dr. Burhan al-Chelabi and his wife, prevented Mr. Smith from attacking Dr. al-Chelabi with a sword.

 DFID's involvement in the livestock sector is based on an appreciation of the diverse contribution livestock make to the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="00628w10.html_para0">We are supporting the international "Livestock, Environment and Development" initiative, which seeks to identify policy interventions to correct the market distortions that currently favour industrial livestock production in many developing countries.
<P>

<a name="00628w10.html_para1">We are also developing a programme of support to FAO aimed at strengthening international norm-setting in the livestock sector: norms that will undoubtedly address issues of animal health and welfare.
<P>

<a name="00628w10.html_para2">DFID has anticipated the impact of globalisation on animal welfare and trade in developing countries. We already have guidelines on the use of animals in development programmes, which will now be revised in the context of global shifts in livestock production and markets. Dialogue with UK and international welfare groups and other stakeholders is under way.

<a name="00628w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 None. Debt relief is not provided to UK companies. It is provided to governments of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) who are committed to eradicating poverty, to benefit the poor. The Government have agreed to provide complete relief on all debts owed to the Export Credit Guarantee Department for those countries which qualify for the HIPC initiative. Aid debts have already been cancelled.

<a name="00628w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 There has been no need for discussions on this particular issue as the Government of Uganda abolished primary school fees in all Government schools, with the exception of those in municipal areas, in January 1997. HIPC1 is on-going and HIPC2 has yet to be finalised; both sets of resources will be used to support the Government of Uganda's primary education programme.

<a name="00628w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend had no discussions with the UN concerning debt relief to Uganda. We agreed that Uganda's debt relief could not be finalised by the Paris Club of government creditors at their May meeting as planned, because of Uganda's involvement in fighting at Kisangani. We want an early and lasting resolution to the situation, and we urge all sides to implement their obligations under the Lusaka Accord. When Uganda has fulfilled the undertakings it has given on Kisangani, we will support their return to the Paris Club. Uganda is receiving interim relief from the IMF and the World Bank, and we believe this should continue.

[127895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Since May 1996, about 3,000 Montserratians have come to the United Kingdom because of the volcanic activity on the island. In May 1999, DFID introduced a Return Air Fare Scheme to provide assistance to those people who, having relocated to the UK or the Caribbean region, wished to return to Montserrat and had suitable accommodation on island. During the first year, 109 applications were received from people living in the UK and, as at the 31 May 2000, 83 people had returned to Montserrat.

 None. Officials have discussed the matter with their counterparts on island, and the Chief Minister. The Montserrat Reporter received start up capital from HMG and for several years since has received budgetary aid from DFID, paid through the Chief Minister's Office in exchange for publishing Government news. The Government of Montserrat have recently concluded in a Public Service Inquiry that these payments did not represent value for money. DFID officials have now decided to withdraw the support, which was never intended as a permanent arrangement.

service charges. It is a basic principle of the scheme that such costs should be met from clients' other income, including Income Support.
<P>

<a name="00628w10.html_para4">Restrictions may also be made under the local reference rent scheme. This scheme is designed to give tenants an interest in their housing costs and to deter private sector landlords from charging higher rents to those claiming Housing Benefit than they would be able to get from tenants who are not in receipt of Housing Benefit.
<P>

<a name="00628w10.html_para5">The available information on family units receiving Housing Benefit and Income Support and Incapacity Benefit who were assessed under the local reference rent scheme in May 1998 (the latest date for which figures are available) is set out in the tables. It is important to note that there is no direct correlation between the average amounts of rent restriction shown in the tables and families' actual incomes which will vary with individual circumstances. For a family on Income Support their actual income may be higher than Income Support levels because of the various disregards on both earned and unearned income. In addition, local authorities have discretionary powers to make additional payments where they judge that the rent restriction would cause the family exceptional hardship.

 Eligibility for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is based on a person's needs, and not on recognition of their specific medical condition. People with epilepsy, as with other potentially disabling conditions, are therefore asked by the Benefits Agency to state their care and mobility needs arising from their condition when completing a DLA claim form. Decision makers are given information on the care and mobility needs arising from disabilities, including epilepsy, in the "Disability Handbook", which is compiled by senior doctors in the Department and approved and monitored by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board. People claiming DLA are also able to make free calls to the Benefits Inquiry Line to help them with their application.

All reports are either placed in the Library or are available on request. If a report is not available, this may be because the full research has not yet been completed (ie reports not yet finalised by contractors, or the fieldwork is still in progress) or findings are still being employed to inform the communications activity.

However, according to official FRY figures, FRY exports to all developing countries represent only 7.3 per cent. of total exports and are unlikely to do much to reduce the FRY's growing trade deficit.

The Presidency report to the European Council in Feira outlined areas for discussion in the second half of this year.

 Paying Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) through the wage packet helps to demonstrate the rewards of work and to make work pay for families on low incomes. An employee applying for WFTC will be paid the tax credit by his or her employer as part of the pay packet and will be able to see clearly the amount of tax credit being paid in each pay period. If the applicant is self-employed or is not working the tax credit is paid by the Inland Revenue either by Automatic Credit Transfer (ACT) into a bank account or by Order Book.

 If, in its judgment due on 12 September, the European Court of Justice agrees with the earlier opinion of the Advocate-General--that VAT should be charged on road tolls--VAT will not be imposed upon motorists or toll operators retrospectively. It may, however, be necessary for the UK to recalculate contributions made to the European Commission budget from 1984. While it is not possible accurately to calculate the amount involved, it will be very small in relation to our overall contribution.

<P>
<a name="00628w14.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government want to minimise the number of people who have to complete self- assessment tax returns. That is why last July I announced changes to the criteria determining who should receive self-assessment tax returns which meant that up to 200,000 older people should no longer have to complete returns. The Inland Revenue are considering whether there are other changes which can be made.
<P>

<a name="00628w14.html_para0">For those pensioners who have to complete a tax return the Revenue is committed to giving the help they need. The Inland Revenue will help pensioners complete any forms if they cannot complete them themselves. They will visit the pensioner in his or her home if a face-to-face discussion is necessary and the pensioner is too infirm to get to the local tax office. Most Inland Revenue offices are equipped with magnifying lenses and induction loops--and all will be within the next few months. For those who prefer to contact the Revenue by telephone, they can contact their own tax office or use the helpline on 0845 9000 444. Research shows that the Revenue's help is valued as pensioners are the Inland Revenue's most satisfied customer group.

<P>
<a name="00628w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The New Deal for Young People is aimed at people aged 18-24 who have been claiming unemployment benefits for six months or more.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jun 2000 : Column: 546W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00628w15.html_para0">Claimant unemployment among this group has fallen by 70 per cent. in the three years since April 1997 and by 56 per cent. since April 1998 when the New Deal was introduced. Part of this fall is due to the delivery of a strong and stable economy, but the New Deal for Young People has helped unemployment to fall even faster. The fall of 56 per cent. since the New Deal was introduced compares with a fall of 18 per cent. in total 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jun 2000 : Column: 547W</I><P>
unemployment, 23 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment and 26 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more. The positive effect of the New Deal is confirmed by independent research from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
<P>

<a name="00628w15.html_para1">It is not possible to measure the New Deal effect exactly in each constituency. However, in Crosby the falls in unemployment among the New Deal client group have also been substantially faster than for other groups. In Crosby constituency in the two years since April 1998 claimant unemployment among those aged 18-24, unemployed for six months or more, has fallen by 52 per cent. from 161 to 77. This compares with a fall of 19 per cent. in total unemployment, 31 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment, and 20 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more.

 On 7 June the European Commission adopted a Communication on a Community framework strategy on gender equality 2001-05.

The Commission also adopted a proposal that there be a European Parliament and Council Directive amending the Equal Treatment Directive (76/207) on equality for men and women. The Government will study each of the proposals carefully (including any impact on domestic legislation such as the

This has helped to reduce the size of the average Key Stage 1 class in Morecambe and Lunesdale to 26.0. The figure in January 1997 was 29.1.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the cost of <i>(a)</i> reducing all primary school class sizes to 25 pupils or fewer and <i>(b)</i> introducing a maximum average class size of 25 in primary schools; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> It has been estimated that the cost of reducing class sizes to 25 for all primary school children would be around &#163;3 billion. We have not made an estimate of the cost of a maximum average class size of 25 in primary schools.
<P>

<a name="00628w16.html_para5">The size of the average primary class fell for the second year running between January 1999 and January 2000, from 27.5 to 27.1, after rising for the previous 10 years. The size of the average primary class in the Truro and St. Austell parliamentary constituency has gone down from 27.5 in January 1997 to 27.2 in January 2000.
<P>

<a name="00628w16.html_para6">At the same time, we are well on the way to delivering our pledge to limit infant classes to 30 pupils. &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge, and allocations so far to Cornwall LEA amount to some &#163;3.5 million. This has helped to reduce the size of the average Key Stage 1 class in Truro and St. Austell to 24.9. The figure in January 1997 was 25.4.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many toilets at buildings owned or controlled by his Department <i>(a)</i> have and <i>(b)</i> do not have access for disabled people.  [127598]<P>

<P>
<a name="00628w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> Central records are not kept on the total number of toilets in buildings owned or controlled by the Department. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Specialist toilet facilities for disabled people are currently available in over 700 (64 per cent.) of these buildings, and we intend to increase the number of buildings that have facilities for disabled people as soon as practicable.

 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2000]:</i> Young people were consulted about their job expectations and asked to examine the different expectations of boys and girls. Young women felt that despite their better performance than boys in school exams, the full range of career choices was not always presented to them. As a result we have developed a range of work experience programmes for girls with major companies and the Ministry of Defence to give girls an experience of different non-traditional work areas such as IT, engineering, construction, property and the armed forces.

from the proposed Cabinet structure for local government for those councils which consist mainly of independent councillors.  [126719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00628w18.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
 I have discussed the proposals with Welsh local councils individually and with the WLGA. The majority of Welsh councils--including some of those consisting mainly of independents--are currently piloting some form of executive style decision making. We have made no general assessment of pilots individual councils are currently pursuing, however these innovations are being carried out under the existing legislative framework which is not designed for executive arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00628w18.html_para10">The Local Government Bill [<i>Lords</i>] provides a tailor made framework for executive arrangements including cabinets and directly elected mayors. The National Assembly for Wales will have the power to make further forms of executive available to Welsh councils if appropriate.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00628w19.html_para2">This matter comes under the responsibility of the Office of Government Commerce, which has been a Treasury Department since April 2000. Each Government Department is responsible for deciding the most appropriate telecommunications systems to meet its business requirements. Obtaining records from each of these on any use of interactive voice response systems to deal with public inquiries would be disproportionately costly.

was published on 15 June 2000. The research found that there is a wide range of factors that affect decisions to apply for judicial appointment and/or Queen's Counsel. Some respondents did not have a judicial appointment in their career plan, while others were concerned about the consultation procedures for assessing candidates for judicial office; concerns based on largely inaccurate perceptions of how the system actually works. The report made no findings into the system of appointment of QCs and judges.
