<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many incidents of <i>(a)</i> virus infection and <i>(b)</i> horizontal gene transfer, broken down by the (i) place, (ii) date and (iii) exact nature of each incident, have occurred as a result of xenotransplantation procedures; and if he will make a statement;  [125265]
<P>
<UL>(2) what safety precautions are implemented <i>(a)</i> during and <i>(b)</i> after xenotransplantation research procedures in order to minimise (i) virus infection and (ii) horizontal gene transfer.  [125264]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> The safety of research into xenotransplantation is governed by various regulations. A summary of the agencies involved and regulations that might apply is contained in guidance on making proposals to conduct xenotransplantation on human subjects (UKXIRA 1998). Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00614w01.html_para4">The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR) requires employers to notify the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) of incidents occurring in the workplace that result in the ill health of employees. The HSE has advised that data sets for reports under RIDDOR for the financial years 1994-95 to 1998-99 contained no reports of infection attributed to xenotransplantation procedures.
<P>

<a name="00614w01.html_para5">No clinical trials involving humans have yet been approved in the United Kingdom. Our position remains that clinical trials in xenotransplantation involving humans will be allowed to take place only when we are fully satisfied that the risks associated with such procedures are acceptable, taking account of all the available evidence at the time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the report, "Diabetes in the UK-the Missing Million"; and if he will make a statement.  [125738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We welcome the report, which will help to raise awareness of the seriousness of diabetes. We announced last year the development of a National Service Framework for diabetes in England. The diabetes National Service Framework will be published in 2001 for implementation in the National Health Service from 2002. Its aim is to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes, by raising the quality of services and reducing variations between them.

<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much funding the Government contributed towards the financing of the North West air ambulance, and how many times the air ambulance has been called out in the North West, in the last year for which figures are available. [125959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Air ambulances are not funded from National Health Service central funds. The North West air ambulance launched 480 missions in its first year, 1999-2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will estimate the financial effect on the Government of the EU Commissioners' proposal to achieve the required reduction in fishing for MAGP IV exclusively through cuts in fleet capacity; and what fleet cuts would be required in Britain for the remaining 18 months of the programme.  [124452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 If adopted, the suggested measures would require a cut in the UK fishing fleet of 8 per cent. over the two years 2001-02, representing about 22,000 tonnes of capacity.
<P>

<a name="00614w01.html_para6">It is not possible to make an accurate estimate of the likely cost of decommissioning this tonnage through a voluntary grant scheme. Based on the average level of successful bids under the most recent scheme in 1997, it would be about &#163;75 million. But the cost would be substantially higher since there would have to be sizeable cuts in those profitable fleet segments which have hitherto shown little interest in voluntary decommissioning schemes. Cuts of this scale over such a time period are not ones we think are feasible or that we could support.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 3 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 140W, on live animal exports, what steps he plans to take to reduce the number of sheep originating from Kent which need to be removed by his staff at Dover port from consignments of slaughter/further fattening sheep; and if he will make a statement.  [124888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Careful consideration is already given to the reasons why individual sheep are found to be unfit at Dover so that steps can be taken to deal with any remediable cause.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 1 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 286W, on live animal exports, how many sheep were rejected by local veterinary inspectors from 31 May to 31 December 1999 as unfit to travel, broken down by county in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what percentage of agricultural/horticultural workers in Cheshire are in <i>(a)</i> part-time and <i>(b)</i> full-time employment; how many receive the national minimum wage; how many of the part-time employees are female; and if he will make a statement on the retention of the Agricultural Wages Board.  [124785]<P>

<P>
<a name="00614w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The 1999 June Agricultural and Horticultural Census recorded 3,938 agricultural and horticultural workers in Cheshire (excluding farmers and managers). Of this total 23 per cent. were in part-time employment and 77 per cent. were in full-time employment. The agricultural work force in Cheshire included 868 regular part-time workers of which 408 were female. In addition 300 casual or seasonal workers were employed on a part-time basis. We have no information on the gender of these workers or any data on rates of pay on a county basis.

 At its meeting in Luxembourg on 17 April the Agriculture Council reached a political agreement on the adoption of a common position on a Commission proposal for a Regulation laying down general rules for a compulsory beef labelling system in the EU. Since then we have received representations from a number of organisations involved in the beef supply chain expressing concerns about the compliance costs, the value of the proposed compulsory indications to consumers and the timescale for implementation.
<P>

<a name="00614w02.html_para4">Particular concern has been expressed about the requirement for beef to be labelled with the category of animal from which it is derived.

An EU-drafted Resolution was passed, registering major concerns, including the need for an independent Commission of Inquiry meeting international standards.

The Lord Chancellor has been consulting on changes to this rule to control the use of QCs more strictly. The consultation is substantially concluded and he will shortly be laying regulations which will have the effect of restricting the use of QCs to cases where the prosecution have instructed a QC or Senior Treasury Counsel or the defence case is exceptional when judged against other offences of the same type and the defence case for that defendant involves substantial, novel or complex issues of law or fact which in the opinion of the court could properly be handled by a QC.

 Wherever possible we disperse asylum seekers to areas where there is an established community of the same language. We also take into account any other local factors brought to our attention during the consultation process with the local regional consortium. The voluntary agencies are establishing "one stop shops" where asylum seekers can receive help and advice.

 The Home Office spent &#163;170,000 in 1999-2000 under the Community Resource Fund, and is likely to spend a similar amount during this financial year. &#163;325,000 was spent under the Community Development Learning Fund with &#163;650,000 to be made available for 2000-01. Both these funds were established as a result of recommendations contained in the Policy Action Team 9 Report on Community Self-Help, and are aimed at enabling small and emerging community groups in deprived areas to access funds as easily and quickly as possible.

Where our current funding allocations are insufficient to support good proposals put to us by the Croatian authorities, I shall consider transferring uncommitted funds from within the overall allocation for Central and South Eastern Europe.

 The shadow Strategic Rail Authority is already working closely with Railtrack to construct replacement timetables for services disrupted by the engineering works for Thameslink 2000. These discussions supplement the normal 30 week notice period Railtrack must give to Train Operating Companies in order to undertake long planned work, and the aim is to reduce disruptions to the minimum.

 These services were withdrawn some years ago by the British Railways Board as they were no longer financially viable. Since then journey times and opportunities on North of England services have been substantially improved both early in the morning and late into the evening. The Franchising Director has no plans to include North of England sleeper services in Passenger Service Requirements at present, since there is little perceived demand. These services could be provided by train operators in the future if there is an adequate commercial basis for their provision. Financial support could be sought through the making of an appropriate Rail Passenger Partnership bid.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2000]:</i> It was decided to extend the Jubilee Line from Green Park to Stratford via Westminster and Waterloo, omitting Charing Cross for engineering, cost and passenger benefit reasons. London Underground Limited did not undergo a consultation period before the withdrawal of the service since Part Five, Section 38 of the London Underground Act 1992 (giving construction powers) excluded them from any need to do so. However, throughout the time the Bill was going through Parliament London Underground made clear their intention to close the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms.

<a name="00614w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2000]:</i> Negotiations for a replacement South Central franchise are at an advanced stage. The Deputy Prime Minister has asked the Franchising Director to evaluate the bids against the following criteria: commitment to secure better performance and customer services, the extent to which extra or earlier investment can be secured, the extent to which passengers will be given a greater voice in the level and standard of services, and value for money to the taxpayer. All the investment proposals contained in bids will be evaluated against these criteria.

This could lead to a number of different outcomes to remove the source of damage.

<P>
<a name="00614w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 As a result of in service experience of engine icing on the BAe 146, the Civil Aviation Authority has issued a total of five Airworthiness Directives, two of which have been superseded. These Airworthiness Directives impose operating limitations and placarding requirements. In addition, the CAA has accepted as mandatory three Airworthiness Directives (two of which have been superseded) issued by US Federal Aviation Administration in relation to the Allied Signal ALF 502 engine used on the BAe 146. The CAA is entirely satisfied that all the necessary precautions have been taken to ensure that the aircraft meets both UK and international airworthiness standards. The current limitation published for aircraft have shown themselves to be both effective and practical for crews to apply.
<P>

<a name="00614w08.html_para2">The CAA has not issued any Airworthiness Directives relating to the ingestion of engine fumes into the cabin on BAe 146. This issue is currently the subject of investigations by both the Australian Senate and the Swedish aviation authorities. Should these investigations reveal problems the CAA will ensure that appropriate action is taken.

SIFF is a complicated project.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only contract placed to date for fitting SIFF has been to the Royal Air Force's Tornado F3 aircraft. This was placed with the then British Aerospace, the aircraft design authority in 1998. This contract was placed ahead of the main SIFF programme in order to achieve cost savings through alignment with the Tornado Capability Sustainment Programme. Separately, but also in 1998, the SIFF Integration Study and Planning Phase (ISPP) commenced with contracts being placed with individual platform type design authorities to investigate the fitting of a SIFF system to the platforms in the main SIFF programme. The overall value of the Tornado F3 and ISPP contracts together amounts to some &#163;100M, and this is within the original budget provision.</FONT></UL>

Outputs from ISPP have included Demonstration and Manufacture tenders provided by two competing potential equipment suppliers, BAE SYSTEMS and Raytheon Systems Ltd, covering many of the platform types, and from individual platform design authorities for the remainder. Evaluation of these tenders is an extensive and intensive task, to ensure that the decision on the choice of equipment supplier and the phasing of the work to be undertaken by the individual platform design authorities is made on the best overall balance of operational and value for money grounds. We are currently considering the way ahead in the light of this and in the current competitive situation are unable to provide further information on costs or budgets.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The data cover UK Regular Forces and UK based civilian personnel counted in official Ministry of Defence civil service figures. They exclude UK based casual civilian personnel and permanent civilian personnel whose salaries are paid for or reimbursed by other non MOD organisations such as NATO and USAF.<P>

2. Civilian figures are full-time equivalents where part-time staff are counted in proportion to hours worked. Since 1995 the method of counting part-time civilian staff has reflected actual hours worked (on average approximately 60 per cent. of full-time) rather than the notional 50 per cent. previously used.<P>

3. The data for Royal Navy Regular Forces include personnel on board ships in their home waters who are included in the region of their ships home port. The method of allocating personnel to location was changed in 1995 from having a category for location on the record of Service to using the postcode of the unit to which personnel are attached.<P>

4. Location data for territorial forces are only readily available for 1999 for the Royal Navy and RAF and are not readily available at all for the Army. Such incomplete data are of little use for comparative purpose of the PQ and have therefore not been included in the written answer. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will estimate how many direct debits for paying licence fees currently set up with the BBC by visually-impaired customers will have to be cancelled because of the evidence requirements contained within the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1998; what guidance his Department has given the BBC to ensure that visually-impaired customers have equal access to this method of paying bills; and if he will make a statement.

 Under section 2(2) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act (as amended), the only evidence required to prove entitlement to the 50 per cent. reduction in the television licence fee for registered blind people, introduced by the Government on 1 April this year, is a certificate issued by a local authority. This requirement has no bearing on the method of payment. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport does not issue guidance to the BBC on the administration of the television licensing system, since this is a statutory responsibility of the Corporation.

One of the conditions for switch-over is that 95 per cent. of consumers have access to digital receiving equipment.

<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para0">The 1998-99 Statement showed losses of &#163;136 million. In addition to overpayments caused by fraudulent benefit claims, this amount includes losses due to other factors such as the writing off of old debts, the miscalculation of entitlement in disability benefits, the change in the payment of hospital in-patients and the duplication of payments of Jobseeker's Allowance by automated credit transfer.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para1">The number of people involved in fraudulent benefit claims, which formed part of the total losses, is not available.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para2">The number of benefit claimants who received no further benefit is not available, as the Benefits Agency does not match past fraudulent claims with new claims.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to review the imputed rate of return on savings used in calculating entitlement to means-tested benefits.  [124939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The system of tariff income in the income-related benefits is not based on any imputed rate of return. The system provides a straightforward method of calculating the weekly contribution which people with capital in excess of the lower limit are expected to make from those resources to help meet their normal living expenses. Because no tariff applies to savings below the lower limit, the rule is most generous to people with relatively low savings; for example, in cases where the lower limit is &#163;3,000 the annual tariff income for a person with savings between &#163;3,000 and &#163;3,250 would equate to just 1.6 per cent. of their savings.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para3">The capital rules are kept under regular review.

<P>
<a name="00614w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 During 1999 the Government led a programme of listening to older people events across the UK. The events were put on by a partnership between the Inter-Ministerial Group for Older People, the UK Secretariat for the International Year of Older Persons and mainly voluntary sector organisations working with older people.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para4">On 17 May the Government published three documents relating to this programme of listening events. "Life begins at 50: the 1999 Listening Events"; a newsletter style account of last year's regional programme of events. "Building a Better Society for Older People: Report on the Listening Events to the Inter-Ministerial Group for Older People"; a research report on the regional events by Annette Boaz and Carol Hayden, Warwick Business School, the University of Warwick. "Life begins at 50--A Better Society for Older People"; a report setting out the key points raised by older people during the 1999 listening events, the action we have already taken to address them, and the action we will take in the future.

<a name="00614w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is estimated that in the last two years the National Insurance Recording System (NIRS) computer will not have carried out a calculation of the additional pension in some 120,000 cases. The number of these who have not yet been paid their full entitlement to additional pension is not known, but because the facility for Benefit Agency offices to apply for a clerical calculation has been available, the number will be in the minority.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para6">There is a team of 10.5 people in the Benefits Agency responsible for clerical calculations of additional pension.
<P>

<a name="00614w12.html_para7">The number of clerical calculations carried out in March was 5,789; in April it was 588; and in May it was 442. The significant reduction in April and May was planned. The processes that had prevented the NIRS2 computer calculating additional pension had become available and it was part of a strategy to accommodate the transition from clerical to computer calculations.

<P>
<a name="00614w12.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There will be no requirement for limited liability partnerships to register an agreement between members. The Government concluded, after wide consultation and taking account of the views of the Trade and Industry Committee, that to impose a requirement on LLPs to register a member's agreement would be of little value unless regulations determined exactly what should be contained in the agreement, and that would be almost impossible to define. Moreover, it would be impracticable for Companies House to take a view on every individual agreement to ensure agreements met the statutory criteria before allowing an LLP to register.

 There has been extensive consultation on the basis of three detailed consultation documents published in February 1997, September 1998 and July 1999. For each consultation copies were sent to some 1,800 consultees, including business, trade associations, academics, potential clients and regulators and meetings were held by officials with interested representatives from each of these groups. Telephone and written requests for documents resulted in around 3,000-5,000 extra copies of each document being sent out. The documents were also made available to visitors to the LLP website at www.dti.gov.uk/cld/llpbill/index.htm from September 1998. Over 300 responses were received in total. The names of those who responded can be found in the Libraries of each House and the responses are publicly available. A further short consultation paper was published in February 2000 on a more limited circulation, but was also available on the LLP website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what duty the Postal Services Commission will have to ensure that any infringement of the reserved area is remedied.  [126396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00614w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The provisions in the Postal Services Bill provide for the enforcement of the reserved area by the Postal Services Commission. That it has a duty to do so is implicit in the Bill. The reserved area (in which it is an offence to operate without a licence) is there to protect the provision of the universal postal service. The primary duty of the Commission (as set out in clause 3) is to exercise its functions in the manner which it considers best calculated to ensure the provision of the universal postal service.
<P>

<a name="00614w13.html_para5">Since, under the European postal services directive, the reserved area can be only such as is necessary to ensure the provision of the universal service, infringement (unlicensed activity) of the reserved area (which is illegal) must be considered a potential threat to the provision of the universal service. This applies as much to relatively small infringements (which could cumulatively undermine the universal postal service) as it does to large infringements which have a significant effect in their own right. It follows, therefore, that there is an implied duty for the Commission to enforce the reserved area to protect the licensing regime and by doing so to protect the provision of a universal postal service.
<P>

<a name="00614w13.html_para6">The Bill makes it clear that, if the Commission considers that the scope of clause 7 of the Bill, and thus the activities requiring a licence, should be changed the mechanism for doing so is to recommend to the Secretary of State that he makes an Order modifying clause 7. It is 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 2000 : Column: 660W</I><P>
clear, therefore, that the Commission should not allow de facto reductions in the scope of the reserved area simply by allowing repeated infringements of it.
<P>

<a name="00614w13.html_para7">Both the intention and effect of the Bill is that the Commission will take whatever enforcement action it considers necessary to protect the reserved area by deterring, detecting and prosecuting or otherwise remedying unlicensed activity. Not to do so (without good reason) would be a breach of its duties.
<P>

<a name="00614w13.html_para8">In line with precedents in the utilities legislation (where it is also a criminal offence to operate without a licence) and the application of the criminal law in general, by not creating an express duty to take enforcement action in all circumstances, the Bill recognises that there should be an element of discretion in enforcement. So, while the presumption is that the Commission will usually take action to protect the licensed area where it knows or has good reason to believe an offence is being committed under clause 6 of the Bill, there may be circumstances where formal enforcement procedures, by prosecution or otherwise, are not in the public interest.
