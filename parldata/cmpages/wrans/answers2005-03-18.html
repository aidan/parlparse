<p><a name="50318w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Wilshire: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason security staff at English airports are vetted by the Scottish Criminal Records Bureau; and for how long this has been the case. [222604]</p>




<p><a name="50318w01.html_spnew0"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 March 2005]:</i> Security staff at UK airports are vetted by the Department for Transport at Counter-Terrorist Check (CTC) Level. All other staff who need to work in the Restricted Zone at airports are required to undergo a check of their criminal record. Such staff need to provide a Basic Disclosure certificate to the pass issuing authority (Aerodrome Manager). At present the only source of such a certificate is Disclosure Scotland (part of the Scottish Criminal Records Office). The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), which provides the Disclosure service in England and Wales, is considering its approach to the introduction .of Basis Disclosures as part of a strategy review.

<sup>(4)</sup> For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes selected to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2003 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were selected:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

2 Cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 292, 304, 305.2&#150;305.9, E850-E858, E950.0-E950.5, E962.0 and E980.0-E980.5 for 1999 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F11-F16, F18-F19, X40-X44, X60-X64, X85 and Y10-Y14from 2001 onwards.<br>

3 Drugs mentioned on the death certificate of a death where the underlying cause was drug poisoning.<br>

4 Data are for deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

5 It is not possible to provide separate figures on deaths related to crack cocaine and cocaine from routine mortality data, as these substances are not generally separately identified on death certificates. ONS routinely publishes a combined figure for deaths mentioning cocaine on the death certificate.<br>

 No underspend from the 2004 EC Budget has yet been announced by the European Commission.

This will be implemented by an Amending Budget tater this year. The surplus from the 2003 EC Budget was returned to member states in this way in Amending Budget 7/2004 implemented from 1 October 2004.

 The return to Nigeria of any money held in accounts owned by the Abacha family or close associates is dependent on the Nigerian authorities prosecuting individuals for their offences and subsequently, if these individuals are found to be guilty, obtaining a confiscation order against them. An application for enforcement of that order in the UK courts would then be required. I understand that no such confiscation orders have, as yet, been made in Nigeria.

 The impact on UK industry of the recent temporary rises in spot gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and/or forward prices and the duration of the high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. The impact on domestic consumers will depend on whether the energy supply companies decide to pass on the costs of what was a short-lived spike in spot prices. Prices in the domestic sector are set to cover a range of weather, including such cold snaps, so we would not expect these peaks to feed into domestic prices.

 Spending Review 2004 made available over &#163;1 billion of new Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) resources for the period 2006&#150;08 (&#163;525 million for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;525 million for 2007&#150;08). No decision has yet been made on how these new resources will be allocated. The Government want to ensure that we get the most impact from these very substantial funds. We are therefore carefully considering the opinions expressed in the recent consultation exercise to make sure we take full account of the views of key stakeholders involved in delivering neighbourhood renewal at the local level. An announcement on the allocation of these new NRF resources will be made when we have completed our consideration.

<p><a name="50318w07.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the Animal By-Product Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 require slaughterhouse waste to be handled in an enclosed space.  [221871]</p>




<p><a name="50318w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Animal By-Products Regulation requires that all intermediate plants have a covered space to receive animal by-products. We consider that in general this will also mean that all handling of by-products must be done in that covered space. The Regulation also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds. In our view, the combination of these requirements is such that it would be necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w07.html_para1">
Slaughterhouse waste may contain high-risk material such as Specified Risk Material (SRM). It will usually have a high liquid content, and contain loose fragments of material, thereby increasing the risk of leakage or spillage during handling and the risk of spread by vermin such as rodents or birds. Such waste must therefore be handled in an enclosed space to provide adequate safeguards to protect public and animal health.

<p>(2) what tests are carried out in the UK on poultry feathers imported from East Asian countries to establish whether they are infected with avian influenza.  [221390]</p>




<p><a name="50318w07.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Import requirements for feathers are set in European Union legislation. Imports of unprocessed feathers are prohibited from countries that are currently under restriction due an outbreak of Avian Influenza (HPAI).

</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w07.html_para2">
Community legislation allows import of processed feathers. Every consignment of processed feathers from countries under restriction because of Avian Influenza are veterinary checked at the Border Inspection Post on entry to the EU. Imports of processed feathers from these countries must be accompanied by a commercial document stating that the feathers have been cleaned with a steam current and heated to at least 70&#176;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w07.html_para3">
Unprocessed feathers are banned from countries under restrictions due to Avian Influenza. They would be easily detectable by smell or sight as they are highly susceptible to deterioration in transit and would be foul-smelling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w07.html_para4">
Cleaning feathers with a steam current and heated to at least 70&#176; is considered effective in significantly reducing the quantity of virus, if present, to a negligible level. Therefore no further testing is carried out.

<a name="50318w09.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Radioactive Waste</h3>


<p><a name="50318w09.html_wqn5"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans her Department has to review low level radioactive waste management policy.  [222126]</p>




<p><a name="50318w09.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I have agreed with ministerial colleagues within UK Government and the devolved administrations that a review of policy for the long-term management of the UK&#039;s low level radioactive waste (LLW) should be carried out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para8">
LLW is generated by a wide range of activities involving the use of radioactive substances. They include the operation of nuclear reactors, the operation of other nuclear processing facilities, the decommissioning and clean up of nuclear sites, non-nuclear industrial activities, the medical use of radioactive materials, and research and educational activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para9">
While relatively low, the level of radioactivity in LLW can span a very wide range (about five orders of magnitude). Not least because of this, it has been managed in a number of ways in the past: using the national disposal facility at Drigg in Cumbria, using various forms of disposal on the nuclear site on which the waste was generated, using controlled burial to landfill and, for small quantities of very low-level waste, through disposal with other ordinary refuse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para10">
What has now changed is that with many nuclear sites and facilities moving into their decommissioning phase, and with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) being set up to deal with this, it has been increasingly recognised that there will be a very large volume of LLW to be dealt with. Potentially this could fill the Drigg disposal facility a number of times over.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Mar 2005 : Column 496W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para11">
The kinds of issue that are going to have to be addressed in the review are should we use up existing capacity in the Drigg facility&#151;which is a relatively expensive management option&#151;on very low activity wastes (i.e. how do we best use the Drigg facility as a national asset?). Does it make sense to dig up very large quantities of very low activity waste and transport it around the country to bury at some other site? Is controlled burial to landfill off-site appropriate for nuclear waste, or should we be looking to a greater use of on-site burial under suitably controlled and regulated conditions? For whatever approach is identified what is the likely timing of the existing Drigg facility becoming full, and what need for action does this imply?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para12">
The proposed policy review is intended to consider these kinds of issues. The aim is to identify a policy framework, which will update that set out in the 1995 White Paper &quot;Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions&quot; (Cm2919) to cover the future management of LLW, notably by the NDA. The aim of such a policy statement is not to address the detail of the individual LLW management decisions that have to be made, but rather to define the high level framework&#151;requirements and principles&#151;within which such decisions must be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para13">
The initial stages are being overseen by a Steering Group drawn from the Government&#039;s Radioactive Waste Policy Group (RWPG). RWPG is made up of UK Government, devolved administrations and regulatory body representatives and meets regularly, several times a year, to discuss radioactive waste management policy and regulatory issues. The Steering Group is organising two national stakeholder workshops during the course of 2005 to support consideration of the issues and possible solutions. This work will contribute to the preparation and issue of a Government consultation on the revised policy proposals to be issued around the turn of the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para14">
The LLW long-term management policy review will be carried out in parallel with the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), which is assessing options for the long-term management of the UK&#039;s higher activity wastes. In contrast to CoRWM&#039;s work the issue for LLW is not that of identifying the best long-term management option itself, but rather how best to apply those forms of long-term management that already exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w09.html_para15">
Clearly there may be some interdependencies between the LLW management policy review and the work of CoRWM. These will be kept under review and managed by RWPG Committee as the work proceeds.

Such a modification would run counter to our policy of promoting financial inclusion by encouraging people to take advantage of direct debit facilities in bank accounts to pay bills. It would also be incompatible with our aims of achieving a fair and reasonable balance between rights and personal responsibilities, and maintaining the momentum from welfare dependency into work for all those who can.

 Poverty is about more than low income; it is also about other important factors in people&#039;s lives: their health, housing and quality of their environment. The sixth annual &quot;Opportunity for All&quot; report (Cm 6239), published in September 2004, sets out the Government&#039;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.

 In 2002&#150;03, an estimated 65 per cent. of households in the South West had incomes below the national mean on the Before Housing Costs income measure, and 64 per cent. on the After Housing Costs measure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w12.html_para2">
These estimates use the same definition of income used in the Households Below Average Income Series, which is sourced from the Family Resources Survey. It is not possible to provide robust estimates for <i>(b)</i> because of small sample sizes.

Our policies are designed to give people aged over 50 real choice to remain in, or rejoin, the workforce and to decide when and how they retire. In May we will be launching a national guidance campaign to raise employers&#039; awareness of, and ability to adopt, flexible employment and retirement opportunities in order to increase the recruitment, retention and training of older workers.

People on jobseeker&#039;s allowance are eligible for further education provision which includes skills (vocational) learning, as long as they continue to meet the jobseeker&#039;s allowance conditions for being available for work.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans Invest NI have to market Newtownards as a preferred location for future inward investment; and if he will make a statement.  [222072]</p>




<p><a name="50318w13.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 The focus of Invest NIs international sales and marketing effort is to aggressively promote all areas of Northern Ireland, including Newtownards, as an attractive and viable location for new inward investment opportunities, in what is a very competitive global marketplace. In recent years the shift in foreign direct investment flows towards service industries has increasingly witnessed new investment, mainly from the financial services and software sectors, wishing to locate within the larger labour pools available in Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w13.html_para0">
Invest NI&#039;s local offices continue to work closely with key stakeholders to understand and ensure that detailed information on sub-regional sales propositions, including Newtownards, is available to potential investors.

While Invest NI continues to encourage new foreign direct investment to Northern Ireland, it also remains committed to strengthening the international competitiveness of local companies.

 Invest NI and its enterprise partners are working with Ards borough council to develop the local economy within the Newtownards region.

With the continuing movement in global foreign development investment trends from manufacturing to predominantly tradable service-based sectors, potential investors place an increasing emphasis on locations within larger labour pools providing good infrastructure or close proximity to University Centres of Excellence.

Invest NI cannot dictate where companies locate but the interaction and co-operation of local stakeholders are important in promoting opportunities for investors to consider areas such as Ards as a potential location.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities and primary care trusts.<br>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the dental practice board (DPB). An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). Total expenditure on these items by the DPB and the PPA cannot be allocated to individual health bodies, therefore the total expenditure in the answer does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w14.html_para11">
The proportion of drugs expenditure accounted for by the DPB was larger in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, which is why the total expenditure figures for those years appear low compared to 1996&#150;97, 1999&#150;2000, and 2000&#150;01.

<p><a name="50318w16.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what requirements there are for primary care trust funding panels to consult patients before reaching a decision on whether to fund treatments and drugs. [213588]</p>




<p><a name="50318w16.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 There is no formal requirement for primary care trust (PCT) funding panels to consult patients before reaching a decision on whether to fund treatment and drugs. However, in cases where there is no guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and a local decision needs to be taken, such consultation would be considered good practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w16.html_para5">
Where the National Institute of Clinical Excellence has recommended a treatment in a technology appraisal, PCTs normally have to make funding available for this treatment within three months of the appraisal&#039;s publication. NICE consults widely with a range of stakeholders, including patients and patients&#039; organisations, before making a technology appraisal decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w16.html_para6">
In addition, all PCTs have patient and public involvement forums, which exist to monitor and review the services arranged and/or provided by the trust from the perspective of the patient. This includes both the range and operation of services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reasons the decision was taken to site the Alliance Medicals mobile scanner at James Cook Hospital, Middlesbrough rather than at University Hospital, North Durham; and who took the decision. [220843]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Mar 2005 : Column 524W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50318w17.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The James Cook Hospital was the closest available site which had immediate access to a power and water supply in the grounds of the hospital where mobile scanner units are normally sited. The decision to site the scanner at James Cook Hospital was taken by the local radiology manager, in conjunction with Alliance Medical.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50318w17.html_para0">
Alliance Medical is investigating the possibility of locating a mobile scanner unit in the North Durham area, ideally on a primary care site, which has a suitable power and water supply available in the grounds of the site.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will take steps to strengthen processes for <i>(a)</i> planning, <i>(b)</i> decision making and <i>(c)</i> performance management in the commissioning of specialised health services.  [220248]</p>




<p><a name="50318w17.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Primary care trusts are expected to collaboratively commission specialised services through their membership of the eight specialised commissioning groups and 26 local specialised commissioning groups covering England. Strategic health authorities actively support, monitor and performance manage the commissioning arrangements for specialised services in their areas.
