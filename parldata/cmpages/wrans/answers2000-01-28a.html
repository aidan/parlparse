<a name="00128w01.html_wqn0"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will announce the outcome of consultation on the local government finance settlement for 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [107553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Local Government Finance Report (England) 2000-01 and the Special Grant Report (No. 52). These reports establish the amounts of revenue support grant (RSG) and non-domestic rates (NDR) to be paid to local authorities in 2000-01, and the basis of their distribution; and provide for Standing Spending Assessment (SSA) Reduction Grant and Central Support Protection Grant to be paid to certain authorities for 2000-01. Drafts of these reports were issued for consultation on 25 November 1999. The Department received written representations from the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government, as well as from 166 local authorities and local authority groups.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para0">Having considered the views of the local authority associations and others who have commented on my initial proposals, I have decided not to make changes to SSAs, although the SSAs for individual authorities may be slightly different from those at consultation, generally reflecting more accurate data that have become available since then.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para1">Since the autumn, it has become clear that &#163;35 million less than provided will be needed to meet transitional costs of local government reorganisation. I have decided that it would be appropriate to increase grant support to local authorities by &#163;35 million to help fund service improvements at a more modest cost in council taxes.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para2">This year's settlement provides an overall increase of 5.8 per cent. in Government grant on top of the substantial increase of 5.5 per cent. given to local authorities in the first year of the Comprehensive Spending Review. We have provided a 5.4 per cent. increase in Education Standard Spending Assessments. We have made it clear that education is the Government's top priority, and we expect councils to pass on this increase to schools, in the expectation that the great majority of schools should receive an increase per pupil at least in line with inflation. In the last three years this Government have increased grant to local authorities by &#163;6 billion--a real terms increase of 7.8 per cent in contrast to the previous three years of a real cut in grant of 4.3 per cent.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2000 : Column: 356W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para3">It is a settlement which has been generally welcomed by local authorities. We had already provided them with greater predictability by announcing three spending totals in the Comprehensive Spending Review, which sets out further increases in the pipeline for the 2001-02 settlement. We had also given them more responsibility for their spending decisions, by abolishing crude and universal capping.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para4">The settlement ensures that no authority will lose grant next year and local authorities with education and social service responsibilities will receive grant increases of at least 1.5 per cent. It will allow councils to concentrate on their priorities and make the improvements which people wish to see to education and social services. But it also allows them to improve services while continuing the momentum of lower council tax increases.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para5">We hope local authorities will look very carefully at the implications for council tax payers when setting budgets in the coming months.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para6">Local authorities will wish to know that I have received representations from local government on council tax benefit subsidy limitation. I have considered these carefully but decided to make no change to the scheme I proposed on 25 November.
<P>

<a name="00128w01.html_para7">I shall be sending copies of these reports and the Plain English guide to all authorities, together with tables showing each authority's Standard Spending Assessment and its entitlement to RSG, NDR and special grant. I have placed copies of the reports in the Journal Office; and copies of the reports, tables and the guide in the Library.

<a name="00128w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the proportion the population in the United Kingdom which has had access to free concessionary bus transport in each year since 1990.  [106820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The information available to my Department indicates that almost 2.1 million pensioners in the United Kingdom benefit from local authority schemes for free concessionary bus travel--that represents 3.55 per cent. of the UK population. I regret that information is not available for other groups who receive free concessionary bus travel (such as people with disabilities).

<a name="00128w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the local authorities which provide free transport on buses to persons of pensionable age.  [106821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A survey carried out by my department showed that in 1995-96 the following authorities had free travel schemes for pensioners (with age group restrictions and cost of bus pass as indicated):

<a name="00128w02.html_para0">The number of additional incinerators required in order to deal with municipal waste in the future is a matter for local authorities, who should make their decisions on the basis of the waste hierarchy and the Best Practical Environmental Option as proposed in the Government's Draft Waste Strategy. That focuses on the need to increase recycling and reuse substantially. The number of incinerators that might eventually be required will depend on the success of the Strategy in minimising the waste collected from householders.

<P>
<a name="00128w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency in Wales is unhypothecated, and it is a matter for the Environment Agency to determine its own priorities for expenditure within the context of such high level objectives as the sponsoring body may set. Over the last two years, no grant-in-aid has been provided to the Environment Agency in Wales specifically to fund emergency works arising from leaks from underground fuel tanks. However, a small sum from general grant-in-aid has been spent on investigation and advice, and in responding to major incidents including those at Bontddu and Llanrwst.
<P>

<a name="00128w02.html_para1">Prior to 1 April 1999, grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency was paid on an England and Wales basis by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what has been the impact on the National Assembly for Wales during the financial year 2000-01 arising from the designation of West Wales and the Valleys as an Objective 1 area.  [107225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 It is too early to know the impact of Objective 1 on the National Assembly for Wales for the forthcoming financial years 2000-01. The figures set out by the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Partnership on the Objective 1 financial tables relate to expected commitments of funding over the full life of projects. The actual rate of expenditure will depend on the spending profiles of projects submitted and approved, which are not yet known.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with the European Commission over the eligibility of private or voluntary sector finance to contribute to the member state's match-funding for European Objective 1 projects; and if he will make a statement.  [107228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I have had no such discussions. The European Structural Funds Regulations, which apply to all EU member states, set no requirements for sources of match funding, which is the responsibility of the grant applicant. It is the eligibility of the activities of each specific project which needs to be assessed against the priorities in the Objective 1 programming document. Match funding from the private and voluntary sectors has been used in previous Structural Funds programmes across the UK and there is no reason why this should not continue for the new Objective 1 programme.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 17 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 356W, what assumptions he made about the level of VAT evasion which would occur with a 5 per cent. rate on house repair and refurbishment relative to the current rate.  [107110]<P>

 The effect on the level of VAT evasion of levying a 5 per cent. rate of VAT both on house refurbishment and repair and on construction on previously undeveloped land is uncertain. My answer of 17 January therefore made no allowance for any such effect.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many additional police officers he will agree can be added to his Department's authorised number employed by the Essex Police Authority as a result of the transfer on 1 April to the Essex Police Authority of that part of Essex currently policed by the Metropolitan Police.

 Each police force in England and Wales has a "notional establishment" of police officers for the purposes of allocating 10 per cent. of the police grant (most of the grant is allocated according to a needs-based funding formula). For the purposes of allocating the police grant in 2000-01, the notional establishment of Essex police was increased by 137 to take account of the enlargement of the Essex police area as a result of the change to the boundary of the Metropolitan police district on April 2000.

 The impact of employment practices on all aspects of a firm's performance is of key interest to my Department. The Workplace Employee Relations Survey, published last September <sup>1</sup> , clearly shows that workplace outcomes and performance appear to be influenced by the way employees are managed. Workplaces with modern employment practices (which included problem-solving groups) were associated with improved performance, less resignations, less dismissals and better management- employee relations.
<P>

<a name="00128w04.html_para5">DTI analysis of data from the Community Innovation Survey and some results form survey work on SME innovation by the Centre for Business Research in Cambridge <sup>2</sup>  has provided evidence on the connections between labour market practices, business human resource management and innovation. Innovative companies use flexible labour market practices but are relatively more intensively engaged in staff development and active human resource management. Training linked to technological change goes with higher levels of innovativeness, reinforcing the message that developing staff capabilities tends to be conducive to innovation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> short and <i>(b)</i> long-term contributions that photovoltaics could make in reducing carbon emissions in the UK.  [106792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00128w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 For the short term, photovoltaics (PV) is a relatively expensive technology, and the cost is unlikely to decrease sufficiently for it to make more than a small contribution to carbon emission reductions in the UK over the next decade. In the longer term, however, PV has the potential to make a significant contribution to carbon savings. The DTI has been supporting a programme of research, development and demonstration of the technology in the UK for several years and, together with support from the European Union, a number of major examples of building integrated PV are now operating, such as Northumbria University, Ford Engine Factory, and Doxford Solar Offices.
<P>

<a name="00128w05.html_para1">The annual generating capacity of PV installed in the UK at the moment is around 0.5 gigawatt hours (GWh). A study conducted for my Department in 1998 suggested that, for five key applications, new and refurbished offices, superstores, new housing and prestige public buildings, the maximum potential, disregarding cost, would be around 7 terrawatt hours (TWh) a year in 2010, around 2 per cent. of current electricity consumption. Investment costs were estimated at around &#163;30 billion. The likely market potential for these applications without substantial levels of subsidy, but assuming significant cost and performance improvements and significant levels of carbon and pollution taxes, was estimated at less than 0.2 TWh/yr by 2010. Clearly, all such estimates can only give a broad indication of potential and the figures quoted are not comprehensive, excluding retrofit installation of PV on domestic roofs for example, where costs are currently high but the theoretical potential is large. Nevertheless, I believe that they give a reasonable indication of the possible scale of contribution in the short to medium term.
<P>

<a name="00128w05.html_para2">This compares with a theoretical estimate of around 270 TWh/yr available in 2025 from installing PV on all available walls and roofs for the entire building stock. More realistically, if PV were to be installed on all south-facing roofs and facades this would yield an annual output of around 70 TWh, or a little over 22 per cent. of current electricity consumption, which stands at around 324 TWh/yr. Alternatively, if 50 square miles (about 0.1 per cent. of the UK's total land area) were covered 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2000 : Column: 371W</I><P>
with PV panels, this would have the technical potential to generate about 15 TWh of electricity (about 5 per cent. of current consumption). The extent and rate at which this longer term potential is exploited will depend on a number of factors, principally on the rate at which costs are reduced, itself the subject of much debate.

 The new National Care Standards Commission will regulate care services and private healthcare. The Commission will ensure that services meet the finalised minimum standards. The proposals in "Fit for the Future?" are aimed at promoting better quality care and helping to prevent abuse by grounding practice on the principles of dignity, choice, privacy and respect.
<P>

<a name="00128w06.html_para0">The Department did not carry out research into the impact of each of the standards proposed. However, Laing and Buisson were commissioned to work on a cost-benefit analysis of the standards to ascertain the likely burden on providers nationally. Additional information was gathered from Heads of Inspection regarding the current standard of provision. Information from these studies was published in "Fit for the Future?" along with a regulatory impact appraisal.

<a name="00128w06.html_para2">The Department has not conducted any specific research into the impact on the National Health Service of the proposals concerning ratios of qualified nurses to other staff in nursing homes. However, we are funding a major study by Kings College, University of London, tracking the careers of 3,000 new entrants to nursing. Although not the focus of the research, this will help assess the demand for nurses, including from the private sector. We are also actively considering models for assessment of nursing needs which would allow levels of qualified nurses to relate more flexibility to assessed needs.

 Residential care homes are currently required to give reasonable notice to residents of any intention to terminate arrangements for accommodating them. Nursing homes are not currently under the same statutory obligation. This will be remedied in the new arrangements for regulating care, through the regulations and national standards we are introducing.
<P>

<a name="00128w06.html_para3">None the less we regard it as good practice that any decision to close a home or part of a home is handled as sensitively and appropriately as possible. When a home does have to close or beds are redesignated, the essential thing is that there should be proper arrangements made for the safe and satisfactory transfer of all residents to other suitable homes. Adequate time should be allowed for this to be done and in a way that allows both residents and their relatives a choice in where they are to move to, and which creates the minimum possible discomfort to all concerned.

As a result of this process and a final best bid stage, Peel Holdings plc was selected as the preferred purchaser. The site was sold to them in June 1999.

Because the VLA has provided training in the diagnosis of BSE for veterinary pathologists in many countries, requests for the examination of bovine samples of BSE have been confirmed at most to the initial few cases experienced in the country, with subsequent diagnosis being conducted by the countries own veterinary pathologists. Also, consultations on such material from other countries will not have been restricted to bovine samples sent to the VLA since opinions will have been sought from VLA veterinary pathologists and scientists whilst visiting other countries.</FONT></UL>
