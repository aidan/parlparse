<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has made to the US Government concerning proposals to increase subsidies to US farmers; and if she will make a statement.  [56622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2002]:</i> I have taken several opportunities, most recently during my visit to Washington in April this year, to express my concern at the increase in subsidies for which the new US Farm Bill provides. I have made clear that the Bill runs counter to our shared goal of reducing worldwide subsidies in the World Trade Organisation.

<a name="20520w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to ensure the continuation of the six and 12 mile fishing limits after 31 December.  [55485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> A decision on the six and 12 mile limits is part of the forthcoming CFP review. Previous discussions in the Council of Ministers have revealed a very strong consensus among member states in favour of renewing the present provisions; the Commission is also known to support them. My Department will be making every effort to get the limits made permanent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of household waste in the last 12 months, comprised plastic bags.  [55484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> My Department has no data on the proportion by volume of plastic bags within household waste. "Waste Strategy 2000" (Part 2, p191) shows estimates of around 6 per cent. dense plastic and 5 per cent. film plastic by weight in household waste. A further national survey to update these figures is planned by the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para0">The Municipal Waste Management Survey shows that recycling of household waste plastics increased to 13,000 tonnes in 1999&#150;2000, compared to 8,000 tonnes for the previous year.

<a name="20520w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many letters from hon. Members are awaiting a response from her Department; and how many responses are due to 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 2W</I><P>
letters dated more than <i>(a)</i> two weeks, <i>(b)</i> one month, <i>(c)</i> two months, <i>(d)</i> three months and <i>(e)</i> more than three months ago.  [42963]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her most recent estimate is of how many letters have yet to be sent a substantive response by her Department that were received <i>(a)</i> under four weeks ago, <i>(b)</i> between four to six weeks ago, <i>(c)</i> between six weeks and two months ago and <i>(d)</i> over two months ago; and if she will make a statement.  [51474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 13 March and 22 April 2002]:</i> The total number of letters from hon. and right hon. Members awaiting a response as at 15 May 2002 stood at 2,125. Of these, 1,699 responses are due to letters dated more than two calendar weeks, 1,295 to letters dated more than one calendar month, 886 to letters dated more than two calendar months and 612 to letters dated more than three calendar months.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para1">On average, DEFRA receives around 1,160 letters from hon. and right hon. Members each month. The Department's service target is 15 working days from date of receipt. Performance was severely affected last year by the impact of foot and mouth disease, and by IT and other convergence issues following the creation of DEFRA. However, the median response time for all letters is now 15 working days, with 53 per cent. of letters meeting the target. Measures are in place to secure further improvements in the weeks ahead.

<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what practical difficulties have been encountered by her Department's officials in administering boluses to Shetland sheep during testing for scrapie; and if she will make a statement.  [56040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> A total of 1,315 Shetland sheep have been electronically tagged using a ruminal bolus as part of the genotype testing programme under the National Scrapie Plan. Occasional difficulties have arisen in administering these boluses, and five casualties have arisen in three separate flocks of Shetland sheep. Full compensation is paid to the flock owner for any casualty arising as a result of this procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with the Department for International Development regarding the procurement of sustainable timber for Government premises; and if she will make a statement.  [56043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> My Department works closely with the Department for International Development on all matters of common interest to do with forest management and illegal logging including the Government's efforts to purchase its timber and timber products from sustainable sources. Officials from both Departments are members of the Whitehall Forestry Group that addresses international issues and of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Timber 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 3W</I><P>
Procurement that is monitoring implementation of the timber procurement policy. These same officials are part of the steering group that has commissioned research into the Government's timber purchasing activities and will help supervise the action to be taken following publication of the consultant's report later this summer.

<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what consultation has been undertaken, and with whom, over the content of Statutory Instrument 843 on TSEs.  [56039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> My Department consulted more than 700 key stakeholders on draft proposals for the TSE (England) Regulations 2002, representing renderers, slaughterhouses, farmers, knackers, hunt kennels, veterinary, consumer and medical interests and enforcement authorities. That is, the people who are actually affected or need to know. The consultation package was distributed in February 2002. It was posted on the Department's website and a copy placed in the Library of the House. It included a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Parallel legislation is being introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with additional and broadly equivalent consultation there.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para2">These Regulations implement current Community legislation on TSEs as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001. My Department twice consulted on the Community measures, giving fair warning of likely new arrangements. First, in January 1999 and again in November 2000. Community measures in relation to animal feeding were implemented under the Processed Animal Protein (England) Regulations 2001, introduced last August; there was a separate consultation exercise specifically for this legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department had made of the viability of non-ozone depleting drop-in refrigerants.  [48075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> I am aware that in certain applications there are drop-in replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. One example is in mobile air-conditioning where HFC-134a is a drop-in replacement for CFC-12, although it should be noted that HFC-134a is also a powerful greenhouse gas with a 100-year Global Warming Potential 1,300 times the warming potential of Carbon Dioxide. There are, however, many other applications where a drop-in replacement is not feasible and the only alternative would either involve costly technical alternations to the refrigeration equipment or replacement of the equipment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> plans to take to strengthen the implementation of (i) the Rio Declaration, (ii) Agenda 21 and (iii) other commitments made at (A) Rio in 1992 and (B) the United Nations General Assembly Special Section in 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 On question <i>(a),</i> the UK's sustainable development strategy, "A Better Quality of Life" (1999), sets out the many steps that DEFRA and its predecessors have taken to implement the various Rio agreements and the outcome of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in 1997. The Department has led the world on the elaboration of sustainable development indicators to assess progress. The Government's first annual review of progress towards sustainable development, "Achieving a Better Quality of Life", was published in January 2001. This is available at www.sustainable-development.gov.uk. We have ratified the conventions on Biodiversity, Climate Change and Desertification, which were products of the Rio process, and we have made particular efforts in the promotion of Local Agenda 21.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para3">Our future plans, <i>(b)</i>, include the publication of a DEFRA sustainable development strategy and implementation of the recently published fuel poverty strategy and waste strategy. We are also implementing the outcomes on fisheries quotas from the December 2001 Fisheries Council, and the recommendations of the Independent Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. DEFRA's formation itself underlines the Government's commitment to delivering a more sustainable development focused agenda on food, farming and rural communities. "Working for the Essentials of Life", published in March, sets out DEFRA's plans for the future.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_wqn10"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her Department's priorities are for the Rio+10 Summit in Johannesburg towards the objectives of <i>(a)</i> poverty eradication and <i>(b)</i> sustainable production and consumption for the UK; and what the priorities of the European Group are.  [44426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Poverty eradication through sustainable development will be a top priority for the UK at the summit. We are keen to ensure that WSSD outcomes should assist progress towards achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs). Actions on poverty and effective management of natural resources are often mutually reinforcing.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para4">De-coupling economic growth from environmental degradation will be central to achieving sustainable production and consumption patterns in both the north and the south, though developed countries have to take the lead. Resource productivity is a concept which underpins actions in particular sectors, such as switching from heavily polluting fossil fuels to cleaner fossil fuels and other low carbon fuel sources, changing demand patterns in favour of environmentally sustainable products and production processes by, for example, raising consumer awareness and promoting certification initiatives and supporting innovation to develop more sustainable technologies.
<P>

<a name="20520w01.html_para5">The priorities of the European Union are currently under discussion and will develop as the agenda becomes more firm.

on the Pollution Inspectorate, what the qualifications are to which she refers; which consultants were commissioned in 2000, what the process was through which any contract was awarded, the month in which this took place, and the terms of reference of this work; if she will place in the Library a copy of their report, and other documentation relating to this work; if she will describe the process by which the contract for carrying out a trial methodology was undertaken; which local authorities, process operators and trade associations were involved in the trial; to whom it is planned to issue the trial report for comments; and how these comments will be utilised.  [44427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have placed in the Library a copy of the 1995 guidance note on inspection frequency, which advised on circumstances where the specified normal inspection rate of twice a year might warrant increase or decrease.
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para0">The consultants, Risk and Policy Analysts, were commissioned in June 2000 as a result of competitive tendering. The terms of reference for the study and the trials it reproduced as Annexe 5 to their October 2000 report which is available on the DEFRA website.
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para1">The report was sent to the Department on 26 March and I expect to decide the next steps shortly. As I said in my reply of 25 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 720W, the report has been placed on the DEFRA website as part of a three-month consultation exercise.
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para2">The trials methodology, including the method of selecting the processes involved and the industry sectors represented, is described in the report. I am grateful to all participants for their contribution to the trials. The list of participating operators could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The local authorities involved in the trials were City of York council, Fylde borough council, Wandsworth borough council, Rochdale metropolitan borough council, mid-Devon district council, Exeter city council, south Tyneside metropolitan borough council, Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council, Mansfield district council, Anglesey county council, Guildford borough council, Rochford district council, and Great Yarmouth port health authority. The two trade associations which submitted comments to the consultants were UK Steel and the Environmental Industries Association.

<P>
<a name="20520w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her Department's policy with regard to bonfires, with specific reference to <i>(a)</i> the impact upon climate change and <i>(b)</i> nuisance to neighbours; what discussions she has had recently with (i) the Local Government Association and (ii) individual local authorities on the subject of bonfires; and what recent research her Department has undertaken into the impact of bonfires.  [57108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2002]:</i> Government policy regard to bonfires is:
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> The Government does not consider bonfires to be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> Garden bonfires are a traditional way of disposing of household and garden rubbish but they can be a nuisance to neighbours and cause air pollution.




<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 6W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para5">Local authorities have powers under section 79 of the Environment Protection Act 1990 to stop people creating smoke that amounts to a statutory nuisance. Where an Environmental Health Officer considers a bonfire to be causing a statutory nuisance then he or she must issue an abatement notice against the person responsible or in certain circumstances, the owner or occupier of the property. This notice can require that the activity causing the nuisance stops completely or may restrict it to between certain hours, or can require that remedial action be taken.
<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para6"><i>(b)</i> (i) My Department has not had recent discussions with the Local Government Association or individual Local Authorities on this particular issue;

[56126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The &#163;37 million for the Market Towns Initiative is provided by DEFRA, with &#163;5 million going to the Countryside Agency and &#163;32 million going (via DTI) to the regional development agencies. It is for the agencies to manage the programme. While not having day to day involvement DEFRA takes a close interest in progress and I have discussed implementation with RDA chairs and with the Countryside Agency.

<P>

<a name="20520w02.html_para10">MG Rover addressed the issue of historic vehicle parc liabilities in both a reply to the DTI's consultation document and in evidence given to the Trade and Industry Committee inquiry into the ELV Directive. In these documents, MG Rover asked that legislation should not place it at a competitive disadvantage as a result of a legacy parc of brands owned or produced by its predecessors, and suggested that any financial contributions made by vehicle manufacturers should be based on current market share rather than on the number of a company's vehicles being scrapped. MG Rover has had the opportunity to expand upon these points at a number of subsequent meetings.

It made clear our determination to accord special consideration to members of the armed forces under the age of 18, but also our understanding that the Protocol would not exclude members of our armed forces aged under 18 from taking a direct part in hostilities in certain narrowly defined circumstances (thereby maintaining operational effectiveness). The declaration defined these circumstances as being

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many UK military personnel he estimates were exposed to dangerous and harmful gases resulting from destroyed Iraqi chemical factories in the Gulf War; and what changes there have been in this number in the last three years.  [54580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any United Kingdom military personnel having being exposed to dangerous and harmful gases resulting from destroyed Iraqi chemical factories during the Gulf conflict. However, on 10 March 1991, US forces demolished Iraqi rockets containing chemical warfare agents near the Khamisiyah Ammunition Depot, Iraq. The MOD's initial assessment of the implications for UK personnel of the demolitions was published in December 1999 in a paper entitled: "Review of Events Concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising from US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot in March 1991". The paper is available in the Library of the House and on the internet at http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm. The paper's main conclusion was that up to 9,000 UK troops might theoretically have been exposed to nerve agent following the demolitions but that the level of exposure would have no detectable effect on human health.
<P>

<a name="20520w03.html_para4">On 25 April 2002, the US released a technical report about the Khamisiyah demolitions based on a revised theoretical model of the plume of nerve agent which may have been released by the demolitions. On 3 May 2002, the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced that the death rate for US personnel who were near Khamisiyah is similar to that for other US Gulf veterans. The US report 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 10W</I><P>
is currently being analysed by MOD officials and the implications for UK personnel will be made public when available but at this stage there is no evidence to link the Khamisiyah demolitions with the range of symptoms of ill health being experienced by some Gulf veterans.

The definition of interests is ultimately for individual Departments since they are best placed to decide what might be thought to influence members of their bodies.

<i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> The latest published data are in the Cabinet Office annual report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the civil service" for the year 2000 which shows the average number of working days lost per staff year among non-industrial staff. The figure for Ministry of Defence is 8.8 days. MOD's own records show that during 2000 4.1 per cent. of days lost were due to mental disorders (stress-related) and 6.6 per cent. were due to mental disorders (non-stress related). The overall cost of sick absence was some &#163;22 million. These figures exclude MOD Trading Funds. MOD is committed to improving the health and well being of its civilian staff and has programmes in hand to reduce the number of working days lost through sick absence and work-related injury and illness.

 Records are not maintained by my Department which enable ill health retirements to be separately identified as work related. However, for the year 2001&#150;02, we had three members of staff who retired with a medical retirement certificate issued by the civil service pension scheme medical adviser. Benefits provided on medical retirement are as set out in the rules of the principal civil service pension scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of an enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure met from the Vote was &#163;310 million in respect of all civil service cases for which an ill health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formerly been ill health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.

 The European Commission (EC) began assessing damage and destruction to EU-funded development projects since the beginning of the Intifada in March 2002. A detailed list was produced, and a copy has been placed in the House of Commons Library. The EC is keen to update this initial assessment. This has not been possible since the Israeli re-occupation of the west bank, due to restricted access and the levels of violence.

 In October 2001 DFID provided &#163;35 million budget support to Tanzania.

 In Kenya, the country worst hit by the recent heavy rains in east Africa, mudslides have killed at least 53 people, and up to 150,000 people have been temporarily displaced by floods. Information from the Kenyan National Disaster Operations Centre suggests that, while the impact in some areas is serious, Government agencies and civil society organisations are coping and are delivering appropriate assistance to those affected. DFID staff are closely monitoring the situation in Kenya and elsewhere in the region.

<a name="20520w05.html_para1">There are major difficulties faced by least-developed countries (LDCs) when attempting to accede to the WTO. The WTO Secretariat, UNCTAD and several donor countries are working to address the issue, but since the inception of the WTO no LDCs have acceded to the organisation. This was recognised in the WTO ministerial declaration at Doha in November 2001 which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Accession of LDCs remains a priority for the Membership. We agree to work to facilitate and accelerate negotiations with acceding LDCs. We instruct the Secretariat to reflect the priority we attach to LDCs' accessions in the annual plans for technical assistance."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20520w05.html_para2">The WTO is working to help LDC accession candidates by streamlining the existing process in a number of ways. The aim is to have as few working party meetings as possible, to have clear agendas and work plans on exit, and to move as soon as possible towards the first version of the working party's draft report. However, the WTO would also like to see more action from WTO members, and is encouraging them to be more flexible and realistic in their market access negotiations with LDCs.
<P>

<a name="20520w05.html_para3">DFID is at the forefront of work on WTO accession, and since 1999 we have been providing assistance (&#163;400,000) to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to support developing and least developed countries accede to the WTO on terms consistent with their respective development needs.

This process helped the three countries to identify and prioritise trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) requirements from infrastructure to human resources within a coherent policy framework.

<P>

<P>
<a name="20520w06.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) has established an independent commission to investigate reports of ethnically motivated violence. Following a visit to northern Afghanistan in February 2002, the commission made a number of recommendations for improving security in the area, which are currently being considered by the AIA. These include the creation of a collaborative mechanism for addressing complaints, made up of representatives of all ethnic groups in the north, including Pashtuns.
<P>

<a name="20520w06.html_para2">The UK is working with the Afghan Interim Administration, other donors and international agencies to strengthen the ability of the Afghan authorities to enforce the rule of law. An Afghan-led, internationally supported security sector reform programme is crucial to ensuring the capacity of the Afghan state both to deter further human rights abuses and to bring those responsible for human rights abuses to justice.

Women have begun to return to work and girls are going back to school. But it is a slow process and more needs to be done. The UK is working closely with the AIA and the rest of the international community, to ensuring women's full and effective participation in civil, cultural, economic, political and social life throughout Afghanistan.

 There have been a number of recent reports of abuses against Pashtuns, particularly in northern Afghanistan. These abuses include beatings, extortion, looting and sexual violence. Pashtuns are believed to have been targeted because of associations between their ethnic group and the Taliban regime.
<P>

<a name="20520w06.html_para3">In February 2002, the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) authorised a high-level independent commission to investigate reports of ethnically motivated violence in Afghanistan. A three person team from the commission visited northern Afghanistan to meet with local people and commanders to investigate reports of abuses against Pashtuns. Based on their findings, the commission made a series of recommendations which the AIA are now considering. Human Rights Watch has also investigated reports of abuses against Pashtuns. Their report&#151;which can be found on their website (http//www.hrw.org)&#151;is the result of interviews and discussions with local people in Balkh, Faryab, Samangan and Baghlan provinces, representatives of the AIA and humanitarian workers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w06.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In January 2002, the United Nations estimated that there were approximately 1.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Afghanistan. Since then, approximately 160,000 IDPs have returned to their homes with assistance from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). A further 400,000 IDPs are estimated to have returned home spontaneously, without international assistance.
<P>

<a name="20520w06.html_para4">IDPs, as victims of conflict and the ongoing effects of the drought, are among the most vulnerable people in Afghanistan, and are targeted by UN agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for the urgent provision of humanitarian assistance. It is a priority in 2002 for the Afghan Interim Administration and the international community to ensure reintegration of uprooted Afghans who wish to return home. Programmes coordinated by UNHCR and IOM are under way to physically transport returnees back to their places of origin, build the capacity of communities to absorb returning families, and integrate short-term programmes with longer-term strategies to ensure sustainable reintegration of returnees. Since September 2001, my Department has contributed &#163;3 million to UNHCR and &#163;3.6 million to IOM for their programmes in the region.

 Claims for work-related injury or illness are matters between individuals and their employers. Teachers and other staff in schools are employed by either the Local Education Authority or the School Governing Body, and consequently such matters are dealt with at a local level. No data are held centrally by the Department about either the number of claims or the cost of compensation payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Entitlement to ill health retirement under the Teachers' Pensions Scheme (TPS) is determined by the severity of a teacher's medical condition. Where the medical evidence demonstrates that the teacher is permanently unfit to teach, irrespective of the cause of the medical condition, retirement benefits become due. Information is not held on whether the medical condition giving rise to ill health retirement is attributable, in whole or in part, to a work-related injury or illness.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2002]:</i> None. Funding of further education (FE) provision is the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). Funding for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities in mainstream FE provision consists of two elements: funding for the basic costs of the course, as for other students; and additional learning support tailored to meet the costs of activities to meet the individual's needs.
<P>

<a name="20520w08.html_para2">The LSC is introducing limited changes to its funding for basic course costs for 2002&#150;03 which include greater emphasis on rewarding retention and achievement. While broadly cost neutral the changes are designed to reward those institutions that raise participation and achievement rates. I believe it is right that funding for retention and achievement for students with special needs in mainstream FE colleges should be on the same basis as for other students. The LSC have safety netting arrangements in place to help those institutions that may see a drop in income solely due to funding methodology changes.
<P>

<a name="20520w08.html_para3">Additional learning support funding arrangements for the 2002&#150;03 academic year remain unchanged from earlier years. However, the LSC is currently consulting on its proposals to revise the present methodology for funding additional learner needs in post-16 education and training. These new arrangements are intended to ensure a coherent approach, based on common principles, to the funding of special needs regardless of age, mode of study or type of programme.

 The committee on the second general system for the recognition of professional education and training assists the European Commission to consider requests made by member states to revise information relating to Annexes C and D of Directive 92/51/EEC. There has been just one meeting of the committee in the last five years&#151;in November 2001. Travel expenses were met from Commission resources. The subsistence cost incurred by this Department was &#163;114. Amendments to Annex C of Directive 92/51/EEC currently under consideration of the committee are:

The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February (Commission Document 5685&#150;02). As part of the review process, the UK Government have encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.

 The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) funds the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which then allocates research funding to higher education institutions in England. The following table outlines the allocations made by HEFCE using research criteria per year since 1997. The table includes DfES spending via the Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) and the Science Research Investment Fund (SRIF). Over and above this, the Government and the Welcome Trust have made available &#163;750 million via the JIF and &#163;900 million via the SRIF for capital investment in higher education research infrastructure in science and technology. Furthermore Research Council funding for research and development will rise from &#163;1,279 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;1,793 million in 2002&#150;03 of which a significant proportion goes to higher education institutions as research grants.

 As part of the Government's commitment to combating poverty and providing security and independence for people aged 60 or over, new measures have been introduced to automatically identify pensioners who might be entitled to Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and encourage them to claim. These measures build on the successful Take Up campaign which ran from May to November 2000, and contacted 2.4 million potential MIG customers. It generated approximately 1 million responses. Further mail shots in March 2001 coincided with the increase in capital limits from &#163;8,000 to &#163;12,000.

<a name="20520w11.html_para9">Further (Key Life Event) MIG triggers have been introduced. Departmental data matching techniques are now being used to identify other new and existing pensioners with potential entitlement to MIG. These triggers identify customers who have a match with one or more predetermined 'key life events', which may indicate a potential entitlement to MIG, for example, when customers aged 60 and over receive a new award of one or more benefits, such as attendance allowance, industrial injuries benefit or housing benefit. A mailshot comprising a letter explaining the possible entitlement and inviting customers to claim along with a MIG1L leaflet is sent to all customers identified in this way.

<a name="20520w12.html_para4">The estimates of the proportions for 1998 were made by using data from the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) and DWP data on state spending on pensioners and Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates of the size of private pensions in payment.

These were uprated by PENSIM estimates of the growth in private pensions in payment until 2025 and then by estimates of GDP growth thereafter.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> There are a number of studies that seek to compare pensioners' incomes. These include the Pensioners' Income Series (1999&#150;2000) which is produced by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Cabinet Office's Individual Income (1996&#150;97 to 1999&#150;2000).

 In the period from April 2001 to 18 March 2002, the agency made 58 applications to the court for committal/withdrawal of a driving licence.

In a further 22 cases the magistrates imposed a suspended committal sentence. The rest of the cases are still with the courts, with three non-resident parents the subject of tracing action by the agency.

 Most people who are entitled to a winter fuel payment receive their payments automatically. However, others have to make a claim. From winter 2000&#150;01, the claim details recorded are used to make further payments automatically, unless the individual's circumstances change. This procedure ensures that people do not have to provide their details more than once.

I am satisfied that stringent security measures apply at all civil nuclear sites in respect of both the sites and the materials held within the sites.

 Israel's stated military objective was to root out terrorists. But neither side can achieve lasting security through force. Actions by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have contributed to the crisis. Israel must withdraw from Palestinian controlled areas and act in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions including SCR 1402 and international humanitarian law. The Palestinian Authority must do everything in its power to stop the violence against Israelis.

 The current Lottery Funding Agreement requires Wembley National Stadium Ltd. (WNSL) to make available 75,000 seats to the general public. Any change to that agreement to reflect the current project is a matter for Sport England, the FA and WNSL.
<P>

<a name="20520w21.html_para0">I understand that following the publication of the English National Stadium Review's interim report on 19 December 2001 [HC 479], WNSL asked Sport England to consider the need to change the balance between general public and premium seats in order to support efforts to secure financing for the project. The request was supported by a revised business plan and by thorough market research carried out by WNSL. The Council of Sport England has considered the revised business plan presented by WNSL and following discussions with WNSL has agreed to reduce the number of general public seats which WNSL must make available to 71,200. This 71,200 figure compares with approximately 73,000 seats available to the general public at the current stadium.

 The European Commission presented a proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum standards in the reception of applicants for asylum in member states in May of last year. The Directive imposes equivalent standards for accommodation, access to health care, employment and education. Following detailed negotiations a general approach agreement was achieved at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 24&#150;25 April 2002. Political agreement is expected by June 2002. European Union member states are to adopt this and other minimum standards measures on Asylum Procedures, Refugee Qualification and a mechanism for establishing which member state is responsible for an asylum claim by 2004.

 The Better Quality Services (BQS) programme was launched in 1998 and adopted by the Cabinet Office in the Modernising Government White Paper of 1999 as a means of delivering continuous improvements in the quality and effectiveness of Government activities and services. It required all Government Departments to review every activity and service over a five-year period starting in October 1999.
<P>

<a name="20520w25.html_para2">The scheme covered all activities in Departments, agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies, and is similar in remit to the Best Value programme in local government. Reviews of the departmental activities and services under the scheme started in April 2000 and have covered the following areas: Information Technology Systems, National Probation Service Estates, and the Prison Service (Security Group, Prison Shops, Prison Industry and Farms Group, Sentencing Management Group and six prisons).
<P>

<a name="20520w25.html_para3">Within the Department's service delivery agreement, we have a target to review 60 per cent. of its business by March 2003 and to review 100 per cent. by March 2004. We will use BQs and other management tools to conduct the reviews.

<a name="20520w26.html_para4">However, creating new channels for distributing aid would impose unnecessary costs and burdens on developing countries. We therefore believe that any additional aid from the international development trust fund should be distributed in a balanced way through existing bilateral, multilateral and civil society mechanisms used in supporting poverty reduction strategies in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para5">No specific target for ratio of overseas development assistance (ODA) to gross national income (GNI) has been proposed as part of the Global New Deal. However, the UK is committed to the target of raising ODA to 0.7 per cent. of national income, and has increased the budget for the Department for International Development by 45 per cent. in real terms between 1997&#150;98 and 2003&#150;04. Moreover, we have made clear that we will significantly raise the amount of our aid, and raise its share of national income, in our next spending round covering the years up to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para6">There are no plans to propose that ODA from all Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors below 0.4 per cent. of GNI is used to finance an international development trust fund. However, at the meeting of European Finance Ministers on 5 March 2002 the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the European Union (EU) should commit to reach an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.39 per cent. by 2006. At the EU Council Meeting in Barcelona on 15&#150;16 March 2002, just before the United Nations conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, EU members committed to increase their collective ODA to 0.39 per cent. of GNI by 2006 as a step towards the 0.7 per cent. target. Within this, all member states would strive to attain at least 0.33 per cent. by 2006, with other member states above that ratio maintaining or improving their levels of aid.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para7">Clearly the international community will need to debate how any additional aid flows are used to greatest effect in order to help developing countries tackle global poverty and achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To that end the UK has consistently argued that resources should be focused on the poorest countries.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para8">In terms of the prospective accountability of developing countries receiving assistance from such a fund a major step forward has been the establishment of the poverty reduction strategy process. It includes consulting widely with civil society and producing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as a framework for IMF, World bank and other donor support. These PRSP's must be clearly linked to the MDGs and provide a budgetary framework to allocate Government revenue, aid and debt relief so that the impact on poverty reduction is maximised.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para9">The Government believe that any lending conditions must be set so that we never return to a situation where countries build up unsustainable burdens of debt. So the very poorest and most vulnerable countries should receive investment help primarily in the form of grants to partner their soft IDA loans and all other low-income countries should be offered interest-free loans. Assistance to middle-income countries should be given via interest- reduced loans conditional upon implementing agreed poverty reduction strategies and engaging civil society.

<a name="20520w26.html_para10">The extent to which an international development trust fund might have to leverage funds from international financial markets would depend on a wide range of factors, including donor contributions, interest rates, the total amount disbursed and the proportions and terms of any grants and loans within that total. If such a fund were to cease dispensing ODA in 2015 the total volume of ODA would then depend on other bilateral and multilateral ODA flows at that time.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para11">The Government have not proposed a separate Global Health Deal but regards achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals in all developing countries as essential to combating global poverty.
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para12">Following the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit, the United Nations is charged with the task of reporting on progress towards the millennium development goals at the global and country levels, coordinated by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and UNDP, respectively. Reporting is based on two principles:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The use of nationally owned poverty reduction strategies, as reported in poverty reduction strategy papers, United Nations common country assessments and national human development reports, which emphasise a consultative process among the development partners.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20520w26.html_para13">An annual report is to be submitted by the UN that will chart progress, made or not made, in fulfilling the Millennium commitments, and highlight particular themes of special significance for that year. Every five years a comprehensive progress report will be submitted.

The table above has been compiled from the annual reports of the European Court of Auditors and the European Commission's publication, Allocation of 2000 EU Operating Expenditure by Member State. These reports do not attribute all EC spending between members states and do not provide a full picture of net contributions. In particular, the effects of administration spending are understated. Most EC administration spending is disbursed in Belgium and Luxembourg. The figures for these countries must therefore be treated with considerable caution.<P>

 The Treasury was happy to work with the Countryside Agency to produce its Rural Proofing report, and provided relevant information on how the Treasury had considered the rural dimension on new policies, where that did not pre-empt policy in the process of development. The Treasury takes Rural Proofing very seriously and has appointed a full-time secondee from the Countryside Agency to rural proof the 2002 Spending Review. That commitment is well demonstrated in the area of banking, where the "Universal Bank", a project on which the Treasury has been closely involved, is planned to make bank accounts accessible to all at post office counters by April 2003. This will be of particular benefit to those living in rural areas, where post offices are far more numerous thank bank branches: 93.5 per cent. of households in rural England live within 2 km of a post office.

<P>

<a name="20520w28.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 We have no plans to extend the reduction in corporation tax to unincorporated businesses. In appropriate cases the Government have introduced specific incentives which apply to all businesses. But the profits of unincorporated businesses are liable to income tax, as part of the income of their proprietor, rather than to corporation tax, and in general unincorporated businesses and companies are not directly comparable. Companies are distinct legal entities, separate from their owners, and are subject to the obligations laid down in the Companies Act. It is right that there is a system of taxation specific to them.

 The corporation tax payable by a company with profits of &#163;40,000 for an accounting period ending 31 March 2003 would be &#163;7,125 (assuming it is entitled to marginal relief from the small companies' rate but no further reliefs such as double taxation relief).

a broadly accurate measure of the tax due where there would otherwise be particular difficulties in establishing an exact figure.
<P>

<a name="20520w28.html_para5">In the years since 1996, seven such agreements were made in cases concerning individuals, one in each of the years 1996 and 1999, three in 1997 and two in 2000. In three of these cases the agreements were renewal agreements where the original was entered into prior to 1996.

 Where an employee is supplied with free or cheap living accommodation by reason of his or her employment a tax charge can arise under section 145 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA), subject to the exemptions from charge of that section. But for an employee who is sent away from their normal work place to work at a temporary work place for a period not expected to last more than two years, the cost of accommodation at or near the new work place is exempt under the employee travel rules in section 198 ICTA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he intends to publish his response to the recommendations of the panel that conducted the Public Examination of Draft Regional Planning Guidance for the North-West; and if he will make a statement,  [58148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w30.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is today publishing for public consultation proposed changes to the Draft Regional Planning Guidance for the North-West (RPG13). They are based on the recommendations of the independent panel that held a Public Examination into Draft RPG13 in February and March 2001.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para2">Draft RPG was prepared and published by the North-West Regional Assembly (NWRA). Its overall strategy is to establish a broad framework for the preparation of development plans by the North-West's local planning authorities up to 2016. It aims to achieve greater economic competitiveness and growth with associated regional progress; to secure an urban renaissance in the cities and towns of the North-West; to sustain the region's smaller rural and coastal communities; to create an accessible region; to assure the prudent management of the region's environmental and cultural assets; and to secure environmental quality. We support this and, as recommended by the panel, we are proposing changes to ensure that the strategy is more clearly expressed and relates clearly to the policy chapters. It is important that the implications for development plans and other strategies are clear and unambiguous in order to make a real difference on the ground.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para3">A key issue for the region is to bring about the renaissance of the urban areas by encouraging economic growth and regeneration in a sustainable way. To achieve this we are promoting the renewal of the region's urban areas by concentrating resources upon the selective refurbishment, conversion and redevelopment of outworn building stock, and the comprehensive improvement of older and unpopular neighbourhoods. At the same time, we are proposing to include a reduction in the annual rate of provision of totally new housing (unrelated to clearance) by 15 per cent., and increase the proportion of housing provided on previously used (brownfield) land from 65 per cent. to 70 per cent. The proposed changes give added weight to avoiding any premature release of greenfield land which would undermine attempts to promote the use of recycled land and the redevelopment of existing housing areas.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para4">The proposed changes set out projected annual housing provision rates in Table 5.1 and policy on housing provision in Policy UR7. We expect RPG to bring forward an integrated approach to housing renewal at regional and sub-regional level, recognising that the development of sub-regional strategies should look beyond purely housing considerations, and allow for holistic approaches, which include economic, environmental and social elements and mechanisms. We also expect that in developing and 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 114W</I><P>
implementing sub-regional strategies there will also be a need to have respect for local area/neighbourhood diversity.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para5">Tackling low demand and abandonment lies at the heart of the revised strategy. In underlining the importance of these proposed changes I also wish to draw to attention to the pathfinder initiative "Action to Tackle Housing Abandonment" announced by the Secretary of State on 6 April 2002. Pathfinders will be formed in Greater Manchester (Manchester&#151;Salford, Oldham&#151;Rochdale), Merseyside (Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral), East Lancashire (Blackburn, Hyndburn, Burnley and Pendle). The role of the Regional Assembly, the North-West Development Agency and local planning authorities working with housing and other partners is to pursue a fully integrated response to these issues of low demand, high vacancy rates, falling housing numbers and abandonment, wherever they are to be found. We would welcome views on whether the proposed changes provide an adequate planning framework for tackling low demand and on the sub-regional approach to housing renewal set out by Policy UR6. In particular, we welcome views on whether the proposed changes are sufficient to prevent the unnecessary release of greenfield land for housing. Alternatively, we need to consider whether there should be further changes to reflect the recommendation made by the Transport, Local Government and the Regions Committee that no new planning permissions should be granted for greenfield sites.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para6">The panel recommended the merging of the original Core Strategy/Development Principles and Spatial Development Framework chapters. After careful study we have decided that it would be better to keep the two chapters apart but re-draft them. In so doing I believe that we have kept true to the spirit of what the original draft intended but added a Core Development Principle (on economic competitiveness with social progress), and expressed the Spatial Development Framework with greater clarity. I would particularly welcome views on the proposed priority for urban renaissance resources (set out in Policy SD1) as suggested in the panel's report (R5.6a).
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para7">The panel recommended the development of Table 11.1 in Chapter 11 on Monitoring, Implementation and Review. While attempting to set out targets and indicators in the form suggested by the panel there is a need to develop these further and views on this would be particularly welcome. To help progress this in line with the panel's recommendations, there will be a seminar for stakeholders during the consultation period and assistance from the assembly will be invaluable in this matter. As part of that deliberation an action plan will be considered in line with the panel's recommendation (R13.2).
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para8">During the Public Examination it was acknowledged that there is a considerable amount of further work that needs to be done and a range of issues that will require an early review of both RPG and the Regional Transport Strategy by the NWRA. Specifically, guidance will need to take into account the findings of a number of studies including those on Air Service; Multi-Modal Transport Studies; Public Transport Accessibility Profiling; Regional Freight; Regional Park and Ride Sites; Renewable Energy Resources; Transport Demand Management; Regional Park Resources; Regional Waste Facility Requirements; Regional Derelict Land Survey; Assessment of distribution and effectiveness of a variety 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 115W</I><P>
of Waste Minimisation Initiatives across the Region; Review of Urban Potential Studies; and the implications of reviews of PPG 25, MPG6 and the Proposed Policy Guidance on the Extraction of Minerals from the Seabed.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para9">In considering these proposed changes and carrying out future review of RPG13 it is important that account is taken of the principles set out in the Planning Green Paper <sup>1</sup> , in particular the need to make RPG shorter and more strategic; more regionally specific; and more integrated and coordinated with other regional strategies; the increasing importance of introducing sub-regional policies within RPGs will also need to be addressed; and ensuring that the RPG process does not avoid making difficult decisions. Such a review is intended to help develop RPG13 and I am sure that the NWRA will continue to embrace the challenge of helping to implement and develop the Guidance. Consequently, while the proposed changes to the policies in this Draft RPG should be the focus of attention, views are also invited on the changes to the supporting text, including on the extent to which there is any scope for it to be shorter, clearer, and more regionally focused. We intend to revisit this issue following the period of consultation.
<P>

<a name="20520w30.html_para10">There will now be a 13-week consultation period on the proposed changes which will end on Friday 16 August. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the Libraries of the House and provided to all of the region's MPs.

 The number of council dwellings built has been falling for many years. Of the 354 local authorities, only 48 reported completing any council dwellings since April 1997. These are given in the following table. These figures are based on monthly numbers reported by local authorities and have not been adjusted for incomplete returns.

 A decision on whether to include an indicative amount for street lighting in the LTP highway maintenance settlement for 2003&#150;04 has not yet been taken. It would depend upon the total resources available and the progress made in other areas of maintenance. The first targets in the 10 Year Plan for Transport are to stop carriageway deterioration by 2004 and to complete bridge strengthening to carry 40 tonne lorries where necessary.
<P>

<a name="20520w31.html_para3">Provision for street lighting replacement is already made within the Highways Maintenance Standard Spending Assessment for Revenue Support Grant.

 Records are not maintained by DTLR which enable ill health retirements to be separately identified as work-related. The number of staff retired in DTLR (including its executive agencies) with a medical retirement certificate issued by the civil service pension scheme medical adviser in the year 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002 was 56. Benefits provided on medical retirement are as set out in the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme and laid before Parliament. This provides for an immediate payment of an enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote and it is not possible to separate out the cost for cases in this Department.

The "Article 21 Committee" approves technical specifications for interoperability-TSIs&#151;and considers various issues arising from the implementation of interoperability (including the cost-benefit analysis to support the draft TSIs and applications to the Commission for derogations from the TSIs).

 The Developing European Railways Committee was established under the provisions of Directive 2001/12/EC. The Committee is composed of representatives of member states and is chaired by the European Commission. The remit of the Committee is to facilitate the implementation of Directives 2001/12/EC, 2001/13/EC and 2001/14/EC, commonly referred to as the 'Railway Infrastructure Package Directives'. The Committee has met twice in the last 12 months. The UK is represented by officials from my Department and the Office of the Rail Regulator. The annual cost of its work to public funds is about &#163;2,500.

 All advisory and executive non-departmental public bodies are required to adopt a board members' code, based on guidance produced by the Cabinet Office, and they should have registers of interests.

 Findings from research carried out by the Employers' Organisation research indicates that the number of days' sick leave taken by local government employees in England for the year April 2000 until March 2001 was approximately 15.9 million&#151;an average of 9.6 days per employee.

 My Department published research on 12 September 2001 on the impact of provisions relating to the temporary use of land, including for off-road motorcycling. It addressed matters such as impact on local amenity and the environment, for example in terms of litter, noise and relationships with other land uses in the area.
<P>

<a name="20520w34.html_para3">On 24 January 2002 a consultation paper was issued on possible options for change to the current temporary use provisions. The paper put forward six options for change as well as inviting proposals for alternative options. The closing date for responses was 24 April 2002. The views of all those who responded will be considered before any decisions are made on the future composition of the Use Classes Order and the temporary use provisions, including controls on the use of land for off-road motorcycling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w34.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highway Code has, for many years, included advice to drivers not to use a mobile phone while driving. In March 1998, newspaper advertising alerted readers to the dangers of killing or injuring yourself or another road user. Leaflets and posters have been made widely available since then. In January 2000, television advertising reminded of the possible tragic consequences of using a mobile phone. We launched new radio advertising this month to demonstrate the distracting effect of using a mobile phone while driving. A public information film for use by TV stations has also been produced, as have new posters, and further publicity is being prepared. We continue to support local campaigns by police forces and local authorities.

<a name="20520w35.html_para12">The Earnings Survey
<P>

<a name="20520w35.html_para13">The earnings survey is based on payroll data for August of the appropriate year. It covers about half of the NHS trusts in England. It is taken for NHS organisations which use the standard payroll system (SPS), and as such the sample may change from year to year. There is some unevenness in the geographical spread of the organisations included in the survey, but the overall results are broadly representative of all regions and different types of staff. Health authority staff were included for the first time in 2000. Independent contractors (including GPs and their staff) were not included in any of the surveys.
<P>

<a name="20520w35.html_para14">Gross earnings data, i.e. before any deductions, were collected from payroll records. Annual basic salary was read directly from payroll records, and annual equivalent total earnings were calculated using all payments made during August, including e.g. overtime, London weighting, special duty enhancements and other leads/ allowances, and multiplying by 12. Average pay figures were calculated by dividing total salaries/earnings by total whole time equivalents.

 The terms "health economy" and "health community" can be used to describe all statutory and voluntary organisations in one area with an interest in local health service delivery and tackling health inequalities.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para0">The term "health economy" can be used to refer to financial relationships between local health service providers and other key stakeholders. The term "health community" encompasses all local groups and individuals with an interest in all aspects of the health of a local community, including the wider determinants of health. This may include patient groups, carers, primary care trusts, local authorities, voluntary and community groups and the private sector.

All nursing care provided by the NHS is free of charge.

 <i>[holding answer 22 April 2002]:</i> I am advised that children who are vaccinated against polio and who do not travel outside of the United Kingdom face extremely small risks from polio, and would only be vulnerable if the vaccine had failed to protect and they were exposed to wild polio virus from a recently arrived infected visitor from an endemic country. Children who have been immunised against polio and who travel abroad are at similarly low risk if visiting another non-endemic country. The risks will increase progressively according to the extent of endemicity of countries visited.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para1">Experts advise that the risk of vaccine associated polio is approximately one in every million doses administered and this will not be affected by travel.

 The Government are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, which is accepted as the best form of nutrition for infants. Action includes the development and dissemination of the evidence base on good practice, embedding messages into national health service practice and other policies, and ensuring effective monitoring of infant feeding practices.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para2">A total of 79 'best breastfeeding practice' projects have been funded across all regions. The aim is to increase the rates of breastfeeding, both initiation and duration. This is a goal shared by all sure start initiatives and several health action zone programmes. Many of the 'best breastfeeding practice' projects have now obtained mainstream funding from sure start initiatives.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para3">Other related Department activities include support for an annual national breastfeeding awareness week, four main voluntary organisations involved in the promotion of breastfeeding, research into breastfeeding through quinquennial infant feeding surveys, and maintaining close links with United Nations Children's Fund's baby friendly initiative. The forthcoming national service framework for children will cover maternity services and we are considering how best to include breastfeeding within this framework.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para4">The results of the infant feeding survey 2000 showed an increase in the breastfeeding rates between 1995 and 2000: 71 per cent. of the mothers in England and Wales breastfed their infants as compared to 68 per cent. in 1995. In social class V there has been a significant increase in the incidence of breastfeeding from 50 per cent. in 1995 to 59 per cent. in 2000.

 A number of risk measurement exercises have been carried out since the inception of the national health service counter fraud service in 1998. The purpose of these exercises is to show the actual figures for losses to fraud and corruption, and figures for the sums at risk in each area of the NHS (the vote 1 budget). The status and results of these exercises are set out in the table.

 Throughout all changes to the structure of the national health service, whether the merger of two health authorities or the major restructuring of the NHS that took place in April this year, the need to maintain sound data systems has been paramount. Throughout the changes, the Department's officials involved in the collation and publication of data have and continue to take action to ensure the continuity of key data streams is maintained.
<P>

<a name="20520w36.html_para7">Since 1 April, primary care trusts have taken on the majority of functions previously carried out by health authorities and will be the focal point locally for improving the health of the community, securing high quality services and integrating health and social care locally.

 The Government are aware that chiropody and podiatry services play a vital role in helping to maintain people's independence. For older people especially, we see these services as having a strong preventative role in helping them maintain their mobility and may enable them to stay in their homes rather than move prematurely to a residential care or nursing home. Chiropodists and podiatrists have been involved in developing the national service frameworks for older people and diabetes to ensure adequate standards for these services.

<P>
<a name="20520w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan sets out the progress we want to make on waiting over the coming years. Each year maximum waiting times will fall so that, by the end of 2005, the maximum in-patient waiting time will be cut to six months and the maximum out-patient waiting time for a first outpatient appointment will be cut to three months. Urgent cases will continue to be treated much faster. All patients will benefit from shorter waiting times as maximum waiting times reduce in the years leading up to 2005.
<P>

<a name="20520w38.html_para5">As a step towards achieving the NHS Plan targets from 1 April 2002 the maximum waiting time for in-patients has been cut from 18 to 15 months and a new maximum waiting time of six months has been established for patients waiting for their first out-patient appointments with a consultant.
<P>

<a name="20520w38.html_para6">The "Action On" programmes have been established by the Government as part of the modernisation of the NHS. They are led by the National Patients' Access Team (NPAT). Their aim is to significantly encourage and disseminate best practice, improve access to care and to reduce variations in waiting times in the four areas with the longest waiting times: cataracts; orthopaedics; ear, nose and throat; and dermatology. Local services are helped to identify their constraints and to find effective solutions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20520w39.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government have a number of actions in place that will contribute to reducing the number of failed appointments in the national health service due to non-attendance:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Booked appointments (including in-patient and out-patient visits) have been shown to reduce the number of failed appointments due to non-attendance. By the end of 2005, all out-patient appointments and in-patient elective admissions will be pre-booked;
<P>
<BR>
Alongside this, electronic booking systems are being implemented. They will make booking more convenient for patients and clinicians, allow bookings to be easily changed to take account of changing circumstances and over time they will also enable appointment reminders to be issued via phone, email and other technologies;
<P>
<BR>
All acute hospital trusts now have booking systems in place in at least two specialities/high volume procedures and more than five million patients have now benefited from booked appointments. A fourth wave of the national booking programme, 'moving to mainstream', began in September 2001 and will shift booking to mainstream NHS activity.
<P>
<BR>
The Modernisation Agency's Theatre Project have issued interim guidance which includes a checklist of actions for addressing patient cancellations, including validating lists and telephoning patients near the date of admission to confirm attendance. Pre-operative assessment is being rolled out as part of operating theatres and pre-operative assessment programme and should reduce non-attendance and last minute patient cancellations;
<P>
<BR>
Use of partial booking systems support reducing the level of non-attendance by ensuring patients are contacted before their appointment so that they can agree a convenient date and time.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20520w39.html_para1">These initiatives are already starting to make an impact. As the level of booking increases and the guidance from the theatre project is spread across the NHS we will see a reduction in number of failed appointment due to non-attendance.

 For several years, botulinum toxin in very carefully timed and measured doses has been used to treat overactive muscles in adults, particularly around the eyes and in the neck. More recently, it has been used as part of the management of spasticity and dystonia sufferers. It is also useful for people with cerebral palsy. It helps relax muscles so they become less stiff&#151;and this helps walking and movement. Botulinum toxin is usually most effective if the condition affects only a limited group of muscles.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that all carcases are inspected after slaughter for signs of bovine TB by Meat Hygiene Service Inspectors, in accordance with the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended). Those Regulations require the carcases of animals with evidence of generalised tuberculosis to be condemned as unfit for human consumption. Where there is evidence of localised disease the Regulations require the affected parts to be condemned.
<P>

<a name="20520w40.html_para9">In September 2000 the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food reviewed the measures in place to protect the food chain from risks associated with "M.bovis" and concluded that the risk, if any, from the consumption of meat following assessment and action by the NHS staff in UK abattoirs is very low. The committee made recommendations to the Agency to reduce any residual risk still further. These measures included some changes to inspection procedures in slaughterhouses, and a change to national legislation bringing it fully into line with EU requirements. Copies of the ACMSF report were placed in the Library on 1 February 2002. The Board of the Food Standards Agency has accepted the recommendations and they will be taken forward as appropriate.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> A recent pilot study conducted in Liverpool has investigated the frequency of adverse drug reaction-related hospital admissions. The findings of this study suggest that the proportion of such reactions has not altered significantly in the last decade; that is, around 5.5 per cent. of all hospital admissions are due to adverse drug reactions 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2002 : Column 156W</I><P>
(ADRs). A follow-up study is anticipated which should identify areas in which prescribing issues and practices should be addressed in order to reduce the incidence of ADRs in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20520w41.html_para0">The ADRs observed during the pilot study were subsequently submitted via the Yellow Card Scheme to the Medicines Control Agency, which is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines to ensure that medicines meet acceptable standards of safety and efficacy. Spontaneous reporting schemes, such as the UK's Yellow Card Scheme which has been in operation since 1964, are one of the primary tools used in monitoring drug safety and provide an 'early warning' of previously unrecognised drug safety hazards in association with medicines.
<P>

<a name="20520w41.html_para1">The Committee on Safety of Medicines/Medicines Control Agency receive reports of suspected ADRs from doctors, dentists, pharmacists and coroners and there is a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs. Approximately 18,000&#150;19,000 suspected ADR reports are received each year via this scheme. The number of reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons, as this scheme is associated with an unknown level of under reporting. It is important to note that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as the patient's underlying illness or other medicines taken concurrently.
<P>

<a name="20520w41.html_para2">Over the last 20 years, suspected ADRs submitted via the Yellow Card Scheme with a fatal outcome account for less than 3 per cent. of these reports. The Office for National Statistics also collates data on deaths certified by doctors and coroners as due to adverse effects of drugs in therapeutic use. The quality of these data may be inconsistent as many thousands of doctors write certificates with a wide variation in knowledge, training and practice. In 2000 a total of 159 deaths were certified as due to adverse effects of drugs in therapeutic use.
