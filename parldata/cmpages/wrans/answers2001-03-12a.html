<a name="10312w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 8 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 631W, on the Joint Service Defence Council, what factors led him to authorise the withdrawal of JS DC1 88/00.  [152852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I authorised the temporary withdrawal of Joint Service Defence Council instruction 88/00, pending a review, as a result of concerns that the Ministry of Defence's policy towards membership of societies such as the Freemasons might not be fully compliant with the European convention on human rights.

<a name="10312w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 13 February 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 130W.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress of the private-public partnership within DERA.  [152775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> I refer my hon. Friend to the announcement I made in the House on 24 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 777-79 about our decision to implement the core competence model for the DERA public-private partnership. Under core competence, around three-quarters of the current DERA organisation will be turned into a company, referred to as NewDERA. For strategic reasons, the remainder will be retained within the Ministry of Defence to carry out functions that could not appropriately be transferred to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="10312w01.html_para0">Work to implement the PPP has intensified over recent months and significant progress has been made on separating DERA into two new organisations. An amended trading fund order, entitled the draft Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Trading Fund Order 2001, was laid before Parliament on 17 January 2001. Operational separation of DERA is planned by 1 April 2001. Legal separation follows on 1 July after a period of shadow operation to test the organisations and their infrastructures. We will then carry out the remaining work necessary to prepare NewDERA for sale.

<a name="10312w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the extent to which DERA has met its targets in relation to payment of its sub-contractors; and what steps are being taken to improve the timeliness of payments.  [152772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> During the year 1999-2000, as reported in the annual report for that year, DERA paid in excess of 97 per cent. of invoices within the agreed credit period on receipt of an undisputed invoice or date of confirmation of receipt of an acceptable service. The payment process is monitored and DERA is currently exploring the possibility of introducing a fast-track payment system for the large number of low value invoices that it processes and making payments more frequently. DERA currently makes payments twice a week, once by cheque and once by bank automated clearing system (BACS).

<a name="10312w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Private Simon Jeans</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Duncan Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the verdict reached by the Croatian court on the killing of Private Simon Jeans in Split, Croatia, in September 1996; what representations he has made to his Croatian counterpart regarding the killing; and if he will make a statement.  [153176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Despite the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Private Simon Jeans, it would, of course, be wholly inappropriate for this Government to attempt to intervene in the judicial process of another country. We have to recognise that the Croatian judiciary, like our own, is independent and not subject to external pressure or direction.
<P>

<a name="10312w01.html_para1">We did, however, make it clear to the Croatian Government, at a senior level, that the case was important and that we were anxious it should be handled both properly and swiftly. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Minister for Europe and the then Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Charles Guthrie, all raised the subject, in addition to the regular dialogue conducted between the Embassy and Defence staff in Zagreb and Split and the Croatian authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The Minister for the Armed Forces visited North-West Cambridgeshire on 31 March 2000 to meet the right hon. Member. No other Defence Ministers have visited constituencies which are in the Peterborough unitary authority between 1 January 2000 and 14 February 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions the medical records of a member of the armed services have been declared lost in each year since 1992.  [151811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not maintain a central list of lost records. Duplicates of some of the documents contained in Service personnel personal medical folders are held centrally and over the last four years 3,722 requests have been made for copies of these records. Of this total, 95 records could not be traced. In addition, hospital records are forwarded to a central repository, which over the last five years has been unable to trace 429 records from 7,227 requests made. Requests for duplicate copies of medical records do not necessarily indicate that the originals are lost: they may be held in another location or an additional copy may be needed.

<a name="10312w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Depleted Uranium</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much depleted uranium is unaccounted for or missing as a result of the malfunction of the test rig which was placed on the sea bed at the Dundrennan range in 2000.  [151845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The depleted uranium samples attached to the test rig damaged by heavy seas in the Solway Firth, and which are now missing, amount to 20.76kg. This is the equivalent of four depleted uranium rounds. If not recovered in a diving exercise planned for the week beginning 5 March, this material will oxidise and disperse in exactly the same way as the existing penetrator rounds, causing a negligible increase above the level of uranium occurring naturally in sea water. Since 1982, when firing of DU rounds into the sea began, there has been no detectable increase in uranium levels in samples of sea water, sea-bed sediment and shellfish taken in the area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many depleted uranium shells were fired into the Irish Sea in each of the last 10 years.  [152629]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> No depleted uranium (DU) shells have been fired into the Irish sea in the last 10 years. DU projectiles are fired from Kirkcudbright into the Solway Firth and the numbers fired over the last 10 years are as follows:

<a name="10312w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2001]:</i> We share the United States concerns about missile proliferation and we recognise the role that missile defence can play as one part of a strategy to deal with it. We have made it clear that we would want to respond helpfully should the US make a specific request, but until any such proposal has been made it does remain premature to make a specific judgment.

<a name="10312w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 15 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 192W, on Defence Medical Services, if he will list each level of medical downgrading used in the medical downgrading categorisation system stating in each case <i>(a)</i> the nature of duty restriction, <i>(b)</i> the nature of geographical restriction and <i>(c)</i> the level of deployability; and if he will make a statement.  [151807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2001]:</i> The various levels of medical downgrading used in the services medical downgrading categorisation systems are set out in detail in service publications. These are currently under review and a revised version is expected to be finalised shortly. As the level of detail involved would require an answer of considerable length, I will write to the right hon. and learned Member and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="10312w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps are taken to ensure that small consultancy companies are given a fair chance to compete for contracts.  [152773]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> The use of competition to select contractors and sub-contractors in order to secure best value for money is the cornerstone of Ministry of Defence's acquisition policy. Suppliers, whether they are small and medium enterprises or large corporate groups, are encouraged to compete for requirements in excess of certain value thresholds (&#163;93,000 for the <i>Official Journal </i>of the European Community, and &#163;250,000 for the MOD Contracts Bulletin for consultancy requirements), which are widely advertised. For low value requirements, formal competition may not be considered cost-effective (in respect of bidding and resource costs), and in such cases a supplier may be selected on the basis of expertise or past performance for example. The principle of fairness throughout the acquisition process is not only MOD policy, but is enshrined in UK and European law.

<a name="10312w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on the imposition of a turnover threshold in relation to competition for consultancy assignments.  [152774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence needs to be assured that potential bidders can fulfil its requirements, and therefore seeks only to invite tenderers with whom it is prepared to place a contract. This not only helps to reduce the cost of bidding to industry, but it provides reassurance that value-for-money defence capability is being delivered. Financial status is just one of the factors taken into account when considering potential bidders eligibility. Turnover size may be employed as part of the calculation to determine whether a supplier has adequate resources to undertake a particular contract, whether for consultancy or other goods or services. This process accords with the central unit on procurement's guidance on good professional practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what tests are carried out on members of HM armed forces for <i>(a)</i> sexually transmitted diseases and <i>(b)</i> HIV/ AIDs; and if he will make a statement.  [153169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There is no compulsory testing for sexually transmitted diseases or HIV. Standard laboratory tests, specific to the particular type of disease, for sexually transmitted diseases are carried out on service personnel where clinically indicated. Tests for HIV are carried out where this is a requirement prior to service in certain countries, or at the request of individuals who are concerned that they may have contracted HIV. Service personnel can, of course, make use of civilian genito- urinary clinics.

 The armed forces are fully committed to the avoidance of all forms of discrimination and make every effort to respect and accommodate the religious requirements of personnel. Muslim personnel are normally allowed to celebrate religious festivals and holidays and to fast and pray. The armed forces also aim to cater for religious dietary requirements: Halal, Kosher and vegetarian meals are provided by service messes and are available in operational ration packs for operations and exercises. However, there may be some circumstances when, in the interests of health and safety or operational effectiveness, some flexibility may be required on the part of the individual.

<a name="10312w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The report by His Honour John Gower QC and Sir Anthony Hammond KCB QC was delivered to the Attorney-General on 5 December 2000. I have today placed a copy of the report in the Libraries and copies of the report are available on request to the solicitor for HM Customs and Excise.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para0">The report concludes that the Customs and Excise solicitor's office should retain its prosecution function, but that in exercising this function, including the giving of advice to investigating officers, it must be truly independent and be seen to be so. To that end, the report has also concluded that in relation to the prosecution function the solicitor should be accountable to the Attorney-General rather than to the commissioners and that the solicitor/client relationship between the commissioners and the solicitor should cease in relation to this function. Where cases are referred to the solicitor's office with a view to prosecution, the decision on whether to do so will rest with the appropriate lawyer after consultation with, where

necessary, an administrator on matters of policy and public interest. These recommendations are supported by a number of associated recommendations on detailed structural and financial aspects.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para1">The Government have carefully considered all these recommendations. They accept all the recommendations in principle, but, given the significant resource implications associated with some recommendations, have opted for a phased approach to implementation.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para2">The Government have had particular regard to the need to ensure that adequate resources are made available to the solicitor's office to enable it properly to conduct the large and complex drugs and other prosecutions which were the main focus of the report, and which are conducted by the special casework division of that office (SCD). They have therefore decided to afford this area of work the greatest priority.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para3">Accordingly, it has been decided that, with effect from 1 April 2001, Customs and Excise will invest sufficient extra resources in the solicitor's office to enable it to implement the recommendations in the report which bear directly on the cases conducted by the SCD. This will mean that, taken with additional resources already provided to the solicitor's office in relation to the Butler report, the number of staff working on those cases in the SCD will almost double.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para4">These additional resources will enable recommendation 10 of the report (the attendance at conferences with counsel, and attendance at hearings in the Crown court) to be implemented quickly in relation to all SCD cases, and in over 60 per cent. of the cases conducted by the solicitor's office in total. The implementation of the remainder of that recommendation will be subject to local trials to evaluate the benefits and costs.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para5">Recommendation 15 (the conduct of magistrates courts proceedings) will not be implemented immediately and will also be subject to such local trials.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para6">The report concludes that Customs and Excise lawyers are dedicated professionals with valuable skills and expertise, and the Government believe that making the changes in accountability, responsibility and resourcing referred to above will ensure public confidence in the solicitor's office as a prosecuting authority.
<P>

<a name="10312w03.html_para7">To enable detailed consideration to be given to the implementation of the remaining recommendations in the report, particularly where these have structural and budgetary implications, the change in accountability will have effect on 1 April 2002.

<a name="10312w03.html_para8">There are more dentists working within the General Dental Service than ever before. In England there are now about 18,040, over 1,600 up on 1997. Availability problems are not caused by a shortage of dentists but by the amount of time dentists dedicate to private work. To address this problem the dental strategy, "Modernising NHS Dentistry: Implementing the NHS Plan", offers incentives to NHS dentists to maintain and increase the amount of NHS work they do. The strategy also allows health authorities to commission personal dental services in areas where there are access difficulties.

 We do not know how many children in care have been abused since 1971, and do not have a sound basis on which to form an estimate. It is a tragedy for any child to be abused, and a particular betrayal when such abuse happens in care. As we made clear in

"Learning the Lessons", our response to the report of the Waterhouse Inquiry, too many children in the past were failed by the very services that should have been helping them. We are concentrating our efforts on ensuring that such failures in the care system are not allowed to happen again, as evidenced by our programme of new protective legislation for children in care and our &#163;885 million Quality Protects Programme.

 We are aware that people who have been abused in care may continue to experience mental health problems. However, central records are not kept of the number who disclose this history. We have set out clear national standards in the National Service Framework for Mental Health. It describes how people should be able to get quicker access to more effective treatments in and through primary care, with support from specialised services where necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received about the Children's Manifesto produced by Barnardos, the Child Poverty Action Group and the NSPCC; and what plans he has to evaluate and monitor services to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.  [153397]<P>

<P>
<a name="10312w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Children's Manifesto is an interesting and thought-provoking document that we are considering carefully. We share the aim expressed in the manifesto of enabling today's young people to grow into secure, confident and resourceful citizens. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are children in need under the Children Act 1989. Services for them are, therefore, monitored and evaluated in the same way as other children's personal social services. From time to time, as necessary, we look specifically at services for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. For example, we asked local authorities to describe services for this group in their Year 3 Quality Protects Management Action Plans, submitted in January 2001. These plans are currently being evaluated.

<a name="10312w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 Following the decision by the Ministers of Public Administration, the first meeting of the Group took place on 21 December in Paris. Chaired by Dieudonne Mandelkern, the French representative, the Group agreed its work plan for the first four months in accordance with its mandate from the Ministers. It decided to look at five themes--codification of existing legislation, simplification, improving consultation, impact assessment (including alternatives to regulation) and the administrative structures needed to support this. I have placed a copy of this work plan and a copy of the Ministers' resolution establishing the Group in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10312w06.html_para2">The second and third meetings of the Group looked at each of the five themes identified, resulting in agreement on the Group's initial report at its meeting in Paris on 26-27 February. On the suggestion of the Swedish representative, the Group also decided it should be known as the 'Mandelkern Group' in future, after its chairman. I have placed a copy of the initial report in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10312w06.html_para3">The Group's initial report is an excellent document covering the main issues of better regulation. Alongside espousing some general principles of better regulation, it makes specific and practical recommendations on each of the five key themes.

 The Policy Studies Directorate (PSD) is part of the Centre for Management and Policy Studies and the Director of Policy Studies was appointed in March 2000. PSD supports policy makers by evaluating new approaches to policy making and promoting best practice, by encouraging and enabling an evidence-based approach and by working to ensure high standards in Government research and evaluation. It is the intention that research reports on new approaches to policy making will be published as they are completed. Special Advisers to Ministers may contribute to the work of the unit in the same way as they would to the other work of a Department, in line with their role and duties as set out in the "Model Contract for Special Advisers".

 The minimum age at which most civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60. The Civil Service Management Code enables staff to retire or be retired early by Departments and agencies on several grounds. A copy of the code is available in the Library.

 Each Government Department is responsible for ensuring it has robust business continuity plans in place to ensure that they can respond effectively to a wide range of problems, including computer failure. Departments are expected to test these plans regularly and to respond to any weaknesses identified. From January 2001 all new high risk projects involving procurement in the Civil Departments of central Government, along with their executive agencies and NDPBs require a business continuity plan that addresses potential problems during implementation and roll out of the project.
<P>

<a name="10312w07.html_para0">Guidance to Departments is principally made available via the Office of Government Commerce, which also chairs an Interdepartmental Business Continuity Planning Forum. This forum has involved a range of commercial companies, including the Guardian IT Group and SGRS.

<a name="10312w07.html_para1">Departments are also required to ensure that their computer systems are adequately protected, and to review regularly security measures.

<a name="10312w07.html_para2">To enhance further security across Government, especially in relation to computer systems, all Departments have now prepared plans to achieve compliance with the International Standard on Information Security Management (ISO 17799).

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> We have not set specific targets for employer awareness of the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). Employer awareness is, however, one of the indicators used by my Department and we test the level through research. A survey carried out in 1998 showed that 75 per cent. of respondents were aware of the DDA, including all respondents from large firms. While 80 per cent. of large firms also stated that they were very or fairly aware of the employment provisions in the Act, awareness was much lower among small businesses at 36 per cent. My Department has recently commissioned a survey of workplaces, involving interviews with line managers as well as personnel staff and head office staff. This survey will examine a range of issues regarding the employment and retention of disabled people, including awareness of the employment provisions of the DDA.
<P>

<a name="10312w07.html_para4">As part of our efforts to raise awareness, a wide range of information about the DDA has been included in free leaflets and by April 2000, over 2 million had been distributed by the DDA Helpline, which was set up to give information and advice to businesses and disabled people. The "See the Person" campaign was launched in June 1999 to raise awareness about disability and to give information and advice to employers and service providers about the requirements of the DDA. The campaign included TV and radio advertisements, posters, press articles, and publicity organised through employers' organisations. The campaign was used to promote new publications such as a good practice guide for employing disabled people which has also been helpfully promoted through organisations such as the Federation of Small Businesses, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the CBI. The Government's current publicity campaign--"What have you got to offer"--is aimed at service providers and their responsibilities to provide access to disabled customers under Part III of the DDA. The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) took over responsibility for the Helpline, when it was set up in April 2000, and continues to provide support, advice and free publications about the Act. The DRC Helpline is on 08457 622 633.
<P>

<a name="10312w07.html_para5">On Monday 5 March we announced our intention to end the exemption of small employers from the DDA employment provisions in 2004. Through our document--"Towards Inclusion"--we are consulting on what help small employers might need as a result and we said that the DRC, the Small Business Service and the DfEE's telephone advice line, Equality Direct, would all work together to ensure that effective advice and information are available at the right time. Our intention is to continue working with these and other organisations and services and increase awareness through a range of initiatives including publicity campaigns.

 Job gains and losses occur for a variety of reasons. Currently, job gains exceed job losses with employment in the UK up 225,000 over the last year (ending October to December 2000). Where job losses occur it is, in general, contrary to EU state aid rules for the Government to compensate companies, partnerships and/or individuals whatever their cause. In these cases, individuals have employment rights including statutory entitlement to redundancy payments from their employer.

 The Department made a further &#163;1.5 million available from the Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) programme for 1997-98. The purpose of this funding was to enable senior teachers with designated responsibility for child protection to receive appropriate and practical in-service training. From 2001-02, schools will be free to use most of their devolved Standards Fund grant to meet their individual priorities, including, where appropriate, in-service teacher training in child protection. The Standards Fund will increase to around &#163;2.2 billion (excluding capital expenditure) in 2001-02, most of which will be devolved to schools.

 The following table shows those schools, in the South Shields constituency, which have benefited from investment through the New Deal for Schools programme, which commenced in 1997-98. These allocations formed part of the &#163;5.5 million investment made in schools in the South Tyneside local education authority under the New Deal for Schools programme between 1997-98 and 2000-01. In total, in those four years, some &#163;13 million of funding for capital investment has been allocated for schools in South Tyneside local education authority.

<sup>(7)</sup> Future years' allocations shown in the above table are those already announced as being attributable to South Tyneside local education authority.<P>

<P>

In addition to the amounts shown above, schools in the Authority will also benefit from a share of other programmes where allocations have not yet been made. These include over &#163;1 billion of credit approvals, mainly to provide new pupil places; &#163;440 million of grant to governors of Voluntary Aided schools; &#163;555 million funding through the NDS Modernisation programme; &#163;170 million worth of funding under the Schools Access Initiative and additional New Deal for Schools Devolved Formula announced in the Budget on 7 March of &#163;300 million in total over the next three years.<P>

This funding will be augmented by capital receipts and other contributions from local education authority sources, and the contribution which governors of Voluntary Aided schools make to their building work. In addition, around &#163;1.6 billion is available nationally through Private Finance Initiative Credits for projects which will sign in 2002-03 and 2003-04.<P>

Funding specifically ring fenced for the renewal of school laboratories and secondary learning support units is ending in 2001-02. Local authorities will be able to prioritise their other increased funding for this purpose, if they wish.<P>

We know that many other young people will have left the programme for employment without telling the Employment Service--these people are not included in this figure.

 On external inspections, all the inspectorates require providers to complete one or two forms to enable the planning of inspections. In the future in line with guidance given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State such information will be routed to the inspectorates through the Learning and Skills Council. During the inspection, inspectors draw from standard documentation prepared and made available by providers. The Secretary of State has required the new Post-16 inspectorates to keep the burden of inspection to a minimum consistent with maintaining the rigour and quality of inspection. As to internal inspections, how these are conducted are matters for the providers themselves.

 According to the Youth Cohort Study, 53 per cent. of 16-18-year-old A-level students, in full-time education, were also in some form of employment. They worked an average of 10 hours per week. Research evidence indicates that young people choose to undertake part-time work for a variety of reasons: not solely to finance their studies.
<P>

<a name="10312w09.html_para3">I am not aware of studies specifically looking at the effects of paid work on the results of A-level students. However, the evaluation of the first year of Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) found that young people, in EMA pilot and control areas, who worked in Year 11 achieved better exam results than those that did not. Subsequent stages of the EMA evaluation should throw further light on this issue.

to two hours of physical activity. This will be delivered during and after school through the PE curriculum and study support. We will be consulting with parents, teachers and relevant organisations to see how the two hour entitlement can be best delivered, and we are working closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to look at ways of increasing the opportunities available to children to participate in physical activities. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority are also producing evidence that demonstrates how schools can achieve the two hours entitlement. Over the last two years, seven out of 10 schools have increased their provision of out of school hours activities, of which sport is the most popular, and over a half plan to increase provision in the coming year. The current curriculum is designed to promote positive attitudes towards active and healthy lifestyles, and the importance of fitness and health is a part of each Key Stage. We are working closely with the Department of Health on the National Healthy School Standard, which seeks to promote health and well being in schools.

[152641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Education maintenance allowance (EMA) is paid on the basis of an assessment of the income available to a student's parents. In line with long established practice, taxable benefits are included in the income to be assessed. Invalid care allowance (ICA) is classed as a taxable payment because it is intended to compensate a carer for the lost earnings which result from not being able to work full-time. Exempting income-replacement benefits from tax would discriminate against those whose income comes from earnings. But other benefits which are intended to meet a specific need of the claimant--such as attendance allowance and disability allowance--are not subject to tax, and are not included in the income to be assessed in deciding on eligibility for EMA.

Examples of our action to do so include: guaranteeing to cut by a third the number of documents, and by a half the number of pages, that the Government send automatically to schools during this school year--last term we reduced paperwork to secondary schools by 60 per cent. and to primary schools by 40 per cent.; harnessing DfEE and Cabinet Office resources to simplify some of the paperwork that schools complete--the first results of this joint project are set out in the "Making a Difference: Reducing School Paperwork" report. This shows that a typical school is

expected to save over 200 hours of paperwork every year--equivalent to more than a month's work for one person; and across the school system 4.5 million hours will be saved annually; simplifying radically the operation of next year's Standards Fund--we have replaced bidding, claiming and reporting with a single expenditure returns sheet; we have allowed schools to vire funds between almost all grant headings; we have allowed schools to carry funds over to the end of the school year; and we have introduced monitoring against existing targets; placing model schemes of work on the DfEE website to underpin all National Curriculum subjects at Key Stages 1 to 3--they are entirely voluntary and teachers may use them directly or adapt them as they wish. We also have plans to place model lesson plans on the website in a further effort to reduce paperwork and make the necessary lesson preparation as straightforward as possible; and developing new ICT resources, including the launch of:

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many <i>(a)</i> children, <i>(b)</i> families and <i>(c)</i> people, in each constituency in Scotland, were living in poverty in (i) 1997, (ii) 1998, (iii) 1999 and (iv) 2000.  [152465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are multi- faceted problems. Therefore, the Government do not use a single definition of poverty but instead use a range of indicators to monitor the progress of our strategy. Information relating to the indicators can be found in the

<P><I>12 Mar 2001 : Column: 450W</I><P>
second Government "Opportunity for all" report on tackling poverty and social exclusion "One year on: making a difference". The report also describes and monitors the impact of policies we have already introduced, and sets our plans for the future.
<P>

<a name="10312w11.html_para0">When tackling poverty in Scotland, the UK Government work in partnership with the Scottish Executive, through mechanisms such as the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty. The Scottish Executive produces a Social Justice Annual Report " . . . a Scotland where everyone matters".

<P>
<a name="10312w11.html_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 My Department and Lottery distributors commissioned research into the impact of the Lottery on the coalfields and is working with coalfields groups to take forward the report's recommendations. These include actively encouraging applications from areas of low take- up, producing flexible partnership funding requirements, making decision making more transparent, and better co-ordination with other organisations responsible for regenerating coalfields. We shall continue to monitor carefully applications and awards in coalfields areas.

<a name="10312w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> The financial thresholds were most recently discussed on 2 March at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Goods, at which my Department made representations about a current proposal to change the date for conversion from euro into sterling, which will effectively reduce the thresholds by 20 per cent. In addition, my Department also made representations about the need for a review of the financial thresholds to, at least, update them in line with inflation. As a result, the European Commission has agreed to consider a review next year, in order to give Her Majesty's Government an opportunity to explain our concerns in detail.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> Wembley National Stadium Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Football Association. The appointment of Sir Rodney Walker as Chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd., and the terms upon which the appointment was made, is entirely a matter for them.
<P>

<a name="10312w11.html_para1">Sir Rodney Walker informed me in December that he had been asked by the Football Association to take over as Chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd. and asked for my advice on whether the appointment would conflict with his position as Chairman of the United Kingdom Sports Council. I advised Sir Rodney that as the United Kingdom Sports Council were not directly involved with the Wembley project, in my view no such conflict arose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w11.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department expects its staff to observe exceptionally high standards of personal honesty and integrity. Staff should not accept gifts which would or might appear to place them under any obligation to the donor, compromise impartiality or otherwise be improper.
<P>

<a name="10312w11.html_para2">After consultation with senior managers, staff may keep gifts with a retail value of less than &#163;25. Gifts that have a value greater than &#163;25 given by commercial or trade organisations or individuals must be surrendered. Alternatively, if it is considered appropriate to retain such gifts, staff must pay the Department the value in excess of &#163;25. Any gift which has a value of &#163;10 or more must be registered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 A survey of working parents conducted in June 2000 by my Department asked parents whether they had taken up parental leave since December 1999. For the great majority of cases, the survey collected information on household income rather than individual income. We are currently analysing this information, which should allow analysis of take-up levels of parental leave across household income bands and provide an indication of whether potential take-up of parental leave is influenced by income levels. A full report of the survey findings is being prepared for publication, but no detailed results are yet available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the criteria for assessing applications for financial support for economic and physical regeneration initiatives for funds administered by his Department; and what account they take of <i>(a)</i> the variation in the availability of previously developed land and buildings and <i>(b)</i> other considerations of environmental capacity.  [152339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The aims of my Department's policies for economic and physical regeneration were summarised in the recent White Paper, "Opportunity for All in a World of Change". These are based on putting greater emphasis on growth within all regions, by assessing under- performance, putting in place the building-blocks for economic success and establishing strategies for sustaining this success. The exercise of these policies is based on equipping all regions with the means to build on their own distinctive cultures, know-how and competitive advantages. These will include factors relating to land, buildings and the environment, and criteria of this kind are being included in the corporate plans currently being agreed jointly between the regional development agencies, my Department and the DETR and DFEE.

<a name="10312w12.html_para0">One company which has benefited is IONEX--a small water treatment company where a grant of &#163;3,000 was given to continue to develop electro catalytic electrodes for the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen and oxygen. Another company, Primrose Bumble, received a grant of &#163;2,250 to help with the development of a spelling aid for dyslexic individuals.

It is a five-year scheme which is designed to tackle social deprivation issues in all of the seven identified market towns. This SRB scheme has been providing very useful input into SWRDA's region wide new market/coastal towns initiative which is due to be launched at the end of March 2001.

 Over the past two years, officials from my Department have been in contact with a number of organisations to discuss security of information and ways of ensuring that the information is available after a disaster. The need for such contingency planning has been highlighted by the "I love you" bug and other computer viruses which have affected the operations of many companies around the world.
<P>

<a name="10312w12.html_para8">My Department encourages all organisations to implement ISO/IEC 17799/BS7799, the code of practice for information security management standard. This standard promotes the use of risk assessment and putting appropriate security controls in place before embarking on decisions which would involve losses or damage of an organisation. This includes business continuity management and information security education and training.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The redundancy and insolvency payments provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provide a safety net of minimum entitlements for employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The limits on payments under these provisions are subject to annual uprating. Employers and employees (or their representatives) are free to negotiate more favourable severance conditions than the statutory provisions require, if this accords with their own priorities, needs and circumstances. In most cases this is in fact what happens. The Government have no plans for any amendments to the law in this regard.

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> The table shows compulsory liquidations and bankruptcies in London for the years 1991 to 2000. The County court allocates an Official Receiver and it is the location of the Official Receiver's office that is recorded, not the location of the business. Official Receiver's offices do not coincide with Government office regions. April 1991 is the earliest available record of regional insolvencies.

We anticipate that this will provide evidence that many people have made their own pension provision on the back of the campaign. In addition, between the start of the pensions awareness advertising campaign on 11 January and 7 March 2001 the Department has had a total of over 212,000 responses to the pensions education marketing campaign. In response to this, we have sent out over 410,000 copies of the new pension guide.

These changes will include, for example, allowing the Department of Trade and Industry more time to negotiate with the miner, without the need to contact the Department of Social Security; and reducing duplication and red tape. These changes will ensure delays in the process do not occur.

 Housing Benefit provides assistance to those on low income to meet the housing costs of the dwelling they occupy as their home. Help can be considered on two such dwellings, for up to four weeks where the local authority is satisfied that the liability to pay two rents was unavoidable. We are aware of the difficulties faced by people whose homes are uninhabitable due to flooding and who have had to rent alternative accommodation. We are reviewing the current arrangements.

<P>

 We have no current plans to review the procedures and operation of the Child Support Agency. As a result of a fundamental review of child support completed in December 1998, we have undertaken a radical reform of the system, detailed provision for which is contained in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000. The new child support scheme will be introduced for new cases by April 2002. Parents who have an existing maintenance assessment will be transferred to the new scheme at a later date when the new arrangements are shown to be working well.
<P>

<a name="10312w14.html_para1">The new child support scheme will be simpler and easy to understand. Child maintenance will be calculated based on a straightforward percentage of the non-resident parent's net income.

<a name="10312w14.html_para11">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty, so we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 18,000 older people in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10312w14.html_para12">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 16,900 pensioners in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic state pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 6,100 in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East. 2,900 pensioner families in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's policy is that radioactive wastes, including waste from the decommissioning of nuclear reactors, should be managed in ways that protect the safety of the public, the workforce and the environment, now and in the future. This is a complex issue and the UK Government and the devolved Administrations will publish a consultation paper setting out detailed proposals as soon as we can. This paper will begin the process that will lead to the implementation of a radioactive waste management policy capable of commanding widespread support across the UK.

<a name="10312w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 All transporters of nuclear material in Great Britain, including BNFL, are required by regulation to have emergency procedures to cover any shipment in the event of an accident. Liaison with local authorities and emergency services is not a regulatory requirement.

<a name="10312w15.html_para4">The nuclear industry, including BNFL, has a nation- wide emergency response organisation called RADSAFE, which has been drawn up after consultation with the relevant national bodies and organisations, including the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association (CACFOA).

 I am extremely grateful to the HSE and to TRL for their speedy consideration of the factors involved in the tragic accident at Great Heck near Selby on 28 February 2001. HSE and TRL will be continuing their investigations, but it is becoming apparent that there was nothing the railway industry could reasonably have done to prevent the train collision. It also appears that there were no technical matters connected with the road infrastructure that would help explain why the vehicle left the M62 in the first place. The road surface appears to have been adequate and the safety barriers more than met

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has asked the HSC to convene and lead a working group that will look at the circumstances of incidents where vehicles have blocked rail lines and whether there are features in common that might have been preventable. In parallel the Highways Agency will be reviewing its standards for safety barriers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent assessment he has made of the accuracy of the formula applied to calculate recycling rates of local authorities.  [153432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Information on the amount of waste collected and recycled by local authorities is obtained on an annual basis through the Department's annual Municipal Waste Management Survey. It is this information that is used to calculate household waste recycling rates at the national and local level. The proposed methodology for calculating the percentage of household waste recycled by local authorities in England was published in the consultation document "Best Value and Audit Commission Performance Indicators for 2001-02" in October 2000. The responses to the consultation exercise were taken into account in producing the final methodology published in Annexe A of the "Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies" on 5 March 2001. A copy of the guidance has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

 The Green Paper "Modernising Local Government Finance", notes that future revenue grant distribution formulae could distinguish more clearly between fixed costs and the costs that vary according to the number of people for whom a service is provided.
<P>

<a name="10312w16.html_para0">To help us explore how such formulae could be developed, we commissioned a scoping study from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The aim of the study was to review the existing evidence, and make recommendations as to the most promising avenues for further research if that was found to be needed. The study will shortly be published on the LGA website: www.lga.gov.uk. It

<P><I>12 Mar 2001 : Column: 469W</I><P>
suggests that fixed costs that do not vary much according to the size or needs of authority populations are most likely to relate to authorities' corporate administration costs. Examples are the costs of statutory external audits, and the costs of completing statements of accounts, annual reports and Best Value Performance Plans.

<a name="10312w16.html_para1">We are currently considering the implications of the scoping study as part of our review of the local government finance system, including whether we need to commission more detailed follow-up research.

 The Queen's Speech on 6 December outlined the Government's intention to draft a Safety Bill. We will use this opportunity to introduce a prescribed blood/ alcohol limit for professional and recreational mariners with accompanying powers for the police to test suspects. We also intend to take permissive powers to allow testing for drugs.
<P>

<a name="10312w16.html_para2">We propose to set a 80 mg per 100 ml blood/alcohol limit for mariners of all types of civil waterborne transport in UK waters, including non-UK vessels. It will be illegal for mariners, on duty, on board any commercial vessel or fishing vessel to be above the limit or to be unfit to fulfil their duties due to being intoxicated through drink. In the interest of passenger safety on passenger vessels or ferries the limit will apply to off-duty crew having a safety critical function in the event of an emergency. Those involved in the navigation or propulsion of recreational craft while in motion and not moored will also be included.
<P>

<a name="10312w16.html_para3">The proposed measures follow from recommendations made by Lord Justice Clarke in his Thames Safety Inquiry report published in December 1999 and a consultation exercise conducted by my Department last year. Responses to the consultation paper were largely supportive of the proposals and a summary has been placed in the Library of the House and a compilation of the full response is available in my Department's library.

<P>

<a name="10312w16.html_para4">The draft conclusions of the expert group show a mixed picture on the impact of air pollution on ecosystems in the UK. For instance the reduction in sulphur emissions has led to a 50 per cent. reduction in 'acid rain' in the UK in the last 12 years, and as a result, some ecosystems are showing signs of recovery. However, following recent scientific developments, the expert group concludes that the continued impact of air pollution on ecosystems may be more widespread than previously calculated.

 Deducting tax and national insurance is the responsibility of employers and the January 2001 "Employers Bulletin", sent to all employers, reminded them of how tax credits should be paid. When the Inland Revenue uncovers errors in the course of its work, or is approached by employees or employers when things go wrong during the year, it helps employers to put things right so that any temporary overpayments are corrected at the earliest opportunity.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what analysis his Department has made of the costs of <i>(a)</i> rendering carcases killed under the OTMS prior to incineration and <i>(b)</i> direct incineration of such carcases.  [151817]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Rendering, meat and bonemeal incineration and direct carcase incineration services were procured by the Intervention Board through tenders conducted under EC rules.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para0">Rates charged by individual suppliers vary. Costs by each route are regularly compared. Historically, on a per animal basis, rendering followed by incineration of the resultant MBM and tallow has been cheaper than direct carcase incineration.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para1">However, following recently concluded negotiations leading to the extension of direct carcase incineration contracts, the costs of each disposal route are now more closely aligned.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what inspections are carried out, and by whom, on meat imports from <i>(a)</i> EU countries and <i>(b)</i> other countries.  [151672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w19.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Community legislation requires member states to comply with strict hygiene rules in the production of meat and meat products in the Community before they are approved to trade. Among other things, this sets out the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in all meat plants before they can export.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para2">The European Commission is responsible for ensuring member states fulfil their obligations. EU legislation also provides for member states to carry out checks at points of destination. These are carried out by Meat Hygiene Service official veterinary surgeons at licensed premises, local authorities and the State Veterinary Service in the UK. Depending on the perceived health risk, checks at destination may be random or 100 per cent. Following the recent identification of specified risk material in imports of meat from Germany and the current foot and mouth disease problems in the UK, the Meat Hygiene Service has been instructed to step up levels of inspection at cutting plants and cold stores to ensure that increased volumes of imports can be checked for the necessary health marks and correct documentation.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para3">All meat imported from third countries into the UK must enter at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary checking. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks in accordance with EU legislation. These checks are to ensure that conditions of import into the Community have been complied with and that the products have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport. They are carried out by official veterinary surgeons employed by the local authority in which the BIP is located.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what his policy is on banning the importation of beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat from countries suffering from outbreaks of <i>(a)</i> foot and mouth disease and <i>(b)</i> swine fever.  [151916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w19.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The importation into the European Community of fresh meat from third countries is governed by Community legislation.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para4">When outbreaks of notifiable disease occur (including both classical swine fever and foot and mouth disease) the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996 allow the Government to prohibit the import of meat from a country or part thereof. On notification of an outbreak these Regulations allow the UK to issue a Declaration prohibiting meat from the relevant country or part thereof. They are effective from the date and time of signature and are sent immediately to all enforcement authorities. These Declarations remain in force pending the adoption of appropriate Community legislation. These provisions apply equally to outbreaks in member states and in third countries.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> All consignments of meat imported into the UK must have been produced in accordance with the harmonised Community rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC (as amended) (fresh meat) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC (as amended) (meat products). Among other things, these Directives set out the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in meat plants.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para6">Ensuring that all member states comply with their Community obligations in properly implementing and applying the Directives is the responsibility of the European Commission, whose Food and Veterinary Office carries our regular programmes of inspection visits to all member states.

The Food and Veterinary Office is also responsible for carrying out inspections in the third countries from which fresh meat is imported into the Community.
<P>

<a name="10312w19.html_para7">All meat imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition. They are carried out by official veterinary surgeons employed by the local authority in which the BIP is located. In line with Community rules, random spot checks at destination may be carried out on consignments of fresh meat imported into the UK from other EU member states.

 Initial epidemiological evidence suggests that the outbreak appears to have started in one premises in north-east England and spread from there.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he was first informed of the risk to animal health arising from <i>(a)</i> legitimate and <i>(b)</i> smuggled meat from Africa; and what action was taken.  [152840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The importation into the Community of fresh meat from third countries is governed by harmonised Community legislation. Under these rules, imports are only permitted from those countries or parts thereof where there is not considered to be a risk to human and animal health.
<P>

<a name="10312w20.html_para1">All meat imported directly into the UK from third countries must enter, and is subject to veterinary inspections, at designated UK border inspection posts (BIP). All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments are subject to physical checks in accordance. These checks are to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and that the products have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport. They are carried out by official veterinary surgeons employed by the local authority in which the BIP is located.
<P>

<a name="10312w20.html_para2">With regard to illegal imports of meat we are aware of continuing risk that meat could be brought into the UK either from third countries or via other Member States which do not comply with UK import conditions. Both MAFF and Customs officials take immediate action and as soon as such consignments are identified. Any meat identified as illegal is seized and destroyed.

<a name="10312w20.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> The EU is committed under the WTO Uruguay Round agreement to reducing expenditure on export refunds. This applies to export refunds for both agricultural raw materials and to processed agricultural products. These refunds are provided to compensate for the higher price of EU raw agricultural materials which is supported under the CAP and is higher than prices on the world market.
<P>

<a name="10312w20.html_para4">The UK's long-term aim is the reform of CAP to lower EU prices and to remove the need for export refunds--but this will take time. Meanwhile our priority is to ensure that WTO and CAP budgetary commitments are honoured with minimum damage to export competitiveness of UK industry. In consultation and with the support of our industry my Department has been active in developing these arrangements with the Commission.
<P>

<a name="10312w20.html_para5">A system of refund certificates was introduced last year with the agreement of member states to keep expenditure within WTO limits. Under this system there are six tranches available in which traders may obtain time- limited refund certificates. These tranches are intended to facilitate planned access to refunds by traders throughout the year. If demand for certificates exceeds funds allocated within a tranche, access to refunds is adjusted by means of a reducing coefficient. The intention at times of such shortfall is to provide increased flexibility to enable processors to access raw materials at (cheaper) prices from the world market.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he next expects to meet the chief constable of the Thames Valley to discuss Oxfordshire police numbers.  [151706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have discussions with the chief constable, Charles Pollard, from time to time, the latest of which took place this morning.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para0">The Thames Valley force is in a strong position in terms of the resources available to it. The force has been allocated a total of 325 crime fighting fund recruits. In the next financial year, the force will receive funding support of &#163;245.1 million, an increase of &#163;13.4 million or 5.8 per cent. over 2000-01. The force will also receive &#163;1.3 million from the rural policing fund. The national recruitment campaign should boost recruitment to the force and has already led to 437 expressions of interest being passed to Thames Valley.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para1">As a result of the range of measures we have taken, the chief constable has told me that he is "quietly hopeful" of the positive impact which they will have on police numbers in his force.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para2">Further to this, I am pleased to announce to the House today that I have accepted the police negotiating board's (PNB's) recommendation that there should be an additional annual allowance paid to officers in eight forces in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para3">In the five forces bordering the Metropolitan Police service--Thames Valley, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey--the allowance will be &#163;2,000 per annum. In the 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2001 : Column: 486W</I><P>
remaining three forces in the south east--Bedfordshire, Hampshire and Sussex--the annual allowance will be &#163;1,000. The new allowance will be payable with effect from 1 April 2001 and will be paid to officers and rejoiners appointed on or after 1 September 1994 who are not in receipt of housing allowance.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para4">This is a good deal for forces in the south-east. The new allowance should help them both to recruit more constables and to retain experienced officers, and ensure that officers in these forces can meet the higher costs associated with living in the region.
<P>

<a name="10312w21.html_para5">The allowance, combined with the unprecedented funding that we are now investing in the police service as a whole, will help ensure that the recent upturn in police numbers is sustained in Thames Valley, in the south-east more generally, and across the country.

We have already cut nearly 50 days from the 1996 average. This year we will be introducing new intensive supervision and surveillance programmes, targeting the 2,500 most persistent young offenders in the community each year. In the Criminal Justice and Police Bill, we have proposed extending the juvenile secure remand criteria to include those with a recent history of repeatedly committing imprisonable offences while on bail or in local authority accommodation. We have also proposed electronic monitoring to supplement supervised bail.

 Electoral registration officers have a duty to ensure that their registers are accurate.

I am confident that electoral registration officers carry out their duties thoroughly and diligently.

 It is vital that both the public and sentencers have confidence in non-custodial penalties. The following measures have been taken to achieve this aim:
<P>

<a name="10312w22.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we have made it clear to the Probation Service that it must raise its performance on enforcement of community sentences. Independent enforcement audits on cases commenced early and late in 1999 showed that the correct enforcement of breach procedures for community sentences improved significantly from 44 per cent. to 62 per cent. of cases being dealt with properly. This is welcome but there is still a long way to go. A third national audit is being conducted to keep up the pressure for further improvement;
<P>
<BR>
in April 2000, new national standards were introduced that tightened the standards for enforcement of community sentences so that offenders are returned to court no later than after second unacceptable failure to comply rather than, as previously, the third such failure;
<P>
<BR>
new enforcement measures contained in section 53 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 provide that where the court finds an offender in breach of his community order and takes the view that he is unlikely to go on successfully to complete the order it must impose a custodial penalty, other than in exceptional circumstances;
<P>
<BR>
we are developing a range of high-quality offending behaviour programmes in the community, and we have set up a new process of accreditation, involving an independent panel of experts to ensure that only the most effective and cost-effective, evidence-based programmes are rolled out across the country;
<P>
<BR>
from April, responsibility for the execution of warrants, including fine warrants, will pass from the police to magistrates courts. This will provide a clearer focus than the present arrangements and deliver better enforcement;
<P>
<BR>
we are conducting a study under the crime reduction programme to identify best practice for fine enforcement. At present, various strategies are being piloted in a number of courts, and the results will be assessed later this year;
<P>
<BR>
from April, measures in the Access to Justice Act 1999 will be implemented enabling, under certain circumstances, the Department of Social Security to provide the court with up to date address details of fine defaulters. This should reduce the number of fines that are currently written off;

 The Government believe that it would be premature to amend the misuse of drugs legislation to allow the prescribing of cannabis before the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicinal form of the drug has been scientifically established and a marketing authorisation issued by the Medicines Control Agency. This is the procedure that all prospective new medicines have to go through in order to protect public health.

 The Home Office certificate of identity (CID) is a travel document issued to foreign nationals, other than refugees, who are resident in the United Kingdom and cannot obtain a passport from their national authorities. This type of document is not issued under an international convention, but on a discretionary basis. Holders of CIDs who travel abroad are entitled to return to any United Kingdom port on a date within the CID's validity, and a visa is not required. Under the Immigration Rules, readmission after examination by an immigration officer is not an automatic entitlement but would normally be granted on the basis that residency here is to be resumed.
<P>

<a name="10312w23.html_para12">A number of European Union member states have declined to recognise the CID, so holders may find their ability to travel abroad restricted because visas are not always issued.

automatic right of return to the United Kingdom. This suggestion was not acceptable because it would place CID holders in a special position under the Immigration Rules compared to other categories of people who acquire residence status in the United Kingdom and wish to spend time abroad. The only residents of the United Kingdom who have an unconditional right to be readmitted at the ports after a stay abroad, no matter how long they have been away, are British citizens, and other Commonwealth citizens who have the right of abode here.

 The suspension of Dr. Dizaei is a matter for the Metropolitan police. It has been the longstanding practice of successive Governments neither to confirm nor deny whether a warrant authorising interception of communications exists, or has existed, in any specific case.

<a name="10312w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to ensure that chief executives of local authorities and local police divisional commanders in England and Wales have agreed timetables and arrangements for completing the new crime and disorder audit, with the full participation of their local partners and the community, to have a fresh local strategy in place by April 2002.  [151712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The timetable for completion of local audits is a matter for individual crime and disorder reduction partnerships. We have provided an extensive programme of support over the past two years to assist partnerships in the audit and strategy process. This has been complemented by the appointment of crime reduction directors in the regions of England and in Wales. They are working with partnerships to ensure that they have the necessary support to complete the audit process and develop local strategies by April 2002.

<P>
<a name="10312w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the reducing burglary initiative, which is part of the crime reduction programme, we have to date granted a total of around &#163;24 million to 246 projects in areas or communities with the highest burglary rates. These communities all have high rates of burglary, and many of them are also among the most deprived areas of the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w24.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish the review of extradition he announced on 2 March 2000.  [153494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10312w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today published a consultation document entitled "The Law on Extradition: A Review" and copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para15">I announced the review to Parliament in the course of my statement on Senator Pinochet on 2 March 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 571W. It is the outcome of an exercise started in 1997 to consider the legislative requirements of two European Union conventions on extradition. However, it developed into a much more extensive inquiry, following the adoption at Tampere in October 1999 of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions by the member states of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para16">The consultation document makes far-reaching proposals in relation to all aspects of current extradition law and practice. The greatest changes are proposed in respect of the United Kingdom's procedures for dealing with extradition requests received from member states of the European Union and Schengen states. Our present 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2001 : Column: 499W</I><P>
procedures for dealing with extradition requests from these states contain cumbersome controls and outdated requirements, some of them derived from 19th century extradition legislation. Such procedures are no longer necessary, nor do they provide an efficient means to deal with the growing difficulties caused by organised and international crime. For these extradition partners a simple backing of warrants procedure is proposed. This would replace the current multi-staged system in which all extradition requests are examined by both the Secretary of State and the courts, with a single, streamlined hearing before a district judge (Sheriff in Scotland). The documentation required to support an extradition request would also be significantly simplified, to reduce the current burdens placed on our European partners in their efforts to bring fugitives to justice. The proposals retain a statutory right of appeal in order to ensure that fugitives' rights are protected, but also propose that the grounds for appeal be tightened to eliminate time-consuming delays where fugitives appeal on grounds which are not relevant, or are more properly for consideration by the court of trial.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para17">The simplified requirements of a backing of warrants scheme would put the mutual recognition principle into practice in the field of extradition. Mutual recognition may be defined as the judicial decisions of one jurisdiction being recognised as valid in another, with the minimum of formality.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para18">The review recognises that while major reforms are required to our extradition procedures in respect of our closest neighbours, there is also a clear operational need to reform the procedures for dealing with requests from our extradition partners outside the European Union. Here a final decision in the case by the Secretary of State would be retained, but there would be a significant reduction in the present duplication of my role and that of the courts in deciding cases, with the aim of making extradition quicker and simpler, while protecting fugitives' fundamental human rights.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para19">The consultation period for the review proposals is three months. Copies are being made widely available to people and organisations with a professional interest in the subject. Members of the public will be able to apply for a copy from the Home Office, or obtain one from the Home Office website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ jcu/jcu.htm.
<P>

<a name="10312w24.html_para20">Many of the proposals in the document will require primary legislation to implement, which would take place when the legislative timetable allows.

<a name="10312w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> The new information technology (IT) projects that are being undertaken in this calendar year within my Department and its agencies (excluding non-departmental public bodies) are listed in the table. The information in the table covers those IT projects where <i>(a)</i> the cost or value of the project exceeds &#163;5 million or <i>(b)</i> the project is essential for the delivery of our core objectives or services. I also refer my right hon. Friend to the answer to him on the IT projects currently undertaken by my Department given on 6 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 130W, and the reply to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on 30 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 165W.
<P>

<a name="10312w25.html_para0">In addition to the projects listed in the table, the Fire Service College is undertaking a number of modernising projects in the current year addressing the shortcomings of the existing software applications. These projects are essential to the delivery of their business. They include an accounting system, library upgrade and a management system to upgrade the teaching facilities. The projects will be started and concluded in 2001 at an estimated total cost of &#163;155,000.
<P>

<a name="10312w25.html_para1">The Prison Service Quantum project is planning future work packages in the development of a strategy for an IT-based business change on a partnership basis. Future work packages are still in the planning stage although it is likely that the user specification for at least one of these will be developed in the forthcoming financial year.
<P>

<a name="10312w25.html_para2">The Forensic Science Service is considering replacing their current work management system with an enhanced system based upon an enterprise resource planning model. The project will need approval by the Forensic Science Service Board once contract negotiation on time scales and cost have been finalised.
<P>

<a name="10312w25.html_para3">The Home Office Sirius programme has identified a number of initial business change projects in the areas of finance, personnel and communications for the current year but these are presently at the scoping stage.

Elements include a productivity-related charge linked to the achievement of reductions in the unit cost of all IND's caseworking activities (not merely of asylum casework) and a fixed monthly charge for a range of technical services specified in the contract. By the end of the current financial year, we would expect to have paid SBS about &#163;25 million in total since the contract began in 1996. The basis of future payments is under discussion with SBS following the joint decision to discontinue the development of the full casework application.
