<P>
<P>
<a name="01207w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Children (Leaving Care) Act received Royal Assent on 30 November. Local authorities will need sufficient time to prepare thoroughly for implementation once the regulations and guidance are published. Following representations from local government, the Action on Aftercare Consortium (AOAC), Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), Local Government Association and others, we have therefore decided that the legislation will take effect from October 2001, to allow sufficient time for these processes. In the meantime, we shall continue to use the Quality Protects programme and the Quality Protects Special Grant to encourage and finance local authorities' work to bring their local policies into line with the Act and to put systems in place to be ready for full implementation. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly be announcing revised details of Revenue Support Grant allocations for 2001-02.

<a name="01207w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the publication today of the Green Paper "Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice". I have placed a copy of the Green Paper in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para2">This Green Paper is the result of extensive discussions with parents, employers and their representatives. It marks an important stage in the most comprehensive review of work and parents ever undertaken by a Government in Britain.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para3">The Green Paper sets out a number of options on the key issues and invites people to indicate which options are of greatest priority to them and will best balance the needs of working parents and business. The Government will then decide how best to proceed.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para4">This is the first step towards a future where being a good parent and a good employee are not in conflict. Supporting parents to balance family life and work commitments enable parents to make a full contribution to the competitiveness and productivity of our economy. It also helps to ensure that British business is able to recruit and retain skilled employees while maintaining the flexibility essential to compete globally.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para5">This document looks at how choice for both parents and employers might be achieved. This is an opportunity to shape a new deal to support parents and business. The closing date for comments is 7 March 2001.

 The National Measurement System (NMS) has a critical role in the UK's national industrial competitiveness. The NMS is underpinned by research programmes funded by my Department. We commissioned an independent review which concluded that the NMS research programme directly affects some 0.8 per cent. (&#163;5 billion a year) of UK Gross Domestic Product by supporting the introduction of new measurement standards and methods. In the light of the conclusions of that review we have decided that the purpose of my Department's investment in measurement standards should be:
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the needs of users in industry and the community by driving up measurement standards while continuing to work at the leading edge of measurement research.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01207w01.html_para7">There is however, more we can do to ensure that we get the best value from public expenditure in this area and we are implementing a plan of action to improve the value that investment in NMS delivers to the economy. The principal features of the action plan are to:
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>introduce new NMS research programmes to meet the needs of emerging technologies like Biotechnology and technological developments such as internet Calibration. There will also be a new programme to improve the dissemination and exploitation of NMS results;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01207w01.html_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>improve the diffusion of NMS results by direct involvement of industry when NMS programmes are being drawn up and by pursuing more industrial partnership;

<a name="01207w01.html_para13">Detailed preparation of the new programmes is now under way. Technical work is scheduled to start in April 2001. In addition my Department has recently awarded contracts worth a total of &#163;38 million for research programmes on Analytical Measurement, Time & Frequency and Electrical Measurement.

 Housing capital allocations for 2001-02 have now been finalised and sent to local authorities. The total of these allocations and the resources for capital works on the council housing stock to be distributed through the new Major Repairs Allowance amount to around &#163;2.6 billion, an increase of about a quarter on the current year. I am arranging for a table giving details of authorities' allocations to be placed in

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to issue statutory guidance to local authorities on community strategies.  [141513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01207w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000 requires local authorities to prepare a community strategy to improve the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK. The Government issued draft guidance for English local authorities for consultation in June and received nearly 350 responses from a wide range of local authorities, public sector organisations, voluntary and community sector groups, businesses and private individuals. We are publishing today statutory guidance on preparing community strategies, updated in the light of this consultation and recent policy developments; copies are being sent to all local authorities in England.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para15">The guidance makes clear that community strategies should be prepared and implemented in partnership with other local stakeholders, and that partnerships should actively engage the participation of local people in the process. This guidance is supported by all the main policy departments who sponsor or regulate other organisations that we hope will work with councils in local strategic partnerships to prepare community strategies.
<P>

<a name="01207w01.html_para16">At the same time, we are issuing for consultation draft guidance for local authorities in England on their new power in section 2 of the 2000 Act to promote or improve economic, social and environmental well-being. The consultation period will last until 9 February 2001. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Electronic copies, together with a document setting out the Government's analysis of the consultation on the community strategies guidance and our response to the key points made, will also be available on my Department's website.

 The Dog Identification Group Report was submitted to me in September. After careful consideration, and discussions with my colleagues in the devolved Administrations, and in other Government Departments which also have responsibilities for dogs, I have decided to put the DIG recommendations out to consultation so that all those with an interest in dogs can make their views known. The Group has recommended a voluntary scheme for the permanent identification of dogs by either microchip or tattoo. The Report will be published tomorrow and copies will be laid in the Libraries of both Houses. The Report will also be put on the DETR website. The consultation will run until 31 March 2001.

<P>

 As my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and Equal Opportunities announced on 20 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 39W, the Government hope to be in a position to publish a formal response to the DRTF report as a whole around the end of February 2001. My Department has been considering the proposals as they relate to transport.
<P>

<a name="01207w02.html_para0">The Government have already made significant progress in implementing the transport provisions of the DDA. This has been achieved largely as a result of wide discussions with the transport industries and disability organisations. This process of consultation has resulted in regulations setting standards of access for rail vehicles and regulations applying similar standards to buses and coaches. I also recently laid before the House regulations which will place taxi drivers under a duty to carry guide, hearing and other assistance dogs.
<P>

<a name="01207w02.html_para1">I have asked my officials, building on the work that has already been undertaken, to discuss the DRTF recommendations widely with industry and with disability organisations. Our goal will be to find ways in which we can take forward the recommendations to deliver further improvements in access and mobility to disabled people without compromising the viability of industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what amendment has been made to the exemption order for the fleet of new Class 460 trains introduced into service by Gatwick Express in respect of any of the provisions of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [141621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01207w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have received a further application from Gatwick Express relating to their Class 460 trains. This seeks to amend the original Order by extending existing exemptions. The exemptions have been discussed with our statutory advisers the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. An exemption Order relating to the exemption of these trains has been laid in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="01207w02.html_para2">The exemptions will not prevent disabled people from using the new trains. Indeed, we believe that their introduction will make a significant contribution to improving mobility opportunities for disabled people.

<P>
<a name="01207w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 On 4 December, I was able to announce that the Outgoers element of the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme was open for applications. This announcement delivers a further component of the Government's Agricultural Strategy. It was particularly pleasing to announce the opening of phase one of a scheme that will make a significant amount of money available to the UK pig industry; a sector that has suffered terribly over the past two years. While market conditions have improved recently, the scale of the debt incurred over those difficult times continues to be a major restraint on the industry's ability to prepare itself for the future. The Government's restructuring scheme will go some way towards remedying that situation.
<P>

<a name="01207w02.html_para3">The European Commission has confirmed that it is content with the Outgoers part of the restructuring scheme. As promised, this first phase was opened as soon as possible after receiving that confirmation. I am confident that formal clearance from the Commission for both phases of the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme will be obtained later this month.
<P>

<a name="01207w02.html_para4">The aim of Outgoers is to reduce pig breeding capacity in the UK by 16 per cent. compared to what was available in June 1998 in order to allow the British pig industry to begin its necessary restructuring. Discussions with the UK
