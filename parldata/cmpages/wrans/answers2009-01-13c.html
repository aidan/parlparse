<i> [holding answer 15 December 2008]:</i> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) remains engaged on drugs and crime work, even though the policy lead passed to Home Office as from 1 April 2008. In London, we give policy advice to operational agencies such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and UK Border Agency (UKBA) and task our global network to help deliver the Government's objectives.

This involves close co-operation with Home Office, SOCA, UKBA, Metropolitan Police Service, Crown Prosecution Service and HM Revenue and Customs to define the threat from drugs and crime to the UK and decide how/where best to tackle it overseas.</p>

 The meeting between the PM and the hon. Member for Belfast North and others on 10 December provided an opportunity for discussion on this issue. The PM is acutely aware of the sensitivities and frustrations of this issue, as he expressed during this meeting. I would emphasise that the Government does not condone in any way Libya's past actions and the victims of IRA atrocities have our whole hearted sympathy. We have tested the Libyan position on IRA compensation on a number of occasions and the US raised it on our behalf in August this year. Each time the Libyans have reiterated that they consider the matter closed. As the PM stated on 10 December, we will not therefore seek to negotiate a bilateral settlement on this issue with Libya. However, we will monitor the position of Libya in relation to this  <br>

 Fluctuations in the value of sterling have had a significant effect over the last six months on a range of defence equipment acquisition projects, though the precise aggregate financial impact of these changes over that period could be provided only at disproportionate cost, given that foreign exchange is only one of a number of factors leading to cost variations in projects. Across 2008-09 as a whole, however, the Defence Equipment and Support organisation estimates a pressure of some &#163;130 million from foreign exchange movements.

 Since the main benefits of Departmental investment in the form of defence capability are not capable of being expressed in monetary terms, the overwhelming majority of MOD investment appraisals use a cost effectiveness approach.

 1. DWP is unable to report precise part year data for the current financial year because its computer system is configured to calculate sickness absence levels using a rolling 12 months&#146; data. The figures for 2008-09 are therefore based on data from December 2007 (rather than April 2008) to November 2008 inclusive. November 2008 is the latest month for which figures are available.<br>
 2. Up to 2006-07, average absence levels per staff year were reported annually by the Cabinet Office. The average figures for 2006-07 derive from the report &#147;Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service 2006-07&#148;. All other data in the tables, including those for working days lost, reflects information currently held on DWP's internal personnel computer system.<br>
 3. The averages shown are the average per full-time staff year, rather than per employee, to take account of part-time workers.<br>
 4. Any difference between the sum of the agency figures and the total for DWP is due to rounding.<br>

 Information on the value of Section 106 moneys not spent on capital programmes by each local authority is not collected centrally. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government has produced research reports into the value of planning obligations in England for 2003-04 and 2005-06 based on a sample of authorities across the country. These reports are available on the Department's website. New research covering 2007-08 has been commissioned and will be published in the summer.</p>

The shortfall would have been due to the fact that not all of the permissions to which the agreements were attached would be implemented and some others would be renegotiated.

 While the terms of commercial leases, including rents, are set by agreement between landlords and tenants, Government are concerned that lease terms should not constrain flexibility in the commercial property market. In 2007, at our request, the property industry introduced a revised stronger code of practice which, among other matters, makes recommendations to landlords about the arrangements for commercial rent reviews. This &#147;Code for Leasing Business Premises in England and Wales 2007&#148;, is voluntary. However, Government are monitoring the use and impact of the code, and will evaluate the outcome to see if it has made a difference to industry practice. Government remain committed to lease reform and has not ruled out legislation as an option.</p>

It is important that we are clear that the headline figure is the total of the counts undertaken during the year. We will no longer ask local authorities that do not count to provide an annual estimate in their annual housing statistics return.</p>

 Local authorities are responsible for notifying Ofsted of serious incidents involving children. This includes cases which then become the subject of a serious case review (SCR). When a review is complete the report is then evaluated by Ofsted. DCSF Children and Learners teams in the regional government offices have a support and challenge role in relation to SCRs, in particular with respect to the implementation by Local Safeguarding Children Boards and local agencies of recommendations in individual reports. They also provide briefing to officials in the DCSF, to enable them to keep Ministers informed of overall progress. But Ministers are not involved in the SCR process and do not see draft SCR reports or take any decisions until that process is complete and the executive summary is made public. Ministers have vested in them a range of statutory powers in relation to local authorities, including intervention powers, and it is important that they allow the SCR process to take its course.</p>

 Free child care for training and learning for work, will be delivered by the Learning and Skills Council, rather than by local authorities.

Report was set out in &#147;Keeping Children Safe&#148; which was published in 2003, alongside the Green Paper &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_629"><a name="90113w0022.htm_para0"><a name="09011492001290">The actions the Government committed to undertaking in response to Lord Laming&#146;s recommendations have been carried out or are in progress; the one exception is the revision of guidance on the Children Act 1989. Volume 1, on Court Orders, has been revised and published, and many of the key messages which &#147;Keeping Children Safe&#148; said were to be incorporated in the revised Children Act 1989 guidance have been incorporated into other guidance documents and standards. We plan to revise further volumes of the 1989 guidance next year, taking into account commitments announced in Care Matters: Time for Change, legislative changes through the Children and Young Persons Act 2008, and proposed revisions to the National Minimum Standards for children&#146;s social care.</p>

 The education maintenance allowance (EMA) was introduced to incentivise more 16 to 19-year-olds from low income households to participate in post-16 learning. It was subject to comprehensive evaluation during pilots from 1999 through to national roll out from 2004. We have evidence on the impact these pilots had on both participation in full-time education and attainment by age 18.</p>

 Education maintenance allowance (EMA) is designed to help young people from low-income households to stay-on in education.

From September 2008 we have amended the criteria for payment of bonuses and weekly payments to include behaviour, punctuality, completing coursework on time and achievement of agreed learning goals.

 The importance of good quality personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education has never been greater. PSHE education has a major contribution to make to young people&#146;s personal development and well-being. Therefore, on 23 October we announced our intention to make PSHE education statutory and launched an independent review to investigate how to achieve this in an effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, head teacher at Morpeth School in Tower Hamlets, has been asked to lead the review and will report to Ministers with recommendations in April 2009.</p>

To address this, &#163;2 million of funding is available each year to train teachers and professionals who deliver PSHE education in schools. We will encourage schools to use INSET to improve staff awareness on the duty to promote well-being and the importance of high quality PSHE education in particular. We are also working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools to develop a specialist route through initial teacher training.</p>

The Self-Harm Reduction programme, (SHaRP), aims to aid the women in developing coping strategies, problem-solving techniques, communication and goal-setting skills to help to control their self-harming behaviour. The programme takes place over 14 group sessions during a period of three weeks; and there are also opportunities for one-to-one sessions twice weekly by appointment. Once the initial three-week programme is completed, there is a six week gap before the women are assessed again by SHaRP staff. The SHaRP programme started in April 2008 for an initial 12 month period, with a view to extend. However it will be fully evaluated at the end of this initial period. In addition the three day SAFE programme, (whose goal is to reduce self harm), has also been running at Bronzefield since 2004 and is currently being evaluated by a forensic psychologist from NOMS.</p>

Though each review had a different focus, together they provide a useful package of learning material upon which local partners can draw and which will inform the Government&#146;s approach to Prevent.</p>

We published &#147;Delivering Prevent&#151;Responding to Learning&#148; on 10 December, which sets out the key strands of learning from the reviews and work already underway to address these key themes. We will continue to develop our response to the reviews throughout the year.</p>

 Many different parts of the Home Office work to tackle crimes that affect business, such as fraud, e-crime, retail theft, criminal damage and alcohol-related crime. Some of these issues affect both businesses and general members of the public and so officials in these teams cannot be said to be working exclusively on business crime, although they will be contributing directly to its reduction. A business crime team did work exclusively on some very specific aspects of business crime, mainly shop theft. This work is now to be included in a new volume crime team in the Department. The scope of this new team will be broader than that of the business crime team, and include crimes such as burglary and vehicle crime which also affect businesses. This will enable a fuller and more efficient response to volume crimes committed against business to be developed. The volume crime team will also support a more responsive approach, being able to focus more flexibly on critical volume crime issues, including those affecting business, as and when necessary.</p>

So far in 2008 returns by police forces indicate that 138,373 vehicles have been seized.
