Challenger 2 Main Battle Tanks is 386, with holdings split between units, the British Army Training Unit Suffield, the Army Training and Recruiting Agency, trials and development, in-depth repair and storage. Units do not normally hold all 58 tanks for which they are established on a day to day basis. More typically the six armoured regiments would hold 44 tanks each.

<P>
<a name="21205w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In line with the practice for all major items of equipment, Post Design Service enabling arrangements have been placed with the Design Authority (DA) (now Alvis Vickers Ltd.) since Challenger 2 entered service. In addition to maintaining the design standard, these agreements allow modifications, ranging from minor adjustments of detailed build standard to significant changes to operational capability, to be considered. This enables specific contracts to be placed to undertake any necessary modification work. In line with this approach, a number of contracts have been placed recently in respect of modifications to Challenger 2 to improve its operation in desert conditions.

 In order to meet our shipping needs in any future emergency, we would plan to charter civil shipping on the world-wide market to augment the capacity that our own ships give us. Where this is not possible, we would seek to use, where appropriate, either alternative types of ships or transport resources of allied or friendly nations or, as a last resort and in

In concert with the Department of Transport, we continue to keep the situation under close scrutiny.

 Bowman will provide a tactical, secure, voice and data communications system for all three Services in support of land and littoral operations from 2004, in place of the Clansman family of radios. Bowman is expected to continue in service for over 20 years.

<a name="21205w02.html_para0">The Personal Role Radio was formally accepted into service in January 2002, two months earlier than forecast and within planned cost. This is a good example of Smart Acquisition and, as reported by the National Audit Office, the Royal Marines who used it on Exercise Saif Sareea II were delighted with its performance. It has also been used successfully in Afghanistan.

<a name="21205w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not routinely scrutinise the employment practices of companies tendering for MOD contracts, unless the transfer of public sector, or ex-public sector, employees out of the public sector under the Transfer of Undertaking (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) Regulations is likely to be involved. In these cases, the MOD will consider contractors' track records on previous TUPE transfers and employment relations issues as part of the general evaluation of proposals for managing staff issues, and within the framework of existing EU regulations.

 NATO and Russia have for some time sought to enhance their relationship, in recognition of their mutual security interests.

Encouraging progress has already been made in its first six months and it is hoped that NATO and Russia can improve and expand this level of co-operation in 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the warship building industry in the UK; and what is being done to encourage competition.  [84837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w03.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is undertaking the largest programme of new warship building for many years. This programme will create or secure several thousand jobs in United Kingdom shipyards and ancillary industries throughout the country. The MOD recognises the considerable challenge for UK shipbuilders to maintain capacity and develop the skills required for the future warship building programme, against the background of a short term dip in the volume of work and an ageing workforce. The MOD will continue to work closely with the industry but it is primarily for the shipbuilders themselves to manage any short term workload gap. The MOD order book alone cannot be expected to sustain the industry.
<P>

<a name="21205w03.html_para4">Competition remains the bedrock of the MOD's procurement policy and has been the keystone of our strategy for warship procurement. The present competition for the future aircraft carrier is an example of this. Maintaining acompetitive environment should also be helped by the decision to share work on the Type 45 destroyer between BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thorny croft, which has the advantage of keeping both shipbuilders involved in the Type 45 programme and potentially available to compete for future MOD and export programmes.
<P>

<a name="21205w03.html_para5">The MOD, together with industry, will continue to review ways of making UK warship building more competitive and innovative, with the aim of enabling the shipbuilders to widen their customer base and identify other opportunities, for warship export orders in particular.

<a name="21205w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the maximum amount is that the abolition of 50 per cent. discount council tax on <i>(a)</i> second and <i>(b)</i> empty homes will raise; what proportion (i) billing and (ii) precepting authorities will be able to retain; how a distinction between empty and abandoned homes will be made; and what the estimated compliance costs are of these changes.  [844141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) announced on 19 November 2002 that the Government intend to allow English local authorities discretion to reduce council tax discounts on second homes from 50 per cent. to a minimum of 10 per cent. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has decided not to remove the discount completely because owners need an incentive to inform the local authority that properties are second homes. Without such information, it would not be possible to identify the extra revenue which could be raised from changing the discount. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also announced that we intend to allow English local authorities to reduce or remove completely the current 50 per cent. council tax discounts on long-term empty dwellings. In either case, the billing authority may determine to change the discount in all or part of its area.
<P>

<a name="21205w04.html_para0">Authorities where the second homes discount has been reduced will benefit from any additional council tax raised: we do not propose to reduce their revenue support grant to take account of their greater tax raising ability. If all authorities reduced the second home discounts to 10 per cent., this could potentially raise around &pound;65 million. If all authorities removed the empty home discounts completely, this could raise a further &pound;160 million.
<P>

<a name="21205w04.html_para1">The benefit of the additional revenue resulting from a reduction in the second homes discount would be shared with the major precepting authorities. The proportions which would go to billing authorities and to major precepting authorities will vary from location to location, depending on the proportion of the council tax bill in an area which goes to major precepting authorities, and different authorities' decisions about how the discount should be applied. The compliance costs will depend on how individual billing authorities decide to change the discounts.

<P>
<a name="21205w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department is not currently undertaking research on this subject. Previous research has shown that there are a number of positive benefits for primary school pupils in mixed-age classes. These include the opportunity to form wider friendships and for younger pupils to learn from their contemporaries, more individualised teaching, and the opportunity for pupils with differing ability to provide intellectual stimulation for each other. The research does not find positive effects for attainment. However, there appears to be no negative impact on pupil attainment of what is known as vertical grouping. Teachers tend to be more negative about mixed-age classes, believing them to create more work and complicate classroom management.

<i> [holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> Furazolidone is included in Annex IV of Council Directive 2377/90EC, so its administration to food-producing animals is banned, both in the UK, and in the European Community. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) run two surveillance schemes for residues of veterinary medicines and banned substances in UK-produced and imported produce. These are overseen by the independent Veterinary Residues Committee (VRC).
<P>

<a name="21205w06.html_para5">In 2001, the VMD analysed 453 samples of bovine, pig and sheep kidney; and 58 samples of eggs for furazolidone under their statutory surveillance programme for UK produce. A further 86 samples of animal feed were analysed for nitrofurans. All samples were free of detectable residues of these compounds.

 Livestock auction markets have an important role in the marketing of farm animals between the various stages of production. However, markets do pose a risk of disease spread through mixing and dispersal of animals during market operations. The Department has sought to mitigate this risk through rules on bio-security at markets, and controls over the movement of animals to and from market premises.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> A badger culling field trial is being carried out as part of DEFRA's extensive bovine tuberculosis (TB) research programme. The trial was designed by the Independent Scientific Group for Cattle TB (ISG) to evaluate what role, if any, badgers play in the transmission of bovine TB to cattle and whether badger culling is an effective or sustainable bovine TB control mechanism. It will provide epidemiological data on the occurrence and prevalence of TB in badgers, its relationship to population density and social group size and the spatial relationship between TB-infected badgers and TB breakdowns in cattle herds.

<P>
<a name="21205w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK is a member, through the EU, of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO), a United Nations body established to, among other things, Xachieve a reasonable balance between world supply and demand on a basis which will assure adequate supplies of coffee at fair prices to consumers and markets for coffee at remunerative prices to producers . . . to facilitate the expansion and transparency of international trade in coffee".
<P>

<a name="21205w07.html_para0">A major plank of the organisation's current activity is a Coffee Quality Improvement Programme. Introduced on 1 October 2002, it requires exports of unprocessed coffee from member countries to comply with minimum quality standards. This should have a positive effect upon supply and demand and, in turn, producer prices. Discussions are also under way within the organisation about how exports of processed coffee should be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="21205w07.html_para1">The Government are also helping coffee growers to diversify, through our development programme, and promoting foreign investment and good regulatory frameworks in coffee-growing countries.
<P>

<a name="21205w07.html_para2">In a wider context, on the WTO front, we are committed to further liberalisation of markets, including significant improvements in market access and special and differential treatment for developing countries. This should also benefit coffee growers.

 The Secretary of State has discussed several variations to energy efficiency targets resulting from corrections to baseline data with sector associations.

The text of the variation has not yet been agreed. The Secretary of State has yet to receive information from the sector associations about the performance of the facilities covered by the agreements during the first target period. Accordingly the Secretary of State is not yet in a position to ascertain whether there has been any failure to meet such targets.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The Xother types" category includes some holdings which are not currently undertaking any agricultural activity.<P>

2. Farm type is designated by the predominant activity on the holding. This is calculated using the Standard Gross Margin (SGM). The total SGM for each farm is calculated by multiplying its crop areas and livestock numbers by the appropriate SGM coefficients and then summing the result for all enterprises on the farm. For example, if more than two thirds of a holding's total SGM is derived from cereals and other crops generally found in cereal rotations (eg oilseeds, peas and beans harvested dry and land set-aside) the holding will be put in the cereals farm type category.<P>

 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which regulates trade in endangered species of animals and plants, is strictly implemented in the UK under both European and National legislation. Medicines derived from species listed in the Appendices to the Convention need an import permit issued by my Department before they can enter the country. Permits will not normally be issued for products containing the most endangered species, which are listed on the Convention's Appendix I. As a result any products that are derived from, or even claim to be derived from, Appendix I specimens taken from the wild will not normally be allowed on sale in the UK.
<P>

<a name="21205w07.html_para4">CITES is actively enforced in the UK by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and the Police who work together with my Department, other Government Departments and certain non-governmental organisations in the Government's Partnership for Action against Wildlife Crime. My Department produces general guidance on the Convention and maintains a dedicated website on CITES implementation in the UK. We have also worked with the enforcement agencies to produce specialist material including leaflets, posters and videos aimed directly at Britain's Chinese speaking community. We are also currently funding, with the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), research into the use of alternatives to replace certain endangered species contained in traditional medicines.

 On 21 September 2000 the European Commission was notified of limited outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in sixteen provinces of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The South African authorities took effective action by imposing their own export ban on meat from the infected areas. At the time the Government was content with this situation as meat from the area could not be exported.
<P>

<a name="21205w08.html_para2">On 17 November the Commission amended Community legislation to formally prohibit the import of fresh meat from the affected areas. This reflected the

<P>

<a name="21205w08.html_para3">On 20 December 2000 the Commission reported that there had been no change in the disease situation.

A note explaining the situation was sent to trade interests on 8 January, as was a letter to all Border Inspection Posts at ports and airports. Scotland and Northern Ireland took similar action shortly afterwards.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2002]:</i> The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) is obliged under the Veterinary Surgeons and Veterinary Practitioners Registration Regulations to maintain and publish a register of all veterinary surgeons eligible to practise in the UK. However, under the Regulations, the RCVS only have jurisdiction over individual registered veterinary surgeons. Should the RCVS be informed of, or identify, individuals practising while unregistered it is a matter for the police or local trading standards agencies to prosecute under Section 19 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966.
<P>

<a name="21205w08.html_para10">The regulations do not require or give the RCVS powers to compel members to provide practice details, although many do so on a voluntary basis. This information is maintained on a database and is published on the RCVS website under 'Find-a-Vet'. This is annually printed as a publication, Xthe Directory of Veterinary Practices" and is available to the public. The Directory and 'Find-a-Vet' link individual veterinary surgeons to practices and provide comprehensive information on the species they treat and any specialist services they offer.
<P>

<a name="21205w08.html_para11">The RCVS continually monitors various advertising and other information media to identify practices not listed in the Directory. Once identified they are contacted and asked if they wish to be listed.

 The DRC is a participant in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the evidential basis is for his statement on page 7 of the unnumbered document Saddam Hussein: Crimes and Human Rights Abuses of the allegation relating to caning of members of the national football team on the feet.  [85560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In our document XSaddam Hussein: crimes and human rights abuses" we report the allegation that Udayy Hussein ordered the national football team to be caned on the soles of their feet after losing a World Cup qualifying match. The Foreign Office has had direct confirmation from Abbas al-Janabi, Press Secretary to Udayy Hussein at the time of the atrocity, that the incident occurred. An Iraqi national footballer, Sharar Haydar Mohamad al Hadithi, not involved in this match, is reported as saying that the caning did take place. Al Hadithi is also reported to have said that he was repeatedly caned on the soles of the feet, dragged through a pit of gravel and ordered to jump into a sewage pit to ensure the wounds were infected after having lost a match in 1994. These incidents conform with other stories suggesting a pattern of abusive behaviour by Udayy towards Iraqi sports people, for example the account of an Iraqi wrestler, Amra Haliff, in a Channel Four Despatches programme, broadcast on 17 November.
<P>

<a name="21205w10.html_para3">In 1997 FIFA sent officials to Iraq to investigate these allegations. Although Iraq was cleared, individuals who later fled Iraq, such as those mentioned above, confirmed that the allegations were true.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The decree in 1994 called for the amputation of the outer part of the ear for those deserting the army of failing to join military service. The Iraqi regime itself acknowledges that it has pursued a policy of amputating ears. The Justice Minister, Shabib al-Maliki, said in an interview with Reuters on 18 January 1996 that a few criminals had had their ears amputated. The law was repealed at about that time. We do not have specific names. I will write to my hon. Friend further on this issue.

 <i>[holding answers 28 November and 4 December 2002]: </i>The maximum cost that social services would face in payments to hospitals under the Community Care (Delayed Discharges, etc) Bill would be &pound;100 million in any one year. That is on the assumption that councils make no progress at all beyond the targets they have already set themselves to reduce the levels of delayed discharges from hospitals by March 2003. It pre-supposes that social services do not use the annual increase in resources to put in place new services to help reduce delayed discharges from hospitals still further and that none of the &pound;1 billion&#151;most of which is earmarked&#151;for elderly care services actually gets spent on building up capacity in elderly care services. Given these assumptions, the Government does not believe that social services will have to pay &pound;100 million to the health service.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para6">Nevertheless, for each of the next three full years, an extra &pound;100 million&#151;on top of the resources already made available&#151;will be transferred from the national health service budget to social services for each full year in which the scheme operates. This will provide a positive incentive to make the system work. This will enable individual councils to gain from the system, provided that they make available the community services needed to reduce delayed discharges from hospitals. The fundamental objection to the Bill, particularly from local government interests during consultation, was that social services were being given a new responsibility without adequate resources. These resources address that.

 Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements came into force on 12 July 2002. The Food Standards Agency is not proposing any amendments to the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para8">In the ongoing negotiations on the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products our priorities will be to press for greater scope to take account of valid evidence of traditional use from outside the European Union, for national flexibility to extend simplified registration to at least some categories of non herbal traditional medicines and for the Directive to cover traditional herbal remedies with added nutrients. 



<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2002 : Column 962W</I><P>
The latter point might be covered by either specific amendment or through reasonable interpretation of the current text.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para9">We support the principle of amendments which would: reduce the required period of usage within the European Union, permit the inclusion of nutrients with traditional herbal remedies; strengthen the role of the proposed Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products; set a deadline of three years after the Directive coming into force for the completion of the proposed review of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para10">We intend to oppose the principle of automatic recognition of registrations or authorisations previously granted to a product in other member states since we believe this could serve to reduce flexibility available to member states; also, historical differences in the way member states have regulated similar products would be likely to create difficulties for a member state seeking to follow a consistent interpretation of the distinction between well established use, for the purposes of a marketing authorisation, and traditional use. We will oppose, on public health grounds, the principle of allowing new combinations of active medicinal ingredients without evidence of traditional use of that combination, although we will continue to look for ways during negotiations of maximising the possibilities for demonstrating traditional use of herbal combinations.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para11">We will oppose the principle of restricting the Directive to ingredients for which there is well documented experimental and clinical evidence of efficacy, as this would run counter to the principle of accepting evidence of traditional usage in place of the normal requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of medicines and could erect an additional regulatory hurdle.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para12">We will consider further the specific proposal to amend the definition of herbal medicinal product in relation to the extent of pharmacological activity. As drafted this could rule out a number of products from achieving registration, in particular where medicines are regarded as medicinal by virtue of their presentation. Also we have doubts about the advisability of amending the definition of a medicinal product in relation to herbal medicines only, when issues relating to levels of pharmacological activity also affect other categories of medicine. However, this regulatory area is a complex one and we will continue to be open to dialogue on this issue, whether in domestic discussions with the herbal sector or European negotiations.
<P>

<a name="21205w11.html_para13">We will consider further the principle of removing the labelling and advertising requirement to indicate that efficacy of traditional use product is not clinically proven. The potential advantages of a more positive presentation of products registered under the proposed traditional use scheme need to be weighed against the possible risk of weakening the incentive for companies to research the efficacy of herbal medicines.

 Many medicines contain plant ingredients or have been derived from plant sources.

The MCA is internationally recognised for its regulatory expertise and we are satisfied that the Agency should continue to regulate herbal medicines.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]</i>: The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has received a range of representations including parliamentary questions, letters from hon. and right hon. Members, patients and health care professionals about the safety of Seroxat.
<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para3">Seroxat (paroxetine) is a member of a group of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Before a product is granted a licence for use in the United Kingdom, satisfactory evidence of safety, quality and efficacy is required. After licensing, the safety of all medicines including SSRIs is continually monitored by the MCA and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and any new evidence which emerges is carefully reviewed.
<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para4">The MCA and the CSM carried out a major review of all side effects associated with SSRIs, which was completed in 2000 and resulted in product information for all SSRIs including Seroxat being updated and harmonised to reflect the common safety profiles of these medicines. An article in Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance in 2000 informed prescribers about this review and reminded them about the risk of withdrawal reactions.
<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para5">Withdrawal reactions are an important and well-recognised side effect of Seroxat and also occur with the other SSRIs. The MCA/CSM warned prescribers about the possibility of withdrawal reactions associated with Seroxat via an article in the bulletin Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance in 1993. The CSM re-reviewed the issue of withdrawal reactions and possible dependence with Seroxat and the other SSRIs in 1998&#150;99. From detailed review of all available data, which included spontaneous reports, published literature, clinical trials and usage data, the CSM concluded that all SSRIs may be associated with withdrawal reactions on stopping but on current evidence they are not associated with dependence. As a result of this review product information for all SSRIs was updated in relation to withdrawal reactions. This issue was also reviewed at a European level by the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) which reached similar conclusions.




<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2002 : Column 968W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para6">The product information for Seroxat which includes the summary of product characteristics for prescribers and the patient information leaflet contains details of side effects and warnings about withdrawal reactions. Doctors are advised to consider gradual tapering of dose when Seroxat is discontinued rather than abruptly stopping to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para7">The MCA/CSM is currently undertaking an intensive review of the safety of SSRIs, and in particular withdrawal reactions with Seroxat. When this is complete, any new advice will be communicated to prescribers and patients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w13.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Whether the location of an accommodation centre prevents a need of its residents from being met is a matter that can only be considered and assessed by the monitor once the accommodation centre is up and running. The monitor will not be involved in the selection of sites and there is no requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the monitor prior to establishing an accommodation centre. Decisions on the location of accommodation centres will be taken by the Secretary of State, subject to the planning process.
<P>

<a name="21205w13.html_para8">Part 2 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 makes provisions regarding accommodation centres. Under section 34, the monitor is required to monitor the operation of Part 2 of the Act, and in particular, to consider:

If the monitor raised concerns with the Secretary of State, either in a formal report or before making his formal report, we would be able to consider whether those concerns required changes to be made.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what rights district councils have to stop asylum seekers coming into an area.  [84651]

<a name="21205w14.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is Government policy that asylum seekers who request that accommodation be provided as part of an application for support are dispersed away from London and the south-east. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS), with the approval of Ministers of the day, designated certain areas (referred to by NASS as Xcluster areas") as suitable for the dispersal of asylum seekers. Prior to designation NASS consulted each regional consortium (made up of all local authorities and county councils within that region) to seek their views on areas proposed for designation. District councils have no right to either stop NASS procuring accommodation for asylum seekers or to prevent asylum seekers being moved into NASS accommodation in their area.
<P>

<a name="21205w14.html_para0">Asylum seekers not requiring accommodation from NASS can live wherever they choose. Local councils have no duty to provide housing to asylum seekers if their need for this arises solely as a result of destitution.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers he has to compel a county council to accept asylum seekers.  [85063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w14.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under section 101 of the Immigration and asylum Act 1999 we can, by order designate an area as a reception zone. No such orders have been made. We have established dispersal areas for asylum seekers requiring accommodation. A county council has no power to prevent asylum seekers being housed in accommodation provided to the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) for that purpose by an accommodation provider in an area designated by NASS as suitable for the housing of asylum seekers supported by NASS.

 Folkestone is not used by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) as a dispersal area for asylum seekers requiring accommodation.

<a name="21205w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Howard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department why he proposes to locate a 24-hour reporting centre for asylum seekers in Folkestone.  [85563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w14.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The setting up of regional asylum reporting centres is part of the Government's strategy to introduce a more rigorous control into the asylum process and bring about improved contact with asylum seekers while their claims are under consideration. The aim is to achieve stronger management of the asylum process, while affording asylum seekers opportunities to monitor the progress of their cases.
<P>

<a name="21205w14.html_para1">Maintaining contact with asylum seekers while their claims are considered is essential. It is in the interests of all parties&#151;the applicant, the local community and central and local Government&#151;that asylum applications are managed quickly and efficiently as part of a well managed asylum system.
<P>

<a name="21205w14.html_para2">Reporting centres will form an important part of this process, providing a well managed approach to the handling of asylum seeker's applications; from arrival to the removal of failed applicants, or the integration into the community of those recognised as refugees.




<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2002 : Column 971W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21205w14.html_para3">The Government are planning to set up a number of reporting centres throughout the UK as part of an overall contact management strategy to support the processing of asylum applications and is keen to utilise such centres for this reporting process, rather than have asylum seekers reporting to their local police station with significant implications on police resources.

<a name="21205w14.html_para8">The possible link between cannabis use and mental illness (especially schizophrenia) has been debated for many years. In its report on the classification of cannabis, the Advisory Council said that no clear causal link was demonstrated, although cannabis could unquestionably worsen schizophrenia (and other mental illnesses) and lead to relapse in some patients. The research highlighted by the British Medical Journal (23 November 2002) adds to, but is not at variance with, the existing body of research which was drawn on by the Council in its consideration of the classification of cannabis. The Council reviews all recent research in a systematic way. The Home Secretary does not propose to ask the Council to review its recommendation about the classification of cannabis.

<P>
<a name="21205w17.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on future provision of a waste water treatment plant for Larne; and when it will come into operation.  [85621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w17.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There is presently no waste water treatment facility in Larne. Untreated waste water from the town's combined sewerage system is discharged into the estuary of Larne Lough through short outfalls at Blackcave and Sandy Bay. This practice is unacceptable in today's environment and improved facilities need to be provided.
<P>

<a name="21205w17.html_para4">Plans for the provision of treatment facilities for the area are well developed and include the construction of a new works to treat the waste water from Larne and the surrounding communities of Ballygalley, Drains Bay, Glynn and Magheramorne. The new works will be designed to comply with current legislation, including the Bathing Water and Urban Waste Water Treatment Directives. These Directives apply the same standards of treatment in Northern Ireland as are applied in the rest of the UK and throughout the European Union.
<P>

<a name="21205w17.html_para5">The current proposals include a housed compact waste water treatment plant within the town on land reclaimed from Redlands Lagoon. Treatment is to include primary and secondary treatment. Current proposals can accommodate a further stage of treatment should it be necessary to meet the consent standards set. The proposed works will be procured on a design and build basis to a strict performance specification and a short-list of contractors deemed to be competent to undertake this project has been set up. However, the invitation to tender is conditional on full planning approval being given. A planning application 



<P>
<P><I>5 Dec 2002 : Column 982W</I><P>
for the waste water treatment works has been submitted and a decision from Planning Service is awaited. Larne borough council are still considering this planning application, but it is hoped to get their agreement in the near future. Environment and Heritage Service has proposed more stringent effluent quality standards and treatment of a higher proportion of storm flows, in accordance with their proposed new environmental policy for coastal waters, the Northern Ireland Coastal and Estuarine Waters Classification System (NICEWCS). Water Service is currently engaged in discussions with Environment and Heritage Service to agree appropriate discharge consent standards to meet all of the regulatory standards. In order that the planning application may proceed, Planning Service has arranged for agreement between EHS and Water Service on the effluent standards to be a condition on planning approval, and approval on this basis is expected shortly.
<P>

<a name="21205w17.html_para6">Subject to the resolution of these matters, construction of the new waste water treatment works for Larne is scheduled to commence in September 2003. It will take two years to complete at an estimated cost of around &pound;10 million.

<P>
<a name="21205w18.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In our first term, we introduced a foundation of decent minimum standards in the workplace. We are now building on this, so that by 2007, employees will, for example, have been given rights to a minimum wage, four weeks paid holidays and to proper information and consultation. They will also benefit from a range of family friendly policies, such as the right for parents of children under six to request flexible working, parental and paternity leave and improved maternity rights. They will also have access to fair discipline and grievance procedures and may not be discriminated against on grounds of age, disability, religion or sexual orientation, or because they are part-time or fixed term workers.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2002]:</i> The UK has access to a wide range of fuels and generally has a more varied and balanced supply than many other countries. The mix of fuels has become increasingly diverse, including through increasing use of renewable energy. The UK remains self-sufficient in energy, but is likely to become increasingly dependent on imports of gas. Competition in UK electricity and gas markets has contributed to lower prices. Data for 2001 suggests that UK industrial gas and electricity prices were the second and fourth lowest in the EU respectively. UK domestic gas prices in 2001 were the second lowest in the EU, while domestic electricity prices were the fourth lowest, based upon available data.

<i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> Under Directive 96/29/Euratom, member states are required to ensure that discharges do not give rise to doses to members of the public which exceed the prescribed limits. The UK participates fully in the process through which these limits are determined. Each member state has an obligation for ensuring that these Euratom Community requirements are implemented in their national law, and for establishing facilities necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil. The European Commission has the task of ensuring compliance with these requirements and has specific powers under which it can verify the operation and efficiency of the monitoring equipment around nuclear sites. The UK Government have no reason to believe that the European Commission has not been assiduous in fulfilling its enforcement responsibilities in France, or indeed, anywhere else in the European Union.
<P>

<a name="21205w21.html_para0">In addition, under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, member states are required to submit general data to the European Commission relating to any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste so that the Commission can determine whether the plan is liable to result in radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another member state. France will have been required to submit such data to the Commission in respect of nuclear facilities on its northern coast and to satisfy the Commission that the disposal of waste from those facilities would not result in the radioactive contamination of any part of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21205w21.html_para1">It is the responsibility of each member state to ensure that the operations undertaken at the civil nuclear installations on its territory comply with the requirements of the Euratom Basic Safety Standards (Council Directive 96/29/Euratom), which includes requirements concerning emergency preparedness. Emergency preparedness requirements are also included under Article 16 of the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) to which both France and the UK are contracting parties. As stated above, the European Commission is responsible for monitoring compliance with obligations under the Euratom Treaty. Contracting parties to the CNS are subject to a three-yearly peer review of their responses to the requirements of the Convention. Both the UK and France participated in the last peer review meeting which was held in April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of sales licensed electricity suppliers are obliged to obtain from renewable sources; and what proportion they will be obliged to obtain from renewable sources <i>(a)</i> by 1 April 2003 and <i>(b)</i> by 1 April 2011.  [85436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 For the current year, the Renewables Obligation is set at 3 per cent. of total electricity sales from licensed electricity suppliers. This will rise to 4.3 per cent. for the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, and to 10.4 per cent. for 2010&#150;11 and subsequent periods. Suppliers may discharge their Obligation either by themselves supplying renewable electricity to customers in Great Britain, or by producing Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) purchased in the market, or by paying a buy-out price in place of all or part of their Obligation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom came from renewable energy sources in <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> to date in 2002.  [85487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The proportion of electricity generated in the United Kingdom, in 2001 that came from renewable energy sources was 2.6 per cent. Complete data for 2002 will not be available until summer 2003. However, because generation from large scale hydro sources by major power producers in the first three quarters of 2002 was 1.6 TWh higher than in the corresponding period of 2001 and because large scale hydro generation accounts for over 40 per cent. of generation from renewables, it is anticipated that this recovery alone will have raised the renewables percentage in 2002.

 It is estimated that by 2030 the throughput of Manchester Airport could range from 40 million passengers per annum (mppa) (if no new terminal capacity is provided) through to 70 mppa (if growth is facilitated and concentrated at Manchester). This equates to the runways handling between 300,000 and 440,000 Air Traffic Movements (ATMs) per annum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Environmental impact assessments of different transport modes take into account the full range of environmental matters, including air pollutants, CO2 emissions and noise, the length of journeys and the quantity and type of fuel consumed. There is also consideration of other local emissions sources, background levels of air pollution in the area and the extent to which emissions from the transport modes in question can be dispersed. The impact of infrastructure on the local environment is also assessed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the arrangements and procedures are for deferring the basic state pension.  [84449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21205w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Entitlement to the state pension arises when a person attains state pension age but to be entitled they have to make a claim. They can put off claiming their state pension to earn increments. When they claim, each part of the state pension is increased by about 7.5 per cent. for each full year of deferral. The minimum period of deferral is seven weeks.
<P>

<a name="21205w23.html_para0">Currently the maximum period for deferral is five years but from April 2010 there will be no time limit and the incremental rate will increase to about 10.4 per cent. for each full year.
<P>

<a name="21205w23.html_para1">It is up to the individual to decide whether to claim their state pension at state pension age or to defer claiming. A person can choose to defer either by writing to the Pension Service to request deferral or by not returning their claim for a state pension.
