 The Department for International Development (DFID) is providing £11 million to Burundi in the financial year 2010-11. As part of support to develop a poverty reduction strategy for 2011-14, DFID and other donors are helping the Government of Burundi put in place improved structures during 2011 to monitor and evaluate delivery. Because most Burundian refugees have now been successfully repatriated and reintegrated, DFID has recently phased out refugee assistance. DFID funding is focused on improving the delivery of services in health and education, increasing people’s access to justice and supporting Burundi’s integration into the East African Community (EAC).</p>

Our offices in Burundi and our ambassador based in Kigali have also encouraged the Government of Burundi to take these and other steps that we believe are essential in enabling Burundi to complete its post-conflict recovery.

 The UK drew the UN 1737 Sanctions Committee's attention to the discovery of a consignment of weapons in transit through Nigeria from Iran in late 2010. The Panel of Experts consequently travelled to Nigeria in January 2011 to conduct an investigation. It received full co-operation from the Nigerian authorities in the conduct of its inspections. The case remains under review until judicial proceedings in Nigeria are concluded. The UK strongly supports the work of the Panel of Experts, whose role is to investigate and report on the full and effective implementation of sanctions against Iran. This incident highlights the UK and the rest of the international community's concerns that Iran continues to defy multiple UN Security Council resolutions and is seeking to foster instability rather than play a constructive role in regional affairs. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of the Panel of Experts' work in responding to such cases.</p>

 We believe that the vast majority of schools want to operate their admissions in a fair and open manner. Where there are issues, parents can, and do, discuss them directly with the schools themselves and this often resolves the issue before a formal complaint is necessary. Where informal dialogue cannot resolve the issue, parents and others can object about admission arrangements to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator, who will independently review the matter. His determinations are binding on both parties. In future the Schools Adjudicator will consider complaints for all schools, including academies and free schools, ensuring that the route of formal complaint for parents is simpler.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 31 January 2011]:</i> School sport partnerships are groups of schools that work together on physical education and sport; they do not have separate legal status. The Department pays an annual grant with 450 secondary schools who agree to act as 'hubs' for the schools in a partnership and who receive additional funding for a ‘partnership development manager’. The Department is in the process of finalising the grant for the financial year 2010-11 with the hub schools. This agreement will cover expenditure of around £114 million in 2010-11. The hub schools make subsequent agreements with the other schools in their partnership, on the basis of the Department's agreement with them. The Department wrote to the hub schools in October 2010 to say that the terms and conditions for this year would be changing, that schools would have new flexibility over how they spend the grant on PE and sport, and that funding beyond March 2011 was not guaranteed. The hub schools will have taken this into account in making further agreements with other schools. The Department has subsequently announced, in December 2010, that the final payment of school sport partnership grant in February 2011 will cover most costs through to the end of the summer term 2011. The additional flexibility that schools have in spending this considerable investment should mean that they can embed the good practice of the previous Administration's PE and sport strategy, as well as run more competitive sport for all pupils. The complexity, lack of transparency, and administrative demands on schools of this payment system set up by the previous Administration are part of the reason that we have decided not to continue with it. Schools will remain able to organise competitive sport in partnerships in future, if they wish.</p>

 As set out in the White Paper on local growth, the Government will normally expect to see business representatives form half the board, with a prominent business leader in the chair. We would also expect business board members to be representative of key sectors in their area but it will be for partnerships themselves to determine their priorities for representation of particular sectors.</p>

 The scientific basis for the selection of Lyme Bay and Torbay, and Prawle Point to Plymouth Sound and Eddystone as possible as special areas of conservation (SACs), were the subject of public consultation by Natural England, one of the Department's statutory advisers on nature conservation. Following this, Natural England advised DEFRA that these two sites met the criteria set out in the Habitats Directive for submission to the European Commission as candidate SACs. The advice was accepted by DEFRA and, following clearance within Government, the sites were submitted to the Commission in August 2010.</p>

To help inform DEFRA of this process, its chief scientific adviser is commissioning an independent case study review to look at some examples relating to the selection of candidate/possible SACs. The review will consider the following case studies: Lyme Bay and Torbay, and Prawle Point to Plymouth Sound and Eddystone candidate SACs, and Prawle Point to Start Point possible SAC. The case study review will look at the evidence, advice and processes, as well as the Government's evaluation of such information.</p>

The difference to the public purse of continuing to follow this timetable for the qualifying age for pension credit rather than the one proposed in the Pensions Bill 2011 is estimated at £1.7 billion in 2010-11 prices between 2016-17 and 2025-26.</p>

3. State pension figure provided is the total state pension caseload. Around 1% of state pension recipients are not in receipt of the basic state pension, but are receiving additional pension only or graduated retirement benefit only.
4. From April 2010, the age at which women reach state pension age started to gradually increase from 60. This will introduce a small increase to the number of working age benefit recipients and a small reduction to the number of pension age recipients. Figures from May 2010 onwards reflect this change.

<i>Notes:</i>
1. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National Statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, the numbers given do not include awards processed clerically which had not yet been entered on to the Social Fund Computer System.
2. The number of initial awards is not available by constituency, but only by Government Office Region or Jobcentre Plus Social Fund budget area.
3. Scotland has been interpreted as the Government Office Region of that name.
4. Numbers are for initial awards only and do not include awards made after review.
5. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest ten.
6. During 2006-07 and 2007-08 the Budgeting loan baseline amount was at a level which gave a maximum amount which was above £1,000 (for single people or couples with children) in later years this has not been the case.
7. In 2006-07 the maximum loan amount was increased from £1,000 to £1,500 therefore allowing applicants to be awarded loans over the £1,000 level.

In addition, a Social Fund Crisis Loan may be available to prevent serious risk to health or safety of anyone in a crisis.</p>

 Local authorities have powers under sections 77 and 78 of the Building Act 1984 to require building owners to remedy structural defects in buildings, or alternatively to demolish them. Under section 77 the local authority must apply to the magistrates court to make an order for these purposes, and under section 78 may serve a notice directly on the owner. If the building owner does not take action as required, the local authority may do so itself and recover the cost from the building owner.</p>

3. The data available from the KC60 (2008 and earlier) and GUMCAD (2009 onwards) returns are for diagnoses made in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics only. A recent study (pending publication) of genital warts cases (first and recurrence) seen in GUM clinics and in general practice in 2008 has found most cases seen in general practice were referred on to GUM clinics and estimated that only around 5% of cases were seen in general practice only, ie figures in table 1 may represent up to 95% of cases.
4. The data available from the KC60 and GUMCAD returns are the number of diagnoses made, not the number of patients diagnosed.
5. The information provided is based on reported data from GUM clinics in England that has been adjusted for missing clinic data.

The reports from the two systems were reconciled. CMO’s confidential inquiry involved reporting of confirmed fatal cases through the national health service. The HPA’s system involved identification of deaths through reconciliation of data from a range of surveillance sources (e.g. influenza laboratory reports, death certificates, reports from local HPA teams).
<sup>(2)</sup> The ascertainment of fatal influenza cases in the current season has been similar to the HPA approach used during the pandemic.
