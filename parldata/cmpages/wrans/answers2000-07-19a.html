 The Department and our Agencies have a range of computer systems in use to support our day-to-day work. The responsibility for support of these is in the main outsourced to the private sector. For each of them disaster arrangements are in place to enable recovery of each system appropriate to the criticality of the business it supports. This includes the basic IT infrastructure on which each of these systems operates. The arrangements include built-in resilience, aimed at minimising loss of service generally. In the event of a major disaster impacting DTI's building, priority users have also been identified so that vital services can be restored first to these key personnel in the event of such a disaster.

 The information is set out in tables. At the end of March 2000, the total number of police officers in England and Wales was 124,418 and there were 53,227 civilian support staff in the police service. Table VI additionally compares the percentage change in police numbers over the 12 month period 31 March 1999 to 31 March 2000, against the percentage increase in police budgets for 1999-2000 in both cash and real terms.

<P>

<a name="00719w02.html_para15">I have already announced my plans to reverse the decline in police numbers. The Crime Fighting Fund was intended to provide funding for the recruitment of 5,000 more officers--3,000 this year and 2,000 next, over and above the number that forces would have planned to recruit over the three years from April 2000. As a result of the Spending Review, we will be making funding available for the recruitment of a further 4,000 officers--making 9,000 in all. The additional 4,000 will come on stream in 2001-02 and 2002-03. So forces will be able to recruit up to a maximum of 3,000 this year, 3,000 next year and 3,000 in 2002-03.

Allocation of this new money will be announced very shortly. This extra funding should contribute to a further increase in police numbers in the rural forces.
<P>

<a name="00719w02.html_para18">I am also stepping up efforts to tackle robbery with a cash boost this year from the Police Modernisation Fund. &#163;20 million will be shared between the Metropolitan Police (&#163;9.1 million), West Midlands Police (&#163;3.3 million), Greater Manchester Police (&#163;3.2 million), West Yorkshire

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the basis is for the statement on page 35 of the Government's Annual report 1999-2000, that tagging and curfews are more effective ways of punishing offenders; to what Government initiatives this statement refers; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> The introduction of curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring as a sentence to all courts in England and Wales on 1 December 1999 built on four years of successful trials. Home Office research has shown that the successful completion rate of 82 per cent. during the first two years of the trials of the sentence compared 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2000 : Column: 180W</I><P>
favourably with other community sentences (the completion rate for probation orders was also 82 per cent., while that for community service was 71 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="00719w03.html_para0">The evaluation of the trials found that curfew orders were more strictly enforced than other community sentences, a fact that places greater value on rate of completion. The primary reason for this is the fact that the electronic monitoring contracts leave little discretion in the enforcement of breaches. The monitoring equipment ensures that violations of curfew are detected immediately, and offenders in breach of their order are very quickly returned to court by the contractors.
<P>

<a name="00719w03.html_para1">Curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring provide the courts with a flexible sentencing option for use in respect of those offences for which the sentence is not fixed by law. Firstly, as a stand-alone sentence, it provides the punitive element of restricting an offender's liberty during the period of the curfew, while enabling those who have families to support to continue to do so. A curfew order can also be used in conjunction with another community sentence to help structure the times of attendance at, for example, probation or drug rehabilitation appointments. The trials of the sentence demonstrated that in this way, electronic monitoring could help to address the chaotic lifestyle of some offenders.
<P>

<a name="00719w03.html_para2">Given the operational effectiveness of curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring, the sentence can also be shown to provide a cost-effective alternative to a custodial sentence.
<P>

<a name="00719w03.html_para3">The operation of the sentence in England and Wales is the subject of an evaluation by the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate. The findings of the evaluation of the first two years of the trials of curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring are published in Home Office Research Study 163 and 177.

 The Human Rights Act 1998 gives further effect in United Kingdom law to rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights. Successive Governments have sought to comply with the provisions of the Convention since 1951.

Following its enactment, Departments have reviewed their legislation and procedures in the light of the Human Rights Act.

<a name="00719w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We welcome the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon, in compliance with UNSCRs 425 and 426, as demanded by UNSCR 520. We look forward to the Lebanese Government taking measures to assert its authority throughout its territory. We support UNSCR 520's call for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon to be respected. We also support the Resolution's reaffirmation of support for the rights of the civilian population of Lebanon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 It is primarily for Israel or any other third country to estimate the costs and benefits to their country of entering into agreements with the EU. The EU-Israel Association Agreement is a reciprocal agreement which confers specific benefits on both parties. It is in no way comparable to EU membership.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what advice has been given to the countries most recently given EU candidacy status about the need to have on their statute book a process providing for <i>(a)</i> restoration of property rights and <i>(b)</i> a compensation regime which is subject to both arbitration and judicial review, in relation to property arbitrarily seized during the period of totalitarian rule, after 1945.  [130662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> The EU monitors applicants' progress in meeting the political and economic criteria for membership of the EU, including issues related to the restitution of property, in the Commission's annual progress reports and the EU's regular dialogue with the applicant countries concerned. However, property restitution is a bilateral issue for the states concerned and does not fall within the scope of the accession negotiations.
<P>

<a name="00719w05.html_para0">We have not bilaterally offered advice to those countries recently given EU candidacy status but we have taken a particular interest in the situation in Poland, which affects a number of British nationals of Polish origin. We have continually made clear to the Polish authorities the

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office annual report on human rights will be published as a Command Paper at 2.30pm on 20 July.

The report will be placed on the FCO websites www.fco.gov.uk and hrpd.fco.gov.uk and will be available through The Stationery Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the UN Secretary-General's recent appointment of experts to look into breaches of UN sanctions against UNITA.  [131486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The UK has given full support to the ground-breaking work of Ambassador Robert Fowler, Chairman of the Angola Sanctions Committee, to ensure that UN sanctions against UNITA are made to bite. We financially supported the Angola Expert Panel to the tune of 200,000 US Dollars. The Panel investigated reports of sanctions breaking and reported to the UN Security Council on 15 March. The Security Council welcomed the Panel's report in UN Security Council resolution 1295, adopted on 18 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00719w05.html_para1">The report gave a detailed analysis of the problem of sanctions breaking. It reports the alleged involvement of a number of individuals. For example, it states that the central figure in UNITA's external procurement and diamond trade operations is Marcelo Moises Dachala, known as "Karrica", based in Ougadougou and that Imad Kabir

<a name="00719w05.html_para2"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has been purchasing weapons for Savimbi which were being delivered to Kinshasa. From 1995-96 until the fall of Andulo in October 1999, Kabir is said to have served as UNITA's primary broker for importing arms and military equipment.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00719w05.html_para3">Security Council resolution 1295 (2000) requested the UN Secretary-General to establish a monitoring mechanism to collect further information and investigate relevant leads relating to allegations of violations of UN sanctions against UNITA and report to the Security Council by 18 October 2000. That mechanism has now been established. On 11 July the Secretary-General appointed five experts to serve on it.
<P>

<a name="00719w05.html_para4">We greatly welcome the fact that Ms Christine Gordon, a British national and independent writer, consultant and researcher, has been appointed to the monitoring mechanism, and wish her well in her important task.
<P>

<a name="00719w05.html_para5">Sanctions breaking must be stopped. The Expert Panel's report, the adoption of Security Council resolution 1295 (2000) and the establishment of the monitoring mechanism show that the international community will no longer tolerate sanctions breaking.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the political settlement of the recent crisis in Fiji, including its racial aspects, and <i>(b)</i> Fiji's future membership of the Commonwealth.  [131413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are relieved that all the hostages have now been released, but dismayed that George Speight and his supporters have been allowed to overthrow Fiji's democratically elected Government at the point of a gun, and that the 1997 Constitution has been abrogated. We continue to call for the restoration of a democratic and constitutional Government which respects the rights of all Fijians. Unless Fiji's new interim administration can demonstrate a clear road map for returning Fiji to democracy, the Commonwealth may wish to consider further measures at the next meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) in September.

[131414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In its statement of 1 July, the International Donor Referendum Group, which includes the UK, concluded that although the voting had been peaceful and orderly, the Referendum campaign as a whole had not been conducted on a level playing field. While noting that it was not clear that these shortcomings were on a scale significantly to influence the result of the Referendum, the Group expressed its hope that the presidential elections scheduled for 2001 would resume momentum towards more inclusive Government.

<a name="00719w06.html_para0">The Group has since met with President Museveni to discuss progress towards greater pluralism, good governance and democratic accountability.

Our plans for addressing this in Bangladesh are described in our relevant Country Strategy Paper, a copy of which is in the House of Commons Library. In Pakistan, where our work was disrupted by last year's military coup, we are providing technical assistance to the Pakistani administration to support action to reduce poverty and corruption and support the development of genuine democracy.

 The New Deal for Young people is aimed at people aged 18-24 who have been claiming unemployment benefits for six months or more. Claimant unemployment among this group has fallen by 56 per cent. since April 1998 when the New Deal was introduced. Part of this is due to the delivery of a strong and stable economy, but the New Deal for Young People has helped unemployment to fall even faster. The 56 per cent. fall in youth long-term unemployment compares with a fall of 18 per cent. in total unemployment, 23 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment and 26 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more. The effect of the New Deal is confirmed by independent research from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

<a name="00719w07.html_para2">It is not possible to measure the New Deal effect exactly in each area of the country. However, in Westminster and Kensington the falls in unemployment among the New Deal client group have also been substantially faster than for other groups. In Westminster in the two years since April 1998 claimant unemployment amongst those aged 18-24, unemployed for six months or more, has fallen by 43 per cent. from 418 to 238. This compares with a fall of 16 per cent. in total unemployment, 25 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment, and 18 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2000]:</i> We have made it clear that head teachers and governors must not use teaching and materials which are inappropriate with regard to the age and the religious and the cultural background of the pupils concerned. In making their judgments, head teachers and governors should have regard to the Personal, Social and Health Education framework, which sets out what is expected at each Key Stage in education, and to the law.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> Under the initiative "School laboratories for the 21st Century", &#163;60 million is being allocated from the Capital Modernisation fund to tackle deficiencies in secondary school science accommodation over the next two years. This will enable around 400 improvement projects to be carried out at those schools most in need.
<P>

<a name="00719w08.html_para5">In line with the Department's policy of reducing bureaucracy and paperwork, grants are being allocated to local education authorities (LEAs) by formulae. LEAs will then distribute funding to schools according to need. Middlesbrough LEA is to receive &#163;115,109 this year and a further &#163;115,109 in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="00719w08.html_para6">Additionally, LEAs have been able to apply for funding from the New Deal for Schools (NDS) programme to improve the condition of school laboratories. So far, 151 such projects have been funded, at a cost of just under &#163;37 million. They may also have incorporated improvements to science accommodation within larger schemes of school expansion or rationalisation.

 The 223 Learning Support Units (LSUs) in the 24 Local Education Authorities (LEAs) in Phase 1 of the 'Excellence in Cities' (EiC) programme have been established progressively over the current academic year and are now operating. The LSUs in the 22 LEAs in Phase 2 of the EiC programme, which includes the City of Nottingham, will start to be set up from September 2000. Most should be operating from January 2001. We are currently assessing these LEAs' final plans. The LSUs in LEAs outside EiC areas, which includes Nottinghamshire, will be established progressively from September 2000. Most should come into operation between January and March 2001.
<P>

<a name="00719w08.html_para7">The City of Nottingham is planning for all of its 21 secondary schools to have an LSU. Information about Nottinghamshire LEA's plans is not yet available. The Authority was notified on 30 June of its allocation--a total of some &#163;671,000 to cover both capital and recurrent expenditure over the financial years 2000-01 and 2001-02. It is now for the LEA in consultation with its schools to decide how many LSUs to establish within those resources and in which schools.
<P>

<a name="00719w08.html_para8">Learning Support Units are a proven strategy for improving behaviour and reducing exclusions, and they are cost effective. They enable schools to get disruptive pupils out of the classroom quickly while not excluding them. We aim to have over 1,000 established by 2002.

 I understand from my officials, who have contacted the school, that no applications were refused on the ground that admission would breach the class size limit. Thirteen children were refused admission because there were forty-three applications for only thirty available places.

<a name="00719w09.html_para0">The thirty places were allocated to Sunningdale residents, thirteen of whom had siblings in the school. Of those applicants refused, four were non residents of Sunningdale with siblings in the school. The school gives priority for admission to children resident in the ecclesiastical parish of Sunningdale. A further four applications from the Sunningdale area were received after places had been allocated, and were refused.

The burden of meeting the Q-mark entry conditions would have borne differentially on different sizes of operators, and in particular could have been harder for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry, including those not in QPA membership, to meet.

 Some 100 insulation and heating installation contractors are currently appointed to the New Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, which started in June. The two Scheme Managers for New HEES expect to appoint up to a further 45 contractors. The New HEES scheme, which started in June, provides vulnerable householders with a comprehensive package of insulation, together with efficient central heating for householders over 60 in age, through grants of up to &#163;2,000. The previous scheme provided householders with one insulation measure per household, mainly draughtproofing, with a maximum grant of &#163;315. Funding for the scheme has been increased from about &#163;76 million last year to around &#163;122 million this year and around &#163;153 million next year.

Regulations. They are contractually required to appoint installers using the same competitive tendering process and following the same Regulations. All existing installers were eligible to tender for appointment to the new scheme. Installers have been chosen on the basis of their technical abilities to deal with the wider range of measures provided through New HEES, their ability to meet the quality standard, and the price tendered.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how many council homes in Shrewsbury and Atcham will benefit from home energy efficiency measures by the end of this year; and if he will make a statement;  [131157]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many households will be helped out of fuel poverty by 2002 through energy-efficiency schemes in Shrewsbury and Atcham.  [131137]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a wide range of programmes to tackle poor energy efficiency, one of the main causes of fuel poverty. These are as follows.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para2">From 1 June, the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme provides grants of up to &#163;2,000 for comprehensive packages of insulation and heating improvements. The scheme is aimed at those households which are most vulnerable to cold-related ill health: older people and families on low incomes, and the disabled and chronically sick. HEES has a budget of &#163;275 million for the first two years, which is expected to help some 460,000 households. The scheme is focused on the private sector, where nearly 70 per cent. of the fuel poor in England are found. However, limited funds will still be available for social housing in the first two years.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para3">We have released substantial additional funds to help improve our housing stock; in total some &#163;5 billion is being made available over the lifetime of this Parliament for investment in housing. Most of the additional resources are going to local authorities and will be spent according to the needs and priorities identified in their housing strategy. We estimate that around one third of the money is likely to lead directly or indirectly to improvements in energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para4">Government-funded programmes operated by the Energy Saving Trust improve the energy efficiency of both fuel poor households and others. In addition, some of the Government funded regeneration schemes will help to improve home energy efficiency in specific areas.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para5">To support the installation of energy efficiency measures, from 1 July 1998 the Government have reduced VAT from 17.5 per cent. to 5 per cent. for the installation of energy efficiency materials through Government-funded grant schemes such as HEES. The Spring 2000 budget extended the reduced rate of VAT of 5 per cent. to include the installation of energy saving material in "all" homes and the installation of heating measures through Government funded grant schemes.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para6">The Government are also introducing provisions to enable lessors to claim capital allowances on their investment in boilers, radiators and controls installed in residential properties under the Affordable Warmth Programme. The Programme will operate from 2000 to 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2000 : Column: 207W</I><P>
2007, with the aim of helping up to 1 million low income households, primarily in the social sector, benefit from improved energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para7">In addition to Government energy efficiency programmes, since 1994, public electricity suppliers have, under the Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance, been required to encourage and assist customers with energy efficiency measures. The new Director General of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets has, from this year extended these to also include public gas suppliers and the overall size of the programme has been doubled to &#163;50 million a year. 65 per cent. of this expenditure will be allocated to low income households.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para8">Under the Home Energy Conservation Act (HECA) 1995, local authorities with housing responsibilities were required to prepare, publish and submit to the Secretary of State an energy conservation report identifying energy conservation measures considered to be practicable, cost-effective and likely to result in a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of all residential accommodation in their area.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2000 : Column: 208W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para9">In England, authorities are now reporting annually on the progress being made in implementing the measures identified. Furthermore, we have now asked local authorities to report on their policies and achievements specifically in combating fuel poverty, at the same time as they submit their HECA progress reports. The next HECA progress report from local authorities is due by 31 July 2000.
<P>

<a name="00719w10.html_para10">The energy conservation report prepared by Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council, and their most recent progress report, should be available from the Council.

A small amount of market research has been carried out in relation to the way in which the Millennium Commission is viewed rather than the work that it has funded. The results have only internal relevance and are used by the Commission's Communications Department to assess the impact of their communications strategy.

 Census returns are subject to 100 year closure, in line with section 1(3) of the Census Confidentiality Act 1991 and with the Government policy set out in the White Paper "Open Government" (Cm 2290, 1993). This is on the grounds that they consist of documents supplied in confidence, the disclosure of which would constitute a breach of good faith.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions he has held with the All-Party Pharmacy Group on the morning-after pill; and if he will make a statement.  [130688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w12.html_spnew11"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There have been no discussions between Health Ministers and the All-Party Pharmacy Group on the issue of emergency contraception. However there has been correspondence between my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), chair of the group, and myself following the group's report on extending access to emergency contraception through community pharmacies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w12.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he defines the morning-after pill as an abortifacient; and if he will make a statement.  [130691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w12.html_spnew12"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The accepted legal and medical view is that emergency contraception is not a method of abortion. Emergency contraception pills work before implantation and so before a pregnancy has been established. Emergency contraceptive pills will not cause an abortion if taken after implantation.
<P>

<a name="00719w12.html_para16">My right hon. Friend the Attorney-General, in answering a parliamentary question in 1983, stated that medical practitioners would not be prosecuted for illegal abortion if they sought to prevent implantation by the use of the 'morning-after pill' or an inter-uterine device.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w12.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice he has issued to general practitioners on prescribing of the morning-after pill; and if he will make a statement.  [131381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w12.html_spnew13"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> None. Prescribing of emergency contraception is a matter for the clinical judgment of the practitioner concerned. The Faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recently researched the available evidence and published updated recommendations for clinical practice for emergency contraception in April this year.

 Zyban is now available on National Health Service prescription. Zyban is a non-nicotine based treatment which has been shown to be effective in helping smokers to quit in combination with motivational support. This drug is an entirely new approach to treating nicotine dependence and NHS availability will give general practitioners an effective way to help smokers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what requirements abortion clinics must meet to be licensed by his Department.  [129412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w13.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Any independent sector place wishing to carry out termination of pregnancy must first of all be registered with the local health authority under the Registered Homes Act 1984. All units are inspected and must undertake to comply with the Department's Required Standard Operating Principles (RSOP), which cover a variety of topics. The RSOPs can be found in the "Procedures For The Approval Of Independent Sector Places For The Termination Of Pregnancy". Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00719w13.html_para0">Approved clinics are subject to regular unannounced inspections. Failure to comply with the RSOPs, or to maintain the standards required by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may lead to withdrawal of approval.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Amess: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the private sector clinics and hospitals providing abortions, indicating <i>(a)</i> the number of approved beds they contain and <i>(b)</i> whether they are approved for (i) surgical day care abortions with or without general anaesthetic and (ii) late abortions, indicating the name of the proprietor in each case.  [129413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w13.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The number of approved beds is controlled by local health authorities under the Registered Homes Act 1984 and this information is not collated centrally. The independent sector places approved to carry out termination of pregnancy are shown in the table. All of them are approved to undertake surgical day care abortions, subject to their conditions of registration under the above Act. Clinics approved to perform abortions from 20 weeks up to 24 weeks gestation are identified in the table. No independent sector place is approved to carry out termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks gestation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps have been taken to increase the proportion of bone marrow donors of Asian ethnic origin.  [129268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Blood Service recruits bone marrow donors from existing blood donors and ran a campaign last year to recruit more Asian blood donors. The NBS do not collect data on the ethnic origin of donors, but estimate that 2 per cent. of donors on the British Bone Marrow Donor Registry (which covers England, Scotland and Northern Ireland) are of ethnic origin compared with the United Kingdom ethnic minority population of roughly 7 per cent. Cord blood donation is an alternative to bone marrow donation in the treatment of some illnesses, and information from the NBS's cord blood donation programme indicates that over 40 per cent. of donations are from ethnic minority groups. I have asked the National Blood Service to explore what further steps can be taken to recruit more blood and bone marrow donors from the Asian community.

<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Mileage allowances for staff on national contracts is determined by an agreement of the General Whitley Council. Rates have been set under an agreed formula linked to the Automobile Association schedule of motoring costs which has been reviewed annually by the Council. No increases have been made to these allowances since 1993.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health by how much deaths from heart disease and strokes have been reduced since May 1997; if Government targets for reducing the number of such deaths are being met in these areas; and if he will make a statement.  [130384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Tackling heart disease and stroke is a top Government priority. Our target for reducing deaths in this area was set out in the White Paper "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" published in July 1999. It is to reduce the death rate from heart disease, stroke and related conditions in those aged under 75 years by at least two fifths (40 per cent.) by the year 2010, from a three-year average baseline at 1995/96/97.
<P>

<a name="00719w14.html_para3">The target was set for the year 2010 because it will take time for interventions in this area to translate into outcomes in terms of mortality rates. Latest available data still pre-date the start of the "Our Healthier Nation" strategy, but show that the three-year average age standardised death rate from circulatory diseases in people aged under 75 fell from 139.6 per 100,000 population in 1995/96/97 to 133.8 per 100,000 population in 1996/97/98--a 4 per cent. fall.
<P>

<a name="00719w14.html_para4">The downward trend in death rates and the Government's "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" strategy should be reinforced by the National Service Framework on Coronary Heart Disease. The Framework, which we published in March this year, sets out our plans

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) advises the Government on all aspects of screening policy. The NSC does not currently recommend antenatal screening for cystic fibrosis as there are too many gene mutations associated with early cystic fibrosis identification and too little information on their clinical severity to enable counsellors to facilitate informed choice. The UK National Screening Committee will review this approach in the light of any new evidence. As yet, there is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend national neonatal screening. The NSC is considering how to make progress on this issue.

 It is not possible to provide information in the form requested. A number of campaigns have covered both prostate cancer awareness and other issues and the sums spent on prostate cancer cannot be disaggregated from the total.
<P>

<a name="00719w14.html_para5">The Department provides information for the public, in leaflets and through health education campaigns. These encourage people to report to their general practitioner or other health professional any persistent or unusual symptoms which may indicate cancer or other disease.

<P>

<a name="00719w14.html_para7">Little research has been carried out worldwide into prevention of prostate cancer and detection. In June, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced an extra &#163;1 million to fund two new research projects.

The second project is looking at innovative new detection and treatment techniques.
<P>

<a name="00719w14.html_para8">We have also invested &#163;200,000 from the Public Health Development Fund to develop, pilot and evaluate an education programme on prostate cancer especially the risks associated with screening and testing. This money will also go towards developing other materials aimed at changing attitudes among men to facilitate early detection and prevention of cancer.
<P>

 Figures are not yet available for the whole of the last 12 months. 42 per cent. of HIV infections diagnosed in the United Kingdom in 1999 and reported to the end of March 2000 were probably acquired through sex between men. When diagnoses of infections probably acquired abroad are excluded, the estimated proportion of infections occurring in the UK through sex between men rises to approximately 70 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w14.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In 1999-2000, of the &#163;3 million allocated to national HIV health promotion and prevention, &#163;1.1 million was spent on work targeting men who have sex with men. Health authorities received &#163;53.4 million for local HIV prevention work, of which they were required to spend at least 50 per cent. on groups at increased risk of HIV, including men who have sex with men.

<P>
<a name="00719w15.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he has agreed to the release of conventionally financed capital expenditure to prepare the way for the Newcastle Hospitals Trust Private Finance Initiative scheme.  [130829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> The consultation draft of a business case relating to the enabling works was received by the National Health Service Executive on 3 July 2000 and is now under assessment alongside the business cases for the later private finance initiative schemes. The National Health Service Executive needs to undertake a full and proper review of the documents in accordance with established procedure to ensure that appropriate approval standards are met. I cannot of course pre-determine the outcome of that review.
<P>

<a name="00719w15.html_para1">The National Health Service Executive has consistently reported its strong support for this scheme, most notably during the approval of the original strategic outline case during 1998, and when the strategic outline case needed approval reconfirmed in 1999 following the increase in the capital cost of the scheme. The National Health Service Executive is well aware of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Trust's recommendation publicly to fund elements of this scheme, and its justification for that approach. However, final confirmation of public funding will be determined following the assessment of the business cases, and taking into consideration the relative priority of all bids upon the capital programme.
<P>

<a name="00719w15.html_para2">The National Health Service Executive is in dialogue with the trust and the Newcastle and North Tyneside health authority on this scheme, and a great deal of work is being undertaken to bring this phase of the process to a conclusion as soon as possible.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many of those children tested for allergies, expressed in each case as a figure and a percentage of total tested, were referred by <i>(a)</i> GPs, <i>(b)</i> hospitals and <i>(c)</i> parents; and if he will make a statement;  [130997]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w15.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> Patients who are suspected of having a nut allergy are normally referred to a clinical immunology and allergy clinic. The outpatient waiting times data do not differentiate between reasons for referral nor between adults and children. During the year 1999-2000 there were 4,304 referrals from general practitioners and 965 from other sources. At the time of their first outpatient attendance 1,923 patients had waited less than 13 weeks; 1,069 patients waited between 13 and 25 weeks; and 508 patients waited more than 26 weeks.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> Data are not collected centrally to show the number of people who are tested and diagnosed with an allergy. Patients with suspected allergies are often referred to clinical immunology and allergy outpatient clinics where they are tested for allergy. The figures indicate the number of patients attending a clinic in England for the first time.

 We recognise the importance of raising awareness about the risk factors and symptoms of diabetes among both the public and health care professionals, including the Asian and African-Caribbean populations. We announced last year the development of a National Service Framework (NSF) for diabetes in England, to be published in 2001. The aims of the diabetes NSF are to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes by raising the quality of services and reducing variations between them. The scope of the NSF is broad and covers prevention, identification and management of diabetes and its complications, including rehabilitation and continuing care. The diabetes NSF will pay particular heed to the needs of those who are disproportionately affected by diabetes, such as people from minority ethnic groups.

 I have today placed in the Library a copy of the report "Tracking Progress in Children's Services: An Evaluation of Local Responses to the Quality Protects Programme Year 2".
<P>

<a name="00719w17.html_para2">When we launched the Quality Protects programme in September 1998, we required local authorities to submit annual Management Action Plans to show how they were intending to improve the management and delivery of children's social services. This report presents the key

messages and findings from the second round of Management Actions Plans (MAPs) which were received in January 2000.
<P>

<a name="00719w17.html_para3">Councils have made a good start over the past year in implementing the Quality Protects programme. For example we have seen:
<P>

<a name="00719w17.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>more corporate working across councils and more partnership working with voluntary organisations
<P>
<BR>
an increase in the proportion of children looked after in foster care or placed for adoption
<P>
<BR>
a reduction in re-registrations on the child protection register
<P>
<BR>
more support being given to care leavers
<P>
<BR>
an increase in education support being given to looked after children
<P>

<a name="00719w17.html_para5"><P>

improvements in the collecting and using of management information.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00719w17.html_para6">But if there are to be real and lasting gains for children, these early improvements must be built on and further substantial progress made in 2000-01. The Government's determination to support this change is demonstrated by the significant increase in special grant available for funding this year (from &#163;75 million to &#163;120 million). We will expect progress in 2000-01 to be commensurate with this increase in funding.

<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
HAZ funding comes from a number of sources:
<BR>
1. The HAZ central budget comprising three elements:
<BR>
programme funding for joint projects with other agencies (1998-99 to 2000-01);
<BR>
innovations funding (1999-2000 and 2000-01);
<BR>
central and other innovations (1998-99 to 2000-01).
<BR>
In 1998-99 a small part of the purchaser development budget was used to provide some start up costs for HAZs;
<BR>
2. Funding for smoking cessation for 1999-2000 and 2000-01.
<BR>
3. Funding for drugs prevention services in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. In 1998-99 and 1999-2000 1st wave HAZs received the allocation and in 2000-01 2nd wave HAZs receive the money.
<BR>
4. Targeted funds for deprived areas. This is allocated to health authorities which include HAZs within their boundaries.

(3) how many cases of benefit fraud have been discovered by local authorities as a result of the "do not re-direct" postal service for benefit-related envelopes.  [131356]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. However, from 2000-01, local authorities are asked to provide details of the number of cases where fraud has been established as a result of using the "do not re-direct" service.
<P>

<a name="00719w18.html_para0">The recent Local Authority Omnibus Survey, published in April 2000, showed that of those authorities surveyed and operating "do not re-direct", around three-quarters said that it had enhanced their ability to protect the system against fraud, and more than half believed that it led to the identification of fraudulent activity. The deterrent effect of the scheme is less easy to quantify.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security which local authorities have yet to implement fully the "do not re-direct" postal service for benefit- related envelopes; and what reasons they have given for the delays.  [131357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 According to information we have received from the Royal Mail, there are currently 57 local authorities who have not joined the "do not re-direct" postal service.
<P>

<a name="00719w18.html_para1">The following list shows the authorities that have not joined, or contacted their local Royal Mail sales centre to join, the scheme to date. The Royal Mail, in turn, depends on their local sales centres to keep them informed as authorities join up.

<a name="00719w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Fraser: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many pensioners from Dorset are suffering a loss of income as a result of the NIRS2 computer problems.  [130835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is not possible to give an accurate answer to this question. I can, however, confirm that the maximum number of pensioners in Dorset whose Retirement Pension will be subject to review is 1,041. We expect to make benefit adjustments to around 600 of these cases. We expect to complete work on these cases by October 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people have moved to sustained unsubsidised employment from the New Deal for Lone Parents; and what percentage he estimates would have found employment without the New Deal for Lone Parents.  [130682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Up to the end of April, 54,241 lone parents had obtained jobs following participation in the New Deal for Lone Parents programme. All NDLP jobs are unsubsidised.
<P>

<a name="00719w18.html_para7">The evaluation of the programme's prototype phase, which ran from July 1997 to October 1998, estimates how many jobs gained were additional to those that would have occurred without the programme. Copies of the evaluation reports are available in the Library. This estimated that NDLP virtually paid for itself.
<P>

<a name="00719w18.html_para8">Comprehensive evaluation of the national phase of the NDLP programme is being conducted and will report in 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate he has made of the administration cost of processing applications for <i>(a)</i> winter fuel allowance and <i>(b)</i> concessionary television licences in the (i) last and (ii) current financial year.  [130434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00719w18.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In the last financial year (1999-2000), Winter Fuel Payments accounted for around 0.35 per cent. of the total departmental running costs. There were no costs paid in respect of concessionary TV licences for people over 75.
<P>

<a name="00719w18.html_para9">In the current financial year, administering these two important initiatives to improve the income of older people will account for around 1.7 per cent. of the total departmental running costs (0.93 per cent. in respect of the Winter Fuel Payment scheme and 0.75 per cent. for the concessionary television licence scheme).

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For 1999-2000 (as well as the first two years of the scheme) two of the main conditions of entitlement to Winter Fuel Payments were both age and receipt of a qualifying benefit; those who were entitled were identified through the relevant computer benefit systems and paid automatically. Following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in December 1999, the Winter Fuel Payment scheme was extended to men as well as women from age 60 from the beginning of the scheme (1997-98). The majority of people who are now eligible for a Winter Fuel Payment because of the changes to the scheme are not receiving a Social Security benefit and will have to make a claim.</FONT></UL>
