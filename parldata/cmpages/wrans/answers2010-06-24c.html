 The Ministry of Justice has, for the last four years, allocated £1.25 million per annum to voluntary sector organisations supporting victims of sexual violence. This is funded through the Victim Surcharge, which is a £15 levy on all fines imposed by the courts following a criminal conviction. It is a condition of the Ministry of Justice's financial settlement that the income from the surcharge must be used to provide non-financial support to victims of crime and their families.</p>

All other arrangements for the funding, including any ring-fencing, remain unchanged. This one-off combined fund was created to provide a more joined-up approach to the sector, to simplify the application process for organisations bidding for money and to deliver better value for money overall.</p>

 The overwhelming majority of property occupied by the UK Border Agency overseas is linked to the processing of visa applications. None of these buildings are leased by the UKBA; they are all leased and managed by the FCO, as part of a package of support services provided to the FCO for which a central charge is made. It is common practice for office accommodation to be shared with the FCO, where this represents the best use of the available office space. Over the last three years the UKBA have rationalised their footprint overseas by concentrating work into a reduced number of decision-making posts. They are currently investigating how further, similar savings can be made.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 June 2010]:</i> Due to the uncertainty of certain costs when building a road, the Highways Agency calculates the maximum and minimum forecast spend on the scheme to create a range estimate. A figure in the middle of the range estimate is then used for planning purposes. The current scheme range estimate for the A5-M1 Link is £134 million to £189 million with a mid range estimate of £162 million. This is based on a detailed review of scheme costs in September 2009.</p>

 Customer's actual interest rates were used in the past to calculate Support for Mortgage Interest. But that method was abandoned in 1995, in favour of a standard interest rate, which has proved to be far more efficient and straightforward.</p>

 The announcement on 24 May set out the immediate savings of over £6 billion that needed to be made as down-payment on the public deficit. Housing budgets for 2010-11 are also subject, however, to the provision of end year flexibility. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced on 17 June that he is reviewing the affordability of a range of end year flexibility agreements made by the previous administration, and an announcement on the outcome of this is expected shortly. A full review of housing projects will be undertaken, once the final funding position for 2010-11 is clear.</p>

 The coalition Government are committed to reducing the United Kingdom's budget deficit. It has led us to identify savings across Government, starting with the £6 billion of immediate savings this year that we announced on 24 May, including the £150 million reduction against the previous Administration's housing pledge. Against this £170 million has been provided for 2010-11 to safeguard delivery of around 4,000, otherwise unfunded, social rented homes. It is estimated that the £150 million reduction will reduce the number of affordable housing starts by around 5,000 but these changes will mainly fall to shared ownership and shared equity schemes-not social rented housing.</p>

 I raised Burma with ASEAN Ministers at the EU-ASEAN Ministerial on 26 May 2010 at which the Burmese Foreign Minister was present.

 The forthcoming elections are set to be held under deeply oppressive conditions. The Burmese regime limits public access to media information. Election literature is censored and public gatherings, political banners and flags are banned. Most people are unable to access the media to voice political views and those who do so risk draconian measures imposed by the military junta including long prison sentences. Under these conditions, Burma's people will not have reasonable access to free and impartial media.</p>

Although internet use is limited in Burma, the FCO's digital communications work also plays its part in the flow of information to the country. As elections approach in Burma, the FCO will continue to work closely with the BBC World Service and others to increase access to political information.</p>
