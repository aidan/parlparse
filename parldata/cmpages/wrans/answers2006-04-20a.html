 The charges applied to pre-payment meters reflect the additional costs of the meter itself and the infrastructure required to support it. Any enforced reduction in the charges applied to pre-payment meters would have to be cross-subsidised by other customers, including pensioners and the fuel poor, the majority of whom do not use pre-payment meters. Pre-payment tariffs of individual suppliers vary, and, where customers prefer to retain a pre-payment meter, they may be able to reduce their expenditure by switching supplier.

 Each of the major domestic energy suppliers offer a number of programmes that assist vulnerable customers in various ways.

It should be noted that complaints received by his office about breaches of Regulation 21 concern not just calls made to Telephone Preference Service (TPS) registered numbers but also calls made to numbers where the subscriber has directly asked the calling organisation not to make marketing calls to that number. Also, Regulation 19 relates to the use of unsolicited direct marketing automated telephone calls.

This was the Aquila/Chertsey Loan Note, between the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Qinetiq, which formed part of the receipt from the initial sale of a minority equity interest in Qinetiq to Carlyle in 2003. The loan note was secured against the sale of Qinetiq property at Aquila (Bromley) and Chertsey. No firm schedule of repayments could be laid down as the income from the sale was conditional on the achievement of various stages of planning permission, and so the Budget assumptions were based on estimates of time scales for this planning permission. These original estimates were not achieved, and hence payments to be made by Qinetiq to the MOD slipped.

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60420w07.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The United Kingdom is a major contributor to mine action in Sri Lanka. We have provided &#163;1 million through the United Nations to support demining and mine awareness in conflict affected areas. A further &#163;669,766 has been committed to two non governmental organisations (NGOs), the Mine Action Group and the HALO Trust, for mine action between 2004 and 2007.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Apr 2006 : Column 771W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60420w07.html_para5">
The programmes, together with those from the wider international community, have been successful. Deaths from mines have been largely eliminated, although there are still a small number of casualties each year, especially in the far north of Sri Lanka. Nevertheless the Government estimate that some 700,000 to 1,000,000 mines remain to be cleared.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60420w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">Given the dependence upon mines in militarily significant areas, it will be many more years before Sri Lanka will be landmine free, and before the Government will feel able to sign the Ottawa Treaty. The Government of Sri Lanka is planning to create within the Sri Lankan army, a national capability to pursue mine action work after 2008. DFID will review progress during 2007 and, in the light of this, consider further support.

 The situation throughout Kosovo remains tense but broadly stable as the United Nations-led final status process continues. I strongly condemn the criminal acts that have taken place in northern Kosovo in recent weeks. The Government fully supports the efforts of the Kosovo Police Service and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo to bring those responsible for such acts to justice.

<a name="stpa_62">The London Contact Group Ministerial statement of 31 January 2006 made clear that a final status settlement must be underpinned by principles that promote a multi-ethnic society. A copy of the statement has been placed in the Library of the House. In the context of the final status process we expect community leaders to continue to engage in creating a climate conducive to bridging the ethnic divide not only in northern Kosovo but the entire territory.

 There are no authoritative figures available for the current operational strength of the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA). It is likely that the total number has declined in recent years and current estimates put the number of combatants in hundreds rather than thousands.

<a name="stpa_63">The largest concentration of LRA fighters is thought to be currently based in the Garamba National Park in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Elsewhere it is thought that the LRA has a presence in southern Sudan as well as northern Uganda, where it operates in relatively small groups and is highly mobile.

 The political situation in Pakistan is continuously evolving. Despite occasional outbreaks of sectarian and other violence, the appalling bomb explosion in Karachi on 11 April being the most recent example, the country remains generally stable and Pakistan is an important partner for achieving UK strategic objectives. Officials in both London and Pakistan meet regularly with members of the Pakistani Government, opposition parties and members of civil society to ensure that we remain abreast of developments. We continue to work towards ensuring that the 2007 elections are both free and fair, thus helping Pakistan&#039;s return to full democracy.

n/a=Figures are not available.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> The expenditure data to 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the annual &#039;RO1&#039; spending returns which local authorities submitted to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (now the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister). Figures for 1999&#150;00 to 2001&#150;02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards are taken from the recasted Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank rows.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> Local Government Reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998. What was previously defined as Essex local authority pre LGR was split into Essex, Southend and Thurrock local authorities for the start of the 1998&#150;99 financial year.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> From 2002&#150;03 the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). From 2002&#150;03 onwards, certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is no longer available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999&#150;00), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;00.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999&#150;00 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> 2004&#150;05 data is subject to change by the local authority.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

 Yes. It is the local authority which signs the contract with the private sector PFI contractor and which therefore is liable for the payment of the unitary charge for the length of the contract. Schools will remain liable for the agreements they have made with the authority for contributing to the unitary charge. The governing body of each school included in a PFI contract must sign such an agreement before the PFI contract&#039; can be signed. This commitment does not change if the school changes status.

 The Department does not hold data on the number of hours of school missed due to truancy or the levels of truancy. In 2005, the proportion of half day sessions missed due to unauthorised absence (of which truancy forms a part) in maintained primary schools in Kingston upon Hull North Constituency was 0.60 per cent. and for maintained secondary schools 1.31 per cent. For Kingston upon Hull local authority 0.57 per cent. of half days were missed in primary schools and 2.78 per cent. in secondary schools. The comparative figures for England were 0.43 per cent. for primary schools and 1.23 per cent. for secondary schools. In September 2005, the Government announced a drive against pupils with high unauthorised absences in 146 secondary schools

In cases where the applicant may have a priority need because of vulnerability due to a medical condition, the authority, may wish to seek a specialist medical opinion to help inform their decision, and should have regard to any medical or social services advice obtained.

 In the period January 1999 to December 2005 the National Offender Management Service has been notified of three rapes committed while the offender was subject to the HOC scheme. To break down further the cases listed under the categories of other assault and other violence against the person would incur disproportionate cost.

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="60420w18.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 A wide range of funding streams across government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour at a local level. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; the Department for Education and Skills (DFES) through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need.

<a name="60420w18.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_93">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60420w18.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_94">The Departmental for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour activity. In relation to specific Home Office funding to tackle anti-social behaviour in the last two financial years we have allocated &#163;25,000 to every CDRP in both England and Wales to fund an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator. This amounts to &#163;9.4 million per annum. Funding for 2005&#150;06 was part of the Safer, Stronger Communities Fund (SSCF) and this arrangement will continue for the next two years (2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08).
