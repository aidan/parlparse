<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence published its Defence Industrial Strategy in December 2005. This gives greater transparency to future UK defence requirements and sets out the industrial capabilities which need to be retained in the UK to meet those requirements. In doing so, it recognises that both MOD and industry will need jointly to develop and change their acquisition behaviours to adopt a through life perspective.

 Between November 2003 and December 2005 the cross-Government Conflict Prevention Pools contributed over &#163;30 million towards the training and equipping of the Iraqi Security Forces. It is not possible to collate the cost of the UK forces programme of training the Iraqi army because MOD identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred, not the individual tasks associated with operations.

 I have written to all MPs announcing that a Veterans Day will take place on 27 June 2006 and we will be marking that date as Veterans Day in future years. It is important that the nation should have an opportunity each year to recognise the contribution that veterans have made and that they continue to make to our life in the UK today. It will be a day to focus on veterans of all ages, raising public awareness of their achievements and celebrating these. The day will also be an appropriate occasion to celebrate the service given by those currently serving in the armed forces.

<p><a name="qn_9"><a name="60227w01.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Harper: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> legal regime and <i>(b)</i> rules of engagement govern the activities of United Kingdom armed forces in Afghanistan as part of (i) the international security assistance force and (ii) Operation Enduring Freedom; and whether these will change in respect of the forthcoming Allied Rapid Reaction Corps deployment.  [48772]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew9"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 British troops in Afghanistan are deployed primarily under the international security assistance force (ISAF). ISAF operates at the request of the Afghan Government and with the authorisation of the United Nations. The latest Security Council resolution on the ISAF (UNSCR 1623) was agreed on 13 September 2005, and will remain in force until October 2006. UK troops deployed under Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) operate in Afghanistan with the consent of the Afghan Government.

<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">UK troops in Afghanistan, whether under ISAF or OEF, will continue to act under UK rules of engagement (ROE), which ensure that UK military actions are consistent with UK law. However, as has been the practice of successive Governments, I am unable to comment in detail on the ROE under which our armed forces operate.

<a name="60227w01.html_para4">

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The role of British troops deployed as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Helmand is to support the Afghan Government as it extends its authority across the entire country and to assist its national security forces to maintain security. Responsibility for protection of sites and artefacts of archaeological or historical value lies primarily with the Government of Afghanistan. However, UK troops will show the utmost respect for local people, customs and Afghanistan&#039;s culture.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 A key role of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan is to provide a stable security environment to facilitate development 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Feb 2006 : Column 4W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and reconstruction work done by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and others. The UK will deploy the HQ Group of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead the ISAF for a period of nine months from May 2006. British troops deploying to Helmand will support a UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, which will help enable NGOs to operate in that province.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the unrest in Afghanistan on 4 and 5 February on the security situation there; and if he will make a statement.  [50364]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The unrest that occurred between 4 and 5 February in Helmand province will have little impact on the overall security situation in Afghanistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The incident initially gave cause for concern due to the significant numbers of insurgents and tribesmen involved in what is assessed to be a well planned and executed operation. However, the response by Afghan Security Forces against a determined and well organised enemy, with minimal coalition support, clearly demonstrates the increasing capability of the ANA and ANP.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 6 February 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> column 817W on Afghanistan, how the expected breach of Harmony guidelines caused by the planned deployment to Afghanistan will be managed.  [50728]</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Harmony guidelines are measured by average Tour Intervals for units and personnel. Breaches are managed in a number of ways, including through tailoring of force packages to achieve objectives in the most efficient way possible, and sensitive posting and deployment of personnel. Pressure is further alleviated through contributions made by other Allies, which we continue to encourage through the NATO force generation process, and through eventual reductions in UK force commitments elsewhere. Over the longer-term, programmes such as the Future Army Structure will help to bring Tour Intervals in line with Harmony guidelines.

 I cannot comment on threat specific assessments for reasons of operational security.

<a name="stpa_7">However, I am not aware of any credible evidence to suggest that insurgents or their techniques and procedures have infiltrated Helmand Province from Iraq or Iran. Helmand does not share a border with either country, but the armed forces of Pakistan have made extensive efforts, at considerable loss of life, to improve the rule of law along their border with Afghanistan. Iran has stated that it supports the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan and the efforts of

[53831]</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60227w01.html_spnew15"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Under the terms of NATO&#039;s Operational Plan, ISAF troops can support Afghan counter-narcotics forces and operations in a number of ways, including by training Afghan forces, sharing information on the opium trade, supporting the counter-narcotics information campaign, and providing enabling support for Afghan counter-narcotics efforts. ISAF will also help provide the security environment in which the rule of law can be applied, traffickers can be effectively targeted by Afghan forces and a diversified economy capable of providing sustainable legal rural livelihoods for the farmers can be developed.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what the retirement age is for civil servants; and whether his Department plans to change it.  [51496]</p>

 Departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff below the senior civil service subject only to the requirement that the minimum age at which civil servants can retire with full superannuation benefits is 60.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_52">Against this background, over 80 per cent. of the civil service now has the option to remain in work until 65, and a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions.

<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para1">
The normal retirement age for the senior civil service is 60. However, heads of departments and agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain members of the senior civil service beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60227w12.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_53">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will result in the normal retirement age in the United Kingdom being 65. As a result employers will not have to justify the decision to retire an employee after that age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of all its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants.

 DFID&#039;s only current bilateral support for alternative livelihoods (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production) is in Afghanistan. Here, DFID&#039;s alternative livelihoods programme was developed substantially after full-blown conflict ended in 2001, although terrorist violence continues in parts of the country where we are supporting the Government to promote alternatives to poppy production. DFID also supports a UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) project in Myanmar, which aims to support the local population in meeting their food security needs following the banning of opium production.

In past years (projects starting in the 1990s), DFID supported alternative livelihoods programmes in Pakistan (&#163;4.4 million) that aimed to reduce poppy cultivation, and in Bolivia (&#163;720,000) and Peru (&#163;3.2 million) that aimed to reduce coca production, including projects led by UN drugs control agencies. A further &#163;16 million was provided in the 1980s and 90s to broader agricultural research projects in non coca-growing areas of Bolivia of which some 10&#150;20 per cent. may have had an impact on coca-growing households in adjacent areas. Some of these programmes coincided with periods of conflict and terrorist violence.

 Afghanistan is the only country where DFID has a bilateral alternative livelihoods programme (i.e. alternatives to drug crop production). The Afghan Government launched its updated National Drug Control Strategy at the London Conference in January which sets out the Afghan Governments policies and plans for tackling Afghanistan&#039;s narcotics trade for the coming three years and highlights four key priorities. These are (i) targeting the trafficker and trade, (ii) strengthening and diversifying legal livelihoods, (iii) developing effective counter-narcotics institutions and (iv) demand reduction. The UK has a three year plan to support this and DFID leads on UK support for alternative livelihoods.

<a name="stpa_91">Between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 DFID&#039;s spending on alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan has increased ten fold. The forecast spend for this year is in the region of &#163;45 million and we hope to maintain similar levels of funding in future years. The DFID livelihoods programme will support the Afghan Government&#039;s efforts to mitigate the impact of those who have lost their livelihoods, through the expansion of key Afghan Government National Programmes into priority poppy growing provinces; support programmes to improve farm and off-farm opportunities for poor Afghan farmers and labourers to access legal income from sustainable legal employment, credit productive assets such as infrastructure and social assets such as education and health services, and markets for legal goods; help generate an improved policy and planning environment for alternative livelihood programmes; and support greater financial and technical support from other donors, delivered in a more coherent manner in line with the Afghan Government&#039;s policies and plans.

<a name="stpa_92">The success criterion for alternative livelihoods is a 10 per cent. year-on-year increase in uptake of legal livelihood opportunities. However success is highly dependant on progress with other strands of the National Drug Control Strategy, in particular improving the capacity of counter-narcotics institutions, law enforcement capacity and success in targeting the trafficker and trade.

 The African Union Mission in Sudan covers the three states of Darfur (Western, Northern and Southern). Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.

<a name="stpa_94">Darfur remains highly dependent on food aid. Although this year there is expected to be above average food production, the ability of Darfuris to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas.

week, I announced an additional &#163;20 million in support of the AU mission. The AU has performed well in very challenging circumstances but the deterioration in security in Darfur since the end of 2005 has been marked by an increase in violence and banditry. This change has underlined that a peace support mission will be required for quite some time. This is why the UK supports the proposed transition from an AU force to a UN operation that will be able to provide the long-term stability required. While the final decision on transfer needs to come from the AU, I welcome their agreement in principle on 12 January and the UN&#039;s planning for such a contingency. Any timetable for this transition will depend on negotiations at the AU and UN.

I stressed the importance of the AU force continuing to be fully supported and strengthened right up until any transition date. The role the AU plays in providing support to the humanitarian agencies and protecting civilians is critical to the people of Darfur and there cannot be any winding down of effectiveness in anticipation of the UN arriving. The UK, therefore, in addition to providing substantial funding, is encouraging our international partners to maintain and increase their levels of support to the AU. This includes taking forward the recommendations of the December 2005 Joint Assessment Mission which will assist in strengthening the AU&#039;s capabilities.

 There is considerable suffering in Tanzania owing to the present food insecurity. The Government of Tanzania has made effective use of its Strategic Grain Reserve to deliver grain to vulnerable households, although the continuing drought means this is now under pressure. A Rapid Vulnerability Assessment (RVA), conducted by the Government in response to the food and water situation was circulated on 13 February. The RVA found that 3.8 million Tanzanians need food assistance to the tune of 100,000 metric tonnes up to the next expected harvest in May. Of those, around 565,000 are considered destitute and need immediate food aid. DFID stands ready to help the Government respond to this situation. We are consulting with other agencies, notably the World Food Programme, to determine the robustness of the RVA and inform decisions on assistance. DFID&#039;s response will be based on a proposal received from the Government of Tanzania, outlining what additional resources it needs from donors, and how it would like them delivered. Other donors are also likely to respond to the Government&#039;s proposal.
