 The most recent statistics<sup>(1)</sup> show that since 2000, waste (business and municipal) has grown significantly less than the UK&#146;s gross domestic product (GDP).

to businesses to improve their resource efficiency and to minimise the levels of waste that are unnecessarily sent to landfill. For example, the BREW Programme funds the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). NISP matches one operator&#146;s waste with another&#146;s raw material needs. In the first two years of its operation, in the region of 1.7 million tonnes of material have been diverted from landfill, with &#163;70 million of cost savings.</p>

Around &#163;4 has been saved by business for each &#163;1 of BREW-funded advice and support. There were also reductions in water use, waste sent to landfill and the amounts of raw materials used by businesses. Many of the benefits will be seen beyond 2005-06, and work is currently under way to assess the impact of programme spending in 2006-07. More details about the BREW Programme can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>

 The UK has been actively engaged in removing landmines and explosive remnants of war worldwide. This has had a real impact in reducing civilian casualties. The UK is contributing funds towards humanitarian de-mining programmes and initiatives to train de-mining personnel in Kenya and Kosovo and has built an explosive destruction facility in Bosnia. In addition since 2001, the Department for International Development has contracted at least &#163;10 million per year on mine action. In April 2007, DFID announced a further &#163;30 million to mine action over the next three years.</p>

 The Government are committed to increasing diversity and equality of opportunity in UK institutions. The Ministry of Justice is working with the judiciary and Judicial Appointments Commission to increase diversity, for example, by promoting the judicial service and widening the range of people eligible to apply for judicial office.

However, there is still a long way to go; only 2.3 per cent. of MPs are from non-white backgrounds, compared to around 8 per cent. of the population. The Discrimination Law Review is considering the case for widening the scope of positive measures to target the selection of political candidates beyond gender. It is also looking at how to widen the range of voluntary positive action measures available to organisations as employees and service providers in order to prevent or compensate for disadvantage or to meet the special needs of groups protected by discrimination law.

 Noise data are not available to estimate noise levels between junctions five and seven of the M3 for each of the last 20 years. As explained in the answers of 27 June 2005, assessments of noise severity are made using the &#147;Calculation of Road Traffic Noise&#148; (CRTN model) which use distance from source, exposure, obstacles and traffic levels. Each of these factors varies significantly at any point along the road length. The range would vary between less than 60 dB to more than 72.5 dB at the road surface.</p>

<i> [holding answer</i><i> s </i><i> 11 June 2007]: </i>The UK Government fully support academic freedom and are firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics. While I appreciate the independence of the UCU, I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions. I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the middle east peace process, in fact the reverse. Within both Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories there are both progressives and reactionaries. The problem with academic boycotts and the problem with what the UCU is proposing is that it makes the job of the progressives more difficult and it could reinforce the stance of those who take a hard line position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70618w0008.htm_para2"><a name="07061829000083">I have recently returned from a visit to Israel where I met with both Israeli and Palestinian academics. These discussions have reinforced my view that a boycott would be inconsistent with the spirit of openness and tolerance that should inform public life. Education plays a vital role in developing and aiding understanding between different people. It is therefore all the more important to keep open channels of communication with academics and educational institutions during these difficult times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70618w0008.htm_para3"><a name="07061829000084">As an independent body, the union would be free to take any action, within the law, voted for by its members. UCU members, like all HE employees, must behave in accordance with their institution's own anti-discrimination policies and the UK's wider legislative framework on employment and equality.</p>

 There is an assumed fee contribution for all further education provision funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), including courses in lip-reading. For 2007/08 the assumed fee element will be 37.5 per cent. meaning that LSC funding will continue to account for at least 62.5 per cent. of the cost of all LSC funded FE courses. A large number of learners also benefit from full fee remission including all 16 to 18-year-olds and those on means tested benefits including those in receipt of the Pension (Guarantee) Credit.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 June 2007]:</i> We have increased investment in further education by 48 per cent. in real terms between 1997 and 2006. In line with our Skills Strategy, first set out in the Skills White Paper 2003, public funding needs to be focused on helping those without the basic and level 2 skills for employment and further progression in learning. This is a planned and continuing strategy to respond to the skills challenges we have as a country.

Across the college sector in London, there is a comparatively high volume of places at entry and level 1, in particular ESOL, but there are fewer places available at level 2. There is a high proportion of the adult population who are low skilled and the LSC with colleges is keen to support employability both amongst disadvantaged groups and those in low skilled employment. To do this, it is important that there is a balance of vocational programmes at lower and higher levels. In 2005/06, some two thirds of adult provision at Westminster Kingsway College was ESOL and we wish to work with the college to achieve a range of vocational places and different levels leading into employment and higher skills.</p>

The consequence of this additional funding will be that the budget for Westminster Kingsway College is unlikely to show a reduction in real terms against 2006/07. In view of this outcome, we do not envisage that the financial health of the college will be adversely impacted by the 2007/08 budget change.</p>

 The UK is a strong supporter of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, established under an agreement between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the UN. The purpose of the Tribunal is to bring to trial those most responsible for serious violations of Cambodian and international law and custom during the period from 17 April 1975 to 6 January 1979.</p>

Regulations in force since 2004 establish criteria for the recognition of hitherto non-sanctioned religious groups.

UNDP has been required to purchase items such as fuel and telecommunications services and pay rent for its premises, and the authorities remain the sole provider of such services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70618w0011.htm_para12"><a name="07061837000150">UNDP has a network of approximately 1,500 national staff based in the 57 townships in which the HDI operates in Burma. These staff&#151;at the state/division level, township level and community level&#151;undertake extensive routine process monitoring for all project activities. They are involved in all aspects of implementation, verification of accounts and expenditures, review of problems, and provision of technical support to ensure effective implementation. Their monitoring is supplemented by national programme managers, which in turn is overseen by UNDP international staff who also regularly visit programme sites. No difficulty has been encountered in such monitoring on account of any government control or restrictions. National staff can travel freely; they do not have to ask for travel permission and are not accompanied by counterpart or local officials in the performance of their project work. Internationals do have to ask for permission but there has been no case when permission has been denied. Furthermore, the formulation of the Operating Guidelines by the Government (February 2006) has not had any significant impact on UNDP&#146;s ability to engage effectively in the field, or to abide by its Executive Board mandate, adhering to humanitarian principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70618w0011.htm_para13"><a name="07061837000151">On the basis of their programme monitoring, UNDP provides DFID with periodic written progress reports on HDI activities. This includes substantive information on activities, achievements, challenges/issues and recommendations as required, as well as budgetary information. A detailed financial report accounting for the previous tranche of support from DFID is necessary before the next tranche is provided to UNDP. Donors themselves carry out an annual joint assessment mission to review the HDI programme. Further ad hoc fieldtrips are made by donors to project sites&#151;in DFID&#146;s case, about four times a year.</p>

 The HMRC econometric analysis suggests that the annual suppression of air passengers as a result of the air passenger duty decision announced at pre-Budget report will be around 5 million out of a total 140 million passengers by 2010-11. Translating this figure into flights and emissions reductions suggests that the emissions saving as a result of the decision will be in the range of 0.2-0.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) per year. Taking into account the effect of the other, non-carbon dioxide emissions of aviation suggests that there will be an annual climate change impact equivalent to saving 0.75 million tonnes of carbon by 2010-11 from the change to air passenger duty.</p>

As part of strengthening this process we have signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) on returns with Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, India, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somaliland, United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and Vietnam. The UK has also opted-in to decisions to mandate the EU Commission to negotiate 16 readmission agreements on behalf of member states. In addition, we have bilateral readmission agreements with Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Switzerland. An agreement has been signed with Algeria and is currently in the process of ratification.</p>

 In deciding the consultation period, the Secretary of State had regard to the date of the local elections. The code of practice on local authority publicity makes it clear that local authorities should not at any time use public funds to mount publicity campaigns whose primary purpose is to persuade the public to hold a particular view on a question of policy, and that authorities must take particular care when publicity is issued immediately prior to an election. In particular, where publicity is used to comment on the proposals or policies of central Government or other local authorities the content should be objective, balanced, informative and accurate.</p>

<i> [pursuant to the reply, 8 January 2007, Official Report, c. 1721-24W]: </i>The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70618w0024.htm_para0"><a name="07061837001989">Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in &#147;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2005-06&#148; (HBAI). This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70618w0024.htm_para1"><a name="07061837001990">Pension credit has been highly successful in reducing pensioner poverty; since its introduction, the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by over 700,000. Now, for the first time in a period of sustained economic growth, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole, after housing costs are accounted for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70618w0024.htm_para2"><a name="07061837001991">We continue to make every effort to ensure that pension credit goes to those who are entitled to it. It is more challenging to reach those entitled to smaller amounts, or to the savings credit only, who may be less familiar with the entitlements available to them. The Pension Service has contacted pensioners to encourage them to take up entitlement to pension credit many times already as part of extensive marketing activity. Over 70 per cent. of those pensioners who appear to have entitlement to pension credit have been contacted over five times already. And around 25 per cent. of customers visited about pension credit say that they do not want to make a claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="70618w0024.htm_para3"><a name="07061837001992">However, we are committed to improving take-up and are continually looking at further ways to target these groups and encouraging them to apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="70618w0024.htm_para4"><a name="07061837001993">The information requested for pensioners in Great Britain is shown in the following tables. Estimates of entitled non-recipients of MIG or pension credit should be treated with caution. This is especially the case given that we are looking at the extreme of the income distribution and so are less sure of pensioners&#146; modelled entitlement. Results are based on small sample sizes and have not been corrected for biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income related benefits&#151;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non-recipients but will not all actually be entitled non recipients and vice versa. Figures are therefore presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income.</p>

1. Figures are presented after housing costs as this is our preferred measure for pensioners.<br>
2. Estimates of the pensioner population cover those above state pension age (60 for women and 65 for men). The estimates therefore exclude some men aged 60 to 64 and partners of pensioners aged under 60, who may have been eligible but not claiming pension credit.<br>
3. Estimates also exclude those cases where respondents have reported they are awaiting the outcome of a claim for a benefit and have been modelled as entitled to that benefit.<br>
4. Estimates cover the private household population of Great Britain. The data source is the Family Resources Survey.<br>
5. These figures are calculated using OECD equivalisation factors. Prior to 2002-03 they are based on a GB median and from 2002-03 it is based on a UK median. This is consistent with low income estimates published in the latest edition of Households Below Average Income. The GB median is similar to the UK median.<br>
6. Minimum income guarantee (MIG) was introduced for pensioners in April 1999 paid through income support.<br>
7. Pension credit (PC) was introduced mid-way through 2003-04; therefore, estimates for 2003-04 cover those pensioners who were entitled but not receiving either MIG or PC. As this relates to the first six months of pension credit the figures should be treated with some caution.<br>
8. For the purposes of this analysis, benefit unit based data (take-up statistics) were combined with household equivalised income based results (Households Below Average Income statistics).<br>
9. Estimates for 2000-01 and 2003-04 onwards incorporate the results of a data matching exercise, which links the Family Resources Survey with DWP administrative data in order to identify &#145;hidden recipients&#146; of MIG-PC, i.e. those people who tell the FRS they do not receive pension credit, but actually do.<br>
10. Estimates are presented as proportions of the total pensioner population below the 40 per cent. of median household income, as the analysis is based on single-year survey data and the absolute numbers of such pensioners who were not claiming the pension credit or minimum income guarantee they were entitled to might be biased due to small sample sizes.<br>
11. These analyses have not been corrected for the biases that may be inherent in estimates of entitlement to income-related benefits&#151;that is, they may be based on the data for those who appear to be entitled non recipients (ENRs) but will not all actually be ENRs and vice versa&#151;and so they should be treated with some caution.<br>
12.The estimates relate only to those who were modelled as entitled to receive benefit but were not identified to be in receipt of any amount of benefit. It therefore does not include cases where a pensioner is in receipt of some benefit, but this is less than the amount they are truly entitled to. Including these cases may not give a reliable indication of full take-up due to the potential error that exists in modelling entitlement.<br>

 The primary dental service resource allocations awarded to primary care trusts for 2006-07 took into account expenditure on general dental services and personal dental services pilots in each area during the reference period October 2004 to September 2005. This captured payments for both general dental services and specialist services such as orthodontic services. The allocations also included adjustments to reflect nationally agreed increases in dentists&#146; remuneration, provision for growth plans previously submitted to and approved by the Department, and some margin to accommodate any new services that may have started during or after the reference period but could not be fully reflected in the calculation of reference period earnings.</p>

1. The data relates to claims from dentists working under the terms of the former general dental services (GDS) only. It excludes orthodontic work carried out within former personal dental service (PDS) pilots, where the value of orthodontic as opposed to general dental treatments can be less easily identified. The Department is aware of at least two specialist orthodontic practices, in Doncaster Central and Rotherham, which converted to personal dental service pilots either before or during the reference period, which would mean the GDS data above is not fully representative of all elements of orthodontic care.<br>
2. The data is presented by the primary care trust (PCT) areas that were operational during the reference period, rather than the new PCTs that assumed responsibility for services from 1 October 2006.<br>

 Consultancy services for advertising campaigns should be understood as the provision of strategic advice on campaigns, not their delivery. Most Government advertising is bought through the Central Office of Information (COI) and under the terms of COI framework agreements advertising agencies are contracted to supply advertising services only, i.e., creative products based on a communications strategy. Advertising agencies (on COI&#146;s roster) do not supply broader consultancy services. On occasion wider ranging consultancy projects may inform campaign work but the costs would not be attributed to the campaign.</p>

 Drug Analysis Prints (DAPs) are reports that collect together information on suspected adverse drug reactions submitted to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the yellow card scheme. The programme for resolving the technical and data issues relating to the production of DAP on the MHRA website is ongoing. This is a high priority for the Agency and full resolution is planned by the end of the 2007-08 business year. The Agency does provide anonymised information on suspected adverse drug reactions upon request to the general public, health professionals, and pharmaceutical companies, interim measures are in place for providing these data ad-hoc in an equivalent, non-automated, format to the DAP.</p>

payments are repayable in the event of subsequent non-commencement of services and are protected by bonds or charges against assets, which enable the payments to be withdrawn on demand. Moreover, forward payments are typically made after the contractor has already incurred the costs to which the payments relate. This prudent approach has subsequently been adopted as an option in guidance issued by the Office of Government Commerce in respect of the procurement of IT-enabled services from the private sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="70618w0029.htm_para17"><a name="07061910000349">The value of forward payments made to local service providers (LSPs) since inception of NPfIT, as at 31 March 2007 are shown in the following tables. Forward payments are depleted as the supplier successfully delivers the contracted solutions. Instead of being paid as the projects go live, suppliers are allowed to recognise the appropriate amount of the forward payment for that project. The principle of payment on delivery is thus maintained.</p>

 The information requested regarding the numbers of patients treated with maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is not held centrally. However, there is one such medical grade maggot which is now available on prescription in the United Kingdom so that general practitioners can use MDT in the community. There were around 1,100 prescriptions written for dispensing in the community for LarvE (the commercial brand name for the sterile maggots) in 2005, which does not include hospital use.</p>

The actual costs of treating difficult to heal wounds have not been measured. If specific services for the management of difficult to heal surgical wounds were to be developed throughout the NHS, there would be organisational and cost implications, which would need to be evaluated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="70618w0031.htm_para10"><a name="07061910000522">The Health Technology Assessment Programme funded a trial of MDT to be undertaken by the Department of Health Sciences of the University of York. The study started on 1 June 2004, involving 600 patients with venous leg ulcers who were randomised to one of three treatment groups to compare their effects on healing and debridement times. The Government, through the Health Technology Assessment Programme, agreed to fund this study, which had been several years in the planning and cost over &#163;700,000. The report of the research is expected in early 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="70618w0031.htm_para11"><a name="07061910000523">MDT may cause pain or discomfort, particularly in patients already experiencing wound pain. This usually occurs about 24-36 hours into therapy and worsens as the larvae grow larger, Painkillers should help to relieve the pain; otherwise removing the maggot dressing provides immediate relief. The maggots should be contained within the wound. If they escape onto unprotected skin around the edges of the wound, the larvae secretions can cause a rash on the skin which resembles a superficial burn.</p>

 Extendable batons were issued in 2005 to all staff who carried the outdated wooden stave. Officers in juvenile establishments have never carried staves and at the time of the introduction of batons consideration was not given to widening their use.
