<a name="00310w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales for the period 2 May 1997 to 29 February 2000 what was <i>(a)</i> the number of occasions on which couriers were used to distribute news releases from his Department and <i>(b)</i> the total cost of using couriers to distribute news releases.  [113978]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will list the <i>(a)</i> national, <i>(b)</i> regional and <i>(c)</i> local newspapers and media bodies to which his Department sent news releases during the period 2 May 1997 to 29 February 2000.  [113988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Wales Office deals with a variety of newspapers and media bodies, with distribution relying on the subject and content of the specific press release. Furthermore, all media outlets can request press releases. All press releases issued are available on the Wales Office website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales on how many occasions <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his predecessors met with (i) the Chairperson and (ii) the board of non-departmental public bodies in Wales since May 1997; and on how many occasions a press statement was issued on the matters discussed and agreed at the meeting.  [113312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 There are currently 14 non- departmental public bodies in Wales sponsored by the National Assembly, but the list of such bodies has changed since May 1997 and the frequency of meetings with the Chairpersons and boards of these organisations varies considerably from one body to another.
<P>

<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 A five-strong selection panel chaired by the Secretary of the Cabinet, Sir Richard Wilson, and including an independent assessor will determine the final shortlist for both the position of chairman and the positions of independent members; the Prime Minister 



<P>

will then make the formal appointment. The procedure will follow the principles of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.
<P>

<a name="00310w01.html_para1">We hope to have the House of Lords Appointments Commission in place by April. However, these are important appointments and we do not intend the process of making them to be skimped to meet a self-imposed artificial deadline.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 There were no occasions on which couriers were used to distribute news releases from my Department. No cost was involved.

<P>

<a name="00310w01.html_para2">Press Releases are available to all press via the news distribution service managed by the Central Office of Information and are also available on the Internet. Targeted distribution will rely on the subject and content of the specific press release.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when his Department last <i>(a)</i> purchased and <i>(b)</i> issued for use new supplies of anthrax vaccine.  [113001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence last purchased supplies of anthrax vaccine in 1991 from the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research, the sole manufacturer in the UK. No new vaccine has since been supplied. The anthrax vaccine issued from 1993 onwards has had its shelf-life extended by the Medicines Control Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the membership of the Independent Panel on Gulf War Illnesses, including the term of appointment in each case and any changes to the membership; how often it meets; and if he will make a statement.  [113958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Independent Panel on Vaccines Interactions was established to scrutinise all aspects of proposals for research into the potential adverse effects of interactions between the vaccines and tablets which could have been administered to Service personnel at the time of the Gulf conflict. The Panel is chaired by Professor Donald Davies. The other Panel members are: Professor J. E. Banatvala, Professor P. Beverley, Dr. J. Bird, 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2000 : Column: 827W</I><P>
Dr. A. Boylston, Dr. P. Fawcett, Professor A. Grossman, Professor Malcolm Hooper, Dr. Ian Kimber, Dr. Norman Jones, Professor Stafford Lightman, Dr. Christopher Martyn, Dr. Elizabeth Miller, Dr. David Ray, Professor E. M. Sedgwick, Professor A. Silman and Dr. Geoffrey Schild.
<P>

<a name="00310w01.html_para3">The Panel has met on four occasions since December 1997. The frequency of the meetings is dictated by the research programme. Professor Davies was appointed chairman in January 1999. Professor Hooper, Dr. Schild and Dr. Kimber have all joined the Panel since the first meeting. Panel members are not appointed for a specific term.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason no minutes were taken of the meeting on 29 March 1999 between Professor Hooper and the Independent Panel on Gulf War Illnesses; if he will place copies of the presentations made at the meeting in the Library; and if he will make a statement.  [113898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 On the evening of 29 March 1999, the Head of the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme gave a presentation on Gulf veterans' illnesses to the Independent Panel, of which Professor Hooper is a member. Only personal notes were used and, as the presentation was informal, no minutes were taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence uses the Central Office of Information (COI) News Distribution Service. Until April 1998, we subscribed to their courier service. For the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1998 we used the couriers on 240 occasions at a total cost of &#163;9,600 (240 x &#163;40).
<P>

<a name="00310w01.html_para4">From April 1998, MOD has distributed press releases electronically and by fax only, through the COI News Distribution Service. Press releases are also posted on the Internet.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 2 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 325W, on peat compost, what percentage of the compost used in his Department's estate gardens 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2000 : Column: 828W</I><P>
is peat; when use of peat compost will be phased out on his Department's estates; and if he will make a statement.  [114144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information on what percentage of the compost used in my Department's estate gardens is peat, is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. All indications are, however, that such use of peat is infrequent. My officials are currently assessing the full impact of phasing out the use of peat on the MOD estate and it is anticipated that an action plan will be in place by the summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In the present Parliament, Defence Ministers have not given evidence to any Select Committee of the House of Commons other than to the Defence Committee inquiring on their own or when acting in partnership with other Select Committees. However, I have just agreed to give oral evidence to the International Development Select Committee as part of that Committee's inquiry into Mozambique.
<P>

<a name="00310w01.html_para5">Memoranda have been submitted by the Department to the Foreign Affairs Committee, Transport Sub-Committee, Agriculture Committee, Treasury Sub-Committee, Environment Sub-Committee, Environmental Audit Committee, the Science and Technology Committee, and the Public Accounts Committee.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Far too little attention has been paid to local procurement in the past. Sound local procurement of goods and services gives a substantial development benefit. DFID is taking steps to increase both our use of local resources and our capacity to carry out local procurement effectively. We have recently appointed two procurement advisers with the remit of increasing the use of local consultants in Africa and India. We are increasingly working with our development partners to strengthen their own capacity to undertake procurement competently. Over the last two years the percentage of consultancy services which we purchased locally rose from 5 per cent. to 12 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many Health and Safety Executive inspections were made to sites operated by licensed asbestos removal companies in the last year for which figures are available; and how many were found to be breaking the law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's (HMRI) Railway Inspectorate monitors and enforces safety on Britain's railways. Responsibility for the safety, welfare and convenience of passengers rests with railway operators.
<P>

<a name="00310w02.html_para2">The HMRI has a planned inspection programme, including inspections of Central Trains Ltd. The last inspection of the activities of Central Trains, Railtrack and the track maintenance contractor between the Birmingham and Shrewsbury line was on 7 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="00310w02.html_para3">The inspector was generally content with the drivers' competence and the track layout and condition on the Birmingham to Shrewsbury line. HMRI are pursuing some matters with the maintenance contractor regarding the condition of certain sections of track, where drainage appeared to be a problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Landfill site operators may claim landfill tax credits for voluntary contributions to support specified environmental objectives. As we said in response to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee's report on the operation of the Landfill Tax, we are discussing with industry the setting of indicative guidelines for the distribution of funds to each objective under the credit scheme, in line with the priorities we set out in our draft waste strategy "A Way with Waste".

<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The EC Landfill Directive will prohibit from disposal in landfill sites special wastes which are infectious clinical wastes or which, in the conditions of landfill, are explosive, corrosive, oxidising, or flammable. The Directive will allow the disposal of other special and toxic waste to landfills, provided that the waste meets the acceptance criteria in Annexe II of the Directive. The Directive prohibits the landfill of all liquid wastes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many tour buses are registered to operate in <i>(a)</i> London, <i>(b)</i> Oxford, <i>(c)</i> Cambridge, <i>(d)</i> Bath and <i>(e)</i> Stratford upon Avon; and how many are entitled to a fuel-duty rebate.  [113440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Local bus service registrations outside London do not identify tour buses as a separate category. It is not therefore possible to supply the information requested for items <i>(b)</i> to <i>(e)</i>. In London, around 68 London Local Service Licences have been granted by the Traffic Commissioner for excursions and tours.
<P>

<a name="00310w02.html_para4">Fuel Duty Rebate is paid on bus services which are registered with the Traffic Commissioner as a local bus service, and which meet the requirements of the relevant Regulations, designed to ensure that, among other things, they are available to the general public. Fuel Duty Rebate claims do not separately identify tour buses.

<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he plans to take to increase the income from Packaging Recovery Notes to ensure the continuing recovery and recycling of glass and other waste materials; and if he will make a statement.  [113423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The main purpose of the Packaging Waste Recovery Note (PRN) is to enable those obligated under the packaging Regulations to demonstrate compliance with their obligations. In addition, the PRN is intended to direct the necessary resources at increasing collection and reprocessing capacity in the UK and developing end-use markets for recyclate. The PRN system is a market-based system and PRN prices are therefore affected both by the balance between targets and available capacity and by developments in the international market. Prices for both virgin and recycled materials are currently low.
<P>

<a name="00310w02.html_para5">Given the targets in the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste that the UK must meet in 2001, it is clear that a considerable increase in recovery will be needed between now and 2001 if the targets are to be met and we would expect this to influence PRN prices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> The letter from MAFF on the 1982 Seeds Regulations was circulated to Departments for information only. Since the matter was clearly for MAFF, and not a matter for DETR, a response was not necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2000]:</i> Those school bus services which are registered with the Traffic Commissioner as local bus services, and which are normally available to, and used by, the general public, are already eligible for bus fuel duty rebate.
<P>

<a name="00310w03.html_para0">Possible changes to the scope of bus fuel duty rebate are currently being considered as part of the Commission for Integrated Transport's review of value for money from public financial support for bus services.
<P>

<a name="00310w03.html_para1">At this stage no estimate has been made of the cost of extending eligibility for the rebate specifically to dial-a- ride schemes or to those school bus services which are currently not eligible. Any such estimates would depend on the precise definition of the newly eligible services which was adopted for the purpose and a forecast of eligible mileage run by them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Town and Country Planning (Blight Provisions) (England) Order, laid today, will raise from &#163;18,000 to &#163;24,600 the annual rateable value limit at or below which businesses are eligible to serve a blight notice. The change, which will come into effect on 1 April 2000, means that small businesses will not be disadvantaged when the year 2000 non-domestic rate revaluation comes into effect on the same date.
<P>

<a name="00310w03.html_para2">The new threshold also applies to businesses claiming compensation for loss of value under Part I of the Land Compensation Act 1973 when their premises are affected by physical factors such as noise, vibration, fumes and artificial lighting from the use of new or altered public works such as highways and aerodromes.

<P>

 The Port Marine Safety Code is being published on Monday and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. The Code represents an important waypoint in the development with all parties in the ports and shipping industry of an agreed national standard for the discharge by harbour authorities of their legal functions relating to marine safety. It applies to port marine operations the well-established principles of risk assessment and safety management systems. It establishes a measure by which harbour authorities can be accountable for the legal powers and duties which they have to run their harbours safely. We are asking all harbour authorities with these obligations, to prepare plans to implement the Code by the end of 2001. In the meantime, work will continue with the industry to develop competence standards for all port marine professionals, and associated qualifications. We are also supporting the development of a guide to good practice on port marine operations, which we hope will be completed this year.

 The Government Purchasing Agency follows the guidance issued by the Secretary of State in his Policy Statement on Green Housekeeping, which closely follows the model policy statement.

<P>
<a name="00310w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The FSC label is accepted by buyers as demonstrating that timber and timber products have come from sustainably managed sources. However, it is not practicable to require that all paper and timber products purchased by the Department are independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council because this might discriminate against any equally valid schemes and therefore be against procurement rules.
<P>

<a name="00310w03.html_para9">Specifying just the FSC label might also result in us failing to meet all our requirements as currently only a tiny percentage of timber products are currently FSC certified. That is why the Department's policy statement for greening its operations suggests that evidence of sustainability might take the form of a certificate issued under a credible, preferably independent, verification scheme; or other documents which demonstrate the operation of an environmental management system

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assurances have been given by Barclays and other banks committed to installing cash terminals in branch post offices as regards <i>(a)</i> access and <i>(b)</i> charges for customers belonging to banks and mutuals which do not have the same outlets; and what impact the decision of the LINK group of banks to allow ATM charging will have on the assurances.  [113179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend considers that the imposition of such charges will impact disproportionately on the socially excluded and those in rural areas. People on fixed budgets, particularly pensioners and the unemployed, should not be charged &#163;2.50 a time to withdraw small amounts of cash. If charges are to be introduced, we will ensure that consumers know what they are before they proceed with a transaction. If the banks will not do this voluntarily, my right hon. Friend has powers under the Prices Act 1974 to compel them.
<P>

<a name="00310w05.html_para0">Under the new Competition Act 1998, the Director General of Fair Trading can investigate whether the LINK agreement on surcharges is in any way anti-competitive and he now has powers to impose severe penalties for infringements of the prohibitions of the Act.
<P>

<a name="00310w05.html_para1">I understand that the Post Office does not have a commercial agreement with Barclays regarding the installation of cash machines in post offices. Contract arrangement with the proposed partners have not yet been finalised.
<P>

<a name="00310w05.html_para2">No assurances have been provided by potential partners, nor have they indicated yet how they will react to the LINK decision on charging which is under review. Access and charging arrangements will, in the first instance, be commercial matters for the Post Office and its partners.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 2000]:</i> Our "Social Inclusion: Pupil Support" guidance, issued in July 1999, makes clear that all Local Education Authorities should receive annual information from school governing bodies on the pattern and frequency of racist incidents in schools. It is for Local Education Authorities to decide how best to develop strategies to support schools, pupils and students in addressing racism, in the light of the information they receive each year. This would include joint working with local police forces, where this is appropriate.

 European Structural Funding is used alongside, and matched by, money already provided at the national and local level.

<a name="00310w09.html_para1">The effect of the UK abatement is, broadly, to refund around two thirds of the difference between the UK's gross contributions to and receipts from the EC Budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will wind up the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board; and if he will make a statement.  [114489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Under the original criminal injuries compensation scheme, established in August 1964, compensation was assessed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) on the basis of common law damages. That scheme was superseded from 1 April 1996 by a tariff-based scheme administered by two new bodies, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel (CICAP). The Board was then left with the residual task of dealing with all outstanding claims lodged before 1 April 1996. There were some 110,000 such cases.
<P>

<a name="00310w09.html_para4">By the end of the current financial year, the Board will have resolved over 100,000 of those cases and its work will largely be done. The Board will accordingly be wound up on 31 March 2000. Any residual old scheme cases still outstanding at that time will be transferred for resolution by legally qualified members of CICAP in accordance with the transitional provisions of the 1996 scheme. Present estimates are that around 6,000 cases will be transferred. The Panel will be set the target of clearing them within two years. The Panel is being strengthened considerably to ensure that it can cope with this additional workload without prejudicing its capacity to deal with appeals made under the 1996 scheme.
<P>

<a name="00310w09.html_para5">I am sure that Ministers in previous Administrations would wish to join me in extending a sincere vote of thanks to all Board members, past and present, for the care and dedication with which they have dealt with claims over the past 35 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many individuals have their DNA recorded on the DNA national database;  [113922]

(3) what recent reports he has received concerning DNA evidence matched using the DNA national database being used to correct miscarriages of justice on appeal; and if he will make a statement concerning the number of such cases, the nature of the use of the DNA national database for this purpose and his future plans for its use.  [113920]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The National DNA Database holds the DNA profiles, obtained from samples of those suspected, cautioned or convicted of a recordable offence, for intelligence purposes. The Database also holds profiles obtained from crime stains left at the scenes of crime. It is managed and operated on behalf of the police by the Forensic Science Service. It currently holds over 700,000 profiles of individuals.
<P>

<a name="00310w10.html_para0">The Home Secretary has received no reports concerning inaccurate matches. The DNA Database reports a possible suspect to the Police for further investigation. If as a result, the DNA information is likely to be used as evidence, a further sample is taken from the suspect for analysis and a report on a match by a forensic science reporting officer.
<P>

<a name="00310w10.html_para1">The Home Secretary has received no reports concerning the DNA database and alleged miscarriages of justice. The DNA database would not normally be used for this purpose. If the Criminal Cases Review Commission

(CCRC) asked the Forensic Science Service to review DNA evidence in a specific case, the results would be recorded on the individual CCRC case file.
<P>

<a name="00310w10.html_para2">There are no plans to alter the existing role of the National DNA database. Last year, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced an additional investment of &#163;34 million over the next two years to launch a programme to expand the National DNA Database so that it holds profiles of all active criminals, to be matched against samples taken from crime scenes. This will increase the Database's effectiveness as an intelligence tool.

 There have been two major inquiries since 1992 into alleged corruption with Cleveland police, known as Operations Lancet and Teak.

In Operation Lancet, the final decision as to whether any officer will face prosecution is now a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when it was decided that towns competing for city status for the third millennium needed a population in excess of 200,000 to qualify.  [113848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No such decision has been made. Although population size is taken into account by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in submitting a recommendation to Her Majesty the Queen, the grant of city status is not a right that can be claimed by a town fulfilling certain criteria, but an honour conferred by the Sovereign by Letters Patent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the <i>(a)</i> national, <i>(b)</i> regional and <i>(c)</i> local newspapers and media bodies to which his Department sent news releases during the period 2 May 1997 to 29 February 2000.  [113997]<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Home Office press releases are distributed in a number of different ways including electronically, by fax, e-mail and by post. All are now posted on the Home Office website. National media receive all Home Office press releases while others, depending on a range of factors such as subject and content, are distributed to the regional, local or specialist media. Identifying the distribution list of every press release since 2 May 1997 would, however, incur disproportionate costs. If the hon. Member would like to write to me about a particular news release that he has in mind, I would be happy to provide any further information that is available.

<P>
<UL>(2) what is the stated recommended dose of the drug Epilim when administering it to (a) adults and (b) children.  [107570]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 As with all medicines, the safety of Epilim, the anticonvulsant sodium valproate, is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) through the Yellow Card Scheme for spontaneous reporting of suspected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). A number of articles have been published in the bulletin 'Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance' to draw ADRs associated with Epilim to the attention of health professionals.
<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_para0">23 suspected ADRs associated with the drug Epilim, all involving children between the ages of 2-11, have been reported to the MCA/CSM from the beginning of 1995 to date. Two of these cases had fits. Reporting of a suspected adverse reaction is not necessarily evidence that the medicine caused the reaction.
<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_para1">In the same period in the United Kingdom, 22 cases of birth defects for women exposed to the drug Epilim during pregnancy were reported to the MCA/CSM. The product information for Epilim contains detailed advice about use in pregnancy and the prescribing physician should weigh up the risks and benefits in the individual woman's case. The number of cases since 1995 where Epilim has been given to pregnant women is not available.
<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_para2">Epilim is contraindicated in all patients including children where there is allergy to sodium valproate, active liver disease or family history of severe liver disease.
<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_para3">The daily dose of the drug Epilim as stated in the Marketing Authorisation for adults and children over 20 kilograms is gradually increased until control of fits is achieved, usually to within the range 20-30 milligrams/ kilograms body weight per day. For children under 20kg, the daily dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight per day may be exceeded in severe cases when plasma levels can be closely monitored. Full guidance on prescribing and monitoring is in the summary of product characteristics published in the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Compendium of Data Sheets and Summaries of Product Characteristics.

 A number of letters have been received from hon.

Results of the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study published in December 1999 found no evidence to link childhood cancer with exposure to magnetic fields from electricity supply. The

 In 1997, 760,000 prescriptions were issued by general practitioners or family planning clinics for emergency contraception pills. Guidance issued in October 1999 by the Faculty of Family Planning states that the overall risk of pregnancy, after a single act of unprotected sex on any day in the menstrual cycle is 2-4 per cent. but can be as high as 20-30 per cent. in the days before and just after ovulation. These figures are for all ages and include older women whose fertility is declining. An accurate estimate of the number of pregnancies expected without treatment is not possible without the menstrual and coital histories of the women concerned.
<P>

<a name="00310w11.html_para4">It is generally understood that use of Schering PC4 (the only hormonal product licensed for emergency contraception use in 1997) prevents 75 per cent. of potential pregnancies that would otherwise occur.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w12.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 As is common practice among many Government Departments, the Central Office of Information News Distribution Service issues press releases on behalf of the Department. Couriers are unlikely to be used purely to distribute press releases. It is however impossible to separate the times when

 The table illustrates that the number of nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff employed by the Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals National Health Service Trust declined between the years 1994 and 1997. However, numbers remain constant for 1998, and the numbers of hospital medical doctors employed within the trust steadily increased since 1994, demonstrating our commitment to increase the number of doctors and nurses working within the NHS. It should be noted that inflated figures for nursing staff in 1994 are not comparable with later years, due to a new classification system introduced in 1995 (see notes).

1. The Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals NHS Trust came into being on 1 April 1994. Data from earlier years cannot be disaggregated from health authority returns.<P>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest ten.<P>

3. 1994 figures include agency staff and exclude learners, 1995 to 1998 figures exclude agency staff and learners.<P>

4. A new classification of the non-medical workforce was introduced in 1995, therefore information based on this classification is not comparable with earlier years.<P>

5. Before 1996, some hospital medical staff were employed directly by the Regional Health Authority and so may not be included in these figures.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the period 2 May 1997 to 29 February 2000 what was <i>(a)</i> the number of occasions on which couriers were used to distribute news releases from his Department and <i>(b)</i> the total cost of using couriers to distribute news releases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 Over this period, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not distributed its news releases to media organisations by courier.
<P>

<a name="00310w13.html_para3">The FCO Daily Bulletin is distributed to Commonwealth High Commissions in London by courier, as part of regular deliveries of other FCO correspondence. Until September 1999 this service was provided in house. Since September 1999 these services have been contracted out.
<P>

<a name="00310w13.html_para4">The cost of delivering news releases in this courier service, as distinct from the costs of delivering other mail distributed with them, is not calculated. To provide a separate breakdown of the cost of delivering news releases, as a proportion of the total volume of correspondence distributed to High Commissions, would incur disproportionate costs.

We were grateful for the assistance of the US authorities, via the US Embassy in London, in helping us carry out investigations into the allegations in <i>The Independent</i> newspaper on 16 and 17 November. The US Embassy did not provide us with a written report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations were made to the South African Government by Her Majesty's Government about <i>(a)</i> the visit to South Africa en route to Mozambique by members of Her Majesty's forces, <i>(b)</i> the arrangements for Her Majesty's forces personnel to leave the aircraft while at a South African airbase and <i>(c)</i> facilities to be provided for members of Her Majesty's forces to use while on this stopover in South Africa; what responses were received to such representations; and what reply was given to the South African response.

<a name="00310w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Our High Commissions in Pretoria and Maputo held extensive discussions with the South African and Mozambican authorities. I also spoke to President Mbeki's Legal Adviser. As a result, the South African Government agreed, with the approval of the Mozambican Government, that the British military team could use Hoedspruit as a rear base for its operation. We are grateful to the South African Government for the help they are giving to our team and I pay tribute to the fast and effective way in which they have responded to the disaster in Mozambique. Our teams are working closely together in the international relief effort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of progress made in implementing <i>(a)</i> Stage I and <i>(b)</i> Stage II of UNMIK's general strategy for Kosovo.  [113876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 UNSCR 1244, which established the international presences in Kosovo, gave the UN Interim Administration Mission (UNMIK) responsibility for: (i) performing basic civilian administrative functions; (ii) developing provisional institutions for democratic self-government; and (iii) transferring responsibilities to these provisional institutions.

<P>

<a name="00310w14.html_para5">UNMIK has established a civil administration in Kosovo. It secured the agreement of the Kosovo Albanian leadership to participate in Joint Interim Administrative Structures (JIAS), integrating UNMIK administration with local participation. UNMIK hopes that the Kosovo Serbs will soon agree to join the JIAS. UNMIK plans to hold municipal elections in Kosovo later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The UN Secretary General, who is responsible for making recommendations to the Security Council, requested in July 1999 that member states provide 3,110 police officers for the United Nations International Police. This request remained unchanged until November 1999 when the requirement was increased to 4,718.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The political and security situation within the Presevo Valley area of southern Serbia appears to be tense. Clashes have taken place between armed groups and Serbian security forces near the administrative border with Kosovo. KFOR have warned Kosovo Albanians not to export trouble and have tightened control of the boundary with Serbia. Compiling accurate information on the situation within Serbia has been obstructed by the FRY authorities, who refused to co-operate with a 3 March visit to the area by the EU Troika.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what is his estimate of the amount of money the Iraqi authorities could have spent on the purchase of medicines since sanctions started.  [114122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Sanctions have never prohibited the import of medicines into Iraq. Under the UN's "oil for food" programme, which was first proposed in 1991 but rejected by the Iraqi government for five years, over $10 billion worth of revenue has been available for the purchase of humanitarian supplies. It is for the Government of Iraq to decide how it allocates that money between the various humanitarian sectors. It has chosen, for example, to allocate $10 million to purchase bank note counting 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 2000 : Column: 876W</I><P>
machines under the current phase of the programme. The UN Secretary-General has refused to approve this allocation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans the Government have to ensure that there is adequate medicine to allow Iraqi civilians to receive the treatment needed.  [114119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government have always worked closely with the UN to ensure that the humanitarian programme is as effective as possible in order to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people. SCR 1284, a UK initiative, contains a raft of measures to make the programme bigger and better, including the removal of the ceiling on the amount of oil Iraq can sell to purchase humanitarian goods. But the government of Iraq is ultimately responsible for deciding how that review is to be allocated. We urge the government of Iraq to take full advantage of the opportunities SCR 1284 offers, and to put the people's needs for food and medicines first when allocating revenue, rather than allocating millions of dollars for bank note counting machines, for example.

<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports his Department has received of medicine brought into Iraq since sanctions started which has not been used for ordinary Iraqi civilians.  [114123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have received reports of widespread official and black-market abuse of medical goods supplied to Iraq under the "oil for food" programme. We are aware, for example that such medicines are being sold by pharmacies in countries neighbouring Iraq. We have passed this information to the UN for further investigation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what is the Government's estimate of the number of children in Iraq who are likely to lack adequate medical treatment as a result of UN sanctions.  [114121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00310w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Sanctions have never prohibited the import of medicines into Iraq. While the international community has sought to maximise the relief available to the Iraqi people, the Government of Iraq has refused to put their welfare first. For example, the latest UN report notes that one quarter of all medical goods delivered to Iraq since the "oil for food" programme began have not been distributed. Under "oil for food" the Government of Iraq decides how much oil revenue will be allocated to purchase medical goods. The UN Secretary General has repeatedly observed that Iraq needs to give greater attention to the provision of basic pharmaceuticals, primary and preventive health-care services and material support for more effective distribution.
