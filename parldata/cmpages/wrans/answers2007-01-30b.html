This is because on leaving the armed forces, or on demobilisation for reservists, it is the long established practice that responsibility for medical care passes to the NHS. To collate figures on medical treatment received by every veteran would require an examination of the records of every NHS trust (and every independent healthcare provider) in the country and could therefore be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The Department is currently therefore reviewing its methods of collating figures on service personnel diagnosed with a mental health condition. I will write to the hon.

 The overriding objective of cost sharing in relation to the livestock sector is to achieve better management of animal disease risks, through better policy making, so that the overall risks and costs are reduced. Responsibility sharing will provide opportunities for improved regulation and a reduction in the regulatory burden in future. The Government will benefit from increased industry involvement in decision making, which should mean a greater ability to respond and deliver outcomes more effectively and efficiently.

 Working with local authorities and other partners, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) distributed 1.167 million home compost bins up to 31 December 2006. 624,000 compost bins were distributed in the 2006 calendar year.

With the average mix of new to existing composters experienced by the programme so far, the average diversion per bin is currently estimated as 145 kilograms per household. This suggests that the total annual diversion capacity from the programme is of the order of 170,000 tonnes. A full assessment will be published at the end of WRAP&#146;s current business plan period in April 2008.</p>

 At the Gleneagles summit in 2005, the UK secured G8 agreement that the World Bank should lead on establishing a new Clean Energy Investment Framework (CEIF) that would operate across the international financing system.

In November 2006, the Chancellor, with the Presidents of the World Bank and the four leading regional development banks, announced a partnership with the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development. The purpose of this partnership is to explore how to stimulate private sector investment through the Clean Energy Investment Framework. A conference will be held in London in March 2007 to launch this work.</p>

The World Bank has sought to maximise its existing resources to support clean energy investments, in line with another element of the Gleneagles agreement. A recent World Bank report shows that in 2006 the Bank increased the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects by 45 per cent. to a total of $668 million, exceeding the 20 per cent. annual increase target set in 2004.</p>

 The infant mortality rate in Zimbabwe is currently 60 per 1,000 live births. Five years ago it was 37 per 1,000 live births. Almost 40 per cent. of infant deaths occur in the first month after birth. DFID has committed &#163;25 million to a programme to reduce maternal and infant mortality. This programme aims to improve access to lifesaving obstetric and newborn care, especially those affected by HIV and AIDS, and to maintain access to family planning services, including secure provision of contraceptives. DFID has also provided UNICEF with over &#163;2 million to support the national vaccination programme to decrease the number of vaccine-preventable deaths among children.</p>

Furthermore there is some evidence of a positive impact on crime and confidence in officers who had higher levels of doorstep contact with the community, rather than contact through patrol. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that patrol, as part of a neighbourhood policing strategy, is effective in its impact on crime, perceptions of crime and antisocial behaviour, feelings of safety, and public confidence in the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"><a name="70130w0009.htm_para9"><a name="07013065000127">The Home Office's evaluation of the national reassurance policing programme was published in January 2006 and provides strong evidence of the impact of neighbourhood policing. A copy is available in the Library of the House. The roll-out of neighbourhood policing is due to be complete by April 2008. Ongoing Home Office research will evaluate its impact on police performance, and the results will be published in due course.</p>

This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>

 Figures for those participating in both adult and community learning (ACL) and further education (FE) can be derived from the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The ACL ILR was collated for the first time in 2003-04 but reliable and consistent figures are only available from 2004-05. The FE ILR was collated for the first time in 2002-03 and figures are presented from that time. The following table shows the total number of learners in Shropshire local learning and skills council (LSC) area for both ACL and FE based on the home postcode of the learner. For FE, the figures show all learners, irrespective of whether the course is subsidised by the LSC (the substantial majority), but also learners on full-cost recovery courses and those who draw funding from other bodies, such as the European social fund or local authorities. ACL providers are not required to submit ILR data on non-LSC funded learners, so the figures shown may exclude some who either pay fees themselves or are funded by other means.</p>

 The entitlement to free tuition for a first full level 3 qualification for young adults aged between 19 and under 25 when they start their learning will be introduced from the start of the 2007/08 academic year. The introduction of the new entitlement will still mean that apprentices of any age are not asked to make a contribution to the costs of their training. The funding to learning providers for the delivery of advanced apprenticeships to 16 to 18-year-old learners will continue to be met fully from public funds. However, the rates payable to learning providers for apprenticeships for those aged 19 or above are reduced by up to 50 per cent. of the 16 to 18 rate to reflect the lower costs of training for older learners and an assumed contribution by employers.</p>

for any fee remission category will also be expected to make a contribution to their learning of 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. By 2010, the learner contribution will rise to around 50 per cent., this is in line with the principle that individuals and employers should contribute to costs in line with their ability to pay and the benefits they receive.</p>

In 2004/05 the LSC adopted a new classification created by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in order to harmonise the categorisation of qualifications across relevant education agencies and bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Figures for 2003/04 are shown recalculated in terms of the new Subject Sector Area (SSA) classification, while figures for 2004/05 are exclusively categorised in terms of SSAs.</p>

 I am not aware of a project of this name. However, I understand that Lancashire county council runs a specialist fostering scheme entitled &#145;Fostering Focus&#146;. The scheme aims to provide highly skilled foster carers able to care for children with the most complex needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="70130w0014.htm_para3"><a name="07013071000601">The recent Green Paper &#147;Care Matters&#148; sets out the Government&#146;s proposal for a tiered model of placement types. The tiered model would be structured around the needs of children, with carers being trained and skilled to a greater or lesser degree depending on the needs of the child. The principle behind Lancashire&#146;s &#145;Fostering Focus&#146; scheme is consistent with such an approach and I welcome the steps which local authorities are taking to ensure that children are placed with carers who have the skills, training and ability to meet their individual needs.</p>

 The Department does not keep records on how many schools in Essex were scheduled to be refurbished over the last five years, and on how many were refurbished. This is because decisions on refurbishing or building schools are taken at local authority level. The Department has recently announced that Essex is in wave four of the Building Schools for the Future programme, and this wave will be rolled out in the spending review period commencing 2008-09. This transformational programme will, over its projected life, provide inspirational schools and academies for all secondary school pupils.</p>

 Successful implementation and delivery of the 14-19 reforms depends on, among other things, wide dissemination of good practice. That is why we are making the lessons learned from the 14-19 Pathfinder Programme on the co-ordination of school and college timetables widely available through the Learning Visits Programme. Some 115 local authority areas have already attended at least one visit, and, following demand, we are planning this term a programme of learning visits particularly focused on common timetabling. In addition, following the 14-19 Regional Conferences last October, we made available information about how the how the diplomas would fit with existing curriculum requirements, including an example on how one 14-19 Partnership was proposing to do this.</p>

We introduced two new relevant measures in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005: first, improved police access to the motor insurance database (MFD) to enhance their capability to detect uninsured driving by using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment; second, powers allowing the police to seize vehicles being driven by someone without appropriate insurance. In the Road Safety Act 2006, we enabled the introduction of a new fixed penalty for people who ignore official reminders that their insurance has expired: when introduced, this will provide for a scheme of continuous insurance enforcement from the vehicle record, to complement police activities.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 January 2007]:</i> On 23 March 2006 the Government launched the Railways for All Strategy which sets out what the rail industry is doing to improve access to Britain's railways, particularly for people with disabilities. Central to the strategy is the &#163;370 million Access for All funding, ring fenced to improve accessibility at railway stations up to 2015.</p>

To date the Department has announced 92 stations in England and Wales for Network Rail to prioritise for access improvements up to 2011. Later this year we are planning to publish a third tranche of stations for inclusion within the Access for All programme for delivery between 2012 and 2015. Llandaff will be considered for inclusion in this tranche alongside all other eligible stations.</p>

(i) Some records show that a person started or ended employment at some point in the year, but the exact date on when they started or left their job is unknown, and therefore we do not know if they were employed at the points in time specified in this query.<br>
(ii) If a person&#146;s earnings are sufficiently low that they fall below the lower income tax threshold and so are not required to pay PAYE income tax on their earnings then there is no requirement to inform HMRC of their employment (although some employers declare these jobs anyway).<br>
(iii) These data do not include the self-employed.<br>
(iv) Poor quality personal data may lead to missed matches with benefits data.<br>
(v) No &#145;HMRC sensitive and secure&#146; information is supplied by HMRC (for example, HMRC employees, members of the security services).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the gravity of the incidents referred to in paragraph 5.108 of her Department&#146;s 2006 annual report relating to infusion devices; what the reasons were for the time taken to rectify the fault; and what the reason is for the range of possible savings given.

 In 2002, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) identified a number of infusion device incidents associated with user error. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), as soon as it had been set up, decided that this was a priority area to look into. It therefore conducted a six-month pilot study from May to November 2003 to identify baseline rates of error in the use of infusion devices. During the study 321 safety incidents were identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="70130w0026.htm_para10"><a name="07013079000969">On the basis of the pilot study the NPSA concluded that the national health service required further advice on the use of infusion devices. In May 2004, the NPSA issued a safer practice notice on improving infusion device safety to trusts in England and Wales. The intervening period was used to identify an effective solution and to develop the safer practice notice, which took into account the pilot study and other relevant research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="70130w0026.htm_para11"><a name="07013079000970">The range of possible savings was taken from research carried out by a health economist. The reason for the wide range of savings made by the different trusts is due to the existing varying levels of implementation of the notice. There were indications that savings have been made in a number of different areas such as reduced stock maintenance costs, more efficient use of nursing time and reduced costs as a result of infusion errors. These savings would be maximised in trusts that prior to the issue of the safer practice notice had been less effective at managing their stock of infusion devices. On the other hand where trusts were already making effective use of their stock of infusion devices, the savings would be minimised. The extreme range of the savings is emphasised by year on year long-term effect of better stock management procedures.</p>

 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is required, as a trading fund, to recover the costs of its medicines regulatory functions through fee income. The agency is required to assess cost pressures to ensure that fee income can fully recover costs. Fees levels were subject to significant increases in April 2006 following new legislation that expanded the agency&#146;s responsibilities in order more effectively to protect public health. In recognition of this, the agency&#146;s aim has been to keep fees increases for the coming year to the lowest possible level. The proposals set out in the agency&#146;s consultation document (MLX 335) include some fees where no increase is proposed&#151;for instance, for wholesale dealers, and for companies who adopt the new international standard for electronic licence applications, which will have speed and efficiency benefits for both the agency and pharmaceutical companies. The average rate of the proposed increases, across the agency&#146;s business, is 4.9 per cent. The income from these increases will cover pay and other cost increases, but will in particular be focused on supporting the agency&#146;s ability to deliver further improvements in the service it provides to companies&#151;something the industry has said it would wish to see. The consultation paper, and its supporting draft regulatory impact assessment, covers these issues in further detail.</p>

 The time taken by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the assessment and determination of applications for licensing of medicinal products, and for their subsequent variation, lengthened for most product types during 2006.

 No. The Department expects that care home closures will be handled sensitively, that arrangements will be made for the satisfactory transfer of residents to other suitable homes and that adequate time will be allowed for the process, so that residents and their relatives can have real choice over where they are to live and the minimum possible discomfort is caused to all concerned.</p>

These payments are made from an Annually Managed Expenditure Budget held by the Department. Under this arrangement debt moves from one part of the public sector to another, and in consequence there is no net increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. Around &#163;2.3 billion of overhanging debt payments have been made since 1997. The Exchequer meets the interest payments on debt that it holds.</p>

 Reductions in the Supporting People budget have been made in line with the findings of the 2004 independent review of the programme. This identified that the then &#163;1.8 billion budget was too much to pay for the services within the programme and did not represent value for public money. Actions have subsequently been taken at the local and national level to address value for money, and reductions in Supporting People budgets have reflected the need to improve efficiency. My Department has provided and ensured support and capacity building for authorities and providers (including small providers) to help them in this work.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><sup>(1 )</sup>Communities and Local Government does not collect data on Right to Buy (RTB) set-aside amounts. Until 2003-04 the data gathered are the total receipts to which set-aside applies for all sales of Housing Revenue Account (HRA) assets. This includes Right to Buy (RTB) sales and also, for example, large or small scale stock transfers and the sale of bare land. For 2003-04, while local authorities will have set aside receipts from all HRA disposals, we only gathered data for receipts generated by large or small scale voluntary transfers. Whether or not a local authority actually used the amounts set-aside to repay debt was a treasury management decision for them. It may have been that it made better financial sense for the local authority to keep a debt on its books and invest the set-aside elsewhere, rather than redeem the debt early and face early redemption penalties.  <sup>(2)</sup> Central Government only began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, local authorities were required instead to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. For 2004-05 onwards, figures include retained capital receipts arising from the sales of all dwellings, not just Right to Buy.  <sup>(3)</sup> Figures for 2006-07 are only for the first two quarters. Figures for the third and fourth quarters will not be known until February and May this year respectively.  <sup>(4)</sup> Before 2004-05, the Department did not collect data on the amount of receipts retained by local authorities.

All local authorities are consulted on proposed amendments to the capital finance system, but there have been no individual discussions with Gloucestershire county council.</p>

 We have no current plans to review the funding formula to take specific account of the cost pressures associated with containing a busy airport or port. Formula Grant (which includes Revenue Support Grant) can be used by councils for any purpose, provided their statutory obligations are met.

 The Prime Minister&#146;s target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds from 1998 levels was met ahead of time in 2001 and is now 73 per cent. lower and being sustained. My officials work closely with local authorities to ensure that levels of rough sleeping remain low and are further reduced through implementation of their homelessness strategies, required under the Homelessness Act 2002.</p>

Departmental officials also attend many counts and we are in the process of extending independent verification to cover all counts undertaken. Local authorities submit the outcome of a count, or their estimate, in their housing strategy and statistical appendix each year. It is these local authority figures that are published each September in the national rough sleeping estimate. Independent evaluations have confirmed the overall reduction since 1997. In addition we are looking at other ways to assess wider homelessness which may not be captured by the current count methods.</p>
