The administration of concessionary travel could also be streamlined by, for instance, issuing passes bi- or tri-annually instead of yearly, or by adopting streamlined procedures for monitoring and calculating reimbursement payments, in co-operation with bus operators.</p>

To assist this process the Government are paying a grant of &#163;31 million to ensure that bus passes for the new national concession starting April 2008 are in ITSO smartcard form.</p>

An article 4 direction can apply to a particular type of development and/or a specific area, but could not impose restrictions based on the ownership of a particular property.

The US is also part of the E3+3 group of countries that is leading the international community in seeking a negotiated solution to this issue and which therefore meets regularly to co-ordinate our approach. That approach is based on a generous offer to Iran should they suspend their proliferation sensitive activities and the threat of sanctions should they continue to refuse to do so. Through the E3+3, the Government and the US have played an important role in securing three United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Iran, two of which have focused on sanctions. The E3+3 are committed to a diplomatic solution to the concerns of the international community about the Iranian nuclear programme.

 GCSEs are unique qualifications because they span two levels of the National Qualifications Framework: grades D-G are at &#147;level 1&#148;, while grades at C and above represent &#147;level 2&#148;. Level 2 qualifications recognise the ability to gain a good knowledge and understanding of a subject area of work or study, and to perform varied tasks with some guidance or supervision.

 City University London is a joint sponsor, together with the City of London Corporation, of the City of London Academy, Islington which is expected to replace Islington Green School from September 2008. The university has raised funds from four sources to provide sponsorship: the Cass Foundation, the Saddlers Company, the Kitchin Fund and a philanthropic benefactor who has expressed a wish to remain anonymous. The university and Department are respecting that wish. The donations are being made to the university, not to the academy and the donors will have no say in the running of the academy. This anonymous donor has been subject to a due diligence check by the university.</p>

 The Children&#146;s Plan, published in December 2007, confirmed that the primary curriculum will be reviewed, including introducing languages as a compulsory subject. This takes forward the recommendation in Lord Dearing&#146;s Languages Review that languages should become a compulsory part of the primary curriculum, and builds on the existing entitlement for all Key Stage 2 pupils to learn a language in class time by 2010. Progress so far is good and already over 70 per cent. of primary schools are offering languages in class time. We are extending language teaching in primary schools through: a teacher training programme in a primary languages specialism, which has so far trained nearly 3,000 teachers, with thousands more to be trained over the next few years; increased funding for local authorities to support the delivery of primary languages; and access for teachers to sources of support for use in the classroom.</p>

He did not recommend making languages compulsory at Key Stage 4 because he felt that a &#145;one size fits all&#146; approach was not the best way to motivate learners. Instead, he recommended a package of measures to extend language learning post-14 which we are now implementing. These include: two new performance indicators in the Achievement and Attainment Tables from 2008 to measure attainment and participation in languages; a more engaging secondary curriculum; more and better support for language teachers; a major communications campaign to promote the benefits of language teaching to pupils, parents and the school workforce; and the Open School for Languages, a major web-based initiative which will offer innovative approaches to the learning of languages.</p>

 In 1997, investment in school buildings was under &#163;700 million a year and schools had suffered from many years of under investment, with a large backlog of condition and suitability needs. This year, Government funding for investment in school buildings and facilities is &#163;6.4 billion and it will rise to over &#163;8 billion a year by 2010-11&#151;a seven-fold increase in real terms under this Government.</p>

In liquidation and bankruptcy cases it is for those who have most interest in the matter, the creditors, to consider the level of remuneration charged by an insolvency practitioner and they, or the relevant committee, must approve such remuneration. Where a minority of creditors are concerned that the remuneration appears excessive, provided at least 25 per cent. in value of creditors agree, application may be made for the court to review the level of remuneration charged.</p>

 The Secretary of State has no plans to bring forward proposals to provide for a single insolvency regulator.

 None. The Resource Accounts and actuarial valuation use different measures of the cost to the Exchequer of providing benefits under the PCPF because they are used for different purposes and use different assumptions about investment returns.</p>

This approach is widely used in the private and public sectors. The last actuarial review in 2005 assessed the underlying rate of employer contribution at 18.1 per cent. of Members&#146; salaries with a further 8.7 per cent. required to make good the current deficit. The next actuarial review was agreed by the Trustees at their last meeting and any revision to the current employer contribution rate will come into effect from 2009.</p>

Ministers and the Prison Service are completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents. The updated Prison Service suicide prevention strategy was published in October 2007 with implementation due to be completed in every prison, including Chelmsford, by end-April 2008. Building on several years of learning from the experience of prisoners, staff, investigators, inspectors and others, it incorporates developments such as improved cross-agency information flows, the provision of safer cells, increasing prisoner peer support, and the introduction of ACCT (assessment, care in custody and teamwork) the care-planning system for prisoners at-risk of suicide or self-harm, introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="80116w0023.htm_para3"><a name="0801176004345">HMP Chelmsford itself has developed a strong relationship with Samaritans to provide support for prisoners.

This includes training in ACCT, use of cut down tools, and resuscitation techniques.</p>

 The recommended standards for sexual health services advise that primary care trusts (PCTs) should ensure information about local sexual health service provision is readily available to enable people to access appropriate services. It also states that PCTs should target specific population groups who are less well serviced by, or find it more difficult to access existing provision. Specific service provision will be based on local need but should include services for young people.</p>

 The capital provision of &#163;17 million to improve national health service capacity in dual X-ray absorptiometer (DXA) scanning provision in the diagnosis of osteoporosis has been included in strategic health authorities&#146; (SHAs) strategic capital allocation and is not ring fenced. While the Department does not monitor how SHA strategic capital is spent, it has been clear in its expectations that this funding is spent exclusively on DXA provision. In May 2006, the National Director for Older People, Professor Ian Philp, wrote to SHAs to highlight the importance of DXA scanning in delivering the relevant elements of the National Service Framework for Older People.</p>

 The vast majority of winter fuel payments are made automatically because most people aged 60 and over are receiving a DWP benefit which allows us to check their eligibility based on information on our departmental computer systems.

 The Department&#146;s contact centres provide a good quality of service to the majority of its customers but we do recognise that customers who need to deal with more than one part of the Department may not always find it as easy as we would like to get answers to cross-cutting queries. The Department has recently introduced a new internal directory for customer contact staff to use to help signpost customers to the right point of contact for the resolution of their inquiry. This is the first step towards the introduction of a more integrated approach. Our aim is that in the future there should be &#145;no wrong door&#146; for customers who contact the Department.</p>
