<P>
<a name="81208w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Earlier this year, my right hon. Friend carried out a full review of Mr. Farrakhan's exclusion from the United Kingdom. My right hon. Friend was minded to continue the exclusion, but invited representations to be made. Those representations are being given careful consideration and we expect to take a final decision shortly.

<a name="81208w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many asylum seekers have been convicted of offences punishable with imprisonment in the last year for which figures are available;  [62212]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many asylum seekers have been <i>(a)</i> excluded and <i>(b)</i> deported from the United Kingdom as a result of the commission of crime in another country in the last year for which figures are available;  [62206]

(3) how many asylum applicants have been ordered to be deported as a result of the commission of criminal offences in the United Kingdom in the last year for which figures are available.  [62205]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="81208w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 1998]:</i> Information is not held centrally on the number of asylum seekers who have committed offences in another country or on the number of asylum seekers convicted of offences punishable with imprisonment and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="81208w01.html_para0">During 1997, 366 persons were recommended for deportation by a court and 89 were served with deportation notices on the basis that their continued 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1998 : Column: 108</I><P>
presence in the United Kingdom was not conducive to the public good. These figures include asylum and non- asylum cases.
<P>

<a name="81208w01.html_para1">The system we inherited for identifying asylum seekers who have offended requires the police and prison service to inform the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) when someone subject to immigration control is convicted of any offence against the person, any drugs offence or any immigration offence or any other offence where a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more is imposed. In addition IND is notified where a court recommends that an offender should be deported. Other offences may be reported but there is no requirement for this to be done.
<P>

<a name="81208w01.html_para2">This system produced records which showed that, in 1997, 14 persons who applied for asylum at some stage were recommended for deportation by a court and a further four were issued with notices of intention to deport on grounds conducive to the public good following conviction for a criminal offence. The current records are likely to under-estimate the numbers involved but it is difficult to assess by precisely how much. I have asked officials to re-examine and recommend improvements to the inherited process of collecting this data as part of our process of modernising the information systems in IND.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made over the last five years <i>(a)</i> within his Department, <i>(b)</i> in conjunction with other Government departments and <i>(c)</i> in conjunction with European bodies towards developing systems involving the use of new technology for safety-related road traffic law enforcement and the administration of penalties.

<a name="81208w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Since 1 January 1994, we have type approved for police use 10 speed measuring devices which operate using the various technologies of radar, lasers or sensors across the road. The most recent available figures show that 34 per cent. of the speed offences dealt with by the police were detected by automatic cameras. For drink drive law enforcement we have also type approved 1 alcohol screening device for roadside use and 3 evidential breath alcohol testing instruments. Research is underway into possible devices to enable the police to screen for drugs driving offences at the roadside.




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1998 : Column: 112</I><P>

In 1996, the Police Research Group published a cost benefit study of police enforcement cameras, the findings of which encouraged the wider use of camera technology to reduce road casualties. Home Office scientists have published a number of technical specifications and standards for various technologies to assist manufacturers to meet the needs of law enforcement. A new technical specification for police vehicle livery has been designed to provide greater safety by improving the visibility of police vehicles.

<a name="81208w02.html_para2">Scientists at the Police Scientific Development Branch and Forensic Science Service continue to test systems developed by manufacturers with a view to their being type approved for police use. The Department is also supporting a project on the possible use of simulation technology for police driver training.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> The Channel Islands are not subject to European Union instruments on taxation, such as the proposed Directive on the taxation of savings. The Explanatory Memorandum to the proposed Directive, however, encourages member states to apply the measures contained in the Directive to their dependent territories within the framework of their constitutional arrangements. Legislation on taxation matters has always taken the form of laws enacted by the Island legislatures.

<a name="81208w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have published two consultation papers this year about jury trials. The first paper, on use of juries in serious fraud trials, invited views on the principle of whether the system is likely to operate better and with a greater degree of public confidence if, in a small number of complex fraud trials, a traditional jury were to be replaced by another method of determining the facts. The consultation paper on determining the mode of trial considered whether defendants should be able to choose to be tried by a jury in cases which magistrates have indicated that they would be content to hear. We are currently considering the responses to these two consultation exercises.

<P>

<a name="81208w03.html_para3">As outlined in the White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum", where an asylum application was made before the coming into force on 1 July 1993 of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, delay in itself will normally be considered so serious as to justify, as a matter of fairness, the grant of indefinite leave to remain.
<P>

<a name="81208w03.html_para4">This will not apply, however, to applicants whose presence here is not conducive to the public good, for example on the basis of their conviction for a serious criminal offence. In general, any offender receiving a custodial sentence of 12 months or more will be excluded from benefiting from the backlog procedure. Other offenders may be excluded if their record is serious enough. Nor will it apply to any application for asylum made after the commencement of removal or deportation action against the applicant.

 The Transport Council met in Brussels on 30 November and 1 December. I and my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para0">The Council agreed a common position on one legislative proposal and reached agreement on transport negotiations with Switzerland. It also agreed a report to the Vienna European Council on integration of 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1998 : Column: 119</I><P>
environmental requirements into transport policy, and held useful discussions in several other important areas of land, air and maritime transport policy.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para1">In land transport, the Council agreed a common position on a directive on heavy goods vehicle taxation and charges (known as the "Eurovignette" directive). This was a difficult dossier, to which successive Presidencies, including our own, had contributed. The Council also reached agreement on the outcome of the European Commission's transport negotiations with Switzerland on behalf of the European Community. The complete package of negotiations with Switzerland, on transport and other items, will be finalised by the General Affairs Council.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para2">There was a debate on two directives amending the rules promoting combined transport. Although there was general support for the underlying aim, there were concerns about the proposals as drafted. Among these were the UK's concern that, at least in the UK, the proposals would not have the desired effect of encouraging a shift of freight from road to rail, and would be likely to have perverse effects. In the absence of sufficient support the Presidency asked for further work to be done by the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER).
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para3">There was further discussion of the Commission's legislative proposals to establish a regulatory framework for the Community's railways. The UK strongly supports the proposals and referred to the Treaty requirement for progressive abolition of barriers to freedom to provide services. Following the discussion, the Presidency asked for further work to be done on the proposals.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para4">Two measures were discussed relating to inland waterways, neither of which applies to the UK. Broad agreement was reached on a measure to extend a fleet capacity management programme, and the Council discussed a draft amending directive on technical standards for inland waterways vessels.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para5">On air transport, the Presidency concluded that there was insufficient support for the draft conclusions which it had tabled on a full Community negotiating mandate for air transport negotiations with the US, and asked for further work to be carried out.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para6">Disagreement between Spain and the UK over application to Gibraltar Airport prevented the Council agreeing a draft amending Regulation which would improve compensation arrangements for air passengers who are denied boarding on overbooked flights. The UK reaffirmed its strong support for the measure and rejected Spanish claims that Gibraltar Airport should be suspended from its application, pointing out that this would remove rights conferred on users of Gibraltar Airport by the original Regulation. The Presidency noted the Commission's request for further work on a Regulation on aviation statistics which has not progressed since 1996 when disagreement on application to Gibraltar Airport prevented its adoption. The Council also discussed a draft Directive providing for ramp checks on third country aircraft using EU airports which had previously been agreed, because Spain had now requested suspension of the application of the measure to Gibraltar Airport. The UK confirmed its support for the text agreed by the Council, regretting that Spain had objected to this important safety measure at such a late stage.

<a name="81208w04.html_para7">The Council noted the Commission's reports on the progress of negotiations to establish a European Aviation Safety Authority, for Community membership of Eurocontrol, and on extending the single aviation market to ten central and eastern European countries. The Council also noted progress on the draft Directive on airport charging, and received a report on the outcome of the 32nd meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para8">In maritime transport, there was a debate on the draft directive on ferry manning conditions. The UK made clear its strong support for the proposal, which would protect Community seafarer employment. Some Member States thought that more information was needed about the impact of the proposal. At the Presidency's request, the Commission agreed to produce a report on the directive's likely impact and inform a future Council of progress.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para9">The Council agreed a report on integrating environmental requirements into transport policy, to go to the European Council in Vienna on 11-12 December. The report outlines progress to date and indicates that the Council will draw up an ambitious phased work programme, a first report on which will be discussed by the end of 1999.
<P>

<a name="81208w04.html_para10">Under other business, the Commission presented its proposal for new working time rules in the road and maritime sectors, and presented its report on the development of transport Trans-European Networks.

 Under the Rail Accessibility Regulations 1998, which will apply to all new types of rolling stock coming into service after 31 December this year, trains fitted with toilets for passengers will have to provide wheelchair accessible toilet facilities, as well as a wide range of other features to improve accessibility. The regulations have been drawn up in close consultation with train operating companies.

 Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council transferred 642 properties on the Limehurst Village estate to Limehurst Village Trust in March 1998. The number of properties transferred fell below the threshold (the lower of 3,000 dwellings or 10 per cent. of the authority's current stock) at which Housing Revenue Account (HRA) Subsidy would be recalculated for 1998-99. Oldham was required to consider the effects on subsidy before deciding to make the transfer. If subsidy had been recalculated, it is estimated that Oldham MBC would have received an additional &#163;490,000 in HRA subsidy for 1998-99.

<a name="81208w05.html_para2">Under the Railways Act 1993 the regulation of fares is a matter for the Franchising Director. The Franchising Director regulates at least one fare between any two points on the network. Other fares, particularly discounted fares for off-peak travel, are set by the train operators. The Government have recently conducted research into the effects of fares regulation, based upon the fare actually paid by the passenger. The increase in average fares paid for 1995-96 and 1996-97 was 2.36 per cent, marginally below the RPI of 2.40 per cent. The increase between 1996-97 and 1997-98 was 3 per cent, below the RPI figure of 4 per cent. Between 1995-96 and 1996-97, the rate of increase in average fare paid fell below RPI for the first time since 1989-90.

<P>
<a name="81208w06.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government have today issued their consultation document on road user charging and the workplace parking levy. The remaining daughter documents--papers on shipping, buses, sustainable distribution, road safety and inland waterways--will follow within the next few months. We will also be issuing a paper on ports policy, and confirming guidance on local transport plans, following up the draft guidance currently out to consultation. In addition, a strategy to encourage walking, produced by the Walking Steering Group, will be published by the Department early in the New Year.

 A New Deal for the Railways (Cm 4024) announced that, subject to legislation, sponsorship of the Rail Users' Consultative Committees will be transferred from the Rail Regulator to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). In future, the Committees will have explicit new powers to report perceived breaches of franchise agreements to the SRA, not just breaches of passenger and station licences. In addition, the Committees' remit will be extended to any open access operators (i.e. to passenger

We will ensure that the Committees include a wide cross-section of passengers, and want them to co-operate with bus user representative bodies and to contribute jointly to the development of the regional transport strategies which will form part of Regional Planning Guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to ensure that staff reductions by train operating companies do not lead to compromises in safety.  [62434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Under the Railways Safety Case Regulations 1994, arrangements for operations or maintenance must be set out in a train operator's Railway Safety Case. Railway Safety Cases and any subsequent revisions have to be accepted by the Infrastructure controller or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) before operations or revised operations can commence. Reductions in staffing levels would require amendment to a Railway Safety Case where this might affect safety. HSE monitors compliance with the Regulations and will take whatever action it considers appropriate (including enforcement action, if necessary) to ensure safety is not compromised.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the circumstances under which franchise agreements with train operating companies can be renegotiated; which franchises have been so renegotiated; and if he will make a statement.  [62438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Deputy Prime Minister has said that the books are open for renegotiating franchises in order to secure improved services for passengers. An announcement about how we will seek additional benefits through renegotiation will be made in due course.
<P>

<a name="81208w06.html_para0">The Franchising Director already has scope to negotiate additional commitments from franchisees. Where contravention of the franchise agreement has a materially adverse effect on passengers, the Franchising Director's Objectives, Instructions and Guidance, given to him in November 1997, require him to seek to secure contractual undertakings from the franchisee which will provide additional benefits as compensation for passengers. Where agreement has been sought to transfer control of a franchise to another party, the Franchising Director can also seek benefits for passengers. Substantial new commitments and changes to franchises negotiated by the Franchising Director since the Minister of Transport gave him new Objectives, Instructions and Guidance in November 1977 are shown in the table.

<P>

 No such estimate can be made, because my Department does not hold statistics on the number of passes issued; that is a matter for the individual local authorities concerned. Without that information it is

[62420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is not possible to give such an estimate, because the cost and the number of passes issued would depend not only on the price of the pass, but also on the level of concessionary fare with which the pass was associated.

 It would be impractical to impose a national ban on lorry traffic on non-trunk roads because most lorry journeys begin and end on such roads. Non- trunk roads are the responsibility of local traffic authorities who have powers to make traffic regulation orders to prohibit or restrict lorry access, subject in limited cases to a requirement to hold a public inquiry and obtain the Secretary of State's consent.

 This was considered by the Franchising Director before letting the current franchises. Train operators may make arrangements with each other for operating services on a subcontracted basis, subject to conditions which ensure that the arrangements do not transfer control of the services concerned, or the obligation to deliver the Passenger Service Requirement (PSR), to the subcontractor; and subject to a maximum of 5 per cent. of the aggregate scheduled train mileage of the operator subcontracting services. Subcontracting above this limit or outside the terms of the conditions requires the consent of the Franchising Director or, where applicable, the relevant Passenger Transport Executive (PTE). In addition, the Franchising Director requires clear separation between different franchises held by the same franchisee, and any relationship between them must be on an arm's-length basis and set out in clear contracts.

At the start of the franchises these terms were at least as favourable as British Rails; since then, a number of operators' terms have tightened, either through negotiation with Franchising Director or at an operator's own commercial initiative. Operators have varying Charter compensation terms and information about payments belongs to each operator. The Franchising Director has the contractual right to inspect records, to ensure compliance, but they are not maintained on a comparable basis across all TOCs.

<P>
<a name="81208w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Green Ministers' meeting on 18 November discussed progress on delivering green transport plans across Government. These plans will comprise measures to encourage staff to choose alternatives to single-occupancy car use, including public transport, cycling, walking and car-sharing, to reduce the environmental impact of travel and to reduce the need to travel. Where feasible, Ministers use public transport or walk. However, security issues and issues of practicality can mean that cars are often essential.
<P>

<a name="81208w07.html_para2">But the Government Car Service is committed to reducing the environmental impact of its fleet, and has begun to convert its vehicles to use Liquid Petroleum Gas, a significantly cleaner fuel than conventional fuels, with the aim of converting its entire fleet within the next five years. It also has a programme monitoring fuel consumption and providing driver training with a published target for improving the average fuel efficiency across its fleet by at least half a mile per gallon every year.

 At the preliminary hearing in the High Court in November, the judge refused IATA's request for an immediate reference of the matter to the European Court of Justice and awarded costs to the Secretary of State. A further hearing has been scheduled for February 1999, at which the substance of IATA's case will be considered, but it is not possible to predict the total cost to the Government of the action since this will depend on the length of the judicial process in reaching a decision and whether the Government are again awarded costs in the event of a successful defence. A reference to the European Court of Justice, which would result in a protraction of matters, cannot be excluded.

 The Government are considering options with the oil industry and other interested organisations with regard to the continuance, under the terms of the EU directive, of a very limited supply of leaded petrol. However, its availability will ultimately be a commercial decision.
<P>

<a name="81208w08.html_para0">Vehicles driven by disabled drivers are generally ordinary passenger cars or light vans all of which have been required to use unleaded petrol for several years. Older vehicles requiring leaded petrol will be able to use lead replacement petrol or an anti-wear additive in conjunction with unleaded petrol.

 Following extensive consultation, we have decided to make important changes to the practical driving test, its length, content and the way it is marked.
<P>

<a name="81208w09.html_para0">From Spring 1999, candidates will be required to demonstrate their skills in a broader range of road and traffic conditions. Tests will have about ten minutes more general driving. Test routes will include more higher speed dual carriageways and rural roads. The emergency stop exercise will be carried out at random in about one third of all car tests rather than all of them. Candidates who commit large numbers of less serious driving faults will fail their test. The threshold will initially be set at 15 faults. The revised test will set higher standards for candidates' driving and will check they are prepared for the pressure of driving in today's road and traffic conditions.
<P>

<a name="81208w09.html_para1">The package also includes measures to raise training standards. We plan to introduce a voluntary log book scheme at the same time as the test is amended, to aid candidates and their instructors to gauge progress towards test standard. Candidates will also be given more detailed written feedback about their performance on test by the examiner. This will advise unsuccessful candidates about the reasons they failed and provide those who passed guidance about aspects of their driving which could still be improved.
<P>

<a name="81208w09.html_para2">The implementation date for these changes will be announced shortly. The longer test and the revised marking arrangements will be introduced for the motorcycle test, and the emergency stop exercise will be retained in all those tests. The revised marking arrangements will also be introduced for lorry and bus driver tests. Training logbooks for these sectors will be developed in consultation with the representative bodies.

In particular, it will address institutional obstacles that are seen to act as a constraint to better regulation of safety and consider whether there are aspects of the current organisational arrangements that could give rise to conflicts of interest. It will not address the substance of policies for the operational safety of individual modes taken forward within the current institutional framework.

<P>
<a name="81208w13.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps the Government are taking to return to victims of Nazi persecution assets which were confiscated in the United Kingdom by Her Majesty's Government under trading with the enemy legislation.  [63042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 This Government are revolted by the treatment meted out by the Nazis to Jews and other minorities during the Second World War. We have the greatest sympathy for the victims and their relatives. This is why, in June 1998, we appointed the right hon. the Lord Archer of Sandwell QC to advise on a Scheme for determining claims from victims of Nazi persecution for the return of assets, where practicable and subject to validation, placed in the UK, which were confiscated by HM Government during the Second World War. We have now received Lord Archer's recommendations and I am pleased to confirm that the Government will quickly put in place a Claims Scheme based on them. A copy of the Government's response to Lord Archer's main recommendations has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="81208w13.html_para3">The Scheme will have the following main features: any victims of Nazi persecution who had assets in the UK confiscated by HM Government under the Trading with the Enemy legislation, and who have not already been compensated, will be eligible to make a claim; the Government will pay compensation at today's values in respect of valid claims to the original owners or their heirs; and claims will be determined by a panel of three independent Assessors comprising a legal Chair; someone with financial expertise; and someone with an understanding of belonging to a minority group.
<P>

<a name="81208w13.html_para4">This Government are aware that time is of the essence to victims of Nazi persecution and their families. We shall therefore establish the Claims Scheme as a matter of urgency so that claims for compensation may be met as soon as possible. The terms of reference of the assessors, a claims form and guidance on how to apply will be made available as soon as is practicable.
<P>

<a name="81208w13.html_para5">My Department has already received a number of potential claims and we shall be writing to these individuals to inform them of the procedure. We shall also be updating my Department's enemy property website, adding further lists of names and details of the Claims Scheme as they emerge. We are also in touch with the main interest groups and together with them we shall ensure that the Scheme gets the widest publicity.
<P>

<a name="81208w13.html_para6">I am grateful to Lord Archer for proposing a solution which allows the Government to meet the claims of victims of Nazi persecution while addressing the real practical problems of meeting the standards of propriety expected in public expenditure in circumstances some fifty years after the event. The UK owes victims of Nazi persecution a debt of honour. That debt can now be repaid.

 The Better Payment Practice Group was established in October 1997 as an integral part of the Government's commitment to work in partnership with the private sector to bring about an improved payment culture in the UK. The role of the Group is to help shape and influence the private and public sectors' efforts to tackle the problem of late payment as well as informing the work of other organisations and sectors on this issue.
<P>

<a name="81208w14.html_para0">Since it began 18 representative organisations have accepted invitations to join the Better Payment Practice Group from the small firms, banking, factoring, trade credit insurance, credit management, accountancy profession and credit services sectors to look at this important issue.

 To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what are <i>(a)</i> the budgets and <i>(b)</i> the priorities for criminal legal aid in (i) 1997-98, (ii) 1998-99 and (iii) 1999-2000.  [61257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no separate budget for criminal legal aid. However, in 1997-98, the cost of criminal legal aid, including advice and assistance, was &#163;733 million. This year expenditure is expected to be around &#163;800 million while next year it is expected to rise to &#163;840 million.
<P>

<a name="81208w14.html_para3">Our priority continues to be that criminal legal aid should enable criminal justice to be dispensed fairly, effectively and without undue delay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am aware of 29 magistrates courthouses closures since May 1997. It is possible that other closures have occurred following a decision by a local magistrates courts committee against which no appeal has been lodged. The Lord Chancellor has a role in magistrates courthouse closures only where an appeal has been made. Three new magistrates courthouses have opened at South Shields, Chippenham and Tameside.
<P>

<a name="81208w14.html_para4">Since May 1997, eight county courts have closed. There have been four court buildings opened since May 1997: Swansea County Court (June 1997), Oldham County Court (November 1997), the Immigration Appellate Authority (March 1998) and Principal Registry of the Family Division (June 1998).

<a name="81208w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department makes grants to local authorities towards current and capital expenditure incurred by them on behalf of the magistrates courts committee for their area. The overall level of expenditure allowed to be incurred, and thereby the amount of grant due to be paid, is determined by this Department.
<P>

<a name="81208w14.html_para5">The formula used to calculate the amount of current grant to be paid to each local authority is under review. It has been agreed, pending the completion of this review, that each local authority will receive, in cash terms, a 1.5 per cent. increase in their grant allocation for 1999-2000 over 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="81208w14.html_para6">The Department has made no specific plans to provide additional resources to local authorities during 1998-99, with the exception of those areas where there are amalgamations of magistrates courts committees which may bid for additional resources towards any transitional additional costs resulting from that amalgamation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Witness support schemes give information about court procedures, arrange with the court pre-court familiarisation visits and provide separate waiting facilities on the day of the witness's court appearances, and give emotional support. The Government are committed to improving witness services in the magistrates courts, reflecting the considerable importance that is attached to the welfare of witnesses in the criminal courts.

 Assistance is currently running at record levels. Last year, direct payments to Scottish farmers totalled almost half a billion pounds and latest indications are that a similar amount will be recorded for 1998. Throughout this year we have implemented a range of additional measures and these have been worth about &#163;50 million. On 16 November, a further &#163;36 million was approved for payment early next year.

 The Government are firmly committed to combating racism in all its forms.

The Scottish Social Inclusion Strategy recognises the exclusion that some minority communities face, and we have made equal opportunity a key principle to underpin the Scottish Parliament so that it can be responsive to the whole range of Scottish society.

<a name="81208w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gorrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what was the average per capita spending <i>(a)</i> in each education authority and <i>(b)</i> in Scotland in (i) primary schools and (ii) secondary schools on (1) books, (2) computer equipment and (3) other education materials and equipment in the most recent three years for which figures are available.

<P>
<a name="81208w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The available information is given in the following tables which have been compiled from local authority financial returns. Details for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are under the council areas then applicable, whereas the table for 1996-97 reflects the current local authority structure. There can be variations in the recording of expenditure under the two headings. It is, therefore, possible that some expenditure on books may be included

under expenditure on equipment or vice versa. Expenditure on computer equipment is not identified separately in local authority returns to The Scottish Office for the years in question.

 We recognise that the creation of the Scottish Parliament means that the present level of Scottish representation at Westminster cannot be maintained, a view which has received very broad support.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the human rights situation in China; and what has been the impact of United Kingdom and European Union policy.  [63146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We continue to have many serious concerns about human rights in China. During his visit to China earlier this year my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised these concerns with Chinese leaders, as did my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Recently, the Chinese Government has taken some positive steps in this field, which we have welcomed, while repeating our desire to address issues of concern through the continuing bilateral and EU/China Human Rights Dialogues.
<P>

<a name="81208w17.html_para4">Since the commencement of the bilateral UK/China Dialogue, and the resumption of the EU/China Human Rights Dialogue, last year, China has taken several positive steps which will bring about its closer integration into the UN human rights system, and should in time help to strengthen protection of human rights in China. It has signed the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic Social and Cultural Rights; agreed to report to the UN on Hong Kong under these two Covenants; admitted the UN High Commissioner for

<P><I>8 Dec 1998 : Column: 167</I><P>
Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, as well as the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; and welcomed a possible visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.
<P>

<a name="81208w17.html_para5">In addition, China has allowed a visit by a delegation of EU Troika Ambassadors to Tibet and accepted the participation in the Dialogue of critical NGOs such as Amnesty International. It is also noteworthy that the Dialogue has allowed us to discuss privately and frankly with the Chinese authorities a range of concerns from Tibet, to the death penalty, freedom of association and torture.
<P>

<a name="81208w17.html_para6">Both Britain and the EU have now established substantial co-operation programmes with China, funded respectively by DFID and the Commission, and these seek among other things to promote judicial exchanges and legal reform.
<P>

<a name="81208w17.html_para7">We shall encourage the Chinese Government to ratify the International Human Rights Covenants, with as few reservations as possible, as soon as possible. We want to see further reform in China's capital punishment regime, leading ultimately to abolition, as well as improvements in its systems of detention.

<P>
<a name="81208w18.html_spnew6"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 In May this year, the Government conveyed their agreement, in principle, to the Belfast Harbour Commissioners' proposals to transfer the Port to the private sector by means of a placed flotation, with the aim of establishing a private/public partnership, with Government retaining a Golden Share interest. Since then the Commissioners have made good progress in further developing their proposals with the view to submitting a formal Transfer Scheme to the Department, under the terms of the Ports (NI) Order 1994.
<P>

<a name="81208w18.html_para4">This legislation provides for a 6-week public consultation on submission of a Transfer Scheme to the Department. However, local elected representatives have expressed the view that this period is insufficient given the strategic importance of the Port in Northern Ireland context. Following discussions with the Belfast Harbour Commissioners therefore, it has been agreed that the Commissioners will now embark on a consultation process involving local Political Parties and other interested groups, before finalising their proposals and submitting their Transfer Scheme.
<P>

<a name="81208w18.html_para5">It is expected that this further consultation will extend over a 3-4 month period and this means that the final decision on the Commissioners' Transfer Scheme will be taken by the Assembly. I am writing today to each of the Northern Ireland Political parties explaining in more detail the arrangements for the extended consultation process.

 Further to my reply to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) on 28 October 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>206</i>, the consultation process is now complete. I have accepted the recommendations of the efficiency review, including the closure of the Worcester office, but in the light of representations made by the Trade Unions I have agreed that the implementation of certain other recommendations from the review should be delayed until later next year. These adjustments to the timetable will help the handling of the important changes in the way the agency conducts its business but will not significantly affect the savings anticipated in the PPA's running costs in the next financial year. The implementation of the review's proposals, especially those concerning the transfer of pensions work from Worcester to Cheadle Hulme, will be sufficiently flexible to ensure the effective transfer of existing skills and will include a contingency to meet any changing demands upon the agency. I am today informing the MOD Trade Unions of my decision.

[61074]

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1998]:</i> The main reason for the shortfall was the introduction by ES--after the unemployed placing target was set--of a new, more rigorous, recording and validation system for job placings. Whilst improving the accuracy of performance information, this action reduced the number of job placings recorded. The welcome fall in unemployment during 1997-98 also meant there were fewer long term unemployed people for ES to help into work. The unemployed job placing target for 1998-99 has been set to take account of the new placing validation system, and the lower level of unemployment.
<P>

<a name="81208w20.html_para3">The 1997-98 planned unit cost of an unemployed placing was based on the assumption that the ES would achieve its placing target with the resources available. Due to the shortfall in unemployed job placings, the ES was unable to stay within its planned unit cost.
<P>

<a name="81208w20.html_para4">ES performance during 1997-98 should be seen in context of the excellent work it undertook to ensure the successful implementation of the New Deal programmes and other Welfare to Work initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if, where admission limits to infant schools are in excess of multiples of 30, his Department will insist on reduction or increases to admission numbers when agreeing local education authority development plans.  [61823]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w20.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 No. It is a matter for local decision how local education authorities and school governing bodies comply with the duty to limit infant classes to 30 or under with effect from the start of the 2001-02 school year. Adjusting published school admission numbers relating to infant classes to multiples of 30 is one of a number of options available, although admission authorities have a duty to vary standard numbers where these are incompatible with class size limits. The Department will consider the plans put forward by local education authorities in the light of local needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="81208w20.html_para5">Local authority plans must give due regard to the exercise of parental preference. Our guidance states that this can be best achieved by adding to the number of classes in popular and high achieving schools which are able to expand. Where this is not possible local education authorities should ensure that there is sufficient space at another local school which offers a broadly equivalent standard of education.

 The following table shows full and part-time qualified teachers (excluding short term supply teachers) who left teaching in the maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools sector in England and Wales, during the financial years shown, by their position at the end of the year.

(33) The increase in premature retirements on efficiency grounds in 1996-97 was mainly caused by teachers leaving before the changes to the early retirement arrangements in September 1997.<P>

<P>

(34) Some of the teachers shown as not in service may be in service that is not recorded i.e. in independent schools that are not part of the Teachers Pension Scheme (TPS).<P>

<P>

(35) A number of the teachers shown as not in service will have taken career breaks and will return to teaching.<P>

<P>

(36) Going to other service such as short term supply teaching, independent schools (that are part of the TPS) or the further education sector. Only the 1992-93 figures include teachers leaving sixth form colleges. In 1993-94, sixth form colleges left the schools sector, this has distorted the number of teachers apparently leaving the schools sector and moving to another sector in 1993-94. From 1994-95 onwards, teachers leaving sixth form colleges are excluded.<P>

<P>
<a name="81208w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 This is a matter for those administering student support arrangements to agree locally, but I would not expect them to ask for such detailed information on individual students. Confirmation that a student or their parents are in receipt of an income-related benefit is usually all that is needed. The arrangements have operated in this way for a number of years.

 My colleagues and I continually assess teacher morale through the various contacts we have with teachers, which include visits to schools, face to face meetings, correspondence and consultations. We have published, on 3 December, a Green Paper setting out our vision of a modernised profession capable of creating a world class education service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will list those organisations in Wales involved in reviewing World Heritage Site nominations resulting from the Government's recent consultation.  [62050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Welsh candidates for the UK Tentative List of potential World Heritage Sites were provisionally identified by the Ancient Monuments Board for Wales and the Historic Buildings Council for Wales (in consultation with Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments) and the Countryside Council for Wales. All local authorities in Wales as well as specialist bodies with an interest in the recommended sites, were subsequently consulted. Cadw has been involved in the review of the results of consultation co-ordinated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

<a name="81208w21.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Denzil Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how much financial assistance has been provided to date by his Department and by Government bodies in Wales to LG Industries for the proposed semi-conductor investment at Newport, Gwent.  [62223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Out of the total support package offered to the overall LG development at Newport the payments to LG Semicon to date amount to &#163;43.328 million. This represents the apportioned value of the land acquired for the development, the general infrastructure and site development costs attributable to LG Semicon, and the property development grant paid by the Welsh Development Agency. This total also include training grants of &#163;528,487 paid by Gwent TEC.
<P>

<a name="81208w21.html_para8">None of the grant offered under the Regional Selective Assistance scheme has yet been paid.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w21.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Denzil Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what procedures his Department has in place to ensure that LG Industries repays any financial assistance received from his Department and from Governmental bodies in Wales for the proposed semi-conductor investment at Newport, Gwent, if the proposed investment does not go ahead.  [62224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Welsh Development Agency has agreements in place with both LG Electronics Ltd. and LG Semicon Ltd. which provide for recovery of grant payments in appropriate circumstances. The Regional Selective Assistance offered to the Companies is also subject to detailed recovery provisions. Gwent TEC makes payments to the LG Companies only when individuals have been training and in employment for 3 months. The total of training support will not be paid if training does not take place for the agreed numbers of staff.

<a name="81208w22.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales (1) what the value is of PFI credits approved for each unitary authority in Wales;  [62366]
<P>
<UL>(2) what is the total value of <i>(a)</i> all PFI applications per unitary authority in Wales to date and <i>(b)</i> PFI schemes approved per unitary authority to date.  [62370]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No PFI credits have yet been issued to County and County Borough Councils in Wales. However, on reaching contract signing stage credits amounting to about &#163;150 million are available for the projects selected as Local Government pathfinders.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what is the average time taken for the appraisal of PFI schemes in Wales.  [62368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Each scheme has to be appraised against the criteria of affordability and value for money. The time taken for the appraisal of PFI varies from scheme to scheme to such a degree that it is not possible to provide a meaningful average figure.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what the notional value is of Government credits for PFI apportioned to Wales.  [62367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are no PFI credits apportioned to Wales. The Welsh Block receives a consequential of the revenue costs of local government PFI projects approved in England. I determine the related level of PFI credits to be made available in Wales as and when successful projects emerge.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will list the criteria applied in considering PFI schemes for approval in Wales.  [62372]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The criteria applied in considering PFI schemes are that each scheme should:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meet a policy objective of the Welsh Office;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meet the priorities of the Welsh Office;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>deliver good value for money by allowing both public and private sectors to focus on what they do best; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ensure that staff are fairly treated whoever employs them.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many PFI schemes are currently under review in Wales.  [62369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are 6 PFI projects included in the Local Government pathfinder programme. There are 3 major NHS PFI projects currently being progressed with the private sector and in addition there are a number of other PFI schemes being progressed individually by NHS Trusts within locally delegated arrangements. There is also a PFI project with one of our NDPBs (Bute Avenue) and the Department itself has one project (the A55).
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many PFI schemes have been approved for each unitary authority in Wales.  [62371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Department is supporting 6 pathfinder PFI projects in the local government sector and will approve projects which successfully meet all the relevant criteria, including affordability. To date, no proposals have reached this stage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what steps he has taken to ensure that the Welsh Language Board monitors Welsh language schemes effectively.  [62364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Welsh Language Board has to set out plans for its activities in its corporate and operational plans. These plans require the approval of Ministers. Under the current approved operational plan, the Board is requiring bodies operating Welsh language schemes to submit annual reports on how they have carried out those schemes. The Board also uses its powers to investigate matters relating to individual schemes where it receives a complaint, or where it has other reason to believe that there has been a failure to carry out a scheme.
<P>

<a name="81208w22.html_para0">The Board's work and progress against its approved plans, is monitored in a cycle of regular meetings with Ministers and officials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w22.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In July 1995, following the publication of the Changing Childbirth report in 1993, the National Health Service Executive issued Executive Letter (95)77 to trusts, suggesting that an 'F' or 'G' grade would normally be appropriate for posts in which a midwife has a defined caseload of women to whom she/he gives the full range of midwifery care. Many NHS trusts have reviewed midwifery services and grading since Changing Childbirth. In January 1998 the Nursing Pay Review Body recommended that the Health Departments ensure the implementation of EL(95)77 at trust level and Advance Letter (Nurses/Midwives) 1/98 was issued on 4 June 1998 asked employing authorities to act upon this recommendation. Subsequently the NHS Executive wrote to NHS trusts in June 1998 asking about midwives' grading with reference to EL(95)77. We have summarised

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w23.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus does not pose a significant risk to healthy people and we are not aware of any evidence to suggest that MRSA infection is more common in hospital staff or visitors than in the rest of the general population. Employers must make a local assessment of the risks from MRSA and other biological agents under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Antibiotic resistance is one of the major challenges facing the international public health community. It was the subject of a comprehensive and wide ranging report earlier this year from the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology to which we will be responding shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81208w23.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 These data are not held centrally. In any individual patient, it is usually very difficult to assess the contribution of any infection acquired in hospital on the outcome, since many patients are already seriously ill from other conditions.

 The Department has issued guidelines on the control of infection in nursing and residential homes and in September 1998 issued a report by the Standing Medical Advisory Committee on good practice in clinical prescribing of antimicrobials to minimise the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

 Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus infection can take the form of many different diseases ranging from minor skin infections to pneumonia or septicaemia, all of which are more commonly due to other causes. It cannot be diagnosed clinically but only by laboratory tests. Notification of clinically suspected cases of all of these diseases would be wholly impracticable. However, consideration is being given to the introduction, at the earliest possible opportunity, of a statutory requirement on laboratories to notify certain specified test results, which may include those indicating MRSA infection.

The NHS Executive's regional offices, as part of their performance management responsibilities, analyse the returned questionnaires and follow up progress and issues through visits and other surveys.
