 Natural England investigates complaints about injurious weeds on behalf of DEFRA. During 2009, Natural England has issued 189 enforcement notices under the Weeds Act 1959 requiring occupiers to take action to prevent injurious weeds spreading to neighbouring land. Of these 189 enforcement notices, 15 were issued by the Natural England office in Worcester which covers the Eddisbury constituency area. It is not possible to be specific about the number issued for the Eddisbury constituency, nor is it possible to provide an estimate of what proportion of ragwort has been removed because this information is not held centrally.</p>

 The &#147;loss&#148; of television channels to some viewers has occurred not because of the digital switchover, but because of a national re-tune. The Broadcasters decided to go ahead with the re-organisation of the Freeview platform in order to make space for the introduction of new technology to enable High Definition services on the digital terrestrial television (or Freeview) platform. It has also increased the availability of Channel Five to the point where it can now be received in almost all households across the UK&#151;98.5 per cent.

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2009]:</i> When movement is by commercial airline, as opposed to MOD charter or part-charter, class of travel is determined by the length of flight and the rank or civil service grade of the passenger. The majority of armed forces and civilian personnel will travel economy, tourist or budget class. Only when flights are longer than 2.5 hours will the passenger be entitled to travel club, executive, new economy, ambassador or premier economy. Two star officers and above and two star senior civil service and above, will mostly travel by club, executive, business, new economy, ambassador or premier. However, when this class of travel is not available, the flight is longer than 2.5 hours, and this is the only method of travel available to meet with designated service priorities, then the passenger is entitled to travel first class.</p>

 Incandescent lighting on the parliamentary estate has been gradually replaced with lower energy lighting over the last five years, mostly during routine lamp changes. Therefore, the only cost of compliance has been the cost of the bulbs themselves which is offset by their increased life and will begin to produce savings within 500 hours of use. Due to the size and complexity of the estate, detailed records of light bulbs are not kept, but virtually no incandescent lighting remains within areas <i> (a)</i> the Chamber and <i> (b)</i> the Press Gallery. In <i> (c)</i>, areas open to the public, the vast majority of incandescent light bulbs have been replaced over the last 12 months with halogen lamps which consume some 30 per cent. less power. On <i> (d)</i>, the remainder of the Commons part of the estate, the only incandescent light fittings that the House has been unable to replace are those using small bayonet caps as these are not currently available. LED lighting is also currently being evaluated in several locations and low energy induction lighting is used widely such as in the Chamber and courtyards.</p>

The programme's objectives are to increase participation in intra-school competition for all young people aged 11 to 16, by providing a competitive experience which is appealing and accessible. The programme also provides opportunities for young leaders to deploy their leadership skills in organising, staging and officiating intra-school competition for their peers.</p>

 Information is not available in the form requested. The value of cash forfeiture orders and confiscation orders obtained by each police force in the eastern region from 2003-04 is set out in the table. The police can obtain forfeiture orders in the magistrates courts following the seizure of cash which they have reasonable grounds for suspecting is the proceeds of crime or intended for use in crime. Confiscation orders are made in the Crown court. The enforcement of confiscation orders is essentially a matter for HM Courts Service.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2009]:</i> The Quantum Technology Partnership is intended to bring together QinetiQ, universities and industry to create a world class centre for the industrial exploitation of quantum technology research. AWM has been working with the partners to develop the project over the past 12 months. The agency has employed a specialist project manager to support the partners, and has also commissioned economic impact work and contributed to the costs of some of the property aspects of the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="91029w0014.htm_para5"><a name="09102946001228">In January AWM received an application for funding of up to &#163;10 million towards the project. The project received outline approval on 6 August 2009 and a full application is expected to be received for appraisal later this month. Subject to satisfactory appraisal and approval by the Agency&#146;s Investment Decision Group a funding agreement could be in place in January 2010.</p>

These include: creating 70 per cent. additional telephone lines; adding 144 staff to answer phones, as well as more staff working overtime at the SLC and its outsource providers, increasing call centre operating capacity by around 35 per cent.; reminding students that they can check the status of their application online; and making improvements to answers to the most common enquiries on the internet, and directing callers to these via a recorded telephone message.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> Formerly a probation order.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, various types of community order previously available for adults (community punishment order, community rehabilitation order, drug treatment and testing order) were replaced by a single generic community order with a range of possible requirements. Courts are able to choose different elements to make up a bespoke community order, which is relevant to that particular offender and the crime(s) they committed.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> These statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts, and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The information requested is not available centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost by asking every young offender establishment to analyse all use of force records for these four years. Use of force is a last resort and is lawful only if its use is reasonable, proportionate and necessary. On 15 December 2008 the Government published their response to the Independent Review of Restraint in Juvenile Settings which followed the deaths of two young people in secure training centres. As part of this a new four stage system is being developed for restraint of young people in both youth offender institutions and secure training centres.</p>

In addition, a. detailed specific consultation was conducted in 2006/7 to refine the user requirements for information on ethnic group, national identity, religion and language questions for the 2011 Census. As a suite of questions they provide the opportunity for individual respondents to indicate their identity in the ways they consider most appropriate, and which ONS will be able to measure in the most statistically relevant way to meet the expressed needs of users. Consultation revealed a high demand for a religion question and the majority of responses indicated a requirement for comparability with the 2001 Census question.</p>

There is insufficient space on the questionnaire to include additional tick-boxes. However, Census outputs based on the write-in answers for those religions not specifically identified by tick boxes will be produced to meet user requirements. Consultation on the form and content of outputs from the 2011 Census is now underway.</p>

 When the Thalidomide Trust was set up in 1974, it was subject to the same rules that govern payments from all discretionary trusts. Under those rules, payments from Trust income counted towards the victims&#146; taxable income and also reduced their level of entitlement to tax credits.</p>

The Treasury were then able to make use of a power bringing those periodical payments by the trustees to Thalidomide victims within the scope of a relief aimed at structured damages settlements arrived at by agreement between the parties or by order of a court.</p>

 National health service organisations provide car parking to patients and visitors based on their local plans, needs and circumstances. Therefore, the details of implementing free car parking for in-patients will vary between different NHS organisations including the proportion that can be afforded in each year and which back-office costs will be reduced. However, all NHS organisations are expected to have fully implemented the change within three years. The improved concession guidance will benefit out-patients by stressing the importance of tangible concessions for regular users, particularly out-patients, and by ensuring that all eligible patients are made fully aware of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="91029w0023.htm_para0"><a name="09102956000562">The estimate of annual cost per annum for phasing out in-patient car parking of &#163;141 million was based on two figures. The direct cost of in-patient parking was based on the number of bed days recorded for elective, emergency and maternity care with each of the bed days resulting in two hours parking at the national average cost of visitor car parking per hour of &#163;1.00 giving a total of &#163;93 million. In addition, the impact of the NHS paying for private finance initiative and other commercial agreements was estimated at an additional &#163;48 million.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 September 2009]:</i> My noble Friend, Baroness Morgan of Drefelin, met officials from the London borough of Hillingdon in March this year to discuss work they are undertaking on child trafficking at Heathrow airport in partnership with the Metropolitan police. She is also a member of the Inter Ministerial Group on Human Trafficking, which meets regularly to discuss such issues. It is for each local authority to shape the services they provide to meet the needs of their local population. Where a local authority identifies a child who requires support, including those that have been trafficked, they are then responsible for identifying appropriate services to meet their needs, including being kept safe from any likely significant harm.</p>

1. Price Base: Real terms at 2008-09 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 29 September 2009.<br>
2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of standard spending assessment/education formula spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>
3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DFES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged three to 19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DFES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-07 to 2008-09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>
4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three-year-old maintained pupils and estimated three to four-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>
5. Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>
6. Status: Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority&#146;s previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department&#146;s time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority&#146;s previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified.

 Central Government funding to support local provision of school places is decided some time in advance, partly because of the time needed for the building of new capacity and partly to respond to local authorities&#146; longstanding plea for a degree of funding certainty. So the central Government decisions on allocating capital funding for school places in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were made some time ago, using pupil number forecasts provided to my Department from local authorities.</p>

 As the key universal service for children, schools play an important role in the promotion of better emotional health and resilience and early intervention where mental health problems may arise. There are a number of programmes in schools that increase awareness of mental health issues for children and young people. These include the Healthy Schools Programme and Targeted Mental Health in Schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="91029w0029.htm_para8"><a name="09102956001858">The Healthy Schools Programme requires schools to have policies and practices in place to support emotional health and wellbeing, including identifying children at risk of experiencing behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. Currently 99 per cent. of schools in England are working towards or have achieved Healthy School status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="91029w0029.htm_para9"><a name="09102956001859">The Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme is developing models of mental health support in schools for those children, young people and their families who need it most. The project includes training for school staff to equip them with the knowledge and ability to identify problems early, to work with and support children and young people at risk of experiencing mental health problems and to refer them to appropriate mental health professionals, as necessary. It also provides mental health awareness and promotion for children, young people and families. Funded by &#163;60 million between 2008 and 2011, the programme is currently operating in 80 local authorities. From September 2010 TaMHS will be operating in clusters of schools in all areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"><a name="91029w0029.htm_para10"><a name="09102956001860">There are other school based programmes that also promote better emotional wellbeing. Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) is a comprehensive voluntary programme to develop the social and emotional skills of all pupils, while the new personal wellbeing programme of study within Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education includes a specific focus on issues relating to emotional wellbeing and mental health.</p>

The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against &#147;notional SEN&#148; are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004-05 onwards, &#147;notional SEN&#148; delegated to nursery schools was reported on Section 52 for the first time (nursery schools &#147;notional SEN&#148; accounts for &#163;7.8 million, &#163;9.5 million, &#163;10.4 million, &#163;11.1 million and &#163;11.7 million of the respective 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 England totals). In 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 local authorities in England also budgeted &#163;499.6 million, &#163;528.5 million, &#163;554.9 million and &#163;552.6 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the above table as figures are not available prior to 2005-06.<br>
