 It is estimated based upon records of consumer purchases from the Expenditure and Food Survey that 736 million litres of mineral water were consumed in the UK in the 12 month period starting in April 2003. These are the latest estimates available. In the same period a year earlier it was 655 million litres.

<a name="stpa_0">Defra does not collect statistics which distinguish between sparkling and still waters or the way water is packaged. However, figures published by Mintel in its Bottled Water Report of June 2003 indicate that 75 per cent. of bottled water in 2003 was still and 25 per cent. sparkling. In addition, 79 per cent. was packaged in plastic bottles, 20 per cent. in glass bottles and 1 per cent. in cans.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment was made of the potential demand that would be placed on the fallen stock scheme during lambing in North West Wales prior to the scheme&#039;s implementation. [12370]</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="50719w01.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 July 2005]</i>: As part of the business case for the scheme an assessment was made of the potential demand for fallen stock collection from the farming industry and the ability of the collection and disposal industry to meet the demand. At a national level, as the latter has consistently maintained, there has been sufficient capacity to meet demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">However, it was always anticipated that there may be localised areas, particularly during times of peak demand, where there may be difficulties in meeting the demand for collection services. Given that in advance of the scheme starting it was difficult to know how many farmers would join the scheme in a given area or which areas fallen stock collectors would wish to cover it was not possible to identify with any certainty the extent of such difficulties in advance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">Unfortunately in parts of North West Wales only one collector was available. This collector made every effort to increase capacity for the lambing season but was unable to meet the demand. Positive steps have now been taken by the National Fallen Stock Company, the farming industry and the collector concerned to learn from this and ensure demand can be met for next year&#039;s lambing season.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50719w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 July 2005]</i>: Any derogation would need to be from the EU Animal By-Products Regulation which bans on-farm burial of fallen stock. The scheme is there to assist farmers in their compliance with the regulation. Under the regulation one of the criteria for meeting the requirements for a derogation is that the area concerned should have a low livestock density. This is not true for North West Wales and therefore it would be difficult for the National Assembly for Wales to make a case for granting one.

The Committee concluded in December 1972 that, in the special context of liquor licensing law, the application of the test of need to new applications for justices&#039; on-licences was out of date and unnecessary.

 For the last five years for the UK as a whole the percentages of electricity sales by licensed suppliers in the UK from renewable sources eligible under the Renewables Obligation (RO) are shown in the following table. These percentages can be divided into two parts; firstly the percentage generated from re-furbished hydro plant and secondly the percentage generated from other eligible plant. On an RO basis the percentage measures for the UK are not meaningful at a sub national level because electricity generated in one part of the UK can be sold in a different part of the UK and the amount of electricity from renewable sources transferred from Scotland or Wales to England or from Scotland to Northern Ireland is not known.

 Microfinance, or financial services for those on low or very low income, is a powerful tool to fight poverty and help reach the Millennium Development Goals. Approximately 50 million low income people have a loan from a microfinance institution, and at least 500 million have some form of bank account, but in some African countries still less than 10 per cent. of the population has access to a bank account.

<p>
<a name="50719w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_117">Financial exclusion, or lack of access to financial services, acts as a constraint on economic growth and poverty reduction. Without access to loans, small enterprises can be restricted from expanding in size or into new markets. Families need access to a savings account, or to money transfer services, in order to ensure they have money at times of need, or to pay for education and other expenditure.

DFID has funded financial sector and microfinance projects in 25 countries and is the major funder to the global Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) initiative. My Department was instrumental in setting up and supporting, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), which is now made up of 29 international donor agencies. This is a resource centre for microfinance institutions and a centre of best practice for donors, Governments, and financial institutions. DFID also funds international agencies that actively support microfinance and financial sector development, such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w19.html_para2">

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1578W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
In several cases these are co-funded with other donors. These programmes work to improve the policy, legal and institutional framework so that banks and other financial institutions are able to expand into microfinance, and in some cases provide direct support to financial institutions to do so. They also enable microfinance institutions to access training, management skills and technical assistance, and improve their governance and systems.

<a name="stpa_121">DFID&#039;s Financial Deepening Challenge Fund has supported innovation by the private sector to extend access to financial services. For example, this Challenge Fund provided a grant to a Kenyan financial institution that then also invested at least as much of its own money, resulting in access to financial services in remote rural parts of Kenya through satellite-linked land rovers. A telecommunications company was also assisted to develop mobile phone-based banking services for low income people in East Africa, which is a technology that offers potential for significantly improving access to financial services across Africa.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1581W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Spending Review. The Child Poverty Review shows that poverty can affect children&#039;s lives through the effects of living in poor housing and eating less nutritious food, and the higher risks of accidents, ill health and problems with school work. Poverty can exclude children from the everyday activities of their peers and limit their opportunities to play safely. Poverty in childhood can prevent children from fulfilling their potential by leading to poorer educational attainment and higher chances of poverty and social exclusion in adult life.

<a name="stpa_124">Child poverty more than doubled between the mid 1970s and the mid 1990s in the UK and we had the highest rate in Europe. The Government are committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. We have already seen some success. By 2003&#150;04 there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income households compared to 1998&#150;99. The Department is working with partners within and beyond Government to meet the Government&#039;s target of eradicating child poverty.

 The majority of services available through Sure Start local programmes are free at the point of use. Local programmes are, however, able to charge parents for child care services provided. Given this, the Government are committed to ensuring that high quality places for children under five, where care and education are integrated, are both affordable and accessible to all parents, particularly those living in disadvantaged areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w23.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">To this end, the 10-year child care strategy, published in December 2004, set out our vision for ensuring that every child gets the best start in life and giving parents more choice about how to balance work and family life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w23.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">Child care costs are currently subsidised by tax credits which are rightly targeted at lower and middle income families. The working tax credit is designed to help with the costs of registered or approved child care. From April 2005 the maximum child care element of the working tax credit increased from &#163;135 to &#163;175 for one child and from &#163;200 to &#163;300 for two or more children, subject to a maximum portion of child care costs payable of 70 per cent. From April 2006 the maximum will increase from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. These changes were expected to benefit 20,000 families straight away and many more over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w23.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_144">The Government currently provides support to all parents in meeting child care costs and is clearly committed to increasing such support in the future.

<a name="stpa_145">From 2006 the 12.5 hour free entitlement to early education for 33 weeks per year will be extended to cover 38 weeks per year for all children aged three or four. From 2007 the free entitlement will begin to increase to 15 hours per week, with all children receiving 15 hours by 2010 on the way to a goal of 20 hours per week. Parents will have the flexibility to use the free entitlement across a minimum of three days. This will result in better choices for all parents who need full day, all year round child care, improved affordability for parents; and more sustainable income for providers.

<p><a name="qnpa_16">(2) what assessment she has made of the commercial implications of requiring training providers to establish a series of regional contracts before they can be consolidated into a single national contract with regional management arrangements;  [7122]

<p><a name="qnpa_17">(3) if she will make a statement on the commercial implications of replacing lead and feed arrangements in the awarding of contracts to training providers through the Learning and Skills Council with regional contracting in 2005&#150;06 for providers already operating on a <i>(a)</i> regional and <i>(b)</i> national basis.

 The &#039;lead and feed&#039; arrangements were part of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC)&#039;s contracting arrangements for 2004&#150;05 and were designed to simplify the relationship between providers and the LSC. As part of its continuing drive to improve quality in work-based learning the LSC has reviewed its contracting arrangements, including &#039;lead and feed&#039; arrangements and is introducing new systems for 2005&#150;06. I have asked Mark Haysom, the Council&#039;s Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Gentleman with more detail about these issues. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_154">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to provide you with a written response to your recent parliamentary questions regarding the LSC&#039;s regional contracting arrangements.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_155">Lead and feed arrangements were introduced in August 2003 to meet the requirements of Success for All to introduce single contracts and development plans for national providers. The arrangements also enabled the LSC to meet requests from The 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>19 Jul 2005 : Column 1601W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>Association of Learning Providers to reduce the bureaucracy of contracting for large providers who worked across more than one local LSC area.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_156">The arrangements were reviewed in 2004 and found to have met the objective of reducing bureaucracy. However, the review also found that the majority of large providers still had success rates below the national average. The review therefore recommended a move to regional contracting so that the LSC could dedicate more senior resource to support providers in improving their quality and success rates.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_157">Many large, national providers have introduced their own regional management arrangements and the commercial impact of the regional contracting on providers is not expected to be significant.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_158">Regional contracting will not affect the responsibility for local LSC&#039;s to decide which providers they contract with and for what programmes. Local LSC&#039;s will be making contracting decisions based on providers&#039; past performance and local need. This may result in some providers not having their contract renewed but this will not be as a result of the introduction of regional contracting.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_159">Where the decision not to contract with a provider would result in the displacement of learners, the LSC is fully equipped and ready to place each learner with a new provider so that the learner can complete their original programme with the minimum disruption. It is not possible to calculate the number of learners affected until contracting negotiations have taken place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_160">The LSC expects that regional contracting will give providers the opportunity to re-direct administration and management time to front line delivery as the number of points at which we liaise reduces from one per local LSC to one per region.</p>

 Work has been conducted with the police, HM Revenue and Customs and the Security Service to identify their possible demand for verification requests and provision of information from the National Identity Register.

<p><a name="st_248"><a name="50719w26.html_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 Most countries with identity cards have had schemes in place for many years and they are therefore not in a position to evaluate the impact they have on crime. However, it is clear that schemes in other countries do help in the fight against crime, for example the Spanish police have stated that identifying nearly all of the terrorists involved in the Madrid bombings was made significantly easier by their identity cards scheme. Identity cards were also used to identify the victims of the bombings quickly.

<a name="stpa_168">Biometrics are being used to more strongly tie a verified identity to an individual. In this way, biometrics can be used along with an ID card to verify that identity against the record held for that card.

<p>
<a name="50719w26.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_175">In enrolment situations the process would be supervised thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent use of biometrics.

 No Government has ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately, and that remains the case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w27.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_178">Although it is impossible to determine accurately how many people are in the UK illegally the Home Office published a report which included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the UK in 2001. It should be noted that the report included an estimate, not an accurate or definitive figure.

<p>
<a name="50719w27.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_179">As mentioned in the report the only method to estimate the size of the unauthorised migrant population in the UK that currently can sensibly be applied is the residual method. As the method relies on data from the census of the population undertaken every 10 years, it is not possible to produce an estimate for a more recent year.

 Millimetre wave imaging is one of a number of technologies being evaluated by the police service and the Home Office Scientific Development Branch for detecting bombs and weapons carried under clothing.

QinetiQ&#039;s latest system will be evaluated as soon as it is available, probably in early August. The new device is smaller than the stowaway detection system and is designed to inspect individuals or groups of people. The image shows the surface of the body and objects under the clothing and needs to be interpreted by a trained operator.

 This consultation document (Cm6402) was published on 16 December 2004 and covered a wide range of issues, including proposals on the use of a regulation-making power to exclude certain cancers (mainly minor skin cancers) from the scope of the extended definition of disability in the Disability Discrimination Bill, now the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The formal consultation ended on 18 March.

During consideration of the Disability Discrimination Bill in the House of Lords, the Government undertook not to use the cancer regulation-making power until it had reviewed in consultation with the Disability Rights Commission and cancer organisations, evidence relating to disability discrimination in respect of cancers not likely to require substantial treatment. This exercise supplemented the public consultation and was carried out in April and May. We are considering the outcomes of both these exercises and expect to be in a position to publish the results shortly.

 The general provision is that payment of housing benefit is made to the tenant. Every tenant is personally responsible for paying their rent; of those who claim housing benefit, the vast majority accept that responsibility by paying rent to their landlords.

Housing benefit regulations give local authorities wide-ranging powers to pay benefit direct to a claimant&#039;s landlord where there are eight weeks arrears of rent, unless it is in the tenant&#039;s overriding interest not to do so, or the landlord is not regarded as fit and proper to receive such payments.

<a name="stpa_20">Local authorities also have discretion to make direct payments at any time where they decide that it is in the tenant&#039;s best interest to do so. This provision also caters for circumstances where it may be appropriate to make direct payments where there are no rent arrears, for example where the tenant has a history of rent arrears at a previous address or where social or medical problems clearly indicate that help with budgeting is needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50719w32.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_21">If a tenant, having originally agreed to payment direct to his landlord, then withdraws his consent it is still open to the local authority to make direct payment if they are satisfied this would be in the tenant&#039;s interest, for example, to prevent rent arrears and possible eviction.

<a name="stpa_38">The top-up rate for discretionary initial payments made to eligible members before wind-up has been completed, including terminally ill people, has been set at 60 per cent. of core pension rights. This is because at that stage scheme trustees will not know how the scheme&#039;s assets compare with its liabilities and how much pension individual members have lost. This follows the precedent whereby trustees may, where funds allow, make interim payments at a safe rate to pensioner members from the pension scheme itself before wind-up is completed. Initial payments from the FAS will take account of any interim payments from the pension scheme. The top-up rate will be adjusted to 80 per cent. on the completion of wind-up and, if needed, arrears will be paid to compensate for the lower rate of payment during wind-up.

<a name="stpa_42">The Department introduced a well-being at work policy in September 2004 as a means of tackling work-related stress. The HSE Management Standards and associated processes underpin the well-being policy and feature as part of the annual DWP staff survey. In addition, the Department has contracts with Atos Origin to provide an occupational health service, and with Right Core Care to provide an employee assistance service. Such provision is not, however, confined to work-related stress, which means it is difficult to apportion a cost to what is being done to reduce this.

<a name="stpa_52">Updating this information and providing information on the additional recommendations contained in the first and second reports from the Select Committee on Abortion, session 1975&#150;76, could be done only at disproportionate cost. Since 1976, a wide range of issues relating to abortion were considered by Parliament during the debates informing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. In 2001, the national strategy for sexual health and HIV set out the Government&#039;s 10 year strategy for sexual health, further bolstered by the 2004 public health White Paper. In this context, the Health Select Committee has itself conducted inquiries into sexual and reproductive health, including abortion issues, in 2003 and 2005.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited HA summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. Figures for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning health care or other services.<br>

3. In many HAs there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or primary<br>

care trusts (PCTs).<br>

4. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. Therefore, the total expenditure in the answer by health authority does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Data were collected by health authority only prior to 2001&#150;02. Trust level data were collected from 2001&#150;02 onwards<br>

2. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels his/her operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br>





3. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>

4. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Registration rates, that is, the percentage of the population registered with a dentist, have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery (not the patient&#039;s address). So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. This can lead to figures being unusually high (even over 100 per cent. for child registrations), whilst other areas may have estimated rates lower than the actual proportion of residents who are registered with a dentist in or outside their own area.<br>

2. The registration rates use population estimates for the PCT areas for the nearest year for which data are available. Figures for 1997 to 2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated from 2003 population data, as this is the most up to date available.<br>

3. The numbers of registrations are based on a snapshot of the registration database taken at the end of March each year and subsequent retrospective notifications of changes to registrations have not been included.<br>





4. Some double counting may occur in the totals when a patient has been newly registered with a dentist in one PCT, but not yet de-registered from a dentist in another PCT.<br>

5. The changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months under the GDS from 1 September 1996 affected the registration numbers from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures.<br>

6. Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.<br>

7. Some PDS schemes do not have any registrations, for example, dental access centres and will not therefore be included in these figures.<br>

8. There is a small number of unallocated registrations.<br>

 Emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) is not a method of abortion.

The conscience clause set out in section 4 of the Abortion Act is therefore not relevant to the supply of EHC.

Note:<br>

1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission 



details, e.g.,. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

5. Time waited (days)&#151;time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50719w47.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 In 2005 the percentage of returns received in which HMRC sought additional information or clarification of information included in stamp duty land tax returns has averaged approximately 33 per cent. A recent review suggested that in approximately 5 per cent. of cases received, one or more fields were either not captured or were misinterpreted during the scanning process. This figure includes returns where the handwriting results in information being captured incorrectly. As a result of this review, HMRC have identified a number of modifications which will quickly reduce the percentage of cases in which there is a scanning error.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the position of the minority shareholders in UK Royal Dutch Shell who, following the reconstruction of the Shell Group, will be liable for capital gains tax.  [12425]</p>

<p>
<a name="50719w48.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_124">The UK has rules relating to share exchanges, which provide for relief by deferring tax on capital gains. Whether that relief is due to shareholders affected by the Shell reconstruction depends on exactly how the reconstruction is carried out. The detail of the reconstruction is, of course, entirely a matter for the companies concerned.
