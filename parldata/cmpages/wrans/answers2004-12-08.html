<a name="41208w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Agriculture and Fisheries Council</h3>


<p><a name="41208w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Hood: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 22 and 23 November; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement. [199752]</p>




<p><a name="41208w01.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 22 and 23 November 2004. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Ministers with responsibility for agriculture and fisheries were also present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para0">
The Council opened on the first day in office of the new Commission. The Council welcomed Commissioners Mariann Fischer-Boel, Markos Kyprianou and Joe Borg to their new posts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para1">
The Presidency secured qualified majority support for a political agreement on a compromise text updating the current rules on the welfare of animals during transport. I supported the proposal, which contains significant improvements to the current rules, including a strengthening of the enforcement rules in Europe, stricter rules for journeys of more than eight hours and new rules for the transport of horses. The proposal also sets out a clear timetable for the review of the new rules together with a commitment to address the issue of journey times, space allowances and rest periods no later than four years after they have come into effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para2">
The Council had a lengthy exchange of views on reform in the sugar sector, based on the Commission&#039;s communication of July 2004. The Commission indicated that it would not make formal proposals until May or June next year when the result of the EU&#039;s appeal against a WTO panel ruling on the sugar regime had been received. The Commission would press for political agreement before the WTO Ministerial scheduled for Hong Kong in December 2005. A majority of member states were critical of the Commission&#039;s approach thus far and argued for minimal change, principally aimed at maintaining production in all those areas of the EU where it is currently found. I argued that the current regime was unsustainable and that reform was inescapable. The EU needed to honour its external obligations and I welcomed the Commission&#039;s commitment to bringing forward a draft action plan for assistance to the ACP countries by the end of the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para3">
In a brief discussion of the rural development and CAP financing proposals, there was general support for the rural development measures, although concerns were expressed on a number of specific issues such as the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 510W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
proposed structure for the new regulation and the treatment of less favoured areas. I stressed the importance of further transfers to Pillar 2 measures, the case for a more objective allocation of funds and the need for equitable treatment of the non-euro member states. Discussion will continue at official level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para4">
The Presidency drew attention to its initiative for member states to co-operate on agricultural research in order to avoid duplication and to maximise value for money. I supported this initiative and expressed our readiness to co-operate with Luxembourg in taking it forward next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para5">
Under Other Business, Estonia described its problems relating to a Russian ban on imports of plant material, Spain called for collaboration with Morocco in the field of animal health, Germany asked the Commission to bring forward legislation on the marketing of seeds of plant varieties of conservation importance, and Slovakia requested funding under the natural disasters heading following gales in the High Tatras national park.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para6">
The Commission reported progress in the bilateral negotiations on a 2005 fisheries agreement with Norway. Good progress had been made in a first round of negotiations on 15&#150;19 November, including provisional agreement on some of the more contentious issues. My hon. Friend and other member states congratulated the Commission on progress so far while underlining the importance of concluding the negotiations rapidly so that EU fishermen are able to fish in Norway waters from 1 January.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para7">
The Council had a first debate on the Commission&#039;s proposals for a European Fisheries Fund (to replace the existing fund for structural improvements in the fisheries sector from 2007). My hon. Friend made clear that the proposal from certain other member states that this should provide for subsidies for fleet renewal would mean going back on a key plank of the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and was not acceptable. Discussions will continue next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para8">
The Council reached agreement by qualified majority on a proposal to allocate quotas to deep sea species to certain new member states, based on a presidency compromise tabled at the meeting. Although the compromise went some way towards requests from the United Kingdom and others that new allocations should be on the same basis as allocation to the EU15, the UK abstained in the vote because the proposal had not cleared Parliamentary Scrutiny and because the Government have concerns about the management regime for deep sea species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para9">
The Council held a discussion on management measures for fisheries in the Baltic Sea.

<a name="41208w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Countryside Access (Consultation)</h3>


<p><a name="41208w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she intends to publish the results of her consultation on four-wheel drive vehicles and access to the countryside on by-ways open to all traffic.  [202061]</p>

<p><a name="41208w01.html_wqn2"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what budget has been set by her Department for <i>(a)</i> consumption of resources and <i>(b)</i> capital spending for (i) environmental protection, (ii) animal health and welfare, (iii) food, farming and fisheries, (iv) land use and rural affairs, (v) departmental operations, (vi) the Rural Payments Agency and (vii) other executive agencies for (A) 2005&#150;06, (B) 2006&#150;07 and (C) 2007&#150;08.  [202039]</p>




<p><a name="41208w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The 2004 departmental report (Cm 6219) shows financial breakdowns for departmental spending up to 2005&#150;06. The information includes how budgets are allocated to deliver the department&#039;s functions and objectives. At present, final internal management decisions on budgets for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 (plus revisions to 2005&#150;06) are still being made. The next departmental report due to be published in spring 2005, will set out information on budgets up to 2007&#150;08 and reflect any organisational changes which have been made over the last year.

<p><a name="41208w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Gangmasters Act 2004 is expected to come fully into force. [199441]</p>




<p><a name="41208w01.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Since the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act received Royal Assent in July 2004, a Commencement Order has been laid before Parliament bringing into effect from 1 December 2004 those provisions in the Act which relate to the establishment of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. Consultation on the draft Gangmaster Licensing Authority Regulations has been completed and it is anticipated that the regulations will be presented to the House for consideration immediately after Christmas. If the House is content, it should be possible to legally establish the Licensing Authority by 1 April 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para10">
Once established, the authority will need to develop and put in place licensing arrangements. This will include work to develop the conditions to be attached to a licence and the associated audit and compliance arrangements. We are working with stakeholders to ensure that the authority will be in a position to make early progress on these issues. We hope that the authority can start dealing with the first round of licence applications in 2005 with a view to completing the process of issuing first licences by mid 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para11">
In the mean time, the Code of Practice launched recently by the Ethical Trading Initiative Temporary Labour Working Group, provides an important opportunity for the whole food chain to show its commitment to a reduction in worker exploitation while work on the introduction of the statutory licensing arrangements proceeds in parallel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w01.html_para12">
Once the first round of licence applications have been dealt with we will bring the offence of operating as a gangmaster without a licence into effect. At this stage all gangmasters will need to be licensed.

<a name="41208w02.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Roadside Lighting</h3>


<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the reduction in <i>(a)</i> electricity use and <i>(b)</i> carbon dioxide emissions if all roadside lighting in the UK were to switch to LED illuminations.  [202069]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w02.html_para0">
The light output and efficiency of high intensity light emitting diodes (LEDs) can now equal or better that of incandescent lamps. However, the light output is still significantly less than the gas discharge light sources used for street lighting, for example high pressure sodium. At present both electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions would increase if the UK switched to LEDs for street lighting.
</p>





<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the total <i>(a)</i> electricity use and <i>(b)</i> carbon dioxide emissions produced by (i) roadside street lighting and (ii) other public illumination of roadside signage in the last year for which figures are available.  [202070]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w02.html_para1">
Street lighting in England is the responsibility of local highway authorities in respect of local roads and the Highways Agency in respect of the trunk road network. The electricity supply for public lighting is not normally metered, but is based on notional lamp wattages and hours of use. The actual electricity consumption is therefore unknown. It is for local highway authorities to decide whence to source their electricity supply so, even if the power consumption could be established, calculations about the carbon dioxide emissions produced by street lighting would be impossible without knowing what proportion of authorities have contracted for &quot;green&quot; energy sources.

<a name="41208w02.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Rural Funding</h3>


<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn2"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how rural funding under the single farm payment will be implemented. [200418]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The CAP reform package agreed in June 2003 allows modulated funds to be compulsorily transferred from farming subsidies to agri-environment and other rural development schemes in all EU member states. A 3 per cent. rate of compulsory EU modulation will apply to subsidy payments in 2005 rising to 5 per cent. from 2007. In addition the UK 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 513W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
secured agreement to allow an additional voluntary modulation rate to be levied over and above the EU rate.
</p>





<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn3"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for rural areas of the new rural funding scheme, with particular reference to North Yorkshire. [200419]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 As part of the Rural Strategy 2004 we announced a simplified funding framework which will be clearly focused on the key targets set out by the Secretary of State, particularly deprivation or social exclusion in rural areas and underperforming rural economies. Delivery will be devolved as much as possible. As a result of our work on the rural database, Defra funding will be better targeted at priorities, with greater regional partnership working and prioritisation. Customers and the public will face a less confusing situation and will receive better information and support in their dealings with our delivery agencies.
</p>





<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn4"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which body will be the delivery body for the new rural funding scheme. [200420]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The new rural funding framework we announced in Rural Strategy 2004 will have three core funds designed to support three departmental priorities. They are: sustainable rural communities; sustainable farming and food; and natural resource protection. Each will have a grant funding and a core (organisational capacity) funding element. In this framework, Regional Development Agencies will take the lead on regeneration and socio-economic funding, support for the rural voluntary and community sector will rest primarily with Rural Community Councils and their partners, supported by Government Offices, while 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 514W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the new Integrated Agency (also announced in Rural Strategy 2004) will deliver natural resource protection and environmental land-management funding.

<p><a name="41208w02.html_wqn5"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for parish plans of the streamlining process for rural funding. [200421]</p>




<p><a name="41208w02.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 In Rural Strategy 2004 we announced that we would simplify our funding framework with delivery devolved as much as possible with parish and town councils playing an important role at the local level. The value of parish plans has been enhanced by the attention and support given to the work of parish and town councils by Ministers and officials at ODPM and Defra, not least through the qualification of clerks and the QUALITY Parish and Town Councils scheme. Having been promoted through pilot schemes on our behalf by the Countryside Agency, we are now working to &quot;mainstream&quot; the parish plan approach and to support further development through the future funding framework.

<i>[holding answer 6 December 2004]:</i> Clause 17 gives the Secretary of State the power to prohibit the fitting of, or the use of vehicles carrying, speed assessment equipment detection devices. It defines such devices as a device one or more of whose purposes is to interfere with or detect the operation of equipment used to assess the speed of motor vehicles.

The Government do not intend to prohibit the use of equipment which usefully gives drivers information on the location of published camera sites and does not detect or interfere with the operation of speed assessment equipment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w04.html_para1">
The sole purpose of detection devices to be covered by the proposed law is to tell drivers when they can break speed limits and get away with it. This is unacceptable, prevents the police from carrying out their duties, and is a danger to other law-abiding drivers and road users.

<p>
<a name="41208w04.html_para2">
There is overwhelming evidence from both UK and international literature that speeding results in more collisions and more severe casualties. As regards safety cameras, the evidence from the independent review of the safety camera programme by University College London and PA Consulting found that cameras significantly reduced the number of people killed or seriously injured at camera sites. This evidence demonstrates why the provisions of Clause 17 of the Bill would enhance road safety.

 In the central Department there is only one significant refurbishment project currently under way, or due to begin in the next six months, involving timber products and this is the replacement of furniture, stud partitioning and doors in Great Minster House. For the partitioning and furniture we will be using the call-off contracts managed by OGC which take account of Government polices on sustainable and legal timber. The doors will be modified and re-used.

It would be premature to consider what revenue might be raised from making the 1911 and 1921 censuses available online so far in advance of their release dates.

<p class="tabletext">PISA is a survey co-ordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which was conducted in 41 countries in 2003. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducted the survey in England and Wales on behalf of the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency in Northern Ireland on behalf of Department of Education, Northern Ireland. The survey in Scotland was conducted by the Scottish Centre for Research in Education on behalf of the Scottish Executive.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The survey involves a two-hour written assessment, as well as completion of a questionnaire by a representative sample of students aged 15. In the UK, PISA depends on the voluntary co-operation of both schools and students. Compared with other surveys conducted through schools, PISA is quite disruptive as it takes a long time to complete and is conducted in the Spring term when schools are preparing for examinations.</p>

<p class="tabletext">Minimum criteria for response rates are set by OECD, and the response rates in the UK, in particular in England, fell short of the required minimum.

In spite of this, the survey response rates fell short of the threshold set by the OECD.</p>

<p><a name="41208w13.html_wqn0"><b> Helen Jones: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what recent discussions he has had on the five year limitation for lodging a complaint with the General Medical Council; [201511]
</p>



<p>(2) if he will take steps to ensure that complaints submitted to the General Medical Council outside the five year limitation period are investigated if it might have a bearing on a doctor&#039;s fitness to practise; [201512]
</p>



<p>(3) what discussions took place between his Department and the General Medical Council prior to the introduction of recent changes in the time limit for lodging complaints. [201513]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 553W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41208w13.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The recent changes to the General Medical Council&#039;s (GMC) fitness to practise procedures were made by amendment of the &quot;Medical Act 1983&quot; under &quot;The Medical Act 1983 (Amendment) Order 2002&quot;. These changes came into force on 1 November 2004. The Department discussed the changes with the CMC as part of the preparations for the making of the Order, which was subject to a statutory consultation before it was laid in Parliament for approval.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w13.html_para0">
The time limit during which an allegation must be made to the CMC was changed by GMC amendment rules in November 2002 (SI 2002/2572). As is usual practice, these rules were discussed with the GMC while they were being drafted. &quot;The General Medical Council (Fitness to Practise) Rules Order of Council 2004&quot;, which also came into force on 1 November re-enacted this previous change. The Rules already provide in rule 4(5) for an allegation made outside the five-year period to be proceeded with if in the exceptional circumstances of the case the registrar considers it is in the public interest to do so.
</p>




<a name="41208w13.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Health Professions Council</h3>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what purposes the Health Professions Council is advertising on radio; what the cost of radio advertising used by them is in the past 12 months; and what estimate has been made of the cost of planned radio advertising.  [202176]</p>




<p><a name="41208w13.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 This is a matter for the Health Professions Council (HPC), which is an independent regulator funded by membership subscription. The HPC has a statutory duty under article 3(13) of the HPC order to inform the public about its work.
</p>





<p><a name="41208w13.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much funding has been allocated to the Health Professions Council <i>(a)</i> in the current financial year and <i>(b)</i> for each of the next three years.  [202177]</p>




<p><a name="41208w13.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We have no funding allocated to the Health Professions Council for this year or for future years. The council is an independent regulator funded by membership subscription.

<a name="41208w13.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Health Trainers</h3>


<p><a name="41208w13.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Lansley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the process will be for accrediting NHS health trainers, as defined in the White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, Cm 6374. [199484]</p>




<p><a name="41208w13.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Health trainers are a new initiative for the national health service and we will be working in consultation with the Health Professions Council and others with an interest to develop processes for accreditation building on the experience gained by piloting the health trainer model in spearhead primary care trusts from 2005. These processes will be based on completion of formal training with built-in standards and quality assurance.

<p><a name="41208w13.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Norman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the strategic health authorities which did not achieve full compliance with the European working time directive for junior doctors in each month since August.  [201261]</p>




<p><a name="41208w13.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Compliance with the working time directive (WTD) is a local matter and the Department of Health does not routinely collect validated information on WTD compliance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w13.html_para1">
From informal discussions with strategic health authorities, we know that the vast majority of trusts achieved compliance across all specialties by 1 August. These discussions also revealed that implementation of the WTD has resulted in a handful of trusts experiencing teething problems in a limited number of specialties.

Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, &quot;Central Nervous System&quot; has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&#151;these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br>

2. Net ingredient cost (NIC) is the basic cost of a drug. It does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.<br>

3. The sum of all SHAs does not equal the total England figure, because the total England figure includes unidentified doctors (not possible for the PPA to allocate to a PCT).<br>

4. Tranquilisers have been defined as all drugs in the British National Formulary section 4.1 &quot;Hypnotics and anxiolytics&quot;. Antidepressants have been defined as all drugs in the British National Formulary section 4.3 &quot;Antidepressant drugs&quot;<br>

5. 2002 and 2003 mid-year population estimates based on the 2001 Census have been used to calculate net ingredient cost per head of population.<br>

 At the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04 the value of debt due to the Legal Services Commission (LSC) under the statutory charge was &#163;264 million. This included &#163;50 million of interest that had accrued upon the debt.
</p>

The debt is secured by the registration of a statutory charge against property and is not generally collectable immediately. Under existing regulations, the LSC has no discretion to enforce repayment of the debt until the charged property is re-mortgaged, sold or upon the death of the client. When one of these events occurs, the Land Registry notifies the LSC and recovery procedures commence.

In order to keep funded clients informed about their debt, and to facilitate early repayment, the LSC has commenced sending out annual statements to clients setting out amounts owed, including accrued interest and offering clients the opportunity to make payment in full or by instalment of their debt.

<p><a name="41208w18.html_spnew4"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Winter fuel payments are one of several measures in place to help alleviate fuel poverty. The majority of payments are made automatically without the need to claim. People who have not previously received a payment and who do not receive a Social Security benefit other than child benefit, housing benefit or council tax benefit must claim. Every effort is made to try and contact those who are newly eligible. For those people who do need to make a claim an extensive publicity campaign is carried out. This begins three months before the qualifying week in September and continues to the end of March. The campaign includes advertisements in national and local press, a leaflet and poster made available in a variety of venues, a dedicated winter fuel payment helpline and information on the internet.

 The UN and the Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VACs) have estimated that around 5.6 million people in southern Africa will be food insecure until June 2005. There is, however, some debate as to how many of these require emergency food relief and how many are part of the caseload of people who are affected by structural, long-term food insecurity outside crisis situations, and for whom short term food aid is an inappropriate and unsustainable response.

Estimates from the Food and Early Warning System Network (FEWS-NET) indicate that the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region will have a surplus of 1.9 million tonnes of cereals in the 2004&#150;05 growing season, after allowing for planned imports. The situation varies quite considerably for individual countries both at national, sub national and household levels however, and VAC assessments will remain important in determining the appropriate level of short-term, emergency response.

 In many southern African countries, significant numbers of poor people are food insecure even when there is no food crisis. Ill health, unemployment, and lack of other means to obtain food (production, welfare payments, or family and non-governmental support) all contribute to a longer-term, structural food insecurity problem.

DFID is increasing its support for income generating initiatives, and is encouraging the development of cash transfer programmes (as part of wider poverty reduction efforts in partnership with Governments), in order to address the long-term vulnerability issue underlying the present food insecurity in the region.

In Zambia, DFID is working with Government to implement cash transfers as part of a wider social protection policy aimed at vulnerable, food insecure groups.

<a name="41208w21.html_para4">
In southern Africa, DFID has been important supporters of the Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VAC) at county and regional levels. This support has given us detailed information on the numbers of food insecure people who will require emergency assistance and, equally important, enables us to understand what responses are most appropriate to long-term food insecurity in the region. The VAC reports clearly underline that food aid alone is not an appropriate solution to underlying food insecurity conditions in southern Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w21.html_para5">
DFID&#039;s support for these country-owned VACs has stimulated discussions about longer-term responses to vulnerability, moving beyond food aid.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what contingency plans are in place to ensure that food aid, if required in Zimbabwe over the next few months, is distributed fairly on the basis of humanitarian needs.  [202818]</p>




<p><a name="41208w21.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Earlier this year the Government of Zimbabwe announced a bumper maize harvest of 2.4 million metric tonnes and declared that international food aid will not be required in the period up to the next harvest, around April 2005. Several independent 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 583W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
surveys have suggested that the actual harvest was considerably less than the Government has claimed. The recently released Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment (ZimVAC) indicates that 2.3 million people in the rural areas and 2.5 million people in urban areas will be unable to meet their food requirements in the &#039;hungry season&#039; preceding the next harvest. Meanwhile, the Government of Zimbabwe appears to be importing substantial amounts of grain. Without accurate information about production or imports, it is difficult to assess food security prospects for the coming months. Donors, UN agencies and others are monitoring the situation closely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w21.html_para6">
After the last harvest, the Government of Zimbabwe restricted the UN World Food Programme (WFP) to distributing only limited amounts of food aid, mainly through schools and clinics, reaching approximately 600,000 people per month. At this rate, there was a danger that the WFP grain stocks in Zimbabwe carried over from last year&#039;s humanitarian operations would spoil before distribution. Faced with the alternative that the WFP would export the grains to other countries in the region where they are needed, the Government of Zimbabwe recently authorised the WFP to undertake a large-scale &quot;one-off&quot; food distribution to 1.8 million of the poorest people in areas experiencing the most severe food shortages, to take place as soon as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w21.html_para7">
This food distribution, likely to be the only donor-funded food distribution at scale during the present season, will be implemented using the same procedures as applied in previous WFP humanitarian operations. Political pressure on agencies implementing relief programmes may increase over the coming months; however, to date such donor-funded programmes have remained relatively free of political interference. DFID Zimbabwe is working closely with the WFP, the UN system and our partner organisations to emphasise adherence to procedures that ensure assistance reaches those in most need. Any incidences of irregularity will be comprehensively reported, investigated and dealt with appropriately, as in previous years.

<i>[holding answer 6 December 2004]:</i> Responsibility for the provision of mobile telephones for official purposes and for payment of associated call charges was devolved to individual directorates, agencies and NDPBs at the end of March 1993. Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office of Government Commerce. This contract allows DTI users access to mobile telephone services and products at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is the total expenditure with DTI&#039;s main suppliers of mobile telephones and the number of handsets supplied through the central OGC contract since 2002.

 We expect the EU Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) to encourage generators to switch from using high carbon fuels (e.g. coal or oil) to lower or zero carbon fuels (e.g. gas or hydro). Such switching will have an effect on forward markets for the different fuels. The extent of this switching will be determined by the price of carbon, as well as the relative fuel prices and other costs associated with power generation from different types of plant. The price of carbon will be determined across the whole of the EU. The differences in behaviour of individual UK market participants are expected to have only a minimal impact on the price of carbon. The potential effect of differing assumptions about the ETS on the generation fuel mix was assessed in the study (Implications of the EU ETS for the Power Sector&#151;Annex C), for DTI, by ILEX in September 2003: http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml

The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom. Chief among these were the Energy Services Directive and the Security of Electricity Supply Directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para5">
A general approach on the Security of Electricity Supply Directive was agreed, though the Commission, which seeks a more interventionist regulator-led approach to promote actively new interconnector build and thereby competition, maintained a reserve on Article 7 on interconnector construction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para6">
Council conclusions were agreed on the Commission&#039;s Communication on the share of Renewable Energy in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para7">
An orientation debate was held on the proposed Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. Member States expressed a strong preference for indicative not mandatory energy saving targets though views were mixed on whether a uniform target at EU level would be helpful; many delegations preferred.individually set targets. There was general recognition that the public sector could play a leading role in promoting energy efficiency but the majority of Member States opposed specific targets for the sector. On the question of the placing of obligations on suppliers there was a clear preference for a broader more flexible approach rather than a focus on one energy efficiency approach&#151;energy services. There was broad agreement that a harmonised approach to measuring energy savings was needed, but there was a split on whether a top down or bottom up approach was best.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para8">
The UK noted our support for a uniform, but indicative, six-year target taking account of already captured efficiency gains; a more broadly defined obligation on energy suppliers to actively offer and promote energy efficiency; and agreement with the Presidency proposal for either a top down or a hybrid approach to measuring efficiency gains.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para9">
The Commission&#039;s preference for a mandatory target reflected what they saw as the poor record of achievement against indicative targets and they suggested that flexible mandatory targets might be the way forward. The Presidency concluded by proposing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2004 : Column 598W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
an annual debate on progress towards achieving indicative national targets, the first of which would fall to the UK Presidency, and looked forward to concluding the dossier in the Luxembourg Presidency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para10">
The Commission reported progress on the negotiations of the Energy Community for South East Europe Treaty, which it hoped would be a model for other sectors. Signature was foreseen for 2005. Some Member States had substantive comments on the language regime, others on the distinction between participating and observing Member States. The next negotiation meeting on 13 December will be an opportunity to discuss outstanding matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para11">
The Commission reported on its communication on progress on the EU/Russia energy dialogue 2000&#150;04, claiming it showed positive outcomes across a range of fields. More progress in Russia was needed on the reform process, energy efficiency and Kyoto implementation, promoting and protecting investment and positive developments in the gas and oil markets. The Commission undertook fully to involve Member States.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para12">
The Presidency concluded by noting, in the context of the recent &quot;Energy in Motion&quot; conference aimed at improving cleaner road traffic, that transport accounted for a third of energy consumption. The conference conclusions would be discussed at the next Transport and Environment Councils and the Commission were urged to take account of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w25.html_para13">
Luxembourg finished by saying they would take forward the Dutch Presidency approaches and singled out Energy TENS as a priority dossier.

 Where an allegation of intimidation due to sectarianism, paramilitarism or racism is confirmed and the applicant is considered eligible for housing and homelessness assistance, that person&#039;s name will be placed on the waiting list for re-housing with an additional 200 intimidation points. Upon being re-housed such applicants will be entitled to claim an intimidation grant of &#163;692 to enable them to resettle in their new home. In the first six months (April to September) of the current financial year 556 applications for re-housing were made due to intimidation and of these 207 were accepted. Figures for the last two financial years show a decrease in such claims. The Housing Executive has set a performance target to fully assess 95 per cent. of all homelessness applications, (including those from applicants claiming intimidation), within 33 days. In the year to date 97 per cent. of all homelessness applications have been fully assessed within the target.

In implementing one of the Strategy&#039;s key recommendations, the Home Office&#039;s Police Standards Unit and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) led an Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) over the summer from 8 July to 31 August.

<p>
<a name="41208w33.html_para0">
92 Basic Command Units representing 39 police forces in England and Wales and 46 Trading Standards departments participated in the campaign. Results from the campaign show that over 30,000 visits to licensed premises were conducted leading to over 1,200 offences being detected. Around 1,800 Test Purchase operations were conducted with over a third resulting in an offence being committed. Over 4,000 fixed penalty notices were issued and over 9,500 alcoholic containers were confiscated with more than one-third of these being confiscated from children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w33.html_para1">
Prior to the start of the AMEC, the Home Office published &quot;Violent Crime&#151;Tackling Violent Crime in the Night-Time Economy&#151;Guidelines and Tactical Options&quot;. The document set out a selection of successful initiatives that were readily transferable to police forces, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and local partners in helping to tackle alcohol-related violence and disorder.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w33.html_para2">
Following the campaign, a &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; document was published and launched at a joint Home Office and ACPO conference on 8 November. The document is intended to assist those who are responsible for the continued drive to tackle alcohol misuse and its associated harms in relation to crime and disorder. A second campaign will take place over the Christmas period from 17 December to 3 January 2005.
</p>


<p>

The Government and the police are building on existing good crime-cutting work and developing best practice in the local areas and CDRPs that still have a high volume of violent crime. This strategy will develop further the work begun by the Government and police over the summer to tackle alcohol-related disorder.

under 18 on licensed premises, consumption of alcohol by a person under 18, and allowing delivery of alcohol to a person under 18. These offences came into effect on 1 November. Local authorities have also introduced around 120 Designated Public Places Orders to help tackle anti-social drinking.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the <i>(a)</i> national and <i>(b)</i> regional funding streams which (i) local authorities, (ii) town and parish councils and (iii) other local organisations with an interest in promoting community safety in Kent Thameside are eligible to apply to for assistance in funding (A) youth shelters, (B) sports systems and (C) other facilities and diversionary activities for young people.

<p><a name="41208w34.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Home Office funding which promotes community safety is channelled through Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs), of which local authorities, town and parish councils and other organisations can be members. Community safety funding is drawn from the Building Safer Communities (BSC) and Basic Command Unit (BCU) funds. Both funds were introduced in 2003&#150;04 to run for three years.

<p>
<a name="41208w34.html_para0">
The Basic Command Unit fund is provided to the police and amounts to &#163;150 million over three years. The Kent Thameside area falls within the North Kent Basic Command Unit, which received &#163;180,598 this year from the BCU fund.

The Building Safer Communities fund is provided to CDRPs; totalling &#163;72.3 million in 2003&#150;04, and &#163;74 million in 2004&#150;05. The two CDRPs which comprise the Kent Thameside area, Dartford and Gravesham, received &#163;163,437 and &#163;164,635 respectively this year.

<p><a name="41208w35.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Police Standards Unit (PSU) plays an important role in driving the effective use of National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS). The Home Office has invested approximately &#163;150 million in the system and the PSU has a team working within the police service to ensure the best use is made of this investment. This includes making recommendations on the working practices of fingerprint officers using, to those on setting force policy for LiveScan, which scans and transmits fingerprints directly to the system. The PSU is working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to implement these recommendations nationally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w35.html_para2">
The unit also has an important NAFIS performance-monitoring role that is essential to drive usage and challenge those that are not making enough use of it. Since 2003, when the reporting commenced, there has been an increase in identifications from recently arrested persons of nearly 80 per cent. The PSU reports progress on usage of the system to Ministers quarterly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w35.html_para3">
In addition, the PSU acts as a consultant to promote the use of NAFIS in individual forces and ensure that the efficiency benefits of the system are maximised.
</p>


<p>

NAFIS became fully operational nationally in 2001. The system provides more than 4,000 fingerprint identifications a month and it makes a significant contribution to the number of detections.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance has been given to the police to ensure that the provisions in the Fireworks Act 2003 are enforced, with particular reference to people who set off fireworks after curfew hours.  [200519]</p>




<p><a name="41208w35.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 We have a comprehensive and robust package in place to tackle the misuse of fireworks. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 came into force in August and in October we extended the Penalty Notices for Disorder Scheme (PND) to include three new firework offences. Breach of the fireworks curfew is one of these new PND offences. The new PNDs allow police to punish offenders immediately by issuing on-the-spot fines and offer an additional disposal that has been widely welcomed by police forces across the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w35.html_para5">
I was keen to ensure all relevant agencies were aware of the new arrangements. In early October I wrote to all chief constables to provide guidance ahead of the fireworks season and to ensure the new arrangements were made an integral part of their fireworks strategies. We have published a TOGETHER fact sheet on the misuse of fireworks and this has been widely distributed to practitioners. DTI are also in regular contact with individual police forces and other enforcement agencies, such as Trading Standards, to provide advice on the Fireworks Regulations 2004. They expect to publish comprehensive guidance shortly.

<p><a name="41208w36.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The various bodies concerned with delivering improved policing outcomes work together to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the police. The Police Leadership and Powers Unit (PLPU) works closely with Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary. Consistency with the National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) is ensured by PLPU&#039;s role as the sponsor unit for CENTREX, the national police-training provider, of which the NCPE is a directorate.

The &#039;Improving Performance through Applied Knowledge&#039; (IPAK) programme of work, led by the Police Standards Unit, is aimed at improving the development and dissemination of good practice in the policing community.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research his Department has commissioned on whether the efficiency targets for police authorities of 3 per cent. from next year, including cashable savings of 1.5 per cent. are attainable. [199778]</p>




<p><a name="41208w36.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 November 2004]:</i> The efficiency target for the police service was set in the Spending Review 2004 taking account of the Efficiency Review carried out by Sir Peter Gershon. It takes into account the police service&#039;s very good record of achievement of average efficiency gains of 2.6 per cent. per year from 1999&#150;2000 to 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w36.html_para2">
The Home Office, the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers have worked together to develop an efficiency strategy for the service. They are committed to work in partnership to deliver cumulative year-on-year improvements in the value for money obtained from expenditure on the police service in pursuit of the very challenging targets set in SR 04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w36.html_para3">
An efficiency strategy implementation group is leading work to determine priorities for making efficiency gains, including in corporate service functions, such as human resource management and finance. A working group led by the Association of Police Authorities has already identified opportunities for substantial gains to be achieved through better procurement of goods and services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w36.html_para4">
A key element of the strategy is to increase the proportion of time which police officers spend on front-line policing. In 2003&#150;04 the average proportion of officer time spent on front-line duties for all forces was 63.6 per cent.; the range between forces was from 53.8 per cent. to 70.2 per cent. Increasing the average to around 72.5 per cent. would deliver nearly half of the efficiency target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41208w36.html_para5">
Bureaucracy reduction, exploiting new technology, more effective deployment of officers and more effective use of support staff will all help to increase the amount of front-line policing. A recent report, commissioned by the Home Office from Accenture, indicates the potential to improve the efficiency with which officers are rostered for duty.

 Foreign law enforcement agencies are permitted to seek the seizure of private property in the UK to secure evidence in connection with a criminal investigation, by sending a request to the UK Central Authority (UKCA) at the Home Office through mutual legal assistance procedures under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The UKCA considers such requests in conjunction with the appropriate UK law enforcement agency. If the request is approved UKCA will then issue a direction to the courts on behalf of the Secretary of State authorising an application for a search warrant.

In this particular case, I understand that, in accordance with a US Commissioner&#039;s subpoena, a US based company accessed its servers in London from the US, in order to comply with the terms of that subpoena. No UK law enforcement agencies were involved in this action.

 Special constables are trained within their force. Forces are responsible for ensuring that their specials receive the necessary training to enable them to undertake their duties. Duration varies depending on the resources and organisation of individual training departments, but also reflecting the voluntary nature of the special constabulary, whose members often have full or part-time work commitments.

 Following the publication of the Stewart Report &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot; in May 2000, we took expert advice from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB)&#039;s independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) on the health and safety aspects of TETRA technology. The AGNIR experts suggested a number of areas where further research would be useful. These suggested have been taken forward as follows:
</p>
<ul>
