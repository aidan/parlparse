<p><a name="st_85"><a name="06051664000018"><a name="60516w0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="06051664000143"><b>Gillian Merron:</b> The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, &#145;the Disability Equality Duty&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="60516w0001.htm_para0"><a name="06051664000019">The Department for Transport is currently assessing its policies in accordance with the duty and the results of this exercise will be included in its Disability Equality Scheme (DES). The DES will set out how the Department intends to meet its duty to promote disability equality including the arrangements in place to assess the impact of its activities together with an action plan outlining how it intends to improve outcomes for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="60516w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06051664000020">The Department for Transport is committed to an accessible public transport system in which disabled people have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="60516w0001.htm_para2"><a name="06051664000021">A great deal has already been achieved in this area. For example, we have introduced regulations under part 5 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) making all new rail vehicles, buses and coaches accessible. Over 4,400 compliant rail vehicles are already in service and almost half the bus fleet is accessible. These improvements have already had a significant impact on the day-to-day mobility of disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="60516w0001.htm_para3"><a name="06051664000022">We are also implementing the transport provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The new Act contains measures amending the rail vehicle accessibility regime and will extend part 3 of the DDA 1995 (which deals with access to goods and services) to the operators of all land-based public transport, vehicle hire and breakdown services from 4 December 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="60516w0001.htm_para4"><a name="06051664000023">Transport infrastructure, such as stations and airports, is already covered by these provisions which require service providers to remove obstacles that mean disabled people find it impossible or unreasonably difficult to access services. Policy initiatives, such as the recently announced &#147;Access for All&#148; fund (a &#163;370 million ring-fenced resource available to improve access to railway stations) will provide further improvements.</p>

In the period 2005-06 the police increased the number of seizures by between 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. and the number of persons charged with drug offences by 18 per cent.

Both charges will consist of a standing charge (estimated at around &#163;55) and a variable element based on the capital value of each property as determined by the Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA) for the purposes of domestic rating. The Government intend to set the new household charges during the three-year period to 2009-10 to achieve the average level of charges that will apply in England and Wales in 2009-10. There will also be a low-income protection scheme. The Government&#146;s broad objective is to ensure that low-income households should not need to spend more than 3 per cent. of their income on water and sewerage charges. To achieve this a new affordability tariff will be available for those households which are eligible. This tariff will be based on income and will be set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person&#146;s pension credit guarantee as updated by Parliament each year. Additional protection in the form of lower caps will be set for those with properties valued at less than &#163;100,000.</p>

Meters will also be installed in all new properties and first time connections. Where meters are installed, both water and sewerage charges (where appropriate) will consist of a standing charge and a variable element based on consumption as registered on the water meter.

However, staff in Band A (clerical or secretarial officers) can choose to retire between the ages of 60 and 65 and staff in Bands B to D (junior and middle managers) between 60 and 63.</p>

We regularly raise these concerns with the Chinese Government, through the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue, ministerial contact and EU mechanisms. With uncertainty over the format of the first meeting of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in June, we do not yet know what issues will be raised. Given the election of China to the HRC on 9 May, China is likely to resist any moves to raise Tibet at the HRC. We will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to raise our concerns with the Chinese authorities.</p>

They were replaced by a net capacity formula which assesses the capacity of the school and derives an indicated admission number. When setting the admission number for the school, the admission authority must have regard to the indicated admission number however they can set a number that is higher or lower if they wish. If they set a number that is lower, they must publish a notice to inform local parents. The Department does not maintain a central record of proposals to lower admission numbers.</p>

It stresses the value of using risk assessments to determine what sort of fire detection and alarm systems should be used in each school, and whether or not sprinklers should be installed. While saying that a building designed in accordance with the guidance in Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the Building Regulations, will achieve a satisfactory standard of life safety, it also suggests ways of improving property protection.</p>

The grant is not paid to individuals but paid each year to councils as a specific formula grant. There are no conditions attached. Individual carers have a right to an assessment of their ability to provide and continue to provide care under section 1 of the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000. Services are not subject to a means test, though local authorities are able to charge for the carers&#146; services they provide. However, carers cannot be charged for community care services provided to people they care for, including the services provided to enable carers to take a break from caring.</p>

As a result, the Department issues guidance to councils to remind them that the policy intention behind the grant is to support carers.</p>
