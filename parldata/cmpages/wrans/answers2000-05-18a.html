To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what the timetable is for the mapping of current provision of services to be undertaken by the Connexions Service as referred to in paragraph 7.20 of "Connexions: the best start in life for every young person".  [122453]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 As part of their proposals, each pilot area has been asked to submit a timetable for completing their mapping exercise. We expect all pilots to complete an initial exercise by September 2000. In submitting proposals for the wider introduction of the Connexions Service from April 2001 we expect further mapping will have started before the end of the year.

 The Connexions Service will provide access to high quality guidance and support to all 13-19 year olds, giving particular priority to those young people who are most at risk of encountering obstacles to a successful transition to adulthood.

<P>
<a name="00518w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies. Each university is responsible for the maintenance and repair of its own estate. No survey has been carried out to look specifically at 1960s buildings, but in 1997 the Higher Education Funding Council for England commissioned a survey to review the condition of the whole higher education estate. As a result of the survey, the Higher Education Funding Council for England introduced a "poor estates" initiative, setting aside &#163;200 million for higher education estates funding up to 2000.

Dearing also drew on Segal Quince and Wicksteed's 1997 "Review of Dual Support: The Funding Gap" study of overall research funding in universities.

As part of this commitment I am today publishing a paper entitled, "A Review of the Activities of the 1 Field Laboratory Unit and Suggested Biological Warfare Agency Detections During Operation Granby".
<P>

<a name="00518w03.html_para10">As a result of our review of the available information we assess that UK troops were not subject to attack by or exposed to biological warfare agents during the Gulf conflict. There were alarms on some detectors, many of which were recognised to be false by the system operators at the time. On one occasion, a biological substance was detected and samples returned to the UK for testing. The tests concluded that this was not caused by a biological warfare agent. Our review re-examined this incident and concludes that the evidence suggests that the detection was caused by natural biological material.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Attributable benefits for Reserve Service were introduced in 1980, and the regulations are contained in the Naval and Marine Pay and Pensions (Non-Effective Benefits and Family Pension) Order 1999, the Army Pay Warrant 1977, and the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Air Force. It has been the practice since 1980 to award attributable benefits only where members of the Reserve Forces are medically discharged from the Reserves at an end of a period of active duty. During periods of recalled service for operations, individuals in the regular reserve forces could claim benefits only if they were medically discharged at the point of demobilisation. We have now taken legal advice, which suggests that Army reservists are, under current regulations, eligible to claim attributable benefits if they are medically discharged from the reserve at any time. Our legal advisers have also identified some anomalies in the regulations for the other Services.
<P>

<a name="00518w04.html_para1">We therefore propose for the future that all members of the volunteer reserves and regular reserves should be eligible for attributable benefits if they are medically discharged from the reserve forces at any time for reasons attributable to reserve service. The existing anomalies in the regulations, under which reservists are treated differently depending on which Service they come from, will be removed. We shall re-examine claims from Gulf Reservists under the interpretation of the regulations we now believe to be correct. We shall also consider any new claims.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the RAND Corporation report entitled, "A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses, volume II: Pyridostigmine Bromide".  [123223]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The RAND report, which is a comprehensive compilation of published literature on pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and its relationship to Gulf Veterans' Illnesses (GVI), has now been carefully reviewed and a written assessment of the report has been produced. I am placing a copy of this assessment in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00518w04.html_para2">The RAND report does not present any new work on pyridostigmine bromide. It concentrates on several hypotheses of how PB might be the cause of GVI and to a lesser extent discusses the effectiveness of PB. Although a number of theories have been identified they have not, in our view, been critically evaluated and there is no differentiation between the credibility and the value of the various pieces of research. The report gives no guidance as to which of the various hypotheses is worthy of further investigation or for the prioritisation of further research. The approach and methodology adopted for this review do not advance the debate on whether PB is possibly linked to illness in Gulf veterans.

 The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is strongly committed, through the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA), to encouraging the widest possible exploitation of defence technology in the civil sector, in line with Government policy. The DDA is implementing this policy by establishing a national network of technology diversification managers, all rooted in DERA but located in regionally based business communities, one of which is the Rosyth Europarc, to provide a technology brokering service. It is also DERA's policy to support the Europarc Business Innovation Centre's application for European funding.

 Cluster bombs held by the Royal Air Force are manufactured in the UK by Hunting Engineering Ltd. Cluster bombs are an effective weapon both against armoured targets and area targets, such as a group of soft-skinned military vehicles. UK armed forces will always use the most appropriate weapons against a given target, acting within their Rules of Engagement, taking into account weapon effectiveness and the need to minimise collateral damage. Applications for the export of cluster bombs are considered on a case-by-case basis against criteria announced by the Foreign Secretary on 28 July 1997 and the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Sales.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what is his response to the 



<P>
<P><I>18 May 2000 : Column: 209W</I><P>
recommendation in the Bowman report on the Crown Office List that there should be a comprehensive review of the present structure, jurisdiction, procedures, remedies and routes of appeal of tribunals.  [123129]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w06.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has welcomed Sir Jeffery Bowman's recommendation. It has been 43 years since the last thorough review of tribunals. The number of tribunals has grown greatly since then. There has also been a fundamental change in the nature of, and pressures on, their work. The Lord Chancellor has therefore decided that there should be a wide ranging, independent review of tribunals.

<P>
<a name="00518w06.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Kelly: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how much the Lord Chancellor's Department has spent since 1997 on <i>(a)</i> marriage support funding and <i>(b)</i> marriage counselling services; and how many people have been helped in each year.  [122600]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w06.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Spending by the Lord Chancellor's Department on marriage and relationship support and research for the financial years since 1997 is as follows: 1997-98: &#163;3.4 million; 1998-99: &#163;3.0 million; 1999-2000: &#163;3.2 million. In line with Sir Graham Hart's recommendations in his report to the Lord Chancellor on Marriage Support Funding (published in November 1999), the allocation is being increased as follows: 2000-01: &#163;4 million; 2001-02: &#163;4.5 million; 2002-03: &#163;5 million.
<P>

<a name="00518w06.html_para16">This spending is currently provided to the central bodies of the main marriage and relationship support and research organisations towards expenses incurred in the development of training and support to local services, including the selection, training and supervision of counsellors, administrative costs and research. The Government do not directly fund the provision of counselling services. It is therefore not possible to calculate precisely how many people are helped in each year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today informed Mr. Tyson that he will be granted entry clearance for a single visit of three weeks' duration strictly for the purpose of a boxing match in Scotland on 24 June 2000.
<P>

<a name="00518w06.html_para18">The decision to grant entry clearance has been taken in accordance with Rule 320(18) of the United Kingdom Immigration Rules which requires that admission will not normally be given to those with criminal convictions for relatively serious offences unless it can be justified for strong compassionate reasons, but also bearing in mind the residual discretion which I have under the Rule.
<P>

<a name="00518w06.html_para19">In reaching my decision, I took note of the fact that Mr. Tyson has relevant convictions for the purposes of the application of this Rule. I also noted that there are recent allegations of an assault on an employee of a nightclub in Las Vegas, but we understand this is still under investigation. And I took into account the views expressed by the public about Mr. Tyson visiting the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00518w06.html_para20">I did not consider that there were strong compassionate reasons which would justify admission in Mr. Tyson's case for the purpose of the Rule. However, I concluded that there were other exceptional circumstances which justified his entry to the country for the purpose of participating in the boxing match. My decision took account of the following factors:
<P>

<a name="00518w06.html_para21"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that Mr. Tyson's behaviour on his previous visit to the United Kingdom was satisfactory;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00518w06.html_para22"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that any risk to the public to which his criminal convictions and other allegations referred to above might be relevant, would be minimised by the circumstances of his proposed visit--ie his high media profile, the presence of his trainers and other supporting entourage, and the limited duration of his visit; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00518w06.html_para23"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that a refusal to permit entry would result in a loss of economic benefit to the United Kingdom, and in particular to the areas in which engagements took place, and would not enhance the United Kingdom's standing as a venue for major sporting events.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00518w06.html_para24">I also took account of the fact that Rule 320(18) currently operates in an inconsistent manner in that those in the public eye whose convictions are known are more likely to be caught by its provisions.

 Asylum seekers who are supported by the National Asylum Support Service will be dispersed to cluster areas around the country. Our intention is to ensure that the cluster areas are suitable for asylum seekers taking into account, inter alia, the views of local authorities. In some cases, local authorities may advise that particular areas may not be suitable for asylum seekers and they may identify such areas by post-code. That information would be taken into consideration in determining whether to accept any accommodation for asylum seekers if offered in that area.

 During 1999, there have been significant increases of four per cent. in the number of probation officers in post and of seven per cent. in the number of other probation service staff in post (whole-time equivalent in both cases). The increase in probation officers is due largely to more than doubling the number of trainee probation officers in the year.

 The current voluntary return programme from the United Kingdom began on 26 July 1999 and will end on 25 June 2000. For humanitarian and economic reasons it was decided to give a relocation grant of 720 Deutschmarks per person (approximately &#163;250), payable on arrival in Kosovo, to all those who chose to go back under the return programme. That grant was increased to 1,300 Deutschmarks per person (approximately &#163;400) with effect from the flight on 5 May. Arrangements have also been made to transport larger possessions overland to Kosovo. This will enable Kosovans to take back, for example, household goods and building materials, which they have bought or been given, and which they cannot take on an aeroplane.
<P>

<a name="00518w08.html_para1">In order to benefit from the grant and the overland transport of goods, Kosovans must register for return by 10 June and leave the United Kingdom on one of the organised voluntary return flights by 25 June.

 Kosovan Albanians who were evacuated to the United Kingdom under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme (HEP) between 25 April and 25 June 1999 were granted 12 months' leave to enter. As agreed with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the outset of the evacuation process, protection was afforded on a temporary basis only. It was made clear at the time and subsequently that the leave of the evacuated Kosovans would not be extended and that they would be expected to return to Kosovo as soon as it was safe to do so.
<P>

<a name="00518w08.html_para3">The UNHCR judge that it is now safe for the majority of Kosovan Albanians to return to Kosovo and this has been exemplified by the one million Kosovans who have voluntarily chosen to return since July 1999.
<P>

<a name="00518w08.html_para4">The Government have given every assistance to Kosovan Albanians who wish to return to Kosovo permanently by funding two voluntary assisted return programmes and giving each returning person a relocation grant. The current programme and grant will run until 25 June. If, at the end of the 12-month period, people do not choose to return voluntarily and there are no protection or other humanitarian reasons to prevent them from doing so, I regret that consideration will be given to enforcing their return. It is the Government's hope that the generosity of this country in affording protection to the Kosovan Albanians in their hour of need will not be overlooked in this way and that such action does not have to be taken.

The programme is open both to those Kosovans who arrived in the United Kingdom under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme (HEP) and to independent arrivals. As of 10 May, 1,280 Kosovans who arrived in the United Kingdom under the HEP and 370 independent arrivals had returned permanently to Kosovo under the voluntary programme. The table shows the number of Kosovans returning permanently by month since the programme started.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Establishments have been categorised according to their primary role. However, it should be noted that there are a number of other prisons that hold young offenders (eg male remand centres) which are not included.<P>

2. Incidents do not equate to numbers of prisoners as an individual prisoner may self harm more than once.<P>

3. Self harm data are derived from information provided by establishments to the Prison Health Policy Unit. These data include information on all attempted suicides.<P>

4. Prior to 1990, data on self-harm have not been held centrally in a format which permits distinction according to type of establishment.<P>

5. Prior to 1988, data on suicides have not been held centrally in a format which permits distinction according to type of establishment.<P>

6. It should be noted that not all self-inflicted deaths conclude with a verdict of suicide.<P>

More generally, the average turn round time for all work in domestic burglary cases over the last six months was 34 days. This year, the Forensic Science Service aims to improve turn round times by the introduction of a classification system whereby cases identified by the customer as urgent or critical are dealt with ahead of standard case types. Further, over the next six months the number of staff is being increased by 15 per cent. to address the balance between demand and capacity in all case types.

 The number of countries in which the British Council is represented increased by 38 per cent. between 1979 and 1997.

The grant-in-aid from the FCO increased by 24 per cent. in real terms (from &#163;83.9 million to &#163;104.1 million) over this period; however, the overall increase was much smaller as the grant-in-aid funding from DFID declined by 56 per cent. in real terms over the same period.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 67 per cent. of Iraq's oil revenue is allocated to the UN "oil for food" humanitarian programme. With Iraq once again among the world's five largest oil producers, and since the passage of resolution 1284, able to export unlimited amounts of oil under this programme, a potential $10 billion will be available this year for the humanitarian programme.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The passage of UN SCR 1284 in December 1999 removed the ceiling on Iraq's exports under the "oil for food" programme. Together with the recent recovery in world oil prices, this has boosted Iraq's oil exports back to--if not above--their peak historical level of around $15 billion per annum, seen only briefly in 1980. Iraq's Oil Minister has also recently announced that Iraq is planning to increase further its oil exports by about 700,000 barrels per day which would put Iraq among the world's top five oil exporters. This means that an estimated $10 billion should be available for the humanitarian programme in Iraq this year.

<P>

<a name="00518w10.html_para0">The Iraqi oil industry needs spare parts in order to be able to sustain this level of production.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We expedite the supply of humanitarian goods to Iraq. We take very seriously our responsibility as a member of the Sanctions Committee, and scrutinise closely all applications. The Committee plays a vital role in ensuring that Iraq does not acquire prohibited goods (such as arms and weapons of mass destruction) and that Iraq spends "oil for food" money for the benefit of the Iraqi people and not the Iraqi regime. Some contracts cannot be processed because of insufficient information: lack of end-user details, or even no description of the goods to be supplied. Others are put on hold because there are dual-use concerns or because the goods in question are not humanitarian in nature. In total, we put only a tiny percentage of "oil for foods" contracts on hold (about 1 per cent. overall).
<P>

<a name="00518w10.html_para1">Under Security Council resolution 1284, which Britain piloted through the Council last year, Sanctions Committee procedures for approving humanitarian contracts have been streamlined to ensure that contracts are processed even more quickly than before. The Committee now reviews all "oil for food" contracts within two (instead of five) working days, and it has agreed lists of foodstuffs, medical, agricultural and educational goods which no longer need to be referred to the Committee but simply notified to the UN Secretariat. Working procedures for an expert group to approve oil spare parts contracts more speedily have also now been agreed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Up until its withdrawal from Iraq in December 1998, UNSCOM consistently reported to the United Nations Security Council that serious gaps remained in Iraq's declarations on chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles. In March 1999, the United Nations Disarmament Panel confirmed UNSCOM's analysis. We therefore believe it is essential that Iraq allows United Nations weapons inspectors to resume their work.

<P>
<a name="00518w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In its resolution 1298(2000) adopted on 17 May, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Ethiopia and Eritrea cease all military action, withdraw military forces, and reconvene proximity talks under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity. The Security Council imposed, in relation to those two States, a mandatory arms embargo and a ban on the provision of related technical assistance or training.
<P>

<a name="00518w10.html_para3">The embargo is established for twelve months. At the end of this period the Security Council will decide whether the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea have complied with its demands and, accordingly, whether to extend the embargo for a further period. The embargo will be terminated immediately if the Secretary-General reports that a peaceful definitive settlement has been concluded.
<P>

<a name="00518w10.html_para4">The United Kingdom co-sponsored this resolution, which was adopted in response to the further outbreak of hostilities between Eritrea and Ethiopia.

<P>

<a name="00518w10.html_para5">The European Union imposed an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea on 15 March 1999 in response to a United Kingdom proposal, following the adoption on 10 February 1999 of UN Security Council resolution 1227, which urged all States to end all sales of arms and munitions to both countries.

 A table showing National Lottery ticket sales by constituency for the first five years of the Lottery's operation has been placed in the Libraries of the House. (This table is reproduced in House of Commons Library Research Paper 00/24.)
<P>

<a name="00518w11.html_para5">The National Lottery Commission supports a social research programme on participation in the National Lottery. Report No. 1 of this programme, published in May 1999, contains data on participation by social class. Copies of this report have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="00518w11.html_wqn10"><B> Ms Kelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the <i>(a)</i> forecast cost of introducing the Income Support supplement to Child Benefit and <i>(b)</i> projected number of claimant families on a year by year basis.  [122611]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w11.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There is no Income Support supplement to Child Benefit. However, the above inflation increases to Child Benefit from April 1999 and April 2000 were reflected in Income Support to ensure that the families on the lowest incomes benefit from the increases. The information contained in the table shows the estimated cost and number of claimant families.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w12.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what was the average percentage increase in salaries of non-industrial civil servants, excluding members of the senior Civil Service, in his Department for 1999-2000; and to what extent the pay awards were staged.  [121658]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The headline pay settlement for the Department, its agencies and its non-departmental public bodies was 2.80 per cent. on the paybill. Together with the additional funds from staff turnover, staff in post received performance related increases averaging 4.46 per cent. The increases were not staged.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what the target market is for stakeholder pensions; and what the definition of success in that market will be before the Stage 2 of the State Second Pension is introduced.  [122592]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Stakeholder pensions are primarily intended for moderate earners--those earning between about &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000 a year--but many higher earners will also be able to take advantage of the lower charges, greater flexibility, and simpler tax regime which stakeholder pension schemes will introduce.
<P>

<a name="00518w12.html_para2">The Pensions Green Paper explains that we expect the new State Second Pension to become a flat-rate scheme for those on lower earnings when stakeholder pension schemes have established themselves as low-cost, value- for-money, funded second pensions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people have been convicted of benefit fraud in the UK during the last 12 months.  [122075]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The number of people convicted of benefit fraud in the 12 months from April 1999 to March 2000 was 9,752. In the same period the Benefits Agency issued 5,594 cautions and 4,702 administrative penalties (Total 20,048).
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the scale of benefit fraud attributable to disability benefits and on action being taken to combat it.  [121686]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> Latest figures show that 6.5 per cent. of claims to Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) and 1.5 per cent. of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) cases showed fraud.
<P>

<a name="00518w13.html_para0">Within the two main disability benefits--Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance--securing the gateway to the benefits and dealing with some claimants' failure to report changed circumstances are crucial to cutting the level of overpayment due to fraud and error. We are seeking better sources of evidence to substantiate claims. We are also ensuring that claimants know more about the purpose of these benefits and understand their responsibilities for reporting change. We shall achieve this by making direct contact with the claimant at the start of the claim and by checking at regular intervals to ensure that entitlement remains correct.

<a name="00518w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the number of pensioners who will receive basic State Pension increases <i>(a)</i> above and <i>(b)</i> below 70p a week when the next uprating of pensions takes effect.  [121504]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 For a pensioner to receive an increase of greater than/less than 70p in 2001-02, based on the projected rate of inflation of September 2000, they would have to be receiving a basic State Pension of greater than/less than approximately &#163;21 per week in 2000-01.

 Government funding for research is provided through a number of routes. The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main agency through which we support research on the causes and treatment of disease. The MRC receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Department funds research to support policy development in health and social care, and to support effective practice in the National Health Service. The Department also provides NHS support funding for research commissioned by the MRC and charities that takes place in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="00518w13.html_para14">Since 1997 we have committed over &#163;800,000 to new research projects on prostate cancer, through the Medical Research Council and through the Department of Health.

 It is recognised that foods such as soya can combine with other factors such as throat and chest infections, allergies to dust mites, pollens, pets, irritants such as cigarette smoke etc. to provoke or exacerbate asthmatic attacks. However, food is seldom the only factor. For those individuals who are not allergic to soya, we are not aware of any particular risks to asthma suffers of drinking soya milk.

Food aid so far promised this year totals over 32,000 metric tonnes (MT), of which over half has been distributed or is in the process of being distributed. In addition, we contribute about 17 per cent. of the cost of EC food aid, estimated to be some 432,000 MT in 2000. 46,665 MT of EU food has already arrived in Djibouti. Non-food inputs often form part of the food aid package and have included the provision of seeds, water tankering and capacity building.

 A number of factors determine the allocation of budgets for regeneration programmes including the total amount of resources available, national priorities and the relative needs of each region. One measure used to determine the needs of each region is the Index of Local Deprivation, which is used to inform the allocation of the Single Regeneration Budget and the New Deal for Communities.
<P>

<a name="00518w15.html_para2">The indicative allocations of resources to regions for all rounds of SRB have been based on the following formula: 50 per cent. according to the regions' share of 1993 population in areas with above average deprivation (based on the 1991 Index of Local Conditions score for each Local Authority district); and 50 per cent. based on the district level deprivation score, for areas with above average deprivation. The SRB is a competitive programme and the 



<P>
<P><I>18 May 2000 : Column: 248W</I><P>
final distribution of resources in each year is dependent upon the quality of bids received for new schemes, together with the pattern of commitments from earlier SRB rounds. A national target, introduced under Round 5 of the SRB in 1998, is for 80 per cent. of new money to be allocated in the most deprived areas which, for this purpose, are taken to be the local authority district areas included in the top 50 on one or more of the four measures of deprivation in the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation. The indicative SRB regional allocation for London represented 27 per cent. of total SRB resources for 1999-2000 in England.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what statutory provisions govern the rights of family members to purchase the freehold of a leasehold residential property they have inherited.  [122352]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Section 7 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 allows certain family members who were resident in a leasehold house at the time of the deceased's death to satisfy the residence test even where they would not normally do so. They must still have resided in the premises for at least three years in the last ten and meet the other conditions that normally apply. We are considering whether to extend these provisions as part of our leasehold reform package.
<P>

<a name="00518w16.html_para4">For flats, only half the group buying the freehold (enfranchising) need to satisfy the residence test (we propose to abolish the residence test as it applies to collective enfranchisement). Subsection 6(3)(b) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 allows the residence test to be satisfied even where the tenant's previous occupation of the flat was not by right of the lease. Therefore, an individual who inherits a long lease on a flat should be able to participate in enfranchisement in the usual way. Subsection 14(5) deals with the possibility that a participating tenant might die during the enfranchisement process. Section 16 makes provision in the event of the death of the nominee purchaser.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidelines his Department has issued on setting a price for the purchase of the freehold of leasehold residential properties.  [122350]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00518w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There is no set formula for deciding on the price of a freehold. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 (as amended) sets out the basic principles to be used when deciding how much should be paid for the freehold of a house. The Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 makes similar provision for flats.
<P>

<a name="00518w16.html_para5">Guidance on this point is included in our booklets "Leasehold flats: your right to buy the freehold of your building or renew your lease" and "Leasehold houses: your right to buy the freehold of your house or renew your lease". Both are available free of charge from DETR Free Literature, PO Box 236, Wetherby, LS23 7NB. This guidance is for information only--it has no legal authority.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2000]:</i> The European Directive 96/29/Euratom lays down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation. The Directive makes the disposal, recycling or reuse of radioactive substances subject to prior authorisation. It also permits member states to set levels of radioactivity at which materials for disposal, recycling and reuse may be released from this requirement for prior authorisation providing that strict radiological criteria are met. This concept is known as clearance, with clearance levels setting a threshold at or below which the levels of radioactivity are small and pose a negligible radiological risk irrespective of the fate of that material. The Radioactive Substances Act (RSA 93), which implements the relevant provisions of the Directive, is administered in England and Wales by the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="00518w16.html_para7">In support of these regulatory functions, the Environment Agency commissions independent monitoring of radioactive waste disposals and their impact on the environment. Details of the monitoring programme are published annually in a report entitled "Radioactivity in the Environment: A summary and radiological assessment of the Environment Agency's monitoring programmes". Copies of the latest report, for 1997, can be found in the Library.

 While the Government have received no specific representations on the situation in Uganda, illegal trade in bushmeat is a growing problem in many African countries, particularly in west and central Africa. I am very pleased that a United Kingdom paper on this issue, tabled by my Department for discussion at last month's Conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), was given unanimous support. The result is the formation of a new international working group under the auspices of CITES, involving the key African countries concerned, donors such as the United Kingdom and United States, and relevant non- governmental organisations. As the issue goes beyond the strict international trade remit of CITES, the UK and Convention Secretariat are actively seeking the full participation of other international bodies such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Tropical Timber Organisation. My Department has already made &#163;50,000 available in the current financial year to support this initiative. I hope others will soon follow.

 Details of the Budget measures can be found in the relevant tables of the July 1997, March 1998, 1999 and 2000 Red Book. Our corporation tax rate is the lowest ever and lowest among major industrialised countries. The combination of this rate and other Budget measures have enhanced the UK tax system, providing an improved environment for UK business to compete.

 The Government have set aside &#163;195 million from the receipts of the Windfall Tax specifically to assist people with disabilities. The New Deal for disabled people has been testing a range of approaches--personal advisers, innovative schemes and benefit changes--to find out what helps people return to work. To date, over 2,500 people have been helped into work by the New Deal pilots. The Government are currently developing plans for extending the New Deal for disabled people nationwide and introducing rehabilitation and retention pilots to test different ways to help disabled people move into, and remain in, work.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 5 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 500W, on tax rates, if he will provide illustrative examples of cases where taxes and benefits can interact to produce a marginal deduction rate of <i>(a)</i> 40 per cent. and above, <i>(b)</i> 50 per cent. and above, <i>(c)</i> 60 per cent. and above, <i>(d)</i> 70 per cent. and above, <i>(e)</i> 80 per cent. and above and <i>(f)</i> 90 per cent. and above.

 A marginal deduction rate (MDR) measures how much of an additional pound of earnings is paid in taxes or in reduced benefit or tax credit entitlement. The table gives some examples of the combinations of income tax and National Insurance for those on income-related benefits or WFTC that give rise to marginal deduction rates of 40 per cent. or more. All the examples assume that National Insurance is payable, at the contracted-in rate.

 <i>[holding answer 14 April and 5 May 2000]:</i> The available information, which shows income tax (including child benefit and working families tax credit from its first full year of implementation) and national insurance contributions, at multiples of median full-time earnings of all employees is given in the table. The figures are shown in <i>(a)</i> current prices and <i>(b)</i> as percentages of income, for (i) the years 1996-97 to 2001-02 where the figures take account of all changes announced in Budgets to date. Estimating the impact of indirect taxes is imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income. The level of council tax payments will also vary depending on where families live.
<P>

<a name="00518w20.html_para4">The figures use median all-employee earnings. However, the data are available only since 1983. Looking over a longer time period, using male mean earnings, the series shows that as a result of personal tax and benefit measures in the last three Budgets the tax burden on a family with two children on 100 per cent. of average earnings will fall by 2001 to the lowest level since 1972.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Income tax payments are calculated on the basis that the households receive no tax reliefs other than the standard allowances and only have income from employment. All earners, including wives, are assumed to pay Class 1 national insurance contributions at the contracted-in rate.<P>

2. Earnings are taken to be the median gross weekly earnings of all full-time employees on adult rates with pay unaffected by absence. (Median earnings are more representative of the population as a whole than mean male full-time earnings.)<P>

3. A family with two children is assumed to have both children aged under 11.<P>

4. In line with the convention in the Tax Benefit Reference Manual, Child Benefit is treated as negative income tax.<P>

5. Working Families Tax Credit is included from its first full year of implementation in 2000-01.<P>

6. For the two earner family it is assumed earnings are split 60 per cent.:40 per cent. <P>

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on people in employment aged over 50. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
The table attached shows non-seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is the main source of labour market data on individuals. It gives the number of men and women in work by age group and the percentage that are in full-time employment in each category in the winter (December to February) quarter of 1999/2000.




<P>
<P><I>18 May 2000 : Column: 269W</I><P>

<BR>
People aged 16 or over are classed in employment by the LFS if they have done at least one hour of paid work (as an employee or self-employed) in the week prior to their LFS interview or if they have a job that they are temporarily away from. People who do unpaid work in a family business and people on Government- supported training and employment programmes are also included according to the International Labour Organisation convention.

The VAT revenue per annum from 2001 on <i>(a)</i> tampons, <i>(b)</i> menstrual towels and <i>(c)</i> panty liners is estimated to be &#163;5 million, &#163;5 million, and negligible, respectively.

 The Wales Office is fully committed to measures such as the "greening" of official ministerial cars. Because the Department is principally located in central London, no members of staff routinely drive to work, instead relying on public transport. However, my Department is extremely small and controls only a single building which houses fewer than 50 staff. We have not therefore submitted a green transport plan.

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2000]:</i> The award of 20 contracts for over-thirty-months scheme (OTMS) abattoir services in the UK followed a competitive tender and looked to ensure that sufficient slaughtering capacity was available having regard to the main production areas. Where abattoirs have changed, some individual farmer's costs have increased a little because their abattoir is now further away; but others have decreased.

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> Rates of payment to farmers participating in the Environmentally Sensitive Areas and Countryside Stewardship Schemes are governed by EU Council Regulation 1257/1999 and Commission Regulation 1750/1999. These provisions require payment rates to be calculated on the basis of income forgone, additional costs incurred, and an incentive not exceeding 20 per cent. of the income forgone. Following the review of payment rates in 11 ESAs in 1999, it is estimated the overall effect on grants to participating farmers in those ESAs would be a reduction of 1 to 2 per cent. Of the eight rates available in the South Downs ESA two were increased, two were reduced and the remainder were unchanged. It is estimated the overall effect will be a reduction of 5 per cent. compared with payments to farmers in that ESA in 1999.
