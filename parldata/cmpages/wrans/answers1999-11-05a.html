<a name="91105w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if there are any proposals to amend the Welsh Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000.  [97785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91105w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class XIV, Vote 1 (the Welsh Office, the Wales Office and the National Assembly for Wales) the Welsh Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000 will be increased by &#163;124,972,000 from &#163;7,092,517,000 to &#163;7,217,489,000. The increase is the result of:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i) Net transfers of &#163;7,866,000 from other Government Departments as detailed from vi) to x);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii) A &#163;14,700,000 increase in the provision for Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iii) Provision of &#163;235,000 for the Auditor General for Wales;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iv) An increase in provision of &#163;4,300,000 as a result of the Dearing Review of Higher Education, and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>v) The take up of end-year flexibility entitlement of &#163;97,871,000.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="91105w01.htm_para0">There is also an increase in the provision for Welfare to Work of &#163;923,000 as a result of the take up of end-year flexibility entitlement of &#163;789,000. For further information relating to end-year flexibility see the answer given on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>393</i>. There is a further transfer of &#163;134,000 from Class 1, Vote 3.
<P>

<a name="91105w01.htm_para1">The increase will be offset by transfers from:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>vi) Class II, Vote 1 (&#163;7,487,000);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>vii) Class III, Votes 2 and 3 (&#163;298,000);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>viii) Class VII, Vote 1 (&#163;50,000);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ix) Class XIII, Vote 1 (&#163;-73,000); and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>x) Class X, Vote 1 (&#163;104,000).</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="91105w01.htm_para2">The balance will be met by a charge on the Departmental Expenditure Limit Reserve for the take-up of the end-year flexibility entitlement, the increase in Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances and the Dearing moneys and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<a name="91105w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. McWalter: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what proposals there are to change the 1999-2000 Departmental Expenditure Limit and running costs limits for the work of the HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor.  [97787]<P>

<P>
<a name="91105w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class V, Vote 6, the Departmental Expenditure Limit will

<P><I>5 Nov 1999 : Column: 332</I><P>
increase by a net &#163;264,000 from &#163;7,175,000 to &#163;7,439,000 whilst the Department's running cost limit will increase by &#163;28,000 from &#163;4,707,000 to &#163;4,735,000.
<P>

<a name="91105w01.htm_para3">The increase in Departmental Expenditure Limit is partially due to an increase in capital expenditure (&#163;236,000) which will be used to continue the expansion of IT systems within the Department. This will be met from end year flexibility provision as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>393</i>. A further increase in the Departmental Expenditure Limit (&#163;28,000), which also increases the running cost limit, is due to additional costs associated with the extension of the Attorney-General's powers in referring unduly lenient sentences which fall on this vote. This will be offset by a transfer from the Home Office (Class IV, Vote 1).
<P>

<a name="91105w01.htm_para4">All this increase is offset by a transfer and not charged to the Reserve, it will not add to the planned total of public expenditure.

 In preparation for the new European Union Structural Funds Plan for Northern Ireland 2000-2006, an ex ante appraisal has established baseline data on equal opportunities for men and women. This will be published as part of the documentation for the Plan. In addition to their primary function in relation to the Structural Funds Plan, this data may also be used for future policy appraisal, including impact assessments in relation to the promotion of opportunity, as required by Section 75 and Schedule 9 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.

<P>
<a name="91105w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The details and quantities of individual contracts, the timing of fuel deliveries and of reprocessing for specific customers as well as the detailed arrangements for returning plutonium and wastes to the country of origin are commercial and operational matters for BNFL and its customers. In understand from BNFL, however, that BNFL concluded a contract to reprocess a quantity of Canadian spent fuel in 1970 and that fuel covered by this contract has been delivered to Sellafield. Since 1976 all BNFL's contracts for reprocessing overseas spent fuel have contained options for the return of wastes to the country of origin. The Government's policy is that these options should be exercised. BNFL's overseas reprocessing contracts concluded prior to 1976 do not contain return of waste options.

 British Trade International brings together the joint work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Trade and Industry in support of UK trade and investment overseas and its TradeUK Internet website(www.tradeuk.com) has been created to help put UK suppliers in touch with overseas buyers. Over 57,000 firms are currently listed. The majority of UK firms' contact data is used under licence from a commercial database source but firms can also submit their own entries. Our current policy is to allow any firm in any sector involved in exporting for the UK to be listed, free of charge, on the TradeUK National Exporters Database. These firms are responsible for the information they supply and for its accuracy. It is clearly not in their interest to promote goods for which an export licence would not be granted. We are reviewing the guidance we provide to UK firms both in the TradeUK application form and on the website to make clear the need to comply with current export control legislation. We are also reviewing operational procedures with the TradeUK contractor.

Additional receipts of &#163;4,175,000, of which &#163;1,400,000 will come from VAT refunds and the balance from electricity licence fees, will not fully meet the increase in gross provision. The shortfall is due to the requirement to reduce electricity licence fees in 1999-2000 by the amount overrecovered in 1998-99 and the take up of End Year Flexibility.

 The Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions are assessing the possible overall costs and benefits of the European Commission's early suggestions for revising EC Directive 94/62 on Packaging and Packaging Waste, including the suggestion to increase the targets from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. At present, there is significant uncertainty about the possible costs and benefits. Both Departments are therefore consulting businesses and other interested parties in order to gather better information and data. This will enable the Government to prepare a Regulatory Impact Assessment to accompany the Explanatory Memorandum which will be submitted to Parliament when a European Commission proposal is published.

 Cluster bombs and depleted uranium (DU)-based ammunition are purchased for the UK armed forces because they are currently the most effective weapons available to satisfy the military requirements for which they are deployed. Cluster bombs are used against armoured and soft-skinned vehicles, artillery, surface to air missile sites, anti-aircraft artillery or forces on the ground. DU-based ammunition is used because of its unique capability as a kinetic penetrator. It offers a significant operational advantage over all currently available alternative materials.

This reflects a transfer of &#163;7,500,000 to Class III, Vote 1 (Housing, construction, regeneration, regional policy, and countryside and wildlife, England) due to an increase in demand for disabled facilities grants; and a transfer of &#163;9,000 to Class III, Vote 2 (Planning, roads, local transport and vehicle safety) for the National Travel Survey.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91105w06.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have set a national target of 95 per cent. coverage for the routine childhood immunisations (including MMR) by age 2. Adverse publicity about the safety of MMR vaccine led to uptake falling from an annual peak of 92 per cent. over the past 3 years. Recent quarterly data from the Public Health Laboratory Service show that this earlier fall appears to have stabilised. For the quarter April to June 1999, 88 per cent. of children at age 2 had received the vaccine (up to 0.4 percentage points on the previous quarter). Most encouragingly, the percentage of children immunised at age 16 months at August 1999 stood at 79.1 per cent., an increase of 3.5 percentage points on April 1999.
<P>

<a name="91105w06.htm_para5">Our recommendations on immunisation are based upon the advice of independent experts. All new evidence on the safety of MMR vaccine is carefully considered by independent groups of scientific and medical experts and subjected to the same rigorous scrutiny as was given to the evidence on which the advice to parents on protecting their children through MMR immunisation is based. The views of these independent experts, as well as those of experts from around the world, including the World Health Organisation, remain unequivocal that there is no evidence of any link between MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel disease or autism.
<P>

<a name="91105w06.htm_para6">We aim to make factually accurate scientific information freely and widely available. As new scientific data has become available--for example, the publication in June of a further two new studies supporting the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and showing no evidence of links to autistic spectrum disorders or bowel problems--this has been widely publicised. The Chief Medical Officer regularly provides health professionals with summaries of the relevant pieces of research emphasising the safety of the vaccine. Ministers have addressed the concerns of the constituents of hon. Members both formally in the House, through correspondence and also through a series of meetings.
<P>

<a name="91105w06.htm_para7">The information provided to the public seeks to address anxious parents' calls for factually accurate scientific information and to provide support for doctors dealing with them. In considering what public information to provide, the Department has taken account of research conducted through the Health Education Authority (HEA) on parental attitudes to immunisation and the data on uptake of vaccines provided by the PHLS. The Department's activities on the MMR vaccine reflect the views of parents consulted through this research. The Department has worked with the HEA to provide leaflets for parents, factsheets for professionals and posters for surgeries that have been widely distributed.

<a name="91105w06.htm_para8">Locally, immunisation co-ordinators have been supported with information and material for use in health authority-based campaigns to publicise the facts about MMR vaccine.

 In the Department's resource accounts for the financial year 1999-2000, it is intended that fixed assets will be depreciated using the straight line method i.e. adjustments for changes in price aside, the same amount of depreciation will be charged each year over the life of an asset. This treatment is in line with HM Treasury's Resource Accounting Manual. The requirements in the Manual relating to depreciation methods will be underpinned by Financial Reporting Standard 15, "Tangible Fixed Assets", issued by the Accounting Standards Board.

 According to a survey conducted by the Department in 1998-99 the average sickness absence rate for staff directly employed by National Health Service trusts was 4.6 per cent. This is equivalent to approximately 8 million out of the 176 million days worked each year by National Health Service staff. Details of the survey can be found in Health Service Circular 1999/229: 'Managing Violence, Accidents and Sickness Absence in the NHS' copies of which are available in the Library. Similar information for earlier years, and information about the overall cost and causes of sick leave, is not collected centrally, but may be held locally by individual National Health Service employers. We have agreed improvement targets for health authorities and NHS trusts to 'achieve year on year improvement in sickness absence rates' of 20 per cent. by 2001 and 30 per cent. by 2003.

Details of cases of food poisoning and the likely sources of infection identified are collected by the Public Health Laboratory Service and published in CDR Weekly.
<P>

<a name="91105w07.htm_para2">The number of cases of food poisoning where the sole vehicle identified has been cheese made from pasteurised and unpasteurised milk (the latter representing less than 1 per cent. of all cheeses manufactured) is set out in the table. Since these figures are based on laboratory reports they cannot be related to food poisoning figures based on statutory notifications. Data for 1994 and 1995 are unavailable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91105w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Eligibility for free hospital treatment depends mainly on residence in the United Kingdom. With some exceptions, for example in accident and emergency departments, all new patients are asked if they have been living in the United Kingdom for the previous 12 months. Patients who have done so, with up to no more than three months absence during that time, will be eligible. Patients who have not lived in the United Kingdom for 12 months may still be eligible if either they are exempt from charges by virtue of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 or, following a House of Lords ruling, if they can demonstrate that they are lawfully in the United Kingdom for a settled, identifiable purpose. It is unlikely that anyone intending to stay for less than six months would fulfil this criteria.
<P>

<a name="91105w07.htm_para7">General practitioners are encouraged to consider residency before accepting a patient for National Health Service treatment but are not bound by the same regulations. Under the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 a GP does not have to accept any patient for NHS treatment unless specifically allocated by a health authority. The GP's decision does not automatically exempt the patient from charges for hospital treatment they may subsequently need.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reasons the EU has lifted sanctions against Libya while retaining the arms embargo; if the UN has retained an arms embargo; and if he will make a statement on Government policy on such sanctions and embargoes.  [97145]<P>

<P>
<a name="91105w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN Sanctions against Libya, including the arms embargo, were suspended on 5 April 1999, following the UN Secretary-General's report to the Council that Libya had complied with the requirements of Security Council resolution 1192 and the Lockerbie accused had arrived in the Netherlands for the purpose of trial.
<P>

<a name="91105w09.htm_para5">On 16 April 1999 the EU suspended its measures implementing the UN sanctions. But it left in place EU measures, including an arms embargo, imposed in 1986 in response to Libya's general implication in terrorism. These measures, with the exception of the arms embargo, were lifted on 13 September 1999, in the light of the UN Secretary-General's report of 30 June 1999, in which he cited several elements suggesting that recent acts by the Libyan authorities were indicative of the Libyan Government's renunciation of terrorism. EU member states will keep the question of the arms embargo under review.
<P>

<a name="91105w09.htm_para6">The conclusions of a Government review of sanctions were announced to Parliament on 15 March 1999. The review found that sanctions, including arms embargoes, had an important role to play in responding to challenges to international peace and security, and should be tailored to fit the circumstances.

However, funding from DCMS is available indirectly through the Area Museums Councils (which received a total of &#163;4 million in 1998-99, most of which was given to individual museums and galleries). Through the Museums and Galleries Commission, the Department provides funds for the PRISM Fund (71 grants worth &#163;292,567 in 1998-99) and the V&A Purchase Grant Fund (227 grants worth &#163;1 million) which assist regional museums in acquiring objects for their collections.

<P>

<a name="91105w13.htm_para5">A continuing programme of investment means items such as vehicles and IT equipment are renewed every 4 to 6 years. As a result, a number of life expired assets will be sold each year as new assets are purchased to replace them. Extracting information on these sales could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

However, at the September Agricultural Council, the French Agriculture Minister provided verbal assurances that the shortcomings identified in the Commission's inspection report had been firmly addressed. There has been no suggestion of widespread use in animal feed of human sewage. The Commission's report focused on the recovery of animal material from waste water treatment systems in rendering plants.
