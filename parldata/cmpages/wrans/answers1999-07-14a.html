<a name="90714w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer of 12 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>170-71</i>, if, in exceptional circumstances, by permission or on request by the interviewees <i>(a)</i> the Independent Commissioner for the Holding Centres, <i>(b)</i> the Chairman of the Independent Commission on Police Complaints, <i>(c)</i> the Police Ombudsman and <i>(d)</i> representatives of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture may have access to an audio recording of an interview conducted in a holding centre.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> There are currently no arrangements in place for the Independent Commissioner for the Holding Centres to gain access to the audio recordings of police interviews with terrorist suspects.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> Under the Royal Ulster Constabulary (Complaints, etc.) Regulations 1988, the Independent Commission on Police Complaints is to be supplied with such information and documents as it may reasonably require relating to a complaint or matter referred to it, for the purpose of enabling it to fulfil its functions. This could include listening to audio recordings of police interviews with terrorist suspects if considered relevant to such a complaint or matter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Provision for a new Police Ombudsman has been made in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. Once appointed and operational, he or she will take over the functions of the Chairman of the ICPC, and in turn will have access to material (including audio recordings) considered relevant to a particular complaint or matter made or referred to him or her, as the case may be.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(d)</i> The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, established by virtue of Article 1 of the European Convention of that name, may have access to information which is necessary for the Committee to carry out its task. This would appear to include access to audio recordings if necessary for that purpose. In seeking such access, the Committee is required to have regard to applicable rules of national law and professional ethics.</FONT></UL>

<a name="90714w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government's fuel duty policy is primarily intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from road transport, as part of our strategy to tackle climate change. It is, however, also one element of the package of measures we are implementing, following last year's Integrated Transport White Paper, to tackle traffic growth. We will publish our first report under the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Act 1998, on the issue of whether to set a national traffic reduction target, by the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what responsibilities the Environment Agency has in respect of the dock system at Seaforth and its immediate environs.  [90171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has powers and duties to prevent pollution of controlled waters including the River Mersey and adjoining dock area.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para0">Under Section 85 of the Water Resources Act 1991, it is an offence to cause or knowingly permit any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter or any solid waste matter to enter controlled waters. It is similarly an offence to cause or knowingly permit the discharge of any trade effluent or sewage effluent into controlled waters except in accordance with a relevant consent. The Environment Agency is the enforcing authority.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para1">The Agency has issued Discharge Consent (no. 6992575) for the discharge of treated sewage effluent from a septic tank at Berth S6 of the Container Terminal. The Agency has a duty to inspect the premises and take samples of the discharge on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the consent.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para2">A Waste Management Licence (no. 192-03) is held by the Sheppard Group Ltd, for the storage and treatment of scrap metal at Seaforth Area B. Agency officers are required to inspect licensed sites to ensure that licence conditions are complied with and that the authorised activities are carried out in ways that protect the environment and human health.

<a name="90714w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Miss Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what help is available from his Department to improve public transport in rural areas.  [90376]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The aim of our integrated transport strategy is to increase transport choice for all--including those who live in rural areas. In addition to the extra &#163;700 million of funding to assist local authorities with the implementation of their local transport plans, we have made available a further &#163;170 million over three years to improve public transport in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para3">The bulk of this &#163;170 million is being used to provide additional bus services in rural areas. We are allocating &#163;32.5 million each year to English local authorities in Rural Bus Subsidy Grant for the support of new rural bus services, as well as making &#163;15 million available for this year's Rural Bus Challenge competition and &#163;15 million 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 191</I><P>
for next year's Challenge. We have also set aside &#163;4.2 million a year for the Rural Transport Partnership fund, to assist community-based transport initiatives.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para4">Lancashire was allocated &#163;751,438 in Rural Bus Subsidy Grant for 1998-99, and the same amount for 1999-2000. In addition, the authority was allocated a total of &#163;481,606 for its two successful bids under the 1998 Rural Bus Challenge competition, involving the creation of a new bus and rail interchange facility at Clitheroe and the establishment of a high quality bus corridor to include low floor accessible vehicles, improved shelters, and better provision of information for passengers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the likely impact on domestic and business water users from 2000 to 2005 of the periodic review of water prices to set prices for that period.  [91163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under the Water Industry Act 1991, the regulation of water and sewerage undertakers' price limits is for the Director General of Water Services. In setting price limits, the Director General is also under a duty to 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 192</I><P>
ensure that the interests of customers are protected, and he will therefore have regard to the impact of the periodic review on customers.
<P>

<a name="90714w01.htm_para5">We believe that reductions in average water and sewerage bills can be secured. The Director General expects to announce draft price limits for each undertaker later this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance he has given to the Director General of Ofwat concerning the periodic review of water prices to set prices for the period from April 2000 to 2005.  [91162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under the Water Industry Act 1991 the regulation of water and sewerage undertakers' price limits is for the Director General of Water Services. The Government have given guidance to the Director General on the environmental and water quality improvements to be delivered by 2005. This guidance was published under the title "Raising the Quality" in September 1998, and was supported by more detailed announcements of company programmes on 1 March 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the current situation is in respect of providing a Channel Tunnel rail interchange at Stratford, East London, to serve East Anglia.  [90708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A new international and domestic station at Stratford remains integral to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link project, with construction planned as part of Section 2. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 provides powers for an open box over which the station is to be built. An Order providing powers for the station itself has been sought by London and Continental Railways (LCR) under the Transport and Works Act 1992. Following a public inquiry, the Secretary of State announced on 8 September 1998 that he was minded to approve the Order with modifications. But before reaching a final decision he required further information from LCR and other parties on pedestrian access, which is presently awaited.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 We have today placed in the Library copies of the Government's response on some of the issues addressed by the EOC in their proposals for changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equal Pay Acts. In reaching our conclusions, the Government have taken into account the Better Regulation Task Force's report on anti-discrimination legislation and the Commission for Racial Equality's proposals for changes to the Race Relations Act 1976, on which we are also responding today.
<P>

<a name="90714w02.htm_para4">In considering the EOC's proposals, our guiding principle has been to identify measures that will have the greatest practical impact on the lives of men and women. We will therefore: consult on changes in the way equal pay cases are dealt with to make them clearer and simpler; update the law to take account of developments in Europe on equal treatment; bring the functions of all public authorities within the scope of the Sex Discrimination Act; explore both legislative and non-legislative options to ensure public bodies promote equal opportunities between women and men; encourage the EOC to work with equality bodies and others to help employers and service providers meet their obligations under the current law by producing clear and accessible guidance and examples of good practice; and bring the EOC's powers in line with the Disability Rights Commission. At this stage we do not consider that undertaking a major legislative overhaul, in the way the EOC suggests, will of itself achieve the practical changes that are needed.
<P>

<a name="90714w02.htm_para5">The Government are taking concrete steps to tackle key issues that affect women and men's lives. For example, the National Childcare Strategy created over 65,000 new child care places last year, enabling men and women to choose to work or study. The National Minimum Wage is benefiting women in particular, as they make up the highest proportion of those on low pay. Measures under the Employment Relations Bill on maternity and parental leave will help people to balance their working and home lives.

Statutory Publications Unit. Stationery Office: Statutory Instruments are classified as General Instruments if they are in the nature of a General Public Act. SIs may also be registered as Local Instruments in the nature of local or private Acts. SIs implementing EC legislation will always be classified as General Instruments. <P>

It is not possible, without incurring disproportionate cost, to determine how many of these SIs were introduced to comply with European Community obligations.<P>

<a name="90714w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 People who move off New Deal to start self-employment are recorded as having found work, and separate statistics are not collected. However, 2,635 young people have started on the Basic Awareness Session of the Self-Employment Route of the New Deal Employment Option; and 740 have started on the Test Trading stage. It is too early to provide meaningful figures of those who have subsequently moved from this stage into independent self-employment, but these will be available from later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the implications of his paper, "Learning to Succeed", Cm 4392, for community organisations that currently use the money they generate from training contracts via TECs to cross-subsidise community-based activities; and what steps he will take to ensure the use of community activities to increase access to education and training for Asian women and Asian Elders.  [90357]<P>

<P>
<a name="90714w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 "Learning to Succeed" makes clear that adult and community learning is a vital part of the Government's aim to create access to high quality, relevant learning opportunities for everyone. The new Learning and Skills Council will provide an opportunity to integrate adult and community learning provision more effectively with other learning opportunities. To this end, the Government propose to give the Council a national duty to arrange adequate and sufficient adult and community learning provision and to give to local authorities the changed duty to contribute to arrangements for provision at local level. The Council will develop a new funding system that caters for the needs of all post-16 learners, including those in adult and community education. Local Learning Councils will arrange provision in the light of plans drawn up by local Learning Partnerships. These new coherent arrangements should make it easier for individuals from all groups in the community to access a wide range of learning opportunities. We shall consult further on the detailed arrangements.

<a name="90714w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) published a new Corporate Plan for 1999-2002 on 6 July. This makes promoting the recruitment of teachers the Agency's top priority. The Plan includes an aim to increase the recruitment of members of ethnic minorities to initial teacher training (ITT) from the present 6 per cent. to 9 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90714w03.htm_para0">The Agency has also persuaded the vast majority of providers to introduce an additional voluntary target for recruitment from the ethnic minorities. The average voluntary target for all primary and secondary ITT providers is 7 per cent. The TTA also allocates additional places to ITT providers if they achieve exceptional recruitment of ethnic minority trainees.

<a name="90714w03.htm_para1">Costs for the final version of the Code amount to &#163;100,000. This includes the costs for printing and distribution of 35,000 initial packs of the Code and guidance, the production of publicity fliers and posters for display in Jobcentres, libraries and Citizens Advice Bureaux: and initial advertising in human resource journals. Beyond this, an additional &#163;70,000 has already been committed to support initiatives by partners to take the Code forward with employers.

 The information is shown in the following tables. Table A shows the capital investment the Government have made in schools in Stoke-on-Trent in the four years up to 1999-2000. Table B shows the level of investment the Government intend to make for the following two financial years, provided resources allow; this represents only commitments arising from existing projects; we cannot indicate what investment we will make to Stoke in respect of new projects. In 1996-97, Stoke was still part of Staffordshire; it is not possible to determine how much of the grant and credit approval allocated to Staffordshire LEA actually benefited schools in Stoke.

(4) 1996-97 and 1997-98: Annual Capital Guidelines, Supplementary Credit Approval, and VA grant: For 1996-97, Stoke was part of Staffordshire; it is not possible to disaggregate what credit approvals and grants would have benefited Stoke schools. New Deal for Schools, Reduction in Class Sizes, National Grid for Learning, and Security in Schools: None of these initiatives were running in 1996-97; nor, in 1997-98, were the initiatives for Class Sizes and the National Grid for Learning operational.<P>

<P>

(5) LEA's Education Capital Programme: Please note, the total education programme is less than the sum total of the amounts allocated under government initiatives. This is because LEAs are not obliged to use credit approvals for the purposes for which they were allocated (see notes 3 and 4); also some of the grants are used for revenue purposes (see note 7).<P>

<P>

(6) Education Capital Programme 1998-99: Please note, this figure is provisional only, based on estimates by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.<P>

<P>

(7) Annual Capital Guidelines: This is used in the calculation of the LEA's Basic Credit Approval (BCA), where the LEA's capital receipts are taken into account. Just because a project has been taken account of in calculating the ACG, it does not mean that the LEA has to use its BCA for that purpose.<P>

<P>

(8) Supplementary Credit Approval (SCA): Unlike BCA, receipts are not taken into account when calculating the level of SCA. However, unless the SCA specifically says otherwise, the LEA is not obliged to use the SCA for the purpose for which it was allocated.<P>

<P>

 <P>

<P>

(9) New Deal for Schools: Some of the grant figures for VA schools would have changed slightly in order to reflect the actual costs of the project.<P>

<P>

(10) National Grid for Learning and Security in Schools: While the majority of the expenditure supported by the grant will be capital in nature, some will be revenue, and it is not possible to isolate the two elements.<P>

<P>

(11) VA Grant: Capital grant is paid in respect of Governors' liability at a rate of 85 per cent. Actual amount of grant paid may change depending on the costs of project on tender. <P>

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, in his announcement about the change of policy to the HEP and the consideration of asylum applications from citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) on 15 June, stated that no Kosovar Albanian would have their stay curtailed nor would they be required to leave the United Kingdom until it was safe to do so.

We expect the first flight to take place in the week commencing 19 July. For those without passports, the necessary travel documentation will be provided for those on the return programme. The programme will be available to those FRY citizens from Kosovo who arrived on the HEP as well as those who arrived in the United Kingdom independently.

The original and updated action plan is sent to Ministers and to the Chief Inspector.

<a name="90714w04.htm_para2">The protocol was not applied retrospectively. It is currently under review.

<a name="90714w04.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A governor's order was issued immediately after Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons' inspection which required managers to make regular checks on the system. The checks include both random and regular visual checks of alarm panels in wing offices. Staff have also been briefed directly by the governor and reminded of their personal responsibilities to respond to cell alarms. Notices to prisoners have been published and displayed on wing notice boards reminding prisoners that cell call systems are for emergency use only.
<P>

<a name="90714w04.htm_para3">The broken mute switch referred to in the Chief Inspector's report has been repaired and the cell call system is now in full working order on A Wing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what are the Prison Service's current projections for changes in the prison population in each of the next five years; and if he will make a statement.  [90597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w04.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Research Development and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office provided revised projections of the prison population in England and Wales in May, and a summary of the projection is included in the April 1999 'Prison Population Brief' which is available on the Internet at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm
<P>

<a name="90714w04.htm_para14">Projections are provided according to various alternative scenarios. The middle variant projection assumes that Crown Court custody rates increase at 0.6 per cent. for males and 1.1 per cent. for females, and that sentence lengths increase by 0.2 months per year in the first two years (but by no more thereafter). A higher variant assumes that from 2001, in addition to the custody rate increases assumed in the middle variant, sentence lengths continue to increase after the first two years at 1.5 per cent. per annum for males and 2 per cent. per annum for females. The results are as given in the table. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 203</I><P>
These scenarios both assume that the amount of courts' business remains constant over the period. A third scenario, that sentence lengths and custody rates do not

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps the Prison Service takes to monitor prisoners who are transferred from private to public prisons, with particular reference to the honouring of risk assessments conducted in private prisons.  [90988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w04.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Risk assessments on prisoners are prepared at prisons for a variety of purposes, including categorisation, sentence planning, release on temporary licence and home detention curfew. Contracted out prisons are subject to the same rules, procedures, guidance and policy for risk assessments as public sector prisons. Assessment processes at contracted out and public sector prisons are monitored during standards audits. Where prisoners transfer, the assessment will be the responsibility of the prison with final accountability for the decision in question, but in doing so, it would normally be expected to take into account any previous assessment undertaken by other prisons. Prisoners dissatisfied with decisions at contracted out or public sector prisons can make use of the request and complaints procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his oral statement of 28 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 28, on Wormwood Scrubs, on what date he asked Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons to re-inspect HMP Wormwood Scrubs within six months of the publication of the 1999 report on the prison.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A voluntary, anonymous survey of HIV and hepatitis and risk behaviour was conducted in 1997-98 by the Public Health Laboratory Service at eight prisons. The survey found prevalence of hepatitis C to be 7.4 per cent. of the prison population overall.
<P>

<a name="90714w05.htm_para0">The Prison Service has a strategy for preventing the spread of communicable diseases which covers training, education, prevention, risk reduction and harm minimisation. A pilot project on the provision of disinfecting tablets to reduce the risk of spreading hepatitis C through prisoners sharing injecting equipment has recently been completed. The Prison Service hopes to be able to extend this initiative across the remainder of the prison estate during the coming year. Advice and guidance is sent to prison governors and doctors on an ad hoc basis and covers the management of blood-borne viruses including hepatitis C. Every prison is expected to have a communicable diseases management team to deal strategically with the management, medical and social challenges involved.
<P>

<a name="90714w05.htm_para1">The treatment available for prisoners with hepatitis C follows that provided to members of the general public by the NHS with decisions about initiating further investigations and treatment taken only by specialists.

<a name="90714w05.htm_para2">The Government recognise that although significant progress has been made since the Race Relations Act 1976 was introduced 23 years ago, there is much to be done before we achieve a truly inclusive society.

 Criminal proceedings are currently being brought against two defendants following the incident which resulted in the death of Mr. Jay Abatan. So long as these matters remain sub judice it would not be proper for me, the Chief Crown Prosecutor, or his staff, to discuss the case with either the hon. Member, or his constituent who is a vital witness in the case. I understand that the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex will be pleased to meet the hon.

 DTI continues to fulfil the role of "responsible body" reporting to the Action 2000 National Infrastructure Forum on the preparations being made by the oil industry and UK's offshore oil and gas producers to avoid any disruption due to the Year 2000 threat to computer systems.
<P>

<a name="90714w06.htm_para2">At the National Infrastructure Forum meeting in January 1999, the industry attracted an overall "amber" assessment against the standard colour code adopted by Action 2000. I am pleased to report that WS Atkins Consultants Ltd. have confirmed that the industry continues to make substantial progress both onshore and offshore.
<P>

<a name="90714w06.htm_para3">In detail WS Atkins found that over 80 per cent. of the industry now merit a blue assessment (no identified risks of material disruption), and that the remainder are on track to attain that rating once work scheduled during the normal summer shutdown period has been completed, and that residual contingency planning and external dependency issues had been finalised.
<P>

<a name="90714w06.htm_para4">The DTI has arranged for WS Atkins to carry out a further review at the end of September, to monitor progress on those outstanding issues and carry out a further programme of independent check visits to confirm that the scheduled work has been completed successfully. DTI will report on this work at the National Infrastructure Forum meeting in October 1999, and will continue to monitor the industry's progress throughout the millennium period.
<P>

<a name="90714w06.htm_para5">A summary of their report has been placed in the Libraries of the House, and copies have been made available on the DTI internet site.

<P>
<a name="90714w06.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Article 8 of the Revised Voice Telephony Directive (RVTD) requires member states to take specific measures where appropriate to ensure equal access to, and affordability of, fixed public telephone services, including directory services for disabled users and users with special social needs. Regulations implementing Article 8 were made in 1998 (The Telecommunications (Open Network Provision) (Voice Telephony) Regulations 1998).
<P>

<a name="90714w06.htm_para6">Following a consultation exercise in 1998, Oftel has proposed further specific measures to improve access to telecommunications for the disabled. The Government are planning to consult on the detail of these proposals later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list by name of recipient all allocations of regional selective assistance in the last five years to organisations in the North West of England, the value of the assistance and the date of the allocation, in development and intermediate areas separately.  [90668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 As the list requested runs to some 900 companies, I will write to my hon. Friend and place a copy of that letter in the Libraries of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in what circumstances pressures from competitors on UK commercial undertakings can be taken into account by the members of industrial development advisory committees or those advising them when considering applications for regional selective assistance.  [90652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Applicants are only eligible for regional selective assistance if they are making new investments. As well as the viability of the project, competition and job displacement are factors taken into account when considering applications.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what statistics are collected by his Department in respect of rejections of applications for regional selective assistance which lead to the cancellation of the proposed investment projects and a consequential loss of potential jobs.  [90653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Department keeps a record of all regional selective assistance applications. It is not part of the scheme procedures, however, to continue contacts with unsuccessful applicants, and subsequent developments are not, therefore, routinely recorded.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate his Department has made of the number of jobs or potential jobs lost as a result of refusals of applications for regional selective assistance which have led to the cancellation of the proposed investment in each of the last three years.  [90654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 No estimate has been made. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the figure would be small. Within available funds, the Department gives a sympathetic hearing to any eligible application and the main reasons for rejection are either on grounds that a project will proceed in any event without grant or that a project is not viable and would not, therefore, provide sustainable jobs.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate his Department has made of the cost of regional selective assistance per job created in the North West of England in the last five years.  [90655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w07.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The average cost per job resulting from Regional Selective Assistance offers accepted in the North West over the last five years is &#163;4,019.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on how many occasions in the last five years members of the North West Industrial Development Advisory Committee or those who advise them have had to stand aside from the consideration of regional selective assistance applications for reasons of either personal or professional conflict of interest.  [90656]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Details of the time-scales for claimants passing through the various stages of the assessment process for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease have still to be finalised. However, the intention is that individuals will receive an offer of compensation within 28 days of their detailed medical assessment having been completed and their eligibility for compensation established. Payment will then be made within 14 days of written confirmation that the offer has been accepted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many claimants he estimates will use the ex-miner compensation lung-test centre facility in Bristol; and when he expects testing of those people to be concluded.  [91160]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 To date a total of 108 claimants have been assessed at the Bristol spirometry centre and a further 19 claimants, who have yet to respond to a letter of invitation, remain to be tested. In addition, 12 claimants in the Bristol area have provided doctors' letters which mean they will receive domiciliary visits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The timing and quantities of spent fuel imported to Sellafield for specific customers are a commercial and operational matter for BNFL and their customers. All civil nuclear material in the United Kingdom is subject to Euratom safeguards and to the terms of the UK/Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement. Since 1976 all new contracts for the reprocessing of overseas spent fuel have contained options for the return of wastes. BNFL's overseas reprocessing contracts prior to 1976, including those with Spanish utilities, do not contain return of wastes options.

 We are working closely with the Treasury to influence the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Review being carried out by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In the first phase, we submitted a joint paper on the need for faster, deeper and wider debt relief, and I am pleased that there is now an international consensus that more debt relief is required for countries committed to eradicating poverty. The second phase of the Review is currently under way and is examining how the link between debt relief and poverty reduction can be strengthened. We have recently submitted a further joint DFID and Treasury paper to the Review team, setting out our ideas and proposals. Decisions on this will be taken at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in September. Both papers are available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="90714w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Cologne Debt Initiative represents a major step forward in the effort to remove the debt burden of the poorest countries. We welcome the commitment to a major improvement in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative so that it delivers faster, wider and deeper debt relief to countries committed to eradicating poverty. If agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, the HIPC initiative will provide twice as much debt relief, twice as quickly. It is also important that there was a call to cancel outstanding aid debts. These amount to $20 billion owed to the G7 countries alone. The UK has already cancelled the aid debts of the poorest countries, and we are pressing others to follow our lead. The UK has also made the largest pledge to the Millennium Trust Fund--a total of $171 million. It is important that everyone plays their part in funding the enhanced debt relief, and we are calling on the European Commission to make a substantial contribution.

 Great progress has already been made this century--more people have climbed out of poverty in the last 50 years than in the previous 500--but we must continue with our efforts at every level to meet this ambitious target. The plans for halving world poverty by 2015 are in place and set out in the 1999 Departmental Report, working both with our partners in country and internationally. It is achievable if the international system works together. It requires greater coherence of aid, trade, environment, agriculture and economic reform policies. We are engaging positively with all our partners to this end.

<P>
<a name="90714w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Last year's review of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) recommended that the IMF should take more account of the social impact of their programmes, consider the quality of government expenditure and protect budgets in high priority areas such as health and education. We strongly welcomed this and are encouraging the IMF to work more closely with the World Bank to ensure that, in designing structural adjustment programmes, they take account of the impact on the poor. Following a proposal put forward by the UK, the World Bank is working with the IMF and the UN to develop good principles and practices of social policy, which will be drawn upon in the design of World Bank and IMF programmes. We continually emphasise the need for the IMF to build support for reform programmes, through discussion and consultation with civil society, so that they lead to economic growth which benefits the poor. A report on the implementation of the recommendations of the ESAF Review is expected in September.

 There can be no doubt that the EC's development assistance programmes are not sufficiently poverty focused and are often ineffective. This is why we published a strategy paper at the end of last year containing 18 detailed proposals for strengthening our collaboration with the EC to improve the poverty focus and effectiveness of its programmes. We are pursuing implementation of this strategy vigorously, and I shall be making a speech in Brussels at the end of July setting out a reform agenda to strengthen the EC's role as we enter the new millennium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w10.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The United Nations Development Programme, together with other UN organisations and the World Bank, has calculated that $80 billion per year would mean basic social services would be available to everyone in the world in the next 15 years. This would have an enormous impact on international poverty reduction and achievement of the International Development targets, particularly in the areas of health and education. Current international overseas development assistance is $50 billion.

But it is increasingly clear that aid spending is effective in reducing poverty only when sound policies are in place in recipient countries. Where this is lacking, aid is best spent on technical assistance to support reform and support for civil society so that it is able to press for the adoption of policy to reduce poverty.

<a name="90714w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Somalia does not have a government and is not formally represented in the negotiations on a new convention. However, we are concerned that the Somali people should be able to benefit from Lome. As part of the negotiations, we are therefore considering, with our EU partners, how to take account of countries like Somalia, who are members of the Lome family but are not able to sign or ratify any future agreement. We are pressing hard to ensure that an equitable solution is reached.

<a name="90714w10.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We view with great concern the estimate by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that, if current trends continue, tobacco will be the leading cause of disease burden by 2030, causing about one in eight deaths, and that 70 per cent. of tobacco-related deaths will be in developing countries. We strongly support the priority given to tobacco control by WHO through its "Tobacco Free" initiative, and the efforts to establish an International Framework Convention (ITC) for tobacco control.

We are contributing &#163;200,000 this financial year to WHO's "Tobacco Free" initiative.

 <i>[holding answer 28 June 1999]:</i> Revised Customer Supplier Agreements (CSA) are being introduced to replace the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) existing with the host NHS Trusts for our Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs) at Derriford, Peterborough and Frimley Park. The new financial model underpinning the CSAs is explained in Health Services Circular 1999/112 and is also being used for the CSA at our new MDHU at Northallerton. The agreements will not include details of the terms and conditions of service for military personnel. However, provision will exist in the agreements for the release of military personnel for operations, exercises and training. The agreements also include a commitment to the achievement of DSCA Key Targets 2 and 3, as set out on 20 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>436</i>, and to the operational priority treatment of patients referred under specific criteria.

 <i>[holding answer 28 June 1999]:</i> Following detailed discussions with the NHS during 1997 and 1998, the principles of a new Service Level Agreement (SLA) have been developed to form a revised contract from 1999-2000 at the three existing Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs) at Peterborough, Frimley Park and Derriford and at the new MDHU Northallerton. This model will also form the basis of all future MOD contracts relationships with the NHS for hosting staff or providing treatment. The new contract model which has been agreed with all partner NHS Trusts in principle, was published in a Health Circular 1999/112 dated 21 May 1999 and will form the basis of the agreements which will replace the existing SLAs. It is expected that the contracts between MOD and individual NHS Trusts will be signed shortly after minor financial negotiations have been completed. These contracts embody commercial arrangements between each Trust and the MOD negotiated on an individual basis and so I am withholding them under exemption of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (Effective Management and Operations of the public service). However, a copy of Health Circular 1999/112 dated 21 May 1999 has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="90714w13.htm_spnew12"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 I have today placed copies of the Government's formal response to the Better Regulation Task Force review of anti-discrimination legislation in the Libraries of the House. The Task Force has made a timely, constructive and challenging contribution to the Government's thinking on these highly important issues. The Government are committed to eliminating all unlawful discrimination, and have accepted the majority of the Task Force proposals. We believe this response to the Task Force, in tandem with our responses today on similar issues to the proposals put forward by the equality Commissions, sets out in the strongest possible terms our commitment to a modern and diverse society.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 235</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90714w13.htm_para3">The Government have accepted the Task Force's main recommendation, that a major legislative overhaul is not necessary at this stage, either in relation to the individual regimes, or in bringing them together. However, the Government agree that much more can be done to make the existing regimes work more effectively, by setting a lead in their own actions as policy makers, a service provider and employer; by encouraging the equality Commissions to act in a more targeted, strategic and joined-up manner; and by encouraging business to seize the initiative and adopt best practices more widely in this area.
<P>

<a name="90714w13.htm_para4">To help businesses comply, the Government will further encourage the Commissions to consult with employers on producing simple, clear advice and guidance which everyone (especially small and medium employers) can quickly and easily act upon. This will include clarifying employer obligations in some key areas. Our Civil Justice and Legal Aid Reforms, along with the new Community Legal Service, will help ensure that ordinary citizens will have better and fairer access to justice.

 We have no information on the seizure of an arms consignment on 7 February in Antwerp.

<a name="90714w15.htm_para0">The British company, JMT Charlesworth Ltd., applied in 1997 for a DTI-funded Export Marketing Research Scheme grant. The grants are open to British companies with less than 500 employees wishing to research specific overseas markets and are payable after the work has been successfully completed. This was a legitimate request and the company received a grant of just over &#163;1,000 following their study of the market for used, refurbished trucks for sale to Eritrea and Ethiopia. Since the seizure of the shipment the company has received no assistance from the British Government.
<P>

<a name="90714w15.htm_para1">In line with our ethical foreign policy we supported UN Security Council Resolution 1227 of 10 February 1999 which demanded a cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea and called for a voluntary arms embargo. We announced on 15 February that the United Kingdom had implemented this arms embargo. We were also instrumental in the adoption by the European Union of a common position on 15 March 1999 implementing an EU arms embargo on Ethiopia and Eritrea.

 While the Universal Declaration was not itself a legally binding treaty, it set the framework for human rights obligations in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESR). The ICCPR has been ratified by 143 states and the ICESR by 141 states. The UK ratified both these Treaties within 7 months of their coming into force in 1976. UN independent expert committees monitor the performance of individual states under these Treaties. The committees report their findings publicly, including failures of implementation. But neither they nor we attempt comparative assessments on what are wide ranging obligations.

These discussions, which took place in the run up to the recent elections, focused on the challenges facing an incoming Administration committed to a reforming agenda.

 Preventing and resolving violent conflict, including internal conflict, is a key foreign policy objective for this Government. Since May 1997 we have worked actively with our partners in the Security Council, European Union and elsewhere to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts around the world. Militarily, we have taken action with our NATO partners in Kosovo to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe; and with the United States in Iraq to prevent repression of the civilian population and Iraq's posing a threat to its neighbours. We currently have troops deployed to UN authorised or led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Cyprus, Georgia, East Timor and on the Iraq/Kuwait border.

 All aspects of the tax system are kept under review and the Chancellor has announced a range of measures in his Budgets benefiting single earner families, in which one partner stays at home to look after children. They include the Working Families' Tax Credit from October 1999 and the new children's tax credit from April 2001. In addition, he has announced substantial increases in Child Benefit, the first of which took effect in April 1999. As a result of the measures announced, a single earner family on average male earnings with two children will be &#163;460 a year better off.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> maximum additional benefit is for claimants of working families tax credit as compared with family credit for each region in England and Wales.  [90643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w16.htm_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It is estimated that in 2000-01, the first full year of the Working Families Tax Credit, the average weekly gain for families in receipt of the credit, compared with Family Credit, is &#163;24. This includes families who would not have been in receipt of Family Credit. Estimated average gains for each region of England and Wales are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="90714w16.htm_para2">The maximum gain from the Working Families Tax Credit depends upon the circumstances of individual families, in particular the number of children and the expenditure on eligible child care. It is not possible to forecast what this maximum gain will be.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your three recent parliamentary questions (90324, 90325 and 90326) on households, families and career breaks.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In answer to your question about couples according to the status of the 'husband' and 'wife' I attach two tables. Table 1a gives estimates from the spring 1998 Labour Force Survey (LFS) of actual numbers comparing the labour market status of the husband/man with that of his wife/partner for the four different couple types requested. For example, looking at the block for married couples 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 248</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>without dependent children you can see that there were 997,000 couples where the husband worked full-time and the wife worked part-time. Table 1b shows this information in terms of percentage breakdowns. These analyses have been based on all working age couples i.e. couples where both the husband and the wife are of working age. Working age is defined as 16-59 for women and 16-64 for men.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>LFS estimates have also been used to answer your question about households by type of household and family (see table 2).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regarding your third question about those reaching retirement age and the incidence and average length of any career breaks they may have taken, I regret that the ONS cannot provide any directly relevant information.</FONT></UL>

 Member states have yet to decide whether to make public the consolidated report on the operation of the Code of Conduct.

Any changes to the Code as a result of the report will by definition be made public.

 The Government are committed to supporting and promoting adherence to the standards and principles of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has lead responsibility for Government policy towards the ILO.
<P>

<a name="90714w18.htm_para3">Our commitment to the ILO is matched by action. At the International Labour Conference (ILC) in June 1999, we played a leading role in securing agreement to a new Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which becomes one of the ILO's core labour standards. At that Conference, we also announced our ratification of the ILO Convention 111 on Discrimination in Employment, one of the core labour conventions. At the ILC in June 1998, we played a key role in the agreement of a Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. And we are currently reviewing our position on ILO Convention 138 on Minimum Age of employment, the only one of the seven existing core labour conventions that the UK has yet to ratify. The UK has ratified a total of 66 conventions, which bears favourable comparison with other industrialised countries.
<P>

<a name="90714w18.htm_para4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department announced the outcome of the Government's review of international human rights instruments in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg) on 3 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>756-57</i>. Since then, on 31 March 1999 we signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, and on 20 May 1999 we ratified protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Both protocols concern abolition of the death penalty.

 2,351 parliamentary questions have been tabled to the FCO for named day answer since 2 May 1997. Our existing database does not allow us to determine which of them received a substantive response on that named day without manually checking each question. To do so would incur disproportionate cost.

 Non-settlement visa applicants dealt with at Tier 1 or 2 will normally have their application processed within 24 hours. The percentage of visa applicants dealt with at Tier 1 and 2 has risen from 52 per cent. in 1994 to 54 per cent. in May 1999. Only those processed at Tier 3 (non-settlement) or Tier 4 (settlement) will be recalled at a later date for interview. Waiting times for these two tiers have been collated only since 1996 and are as follows:

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> Since May 1997, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has funded three pieces of public opinion research centrally. A survey of opinion formers in Pakistan and a public image survey in the Eastern Caribbean helped to establish how Britain is perceived in these two areas, to highlight misconceptions, and to measure Britain's profile. Results of these two surveys have not been published. A survey on British public attitudes to Europe in 1997 helped us prepare for the EU Presidency; a copy of the results has been placed in the Libraries of the House. It would involve disproportionate costs to provide the information requested for work carried out by individual FCO posts.

KFOR has been present and escorted a relatively peaceful march through the affected part of the city by 2,000 people on 7 July. Most recently French troops broke up a demonstration on the bridge dividing the two areas on 11 July. KFOR has a strong presence in the area and has kept the situation under control, in line with their mandate under UNSCR 1244 to provide a secure environment for all the people of Kosovo.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates are based on sample counts which have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

2. It should be noted that questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low level of response, and hence a higher level of imputation compare to other parts of the survey. Responses are imputed in around 1 in 10 cases. Past evidence has suggested some under reporting of capital by respondents, and figures for income from these sources for pensioners are lower on the FRS compared to other surveys such as the Family Expenditure Survey.<P>

3. In the 1997-98 Family Resources Survey the head of the household is classified using standard procedures:<P>

In a household containing only husband, wife and children under 16 (and boarders) the husband is always the head of the household.<P>

Similarly, when a couple have been recorded as living together/cohabiting the male partner is treated as the head of the household.<P>





In all situations where there are other relatives in the household where some or all of the household are unrelated, except that a husband always takes precedence, the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented is taken as the head.<P>

When the accommodation is supplied with a job or provided rent free for some other reason, the person to whom the accommodation is given in this way becomes the head.<P>

Occasionally more than one person will have equal claim to be the head, in these cases, where they are of the same sec, the oldest is the head; where they are of different sexes, the male is the head.<P>

4. All percentages have been rounded to the nearest integer.<P>

[91047]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w21.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 1999]: Glyphosate:</i> Experimental studies indicate that two major residues may be found in soya and maize crops treated with glyphosate. The residues concerned are glyphosate itself and its metabolite aminomethylphosphoric acid (AMPA). These two residues occur in both conventionally treated and genetically modified (GM) glyphosate tolerant crops. However, the levels of the metabolite AMPA are generally higher in the GM crops.
<P>

<a name="90714w21.htm_para5">The maximum residue level (MRL) permitted for glyphosate in maize in the UK is 0.1 mg/kg. This was the lowest level at which glyphosate could be reliably detected at the time the MRL was set, so represents an effective 'zero'. No MRL has been set for AMPA, as it is of less toxicological significance to humans than glyphosate.
<P>

<a name="90714w21.htm_para6">The UK MRL for glyphosate on soya is 20 mg/kg. All maize and soya, including imports of GM and conventional crops, must comply with these MRLs.
<P>

<a name="90714w21.htm_para7">The Government carried out monitoring for residues of glyphosate in imported and home produced maize during 1998. The results of this monitoring, including information on the actual levels found, will be published 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1999 : Column: 264</I><P>
later this year. We are monitoring for residues of glyphosate and its metabolite in soya products during 1999. The results will be published next year.
<P>

<a name="90714w21.htm_para8"><i>Glufosinate ammonium:</i> In the case of glufosinate ammonium, the major residue in traditional soya varieties is glufosinate. In GM soya varieties, the major components of the residue are glufosinate and a metabolite n-acetyl glufosinate.
<P>

<a name="90714w21.htm_para9">No consent has been given to market genetically modified glufosinate ammonium tolerant soya in Europe, so setting an MRL for n-acetyl glufosinate has not been considered. There are currently no UK statutory MRLs for glufosinate ammonium, but any food treated with glufosinate ammonium must pose no unacceptable risk to consumers under general UK food safety legislation. The Government are monitoring for residues of glufosinate ammonium and its metabolite in soya products during 1999. The results will be published in the year 2000.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the environmental impact of the use of the herbicide glyphosphate when it is applied to the land as an aid in conservation tillage schemes.  [90599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90714w22.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I believe my hon. Friend is referring to the herbicide glyphosate. All pesticides are subject to strict statutory control and are approved only following thorough scientific evaluation of the risk that they pose to people, wildlife and to the wider environment. Only if this assessment shows that there is no unacceptable risk will approval be granted.
<P>

<a name="90714w22.htm_para1">Glyphosate has been approved as a herbicide since 1974. The environmental impact of its use in conservation tillage schemes would have been assessed at that time. Glyphosate is currently being reviewed by the EU Commission and the UK is playing an active part in this work. The review is expected to be completed by about late 2000.

<a name="90714w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the food and drink industry, charges are made for the hygiene inspection of meat, milk production and fish. Where export certification is required, the necessary inspections are paid for by the industry. In addition, the industry also pays for the sampling and analysis of food of animal origin for residues of veterinary medicines, and the agrochemical sector pays part of the cost of the pesticide residue monitoring arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 1999]:</i> The Government have no wish to see good food go to waste and have consistently opposed the system of paying compensation for produce withdrawn from the market, arguing that it distorts the market and encourages surpluses. The reform of the EU fruit and vegetable regime in 1996 was a step in the right direction, providing for reductions in withdrawal prices and volumes withdrawn over the first six years of the reform. The reform also encouraged greater use of free distribution to charities and other non-profit making institutions. A considerable amount of produce withdrawn in the UK has been distributed to such bodies in the past year.
