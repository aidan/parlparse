<P>
<a name="01030w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Code for Crown Prosecutors provides guidance to Crown Prosecutors on a range of casework issues, including the acceptance of guilty pleas. Defendants may want to plead guilty to some, but not all charges. Alternatively, defendants may want to plead guilty to a different, possibly less serious charge. The Code states that, in these circumstances, Crown Prosecutors should accept a defendant's guilty plea only if they think that the court is able to pass a sentence that matches the seriousness of the offending. The Code also states that Crown Prosecutors should never accept a guilty plea just because it is convenient. The Code is a public document, issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was re-issued in a revised form earlier this month after an extensive public consultation exercise and a copy has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01030w01.html_para4">The Court of Appeal gave judgment on 16 October 2000 in a Reference by the Attorney-General of a sentence passed on Robin Peverett for offences of indecent assault. The Attorney-General has said that in the light of that judgment he will consider, with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, whether additional guidance should be issued on the acceptance of guilty pleas at the Crown Court.

 The resource position for the CPS has been challenging since 1994-95 but the SR2000 settlement was a good one. As a result the CPS budget in 2003-04 will be 8 per cent. higher in real terms than in this year. This is on top of the additional funding of &#163;15.8 million for 2000-01 announced on 26 June 2000.
<P>

<a name="01030w01.html_para5">The quality of staff is assessed by the CPS through the performance appraisal system, whereby staff are assessed individually against the performance standard appropriate to their job. The quality of staff is also benchmarked externally by involving staff outside the Service in recruitment panels and in opening up selection exercises to outside competition. I have been impressed on my frequent visits to CPS offices around the country by the commitment and professionalism of staff.

<P>
<a name="01030w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what evaluation his Department has undertaken of the effect of the EU Telecommunications Regulation concerning unbundling of the local loop on the UK telecommunications industry.  [135666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 A Regulatory Impact Assessment on the costs and benefits of the draft Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on unbundled access to the local loop is currently being prepared.
<P>

<a name="01030w01.html_para11">Local Loop Unbundling has already been mandated in the UK. Oftel decided in November 1999 that BT should allow operators to access its local access lines, and a condition in BT's licence requiring it to provide unbundled local loops was put in place in April 2000 and brought into force on 8 August 2000--four months ahead of the deadline in the Regulation. BT started the process of accepting orders for co-location in its exchanges in September and the first loops should be available early in 2001. This progress means the UK is well placed in Europe in the introduction of local loop unbundling, which will promote competition in the provision of broadband and other communications services to consumers and small businesses.
<P>

<a name="01030w01.html_para12">The Regulation also requires the introduction of shared access, where the incumbent operator continues to provide telephony while an alternative operator provides a broadband service over the same line. While shared access is not yet in place in the UK (nor is it widely available elsewhere in Europe), Oftel has already proposed its introduction in a consultation document "Access to bandwidth: Shared access to the local loop" published in October 2000. Oftel's proposal is in line with the Regulation.
<P>

<a name="01030w01.html_para13">The overall effect of the Regulation in the UK will thus be to underpin the existing regime, which will bring significant benefits to the telecommunications industry and consumers as a whole. The Regulation will also enable UK industry to reap similar benefits elsewhere in Europe by creating a harmonised framework for local loop unbundling.

<a name="01030w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) of 24 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 106-07W, concerning the telecommunications council, what the Government's policy was towards the Commission's postal services proposal; and if he will make a statement.  [135744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 For the UK, I said that we strongly supported further liberalisation of postal services in Europe compatible with the maintenance of the universal service. We recognised that this was an increasingly global market and that postal services within the EU needed greater commercial freedom if they were to become global players. Liberalisation should proceed in a way consistent with our social objectives so as to allow the full benefits of competition to be achieved for all consumers. At the moment, and subject to the content of the package as a whole, our view was that a reduction of the reserved area to 150grams was achievable without putting the universal service at risk. We would need to consider the advice of the new UK postal regulator on whether a greater reduction could be achieved without putting at risk the universal service at a uniform tariff. However, we would play a constructive role in further discussions on the proposal reflecting the new regulator's advice.

<a name="01030w02.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Banana Trade Dispute</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) of 24 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 101W, on the banana trade dispute, what the obstacles to compensation are; and how they are affected by World Trade Organisation membership.  [135793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Any compensation scheme for companies affected by the banana dispute would raise a number of questions concerning compatibility with both the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and EC state aid rules. There is a significant risk that a scheme would be incompatible with these. As I pointed out in my earlier answer, the only way to alleviate this burden from all the companies facing US sanctions is to find a solution to the banana dispute that is satisfactory to all parties. It is precisely this that the Government have been working hard to achieve since the US first imposed retaliation last year.
<P>

<a name="01030w02.html_para0">No other European State is running a scheme to assist its own industries affected by the dispute. Several posts have reported that their hosts have looked into such a possibility and have concluded that any scheme would fall foul of these rules.

 The Government propose that the Renewables Obligation will extend to 31 March 2026, and that the 3p/KWh level of the buy-out price will not be reduced throughout that time in order to ensure that there is a secure basis for long-term investment. The Government also propose to link the buy-out to the Retail Prices Index. The Government's proposals are subject to the outcome of the current consultation.

 At a broad level, the DTI is responsible for projections of energy demand which are used to project carbon dioxide emissions, while the DETR and MAFF have responsibility for projections of other greenhouse gases.
<P>

<a name="01030w03.html_para0">Projections of carbon dioxide emissions are based on the energy demand projections which are generated by the DTI's energy model, which has been developed through extensive research over many years. The approach taken to modelling energy demand is described in chapter 2 of a working paper made available in March this year. A copy of the working paper, entitled "Energy Projections for the UK", is available in the Library of the House. The DETR also funds extensive research into carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from specific sectors such as non-domestic buildings, manufacturing industry and road transport to help inform Government projections.
<P>

<a name="01030w03.html_para1">Methods for projecting emissions of the other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) have been developed by DETR and MAFF based on many years of Government funded research. The projections were updated recently by independent consultants for inclusion in the draft Climate Change Programme and provided as a working paper entitled "Projections of Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases For The United Kingdom", March 2000, WS Atkins Limited, also available in the Library of the House.

These regulations give protection to all workers, including agency workers, against less favourable treatment on the grounds that they work part-time.

 The UK delegation to the 44th General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) played a full and active part during the conference. The UK was involved in the drafting and submission by the European Union of resolutions covering strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the model protocol, measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources and the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq. These draft resolutions were in some cases amended in negotiation with other delegations, but all were eventually adopted. The UK delegation also participated fully in discussions concerning other resolutions and decisions of the conference.

 I understand from UKAEA that in 1990, towards the end of the UK Fast Reactor research and development programme, the total investment in the programme over 30 years was estimated to be &#163;4 billion (undiscounted, in 1988 prices). This figure includes design and development for the programme at Risley and other sites as well as at Dounreay.

 Under the Claims Handling Agreement, signed by the Department and the Solicitors acting for the claimants, interest on general damages is payable from the date of the receipt of the letter of claim. On special damages, interest is payable from either the date the loss occurred, or in some cases the date of receipt of the letter of claim. Loss of earnings are calculated at the appropriate Court rate, and other heads of special damages are calculated at a reduced rate, reflecting the fact that these are assessed at present day values. All interest runs to the date an offer is accepted.

<a name="01030w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dobbin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what the outcome was of the Agriculture Council held in Luxembourg on 23 and 24 October; and if he will make a statement.  [135652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I attended the Agriculture Council meeting in Luxembourg on 23 October.
<P>

<a name="01030w05.html_para0">The Council warmly welcomed a commitment from Commissioner Fischler to table proposals simplifying the administration of the CAP. This followed a UK/French initiative responding to concerns by farmers about unnecessarily bureaucratic regulation and recommendations by the Red Tape Review team looking at implementation of IACS. The Commission also stated that it recognised the importance of traditional landscape features, such as hedges, in implementing schemes.
<P>

<a name="01030w05.html_para1">The Council held first discussions on proposals to reform the fruit and vegetables, rice and sugar regimes. On fruit and vegetables I welcomed the proposed simplification of the regime, particularly in relation to the funding of producer organisations. On rice, I stressed the importance of securing an outcome that safeguarded the interests of UK consumers, avoided problems in the WTO and for third country suppliers, and took account of the environmental aspects of rice growing in certain EU regions. I expressed disappointment that the Commission proposal for reform of the sugar regime was not more radical, particularly in view of the pressures from enlargement and from WTO developments. I nevertheless welcomed the proposed extension of sugar quotas for only two years to enable studies to be undertaken to inform a full review in 2002.
<P>

<a name="01030w05.html_para2">The Council will consider these proposals further at future meetings.
<P>

<a name="01030w05.html_para3">The Council also heard a report from Commissioner Fischler on developments in the WTO agriculture negotiations and a call from the Danish Minister to develop initiatives on organic agriculture, which was widely supported.

<a name="01030w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 If the results of the United Nations Drug Control Programme's (UNDCP) research proves that Pleospora Papaveracea can be used for the eradication of illicit opium poppy cultivation without damage to human health or the environment, UNDCP would decide on sharing these results with its member countries. The decision on whether or not to use Pleospora Papaveracea for eradication would be for the governments of the countries where there is such illicit cultivation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when representations were first made to the Cuban authorities about access to the arrested United Kingdom citizens in Cuba.  [135657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Our Embassy in Havana made representations to the Cuban authorities about access as soon as they were informed of the arrest on 9 October and continue to do so subsequently.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when the travel advice for Cuba was last amended; and what plans he has to amend it following the arrest of United Kingdom citizens in Cuba.  [135658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 FCO travel advice for Cuba was updated on 4 October 2000. It is kept under constant review. We are not planning to revise it in light of the recent arrests. British nationals travelling to Cuba who comply with the local law and are holding the correct documentation should have no cause for concern.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on what date, at what time and by whom Ministers in his Department were first informed of the arrest of United Kingdom citizens in Cuba; and which Minister in his Department was first informed.  [135656]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Ministers were aware of the arrest of the British nationals on 24 October from media reporting. It is not normal practice for FCO officials to inform Ministers whenever a British national is arrested overseas.

 The BBC has today announced that the BBC World Service will move from Bush House to Broadcasting House at the end of 2006. We welcome and endorse this decision, about which we have been kept fully informed.
<P>

<a name="01030w06.html_para0">We are confident that the World Service will maintain in Broadcasting House the standards and traditions that have made it the world's best known and most respected voice in international broadcasting. The new location will be better suited than Bush House to enable the World Service to meet the challenges of the digital age--for which the Government made available an additional &#163;64 million in the recent Spending Review--and to work to maximum effect with key BBC partners.
<P>

<a name="01030w06.html_para1">It also offers better value for money than remaining at Bush House.

concluded, therefore, that after the basic provision of storage and filing space in the wall cupboards, the most effective use of the available floor space would be achieved by providing flexible two and three drawer pedestals that could be housed under the workbenches. The matter of cost was not, therefore, a factor in our deliberations.

CAMR had a distributorship and marketing agreement with a private sector company, Porton Products Ltd., from April 1985 to October 1998 (at which time the term of the agreement ended). The range of products covered by the agreement included frozen bacterial cell pastes, enzymes and proteins, vaccines and therapeutic toxins. A full list will be deposited in the Library.

 The National Health Service Executive conducted a survey of violence in National Health Service trusts in England in 1998-99. The survey found that, on average, seven violent incidents were recorded each month per 1,000 staff. This is equivalent to approximately 65,000 violent incidents against NHS trust staff each year. The survey did not reveal the causes of violent incidents. This information will be held locally by individual National Health Service employers through local reporting procedures and identified through appropriate risk assessment measures. The information would be reflected in local prevention and reduction strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the minimum and maximum times are for a business case submitted by an NHS trust in <i>(a)</i> the West Midlands Regional Office and <i>(b)</i> England and Wales to receive funding, differentiating between PFI and non-PFI schemes.  [134721]<P>

<a name="01030w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The timetables for the submission of outline business cases (and initial strategic outline cases for major schemes) are decided on a case by case basis by National Health Service Executive regional offices. If approved to test for funding options (public capital or the private finance initiative) then NHS guidance gives indicative timetables for major and non-major schemes for the preparation and approval of the full business case.

<P>
<a name="01030w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Draft new guidance on planning services for vulnerable children was issued for consultation in April 2000. The broad thrust of the guidance that planning for vulnerable children should be conducted by the whole Council with Health and other partners was welcomed. We are now working with the Children and Young People's Unit and others to produce non-statutory "good practice" guidance on planning children's services as soon as possible.

<P>
<a name="01030w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We expect that National Health Service employers will be exempt from the requirement to provide Stakeholder Pensions. The NHS already has an excellent occupational pension scheme. However, scheme members, earning &#163;30,000 or less, will be eligible to make concurrent contributions to both the NHS pension scheme

 At the moment, information on which hospitals in England have eliminated mixed sex accommodation is not available, as data are collected on a health authority basis. However, the National Health Service Executive is currently undertaking a monitoring exercise to find out which NHS trusts have achieved our objectives in this area and what remains to be done in those places which have not. The results of the monitoring results will be available in due course.

<P>
<a name="01030w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Each hospital development is unique, reflecting local requirements and circumstances. We are therefore unable to give an average overall cost. The capital value would be dependent on many factors, such as location, with the land and construction costs varying considerably, with inner London prices at over 25 per cent. higher than in many other parts of the country. Other factors include the geography and nature of the site chosen, and whether it is new build on an existing hospital site, a greenfield site or a major refurbishment project.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the reduction of burdens on other parts of the National Health Service since the introduction of National Health Service Direct.  [134958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w08.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 NHS Direct has not been set up to merely reduce demand on other health services. It is about making sure that patients get to the right service at the right time, and giving people re-assuring clinical advice so that they can look after themselves if that is the appropriate thing to do.
<P>

<a name="01030w08.html_para1">Sheffield University's 2nd independent report on NHS Direct reconfirmed the levels of patient satisfaction and suggested that the introduction of NHS Direct was associated with halting an upward trend in demand for out-of-hours general practice.
<P>

<a name="01030w08.html_para2">Data from those NHS Direct sites that handle calls on behalf of a general practitioner co-operatives also show that NHS Direct has been able to reduce demand on out-of-hours services. NHS Direct routinely handles 50 per cent. of calls to GP Co-operatives without the need to refer patients to the out-of-hours doctor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Feeding Stuffs Regulations 2000 for England have been made and came into force on 29 October 2000. The Regulations incorporate a number of European Commission Directives covering the labelling of feed materials and feed additives and improved procedures for the authorisation of new additives. The status of additives, such as vitamins and trace elements, used outside of feeding stuffs has not been changed by this legislation. Discussions are currently taking place with the European Commission on the best way to control this long standing practice, which occurs in all member states, without adversely affecting the welfare of farm animals.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> Worcestershire Health Authority, Acute Trust and Social Services Department are working hard to address any potential risks to hospital services arising from the social services overspend.
<P>

<a name="01030w08.html_para3">The acute trust has reported that there are currently fewer patients awaiting discharge than earlier in the year as a result of improved use of community beds and social services support. Health and social services are working together on any residual risk to ensure their winter plans meet demand over the winter. Social services have reinstated a number of care packages for the elderly.
<P>

<a name="01030w08.html_para4">&#163;1 million was transferred from county council to the adult services budget following committee approval in September, to reduce hospital delayed transfers. Additional winter funding of &#163;550,000 has been allocated to Worcestershire Health Authority, and is also targeted at delayed transfers.

<a name="01030w09.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 A review of cancer research priorities undertaken by the Department in 1999 identified support for the infrastructure for clinical cancer research as the highest priority. We responded to this need in The National Health Service Plan by committing funds for development of a NHS Cancer Research Network (NCRN) across England. By 2003 we will be investing an additional &#163;20 million each year in this new initiative.
<P>

<a name="01030w09.html_para0">The NCRN will provide a world class infrastructure for the conduct of clinical trials and other well designed research. Its initial aim is to double the total proportion of adult cancer patients entering trials within three years. It will be a managed research network mapping onto the cancer service networks across the country. It will provide dedicated research nurses, data managers, medical staff sessions and information systems needed for high quality clinical research, together with research support for radiology, pathology, pharmacy and radiotherapy. The quality, speed and co-ordination of clinical research will be enhanced and research will be better integrated with cancer care.
<P>

<a name="01030w09.html_para1">The first step in establishing the NCRN is to commission a Co-ordinating Centre. This process is well advanced and we hope to make an announcement soon.

[135798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w09.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The National Health Service Plan and the NHS prostate cancer programme outline our policy of a progressive increase in the resources from the Department devoted to prostate cancer. This will result in the expenditure this year of &#163;1.2 million rising to &#163;4.2 million in 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="01030w09.html_para2">This year we are investing in a study of the most effective treatment of patients who are screening test positive, a new method of diagnosis and treatment of early prostate cancer, a collection of 300 prostate cancer tumour samples as source material for researchers and a study of the current extent of screening in the United Kingdom. The next meeting of the Cancer Research Funders Forum will discuss the creation of centres of excellence for prostate cancer research in which the Department is ready to invest. The Medical Research Council is currently considering a proposal for a trial of prostate cancer screening and we will know the outcome in four to six weeks. The benefits of all this research and any policies that develop from it will be available to everyone in England.

<a name="01030w09.html_para3">The circular asks chief executives to ensure that appropriate resuscitation policies--which respects patients' rights--are in place, understood by all relevant staff, accessible to those who need them, and that such policies are subject to appropriate audit and monitoring arrangements.

 Waiting list statistics are not recorded by specific clinical condition, rather by specialty. It is therefore not feasible to produce statistics for operations to remove tumours. Depending on the nature of the tumour (malignant/benign), the location of the tumour and the size of the tumour, the clinical priority on the waiting list for that patient can be different, with urgent cases treated before non-urgent.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2000]:</i> My noble Friend, The Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, explained to my hon. Friend on 25 July that we fully support the need to raise public awareness of the benefits of animal testing. The Medical Research Council has recently published a booklet, "Mice and Medicine", on animal experiments and medical advances, copies of which are available in the Library. The joint industry/Government Pharmaceutical Industry Competitiveness Task Force is also considering the wider issue as part of its work on animal research. We also will be examining what enhanced role patient groups can play in raising public awareness in this area.

Such a system would require an amendment to European law and, even if permitted, there will not be the space on most labels to explain the necessity for animal testing in the interests of protection of public health.

 The basis for the Department's calculation of tariff income in the income-related benefits, with a system of graduated deductions between lower and higher limits, was established with the introduction of Income Support in 1988. It was not intended to represent any return that could be obtained from investing capital and hence is not based on any particular rate of return.

 We are determined to drive up the standards of Housing Benefit administration and have introduced a number of initiatives, like Best Value and the Verification Framework, which are designed to promote improved performance. We have a number of measures in place to monitor closely the progress authorities are making towards better service delivery.
<P>

<a name="01030w10.html_para0">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate has an ongoing programme of inspection of Housing Benefit administration and reports on the performance of each of the local authorities it inspects. As at 27 October 2000, and since its inception in 1998, the Inspectorate has completed and published reports of 72 inspections. A further 47 inspections are in progress or planned.
<P>

<a name="01030w10.html_para1">With the introduction of Best Value, from April this year, the Inspectorate will also carry out inspections which will consider whether local authorities are complying with the requirements of the Best Value framework. In addition, a number of Best Value performance indicators relating to Housing Benefit have been introduced. These will allow us to assess how well authorities are carrying out their benefit administration and whether they are delivering the continuous improvement which Best Value requires.
<P>

<a name="01030w10.html_para2">Best Value also requires each local authority to publish an annual performance plan in which they must set themselves realistic, but challenging, targets for improvement. Auditors review whether the plans have been prepared and published in accordance with the statutory guidance and whether the systems in place are adequate for producing accurate information. Where they are concerned about a performance plan, the auditors can recommend that a Best Value inspection is undertaken.

 There are a number of safeguards in place to prevent Housing Benefit from meeting the full contactual rent where it is excessive or includes charges for services that do not relate to the provision of adequate accommodation.

Claims received from those in the private rented sector will generally be referred to the local Rent Officer by the local authority for a rental valuation to determine the Housing Benefit claim.

Other deductions:
<BR>
Excess income: Where a person's income is higher than the applicable amount, benefit is reduced by a fixed taper of 65 pence for every pound of additional income over the applicable amount.
<BR>
Non-Dependant deduction: Deductions in respect of non- dependant members of a tenant's household are made at nationally set standard rates, depending on their age, circumstances and income.

<P>
<a name="01030w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Financial Services Authority continues to monitor "stakeholder friendly" advertisements and reviews the selling of personal pensions as part of its ongoing supervision of firms.

 The Authority currently has a small team working full-time on the registration of stakeholder pension schemes and developing regulatory procedures, together with a number of staff who work partly on the stakeholder pensions project alongside other duties. The Authority has not yet determined how many staff will be employed on stakeholder pensions once schemes begin operating. That will depend on the total number of schemes which are registered, the number of reported breaches, and the approach the Authority decides to take in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities.

 The Stakeholder Pension Scheme Regulations 2000 (SI 1403) require the trustees or managers of schemes to make a written statement at least once a year, describing the scheme's compliance with the regulations which impose limits on the amount of charges and the manner in which charges may be made. Schemes must also appoint a reporting accountant and obtain the reporting accountant's opinion on the statement.

 In 1998-99, 'pensioner households' spent an average of &#163;5.70 a week on petrol, diesel and other motor oils. This represented around 3 per cent. of their disposable income on average. In comparison households where the head was aged under 65 spent an average of &#163;15.50 a week (4 per cent. of disposable income). Therefore the effect of increases in petrol prices would be smaller for pensioners than non-pensioners.
<P>

<a name="01030w11.html_para4">Given that expenditure on petrol, diesel and motor oils represents a small proportion of disposable income for pensioner households, the effect of price increases on living standards would be even smaller.

For the period from 1 April to 1 September this year, 2.2 per cent. of the armed forces intake from the British labour market came from the British ethnic minority communities. Although short of the 4 per cent. goal, the figure represents an improvement on achievement levels for the corresponding period for

the last financial year, which stood at about 1.8 per cent. If this improvement continues for the rest of the financial year, it would indicate that ethnic minority recruitment into the armed forces is moving in the right direction.

 The UK worked closely with the UN Secretary-General's expert panel during the preparation of the recently published Brahimi Report on reforming UN Peace Operations. Key proposals in the Report aimed at strengthening the UN's defence capability include enhancing early warning mechanisms and information analysis; creating integrated teams for the planning and execution of peacekeeping missions; and improving deployment times and the training and equipping of troops. The Report recommends many of the reforms for which we have argued for some years. They will be of vital importance for all UN deployments including those involving British troops.

These bombs will make use of Global Positioning System technology to strike targets accurately in all weather conditions and are expected to be in service with RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft by October next year. This capability will be supplemented by an additional all weather precision guided bombing system that we are currently planning to introduce in 2006.

 It is the Ministry of Defence's policy that all service personnel should be up to date with routine vaccinations and that members of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces should be up to date with certain additional vaccinations, depending on their degree of readiness. Personnel deploying to high risk areas should receive further vaccinations specific to the risks they face. Other aspects of medical preparedness will depend on the role of the deploying forces and the geographical location to which they are deploying. The role of commanding officers in maintaining medical and other aspects of preparedness of their personnel for military operations has recently been emphasised through the chain of command.

 It is vital that our Armed Forces are properly equipped and we are determined to ensure that the right equipment is available at the right time.

 Although the Education Act 1996 requires a local education authority to specify the special educational provision for a child, it does not require a local education authority to detail that provision in terms of hours of support. Where parents disagree with the wording or provision set out in their child's statement of special educational needs, it is open for them to appeal to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal. Where parents have complaints about the delivery of their child's provision, they may ask the Secretary of State to intervene. He will consider what action is appropriate in each case.

 Citizenship education will be subject to the same requirements of political impartiality as other areas of the curriculum. There are safeguards in law to guard against biased or unbalanced teaching. Local education authorities, governing bodies and head teachers are required under Section 407 of the Education Act 1996 to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that where political issues are brought to the attention of pupils, they are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views. The introduction of citizenship was proposed by the Citizenship Education Working Party that included Lord Baker, the former education secretary.

The total amount available, with the assistance of the Government grant (at 75 per cent.), is &#163;22 million a year. The grant is allocated by formula. The grant is to supplement existing expenditure by local education authorities and schools on school security measures. It is for local education authorities to determine local priorities of use of their grant allocation, including distribution to schools and training needs. All maintained schools, including Pupil Referral Units and nursery schools, are eligible to receive funding from the grant.

 Unless the Secretary of State has barred a person from employment as a teacher, it is for the prospective employer to decide on the suitability of an applicant for a teaching post. In reaching those decisions employers will take into account any information about the applicant's previous convictions that is revealed by a criminal record check. The Department's Circular 9/93 (first issued in 1993 and still in effect), which gives guidance about the procedures for obtaining such checks, advises employers that convictions for sexual, violent, or drugs offences will be particularly strong contra- indications for work with children, but that they will also need to consider the age and seriousness of the offence.

<a name="01030w21.html_para1">The Children's Fund will form a major new part of the Government's strategy to tackle child poverty and prevent social exclusion. The Fund will support services to work with children and their families and prevent children and young people falling into drug abuse, truancy, unemployment and crime. It will be worth a total of &#163;450 million over three years.

<a name="01030w21.html_para2">The new interdepartmental Children and Young People's Unit, based in my Department, will run the Children's Fund in England at official level. The Unit's remit will be set by the new Cabinet Ministerial Group on Children and Young People's Services. The Unit will have its own Request for Resources within my Department's Estimate. The Head of the Children and Young People's Unit, once appointed, will be an additional Accounting Officer within my Department. As is usual, the appointment as additional Accounting Officer will be made by the Treasury and a copy of the letter of appointment, setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of the additional Accounting Officer and the Permanent Secretary of the Department for Education and Employment as Principal Accounting Officer, will be sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Clerk of the Committee of Public Accounts.

Friend, as Minister for Young People, will normally answer Parliamentary Questions on the Children's Fund and the Unit in this House, and in the case of Oral Questions will do so during Department for Education and Employment Question Time. The Government expect that the relevant Select Committees will normally wish to invite him to appear when they examine the Children's Fund and the Government's strategy on services to tackle disadvantage among children and young people. My noble Friend Baroness Blackstone will answer for the Government in another place.

<a name="01030w22.html_para4">The advantages of early debt redemption are twofold. First, a mechanism to deal with overhanging debt makes housing transfer a realistic option for a wider range of authorities where investment is most needed. I understand that the total capital investment over the next 30 years in the housing stock transferred by Coventry City Council and Burnley Borough Council is estimated to be over &#163;1 billion. Second, a one-off payment to assist an authority to repay outstanding PWLB loans is simpler--for both local and central government--than the alternative of leaving an authority's Housing Revenue Account open, despite the transfer of stock, and for the Exchequer to subsidise the overhanging debt for many years.

 The Government have always made safety the top priority in the railways. All sections of the industry are under obligations to carry out their operations in a safe manner. We look to the Health and Safety Executive, as the sole regulator for rail safety, to ensure that the railways are operating safely.

<a name="01030w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Recent research at the Hadley Centre, one of the world's leading climate research centres and funded by my Department, has shown that both natural and man made factors have contributed to the global rise in temperature of 0.6 deg C since 1860. The strong warming since the mid 1970s can only be explained by taking into account the effects of human activities on the atmosphere.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> The project already agreed with East Sussex County Council and Brighton and Hove Council will not be affected by the revised criteria for PFI waste schemes announced in News Release 609. The PFI contract will need to contribute towards the overall achievement of the statutory performance standards for recycling of household waste which we announced in Waste Strategy 2000. These will require authorities, on average, to double their recycling in three years and nearly triple it in five years.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> We are currently awaiting the results of the inquiry by the House of Lords Science and Technology Sub-Committee on the aircraft cabin environment.
<P>

<a name="01030w23.html_para0">The focus of existing advice is to inform airline passengers of the possible health risks posed by air travel and to allow them to take any necessary precautions. The "Health Advice for Travellers" booklet, issued by the Department of Health has been recently updated and includes references to the potential health risks of air travel, such as deep vein thrombosis. Approximately 12 million copies of this booklet are printed and made available to long and short haul travellers each year, usually through post offices, and it is also available on the internet and on CEEFAX.

 In the light of evidence given during the House of Lords Science and Technology Sub-Committee on the aircraft cabin environment, we have commissioned an independent study on passenger health on board aircraft.

<P>
<a name="01030w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK already has an airworthiness requirement for minimum seat space, and is unique in this respect. The Civil Aviation Authority which is responsible for the safety regulation of UK registered passenger aircraft, has set standards for seat spacing on UK registered aircraft since 1989. There is also a limit on the number of seats in each row which determines the minimum width of seats.

<a name="01030w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Since 1993 the EU has introduced, a series of increasingly stringent emissions standards for new road vehicles. Further tightening will take effect in 2001 and 2006. EU Directive 98/70/EC requires petrol and diesel fuels to meet cleaner specifications from 1 January 2000. Further reductions in permitted sulphur and aromatics content in petrol and sulphur content in diesel will apply from 2005. Taken together these measures will have a significant role in helping us to meet our national air quality objectives and our legal obligations under the various EU Air Quality Directives.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 3: "Housing" and Circular 6/98 "Planning and Affordable Housing" provide detailed guidance to local planning authorities on formulating development plan policies on affordable housing. While planning policy should not be expressed in favour of any particular form of tenure, the particular amount and type of affordable housing to be provided in individual developments will be for the local authority to decide based on their own assessment of local needs, and in negotiation with

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what measures his Department has taken to assist the introduction of barriers to reduce traffic noise;  [135148]
<P>
<UL>(2) what actions his Department has taken to introduce noise attenuation methods where traffic is concerned.  [135146]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 One of the main methods of mitigating and attenuating traffic noise is to reduce the noise emitted by new vehicles. The Department has a continuing involvement in negotiating EU directives in this area. These measures have already delivered a substantial reduction in noise levels from new vehicles. A large lorry today makes no more noise than a car of the early 1970s and three modern cars now make less noise than one 1970s model. These measures will bring improvements as the vehicle fleet is renewed. Negotiations on further noise reduction are likely to focus on heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses.
<P>

<a name="01030w24.html_para2">In addition the Department has recently been involved in negotiating an EU directive to limit tyre noise, the dominant source of noise from traffic at speeds above 40 miles per hour. This directive is expected to be adopted shortly.
<P>

<a name="01030w24.html_para3">&#163;5 million a year ring-fenced budget is being spent to mitigate and attenuate noise, primarily using barriers, at locations on the national network where detailed studies have confirmed the severity of the problem and shown that barriers are the most effective solution in the short term. As indicated in my reply to my hon. Friend on 6 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 427W, studies have been commissioned at a large number of locations. The Highways Agency will be dealing with nearly all of these locations over the next few years. In a number of cases where the road has been reassessed for resurfacing, the use of quieter materials has affected the priority for other measures.

 An Integrated Transport White Paper explained that we need to gain a better understanding of the effects of transport noise and expect advances in technology to provide some reductions in the impact of noise from road traffic. It is for local authorities to decide what further measures would be appropriate on their roads. My policies as highway authority for the strategic national road network were set out in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads" which was published along with the White Paper in July 1998. This states that quieter surfaces are to be used for all new trunk road schemes and resurfacing existing roads in an area where noise was a matter of concern. The Ten Year Plan for Transport, published in July, should enable the Highways Agency to install by 2011 quieter surfaces on over 60 per cent. of the national road network including all concrete stretches. In addition, funds are to be ring-fenced to permit the Highways Agency to provide over the next ten years other measures such as noise barriers in some of the worst and most pressing cases where there is no immediate need for the road to be resurfaced.

We will now consider the proposals put forward by the Group, the comments made on them and all other suggestions made in the course of the review.

 My letter of 15 October 1999 was an informal request to chief executives and local authorities asking whether there was anything to be learned from their experiences in using provisions contained in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and whether any good practice could be shared. I would not normally place copies of routine correspondence of this sort in the Library. As a result of that correspondence the Home Office and the Local Government Association jointly held 10 regional seminars to help spread good practice in using anti-social behaviour orders. The seminars also served as a consultation exercise for the issue of a model agreement, or protocol, for effective local co-operation in tackling anti-social behaviour. I launched this guidance on 28 June. Both the guidance and the seminars were well received, and indicated a widespread willingness to use anti-social behaviour orders.

<a name="01030w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has, by way of its Protocols to the Treaty establishing the European Community, reserved the right not to be bound by Community law unless it decides to opt into the adoption of measures falling within Title IV of the Treaty (visas, asylum and immigration). We have indicated our general intention to participate in all measures which do not adversely affect the United Kingdom's ability to maintain our frontier and immigration controls.
<P>

<a name="01030w28.html_para0">On 12 March 1999, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced the basis on which the United Kingdom would participate in the adoption of measures under Title IV. On that basis, the United Kingdom has opted into: the Eurodac Regulation, setting up the exchange of fingerprints of asylum seekers and some illegal entrants; the draft temporary protection Directive; the negotiating mandate for an agreement with Norway and Iceland parallel to the Dublin Convention; the Council Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund; and measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and trafficking. The latter measures include: a draft Council Directive defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence; and a draft Council Directive about harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers transporting into the territory of the member states third-country nationals not having the documents necessary for admission.
<P>

<a name="01030w28.html_para1">Article 67 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community provides that, during a transitional period of five years following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council of Ministers shall act unanimously on measures adopted under Title IV.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the use of armed police officers on foot patrols; whether police authorities have to be consulted before armed police are used on routine patrols; how many forces use armed police officers for routine patrols; what assessment has been made by his Department of the effectiveness of the use of armed patrol officers; what guidance has been issued by <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Association of Chief Police Officers; and if he will make a statement.  [135807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The issue and use of firearms is an operational decision for chief officers of police, working within the legal framework and operational guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers. (The guidance has not been published as it could be of assistance to armed criminals.) Firearms operations do not require the agreement of Police Authorities. The Home Office monitors the police use of firearms through annual statistical returns, which are published. The guidance does not permit the use of armed officers on routine foot patrols as opposed to specific operations, and there has therefore been no assessment of effectiveness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01030w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The number of self-inflicted deaths in prison in England and Wales has risen in the last five years from 64 in 1996 to 91 in 1999 (116 and 91 per 100,000 respectively). The current figure for this year is 72. Total incidents of self-harm have risen from 6,670 in 1995-96 to 7,397 in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="01030w29.html_para2">The majority of these deaths occurred in local prisons among prisoners who are unsentenced and within the first two months in custody. Other particularly vulnerable groups of prisoners are those who have previously suffered from mental health problems or from drug/ alcohol abuse.
<P>

<a name="01030w29.html_para3">The number of self-inflicted deaths among women prisoners and young offenders are relatively low, but are rising this year. Rates of self-harm among women and young offenders are higher than adult male prisoners. Many of those who self-harm experienced similar problems to those who took their own lives.
<P>

<a name="01030w29.html_para4">These trends reinforce the need to give a high priority to measures to combat the incidence of suicide and self-harm. The Prison Service is reviewing its suicide/ self-harm prevention strategy and will report to Ministers shortly.

<a name="01030w29.html_spnew8"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 On the progress of applications, the British Broadcasting Corporation has reported that, by 20 October 2000, TV Licensing had received 3 million applications for free licences. Of these, 220,000 are not yet eligible. All the complete, and accurate, applications made before the 1 October 2000 closing date will result in a licence being issued by early November. People aged 75 or over who are currently beneficiaries of the &#163;5 Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) licence will receive a free licence when their "scheme" television licence next falls to be renewed.
<P>

Each applicant will be issued a receipt by the Post Office as evidence of their application in the period before they receive a free licence.

<a name="01030w29.html_para11">Applicants who have been asked for further information have been urged to respond quickly, as TV Licensing is unable to proceed further without a reply. Applications which raise problems, such as illegible contact information and current television licences having been cancelled since applying, will be processed as quickly as possible, though this may take until the middle or end of November. The BBC estimates these are about 2 per cent. of the total so far received.
<P>

end of November. Similarly, applications received between 1 and 30 November 2000 will result in a licence being issued at the end of December.
<P>

<a name="01030w29.html_para13">On the timetable for issuing licences and refunds, the BBC has said that the mailing of the free licences, and any refunds associated with unused portions of a previous licence, started on 23 October 2000. In order to manage the response to the licence mailing, which inevitably includes people telephoning TV Licensing with queries and changes of address, the licences are being mailed in the following volumes:

<a name="01030w29.html_para18">The licences are being sent out using Mailsort 2 (the equivalent of 2nd class post) with Royal Mail, and so will arrive with the applicant between two and four days after posting. The majority of licences will, therefore, reach applicants between 25 October and 6 November 2000. The number of licences still to be sent in November could be as high as 430,000 depending on the level, timeliness and accuracy of the responses from applicants. These will be sent out at an even rate through the remainder of the month.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> My Department has received a number of representations from members of the visitor attraction industry concerning this issue. The National Lottery Act 1998 requires distributors to submit strategic plans; this helps to ensure that Lottery funding responds to need and that recipients complement existing attractions rather than compete with them.

 There has been no formal assessment of the extent of the use of steroids in competitive sport in the United Kingdom. The UK Sport Testing Programme focuses on elite competitive sports. While this programme includes tests for anabolic agents (including anabolic steroids), its findings may include UK and non-UK athletes.
<P>

<a name="01030w31.html_para1">The most recent research undertaken into the use of steroids in the UK was published in 1993 and indicated that 35 per cent. of athletes attending weight training gymnasiums were found to be using anabolic steroids. This Government firmly believe that there is no place for drugs in sport and we will continue to work through UK Sport and the national governing bodies of sport to reduce doping in sport through the implementation of an effective testing programme and a comprehensive education programme.

 None. Under the United Kingdom's arrangements for broadcasting, it is the responsibility of broadcasters and broadcasting regulators to set and enforce standards.
