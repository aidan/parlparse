 The mobile telecommunications and health research programme reports progress at open seminars each year. The majority of projects are due to be completed in time for the annual seminar in November 2005. The remaining projects may take up to three years longer depending on their complexity. Most of the studies are concerned with mobile phones rather than base stations (masts) although there is one volunteer study looking specifically at base station exposures. Further details of these projects can be found on the website www.mthr.org.uk.

<a name="40420w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Smoking</h3>





<p><a name="40420w01.html_wqn3"><b> Sandra Gidley:  </b> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what programmes he has in place to encourage smoking cessation among the over-60s.  [166010]</p>








<p><a name="40420w01.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </b> 
Our comprehensive tobacco control programme is aimed at all age groups, to reduce the numbers starting to smoke and to encourage those who smoke to stop. National Health Service stop smoking services are in place across the country to support smokers who want to quit. The services welcome people of all ages, and are widely available and accessible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para2">
Standard 8 of the national service framework for older people provides a continuing commitment to the health and well being of older people. An increase in access to local NHS stop smoking services is one important component in extending healthy life expectancy in older people.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Apr 2004 : Column 411W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para3">
Between April and September 2003 over 23,300 smokers aged 60 or over set a date to quit smoking with the help of NHS stop smoking services and nearly 14,800 reported that they had successfully quit four weeks later. This means that an encouraging 63 per cent. in this age group were successful in quitting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has for the future of the Edward Jenner Institute at Compton; and what funding he as allocated to the institute for future years.  [162227]</p>








<p><a name="40420w01.html_spnew4"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 March 2004]: </i>The Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research (EJIVR) was established in 1995 to develop programmes in basic research relevant to human and animal vaccines. GlaxoSmithKline, the Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Department of Health contributed a total of &#163;6 million per annum to establish and fund the EJIVR for an initial 10 year research programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para4">
The four sponsors remain committed to supporting basic and applied vaccine research through to the end of the current term in October 2005. However, they have agreed that the existing joint funding model for the EJIVR is not the best way forward beyond 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para5">
The sponsors are working actively with the board of the EJIVR to progress vaccine research beyond October 2005. The sponsors have recently completed a scientific review of the EJIVR&#039;s research programmes. The outcomes from this are assisting the board in its development of future plans to build on the best programmes, scientifically and strategically. Until the board&#039;s plans have progressed further, it is not possible to be more specific about the future.

<a name="40420w01.html_sbhd6"><h3 align=center>Working Time Directive</h3>





<p><a name="40420w01.html_wqn6"><b> Dr. Murrison:  </b> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the costs of implementing the European Working Time Directive in&nbsp;<i>(a) </i> money terms, <i>(b) </i>extra doctors required and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Apr 2004 : Column 412W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>(c)&nbsp;</i>other extra NHS staff required for (i) August 2004 and (ii) 2009; and what methodology he used to calculate those figures.  [164568]</p>








<p><a name="40420w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hutton  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 30 March 2004]: </i>The Working Time Directive (WTD) is an integral part of modernising and improving services. The National Health Service has been aware of the implications of implementing the WTD for doctors in training since 2000, and planning for it forms part of overall NHS planning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para7">
In the United Kingdom&#039;s response to the European Commission&#039;s questionnaire on working time, which was completed in February, we stated that in the UK the NHS would need to recruit several thousand extra middle grade doctors by August 2004 to achieve compliance with the re-interpreted Working Time Directive, while simultaneously maintaining current levels of service provision and retaining similar working practices as now. The cost of recruiting the extra middle grade doctors would run to hundreds of millions of pounds per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w01.html_para8">
However, this is not a realistic scenario. Even if this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of additional doctors were available, implementing the directive in this way would be very inefficient. As stated in our recent response to the EC&#039;s communication on working time, solutions need to include alternative ways of working that are already being piloted in the NHS, such as substituting non-medical practitioners where possible, instituting new forms of multidisciplinary team working, or redesigning services in some areas. There is no &#039;one size fits all&#039; solution and ways of becoming WTD compliant will vary between trusts. Actual costs or numbers of additional staff required are not held centrally and could not in any case be disaggregated from the overall cost of NHS growth and modernisation.

The use of donor eggs in treatment in the United Kingdom is subject to the provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).

Details of research projects relating to beta thalassaemia major funded by, or of interest to, the National Health Service are available on the National Research Register (NRR) at www.update-software.com/national. The NRR currently contains details of around 20 on-going or completed projects with a specific focus on beta thalassaemia, in addition to a larger number of projects covering a wider range of haemoglobinopathies. Many of these projects are funded through allocations made annually to NHS providers for research to meet the priorities and needs of the NHS and to meet the costs to the NHS of hosting research supported by external funders. The total amount allocated to NHS providers in 2003&#150;04 for research and development was &#163;442 million.

The Medical Research Council (MRC) has a long history of research into the causes and treatment of thalassaemia. Since 1980, the MRC molecular haematology unit in Oxford has undertaken both basic research into the process by which multipotential haemopoietic stem cells differentiate into the highly specialised cells found in blood, and also more applied research into how these processes are perturbed in inherited and acquired human genetic disesases (e.g. thalassaemia). The unit has an annual budget of over &#163;2&nbsp;million. The MRC also supports two grants in this area.

<p><a name="40420w03.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </b> 
The Government supported the 2002 MORI poll because it provided data on public attitudes to inform development of Government policy relating to the use of animals in medical research.

<p><a name="40420w05.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The National Blood Service (NBS) has produced two leaflets for donors giving them more information about the new donor exclusion criteria. The first leaflet is entitled <i>Variant CJD and blood donation</i> and is a general information leaflet for donors. The second leaflet, entitled <i>Keeping things safe</i>, is for those donors who have received blood since 1 January 1980 in the United Kingdom and can therefore no longer give blood. Copies of these leaflets can be obtained from the NBS website at www.blood.co.uk or from the NBS helpline. Donors will also receive an information leaflet entitled <i>A change to the rules for blood donors</i> with their invitation letter to give blood.
</p>


<p>

The NBS has run some press advertising in national newspapers in early April. These adverts addressed why this change is happening, what the risks are and how people can help.

<p><a name="40420w05.html_spnew4"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </b> 
The new donor exclusion criteria will apply to anyone who has received a blood transfusion since January 1980. This is because there is still a risk that the person from whom the recipient received the blood may have been exposed to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease by dietary exposure.

None. The Government set up the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (chaired by Sir William Stewart) to consider the health effects of mobile phones, base stations and transmitters. They conducted a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of existing research and gathered a wide range of views and published their report in May 2000. In respect of base stations, the report concludes that &quot;the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of the guidelines&quot;. However, gaps in scientific knowledge led Stewart to recommend a precautionary approach comprising a series of specific measures. The Government accepted the recommended precautionary approach and is taking forward a range of precautionary actions. These include ensuring all base stations meet the international guidelines on public exposure set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w07.html_para0">
Following a request to the NRPB by the Home Office, the issue of possible health effects caused by signals from TETRA base stations was comprehensively addressed in a report by NRPB&#039;s independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR), chaired by Sir Richard Doll. The report on <i>Possible Health Effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) </i>was published in 2002 in the Documents of NRPB (Volume 12 No 2, 2001) and is also available on the NRPB web site: www.nrpb.org.

It is also an offence to incite another person to commit a criminal offence. While it might not be possible to take action against a foreign-based internet service provider for disseminating the incitement, that would not in itself prevent prosecution of a person in this country who had been responsible for the content of the website. There is, of course, a question about what constitutes incitement. Publishing information such as names and addresses of those belonging to an identified organisation or espousing a particular view may not necessarily be enough in itself to constitute incitement but it is for the police and prosecutors to decide in all the circumstances of a particular case and on the available evidence whether an offence has been committed.

The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 makes provision that a person may be guilty of an offence if he engages in a course of conduct which he knows or ought to know causes harassment.

The Act also provides, as a civil remedy, the opportunity to apply to the High Court for an injunction. Victims of harassment by animal rights extremists have successfully used the Act to secure orders which, among other things, have required the removal of their personal details from websites. In these cases however acts of harassment beyond identifying persons on a website were proved.

<p>
<a name="40420w07.html_para5">
The internet service provider industry itself is sometimes able and willing to refuse to carry objectionable material on websites. In the UK, most service providers have acceptable use policies, under which they reserve the right to remove a customer&#039;s material, or refuse to carry it, not only if it is illegal but also in certain other circumstances, which can include where material causes concern or needless anxiety to others or publishes details of individuals without their consent. The UK&#039;s Internet Watch Foundation encourages service providers to refuse to handle sites which violate their acceptable use policies. The great majority of UK service providers operate responsibly. The government has also discussed with other governments how we can co-operate to tackle this problem, given that it raises issues of cross-national jurisdication.

The main reasons are that the proposed development is situated within 22km and in line of sight of the Air Traffic Radar at RAF Coltishall and within 16km and line of sight of the radar at RAF Honington. The blades of wind turbines can produce false returns or mask the detection of flying aircraft. It is the view of our specialist technical advisers, who have considered the proposal,

The Highways Agency is keeping in touch with developments in Europe on work on noise absorbing concrete.

Initial trials in European countries of a new

The planning permission granted in April 2003 limits the number of air cargo movements per annum to 2,738 from the opening of the airport, rising to a maximum of 4,140 movements per annum after 1 January 2012. I understand that, within these limits, the airport operator hopes to handle around 50,000 tonnes of freight a year by 2014. A small component of this could be in the bellyhold of passenger aircaft.

<p><a name="40420w16.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 19 April 2004]: </i>The B30 facility at Sellafield was commissioned in 1959&#150;60 for interim storage of spent Magnox fuel in water-filled concrete ponds and the subsequent removal of cladding from the fuel prior to it being reprocessed. The facility stopped receiving spent fuel during 1992. The B30 pond contains many tonnes of Magnox fuel and sludge from corrosion of the Magnox fuel cladding and the fuel. For security reasons it would not be appropriate to reveal itemised information on the quantities of nuclear material held in specific locations (Exemption 1, code of practice on access to Government information).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w16.html_para2">
The condition of the material in B30 and the need to minimise radiation exposure means that the activities that can be performed at present to verify current quantities of material (including in the course Euratom safeguards inspections) are limited. Appropriate measurement and verification of the material will however take place as material is removed during the decommissioning of B30.

Because of the large number of different organisations involved in awarding reconstruction contracts in Iraq, it has not been possible to maintain an overall picture of the total volume of contracts awarded or the cumulative total. In addition, there is no central organisation that collects, collates and publishes such information. However, a number of British companies have been awarded contracts and sub-contracts for the reconstruction process in Iraq, including the recent awards announced by the Program Management Office (PMO). UK companies (mainly in Joint Venture with US partners) have won PMO contracts in the Electricity, Water and Oil sectors.

 Barclays Bank&#039;s latest survey of business creation, published on 31 March 2004, includes non-VAT registered firms, and shows that there were 115,000 business start-ups in England and Wales, including 500 in Sefton local authority (in which Crosby is a constituency) in the fourth quarter of 2003.

<p>
<a name="40420w17.html_para0">
There were 5,380 businesses registered for VAT in Sefton local authority at the end of 2002. This represents a 7 per cent increase since the start of 1997 when there were 5,040 VAT-registered businesses. VAT registration data for the end of 2003 will be available in Autumn 2004.

It is important to note that VAT registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

<a name="40420w19.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>School Closures</h3>





<p><a name="40420w19.html_wqn0"><b> David Hamilton:  </b> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, what criteria are applied when making decisions on closing <i>(a)</i> rural schools and <i>(b)</i> urban schools. [165587]</p>








<p><a name="40420w19.html_spnew0"><b> Stephen Twigg  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 19 April 2004]: </i>Under arrangements for local decision making School Organisation Committees and schools adjudicators must consider guidance issued by the Secretary of State when taking decisions on statutory proposals to close any school&#151;rural or urban.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para0">
The guidance emphasises that all proposals must be considered on their individual merit and in the light of local circumstances. It also provides a list of factors that must be considered. For school closures this includes: the impact on standards of provision in the area, the supply and demand for places, the cost effectiveness of proposals, the views of interested parties, the journey to alternative provision, the effect on the local community etc. The guidance also includes a presumption to approve proposals to close a failing school if there is to be a fresh start school established in its place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para1">
For proposals to close rural schools there is a presumption against the closure except where the case is strong and in the best interests of provision in the area. The guidance recommends that the transport implications of rural school closures should be considered and the overall effect on the community of closure of village schools. It also advises that the new provisions for federated and extended schools should be considered to increase the viability of rural schools before closure proposals are brought forward. There are no specific factors that apply to the consideration of urban school closures. More information can be found on the Department&#039;s School Organisation Website www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolorg.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many <i>(a)</i> teachers and <i>(b)</i> families in Birkenhead have benefited from the Computers within Reach programme. [166323]</p>








<p><a name="40420w19.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke:  </b> 
The Computers Within Reach scheme closed on 31 October 2001 having delivered over 24,000 recycled computers to people in 22 pilot areas, at a cost of &#163;7.1 million over two years. Those eligible were in receipt of certain working age benefits or a State Pension with minimum income guarantee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para2">
At the same time as funding was made available for the Computers within Reach scheme, funding was also provided for the Computers for Teachers programme. For teachers who met certain criteria, this programme subsidised the cost of a computer. It was subsequently replaced by the current Laptops for Teachers scheme which dispensed with subsidies, and through which sufficient funding will be provided to enable two-thirds of teachers to receive a laptop by March 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para3">
Of the 24,000 computers delivered through the Computers within Reach scheme, approximately 3,000 were for people in the Liverpool area, including those in and around Birkenhead.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to update computer <i>(a)</i> hardware and <i>(b)</i> software standard packages used in his Department. [166373]</p>








<p><a name="40420w19.html_spnew3"><b> Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 We have no plans this year to make major replacements or upgrades to the Department&#039;s hardware base which is perfectly adequate for the current level of IT in use. Over the near to medium term, we expect the percentage of laptops in use by Departmental staff to increase as remote working facilities improve and the Department encourages increased flexibility of working patterns and closer working relationships across the education sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para4">
The Department used predominantly Microsoft technology for its PC and back-office systems supplemented by &quot;best of breed&quot; technology for specific business critical activities. We have no plans to proactively update either our PC or server software this year although we do plan to introduce an improved email system (based on Microsoft&#039;s Exchange 2003), an integrated Human Resource and Payroll system, a Department-level accounting system and an Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) which will help us make better informed policy and allow us to respond positively to the Freedom of Information Act.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, if he will make a statement on the effects on schools of changes since 1997 in the level of investment in school sports in Birkenhead. [166296]</p>








<p><a name="40420w19.html_spnew4"><b> Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The Government is investing more than &#163;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help to deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with

</p>


<p>
<a name="40420w19.html_para5">
The Department is providing &#163;1,376,176 to support the delivery of three School Sport Partnerships in the Wirrall LEA area. The partnerships include 14 secondary and 70 primary schools and provide enhanced sport opportunities for all young people. Furthermore, the New Opportunities Fund has allocated &#163;4,448,000 to specifically enhance PE and school sport facilities in the Wirral LEA area.

 The only publicly funded institution providing higher education in Birkenhead is Wirral Metropolitan College.

The table shows the schools in the Birkenhead constituency that benefited from investment through the New Deal for Schools (NDS) programme, which commenced in 1997&#150;98. From 2000&#150;01, capital allocations to local authorities and schools have largely been made by formulae linked to asset management plans. In addition, all schools have, since 2000&#150;01, received Devolved Formula capital to use on their most urgent capital needs.

 My right hon. Friend has no present plans to take such measures. However, the Government has already taken action to improve the quality and reliability of supply teachers. A package of self-study materials was launched in June 2002 specifically for supply teachers. In addition, my Department&#039;s Quality mark scheme requires that teachers being offered to schools by agencies and Local Education Authorities have been interviewed and their references checked. I plan to write to schools soon recommending that they use Quality Mark holders for fulfilling their supply needs wherever possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many temporary or demountable classrooms in the Colchester Parliamentary constituency have been replaced with permanent accommodation since May 1997; and if he will make a statement. [165328]</p>








<p><a name="40420w21.html_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson:  </b> 
The Department does not hold data on the replacement of temporary classrooms since 1997. This Government has increased its support for capital investment in schools from under &#163;700 million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;3.8 billion this year and this will increase further to over &#163;5 billion by 2005&#150;06. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to Authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Prioritisation of need is through asset management planning, which should be an open, rigorous and consultative process, based on a survey of the needs of all schools. Modern, high-quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short-term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short-term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.

The majority of the Department&#039;s school capital investment is allocated to schools and Local Education Authorities (LEAs) by formula, and they decide how best to invest it in line with their asset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management plans. We do not stipulate how LEAs should split this investment between primary and secondary schools and we do not, therefore, have detailed information about all capital investment spent on secondary schools. This information should be held&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locally. The total capital investment available for all schools amounted to &#163;3.8 billion in 2003&#150;04, and we have indicated that this will rise to &#163;4.5 billion and &#163;5.1&nbsp;billion in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 respectively.

All of the Department&#039;s post-16 learning and skills sector capital investment is allocated to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).

This comprises capital funding for the further education and Adult and Community Learning sectors. It includes funding to develop the Information and Learning Technology infrastructure; to develop Centres of Vocational Excellence; and to support the Neighbourhood Learning in Deprived Communities programme. The Department does not provide a specific budget to the LSC for rebuilding and refurbishing property in further education colleges.
