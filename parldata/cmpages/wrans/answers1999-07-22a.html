To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what discussions he has held with the Energy Regulator on <i>(a)</i> two-way net metering and <i>(b)</i> industry charging and remuneration policy for photovoltaic installations.  [91448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Both issues are important in securing our objective that renewables and other forms of embedded generation can compete, in the long term, on equal terms with other forms of generation. The consultation paper "New and Renewable Energy--Prospects for the 21st Century", which I published on 30 March, invited comments on the issues surrounding the connection of embedded renewable generators to the electricity system. I am grateful to all those who responded.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para0">I am currently considering the various responses to the consultation paper which have been received and will make an announcement in due course. I will continue to discuss the issues arising with the electricity companies when I meet them. Metering is an essential component of a competitive market. The Government would like to see the full value of exported electricity being offered to consumers in order to encourage the uptake of photovoltaic installations in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what new techniques, skills and strategies are being developed to manage more efficiently and effectively the liabilities of BNFL.  [92053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 BNFL has established a Liabilities Management Unit to reinforce the strategic management of its liabilities. The key tasks are to provide assurance that liabilities are fully identified and quantified, and to provide value for money and continuous improvement in how the liabilities are discharged, drawing on the expertise of BNFL's Research and Technology Group in key technologies and processes. BNFL is also involved with others in the nuclear industry in sharing best practice

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what are his plans to address the problem of the Child Support Agency's backlog of periodical reviews.  [93100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Until December 1998, child support legislation required the Agency to reconsider child support assessments every two years. This process meant gathering all the many pieces of information used to make an assessment afresh. In many cases, parents failed to return review forms or to provide the necessary information and the reviews have become increasingly difficult to complete as time has passed. As a result, there are now some 350,000 outstanding periodical reviews in the Child Support Agency.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para1">To address the backlog of periodic reviews and to release more of the Agency's resources for current work, however, I intend to bring forward legislation as soon as Parliamentary time allows retrospectively to repeal the provisions which govern this process. This will mean that there will no longer be a requirement to complete the outstanding reviews for past periods. However, the Agency will be taking forward a rolling programme over the next two years to review and update assessments from a current date. Where the parent with care is on benefit, this will happen automatically: parents who have applied voluntarily for child support will be offered the opportunity to have the assessment brought up to date. Also, any parent who wants to have the periodical review completed in their case can ask the Child Support Agency to complete this action and this will be done providing the information and evidence necessary to complete the process is supplied.

<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 I have today published the second Benefit Fraud Inspectorate Annual Report.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para2">We published our strategy in March 1999 for tackling fraud and improving security within the DSS and local authorities. We are determined to make sure we get it right from the start. That means delivering an improved secure system including the use of robust checks and safeguards. The BFI is a significant part of our strategy. Their role is to publish reports which support the strategy by helping to raise standards of administration and by contributing to the continuing development of the new strategy.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para3">In this first full year of operation, considerable progress has been made. So far, the BFI has published 23 local authority reports, BA, CSA and CA reports, with a further 46 inspections either ongoing or due to be started by November 1999.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para4">Working in partnership with those they inspect is leading to improvements in benefit administration and counter fraud work standards. The report includes case studies demonstrating the BFI impact on local authorities, such as the introduction of prosecution and security strategies, improved recovery of benefit overpayments and better liaison and exchange of information between BA and local authorities.
<P>

<a name="90722w01.htm_para5">Copies of the published BFI Annual Report are available in the Library. Further copies are available on request.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps he will take to promote higher standards in occupational pension schemes following responses to the consultation on proposals for a Quality in Pensions accreditation scheme.  [93102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have discussed with the pensions industry how best to develop improved standards in pensions. We have concluded we should develop best practice guidelines for occupational schemes that would be made widely available. I am pleased to announce the formation of a working group to take this work forward. The names of the working group members are as given. We have also published today a response to the consultation exercise which provides an analysis of the consultation responses and sets out our proposals for developing the best practice guidelines.

<P>
<a name="90722w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will set out the circumstances in which a full-time carer aged 16 years may receive invalid care allowance, the effect on entitlement of the carer undertaking a course of education, and the role of Benefits Agency staff in assisting such carers.  [91870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Carers aged 16 who care for a severely disabled person for at least 35 hours a week may receive Invalid Care Allowance (ICA), subject to satisfying the other conditions of entitlement. A carer of any age will not be entitled to ICA if they undertake a course of full-time education, which for ICA purposes is defined as 21 hours a week.
<P>

<a name="90722w02.htm_para0">All carers who claim ICA are advised of the outcome of their claim and their right of appeal. In addition, the Benefits Agency are preparing a Multi-benefit bulletin to remind all staff of the other bodies who can help young carers and highlight the importance of being sympathetic to a young person's needs.

The tables show the numbers of children in households with below 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. of contemporary mean income. Information is not available for geographic areas smaller than regions.

It does not include Northern Ireland. 1996-97 is the latest year for which information is available. The figures presented will be subject to sampling error.<P>

2. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household). It is standard HBAI practice to give results for income both before and after housing costs, in order 



to allow for the effect of variations in housing costs between households. Results are also provided including and excluding the self-employed, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of income measures for the self-employed.<P>

3. Numbers and percentages below half average income before housing costs are sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale.<P>

4. Due to the sampling method and sample sizes used in the FRS, results are not available below government office regional level.<P>

5. Dependent children are defined as: an individual aged under 16 or an unmarried 16 to 18 year old on a course up to and including 'A' level standard.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made by Government Departments towards the target of improving energy efficiency by 20 per cent. in the nine years to 31 March 2000.  [92881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 By 31 March 1998, energy efficiency in Government Departments had improved by just over 18 per cent. since 1990-91, as measured by the Total Cost Indicator.
<P>

<a name="90722w03.htm_para8">Full details are given in the tables which have been placed in the Library; the overall estate improvement is shown in Table 4. The tables give a summary.
<P>

<a name="90722w03.htm_para9">The tables include revisions to figures for earlier years revealing better performance than previously reported. In particular, the 1996-97 figure for the Army has been revised to take account of a large estate increase which had been inadvertently omitted, and this restores not only the Army's own steady progress but that of the whole government estate, to 17.5 per cent. instead of to 15.1 per cent. as previously reported in that year.
<P>

<a name="90722w03.htm_para10">Energy management in individual Departments is a matter for those Departments and their Green Minister. However, the Government aim to be at the forefront of good practice to improve energy efficiency, and progress is reviewed regularly by Green Ministers under the Chairmanship of my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. We have developed and are now piloting new performance indicators which will, for the first time, enable comparisons with independent standards of good practice across the economy. These are likely to form the basis of the new campaign starting in April 2000.
<P>

the need to run a number of old and new buildings in parallel while changes took place. However, the Department's two new headquarters buildings at Eland House and Ashdown House were fully occupied by the end of March 1998 so future results should reflect this.

(12) Progress is expressed as a percentage relative to the 1990-91 base year value of the performance indicator in question. Positive figures represent improvement. The standard indicator, against which the target to improve energy efficiency by 20 per cent. by 31 March 2000 is measured, is obtained by weather-correcting energy consumption and converting to costs using 'standard prices' for fuel (6p/kWh for electricity and 1.25p/kWh for all fossil fuels) then dividing by floor area. Conversation to money both reflects the relative costs of electricity and fossil fuel and their environmental impact, and the use of fixed prices eliminates the effects of tariff changes which distort the comparison of fuel bills.<P>

<P>

(13) Although figures have been prepared on a consistent basis, caution should be exercised in comparing the energy use of different Departments and Agencies because of differences in their estate and the nature of their work. For example, the operational needs of prisons and the QEII Conference Centre mean that they have a pattern of energy use which is different from that of a Department which has predominantly office accommodation. Expenditure on energy and investment figures are included for information only. Investment figures relate to clearly identifiable energy efficiency measures undertaken by Departments. Energy efficiency is an integral part of all major construction projects, including building refurbishment and plant replacement and the figure '0' for some Departments does not necessarily mean there has been no investment, just that the investment was not clearly identifiable.<P>

<P>

(14) The average performance figure for the civil estate cannot be derived by simply adding together the individual Departmental progress and dividing by the number of Departments because this does not allow for the large variations in consumption. The correct figure is obtained by calculating the value of the performance indicator for the year in question and the base year, for the civil estate as a whole, and calculating the reduction relative to the base year.<P>

<P>

(15) The energy performance for MAFF's 'Main estate' and its 'Laboratories' continues to improve through ongoing investment in energy schemes, monitoring of energy at local level and taking appropriate action as well as central initiatives including continued staff awareness programmes.<P>





(16) The DETR's figures have been compiled from the former Environment and Transport Departments. The Department now has a greater proportion of air-conditioned buildings than in the base year, because of estate rationalisation, relocation to new HQ buildings and inclusion of some Government Offices for the Regions. Performance in 1997-98 was adversely affected by parallel operation of both old and new buildings while staff moved from one to the other.<P>

<P>

(17) HSE was removed from the DfEE estate on the formation of that Department. QEII Conference Centre is reported separately because of its business led demands. The initial sharp rise in consumption following the 1990-91 base year was directly attributable to increased revenue earning activity, which has continued throughout the reporting period, and the more recent decline in consumption reflects the effect of energy conservation measures undertaken at the site.<P>

<P>

(18) Rationalisation of the estate since the base year has led to staff moving from several naturally ventilated buildings to more densely occupied air-conditioned buildings, all equipped with information technology equipment.<P>

<P>

(19) Base year is 1991-92.<P>

<P>

(20) Base year in 1991-92. Data for Natural Resources Institute no longer included following its transfer to the University of Greenwich.<P>

<P>

(21) Base year is 1994-95 by which time energy efficient lighting and other improvements already installed in buildings which are already fully air-conditioned with intensive IT usage.<P>

<P>

(22) Workload is increasing, affecting occupancy and requiring offices to be occupied for longer, increasing the use of energy. Greater use of information technology, expansion of the use of air conditioning and the upgrading of lighting levels has increased electricity consumption.<P>

<P>

(23) The Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate is different from the rest of the Government estate, and has been undergoing more radical changes. It is therefore treated in a slightly different way. In common with the civil estate, it has greatly increased its use of information technology.<P>

<P>

(24) In civil departments, the effect of estate changes is allowed for by dividing consumption by floor area. In MOD, floor area is sometimes not meaningful (e.g. in relation to security or runway lighting) and also not often available, so estate changes are allowed for by being explicitly excluded from the calculations, i.e. the energy consumption of new facilities is removed, and for facilities no longer part of the estate, the consumption for the last full year of operation is added back. In most cases, such changes are small compared to the total and can often approximately cancel each other out.<P>

<P>

(25) It is almost impossible to produce any meaningful results to date for MOD's Procurement Executive (PE) since it has suffered major estate gains and losses over the past 10 years and now consists largely of one recently built large office. The standard MOD methodology produces a meaningless 'no change' result (since the present estate is almost entirely different from the original).<P>

<P>

(26) This shows the combined results for the whole of the Government estate based on the data in tables 1, 2 and 3. It is not a simple average of the data, but reflects the proportion of total consumption represented by each part of the estate (see also note 3). Some Departments have a different base year, and the individually agreed base year has been used for the purposes of this table, where appropriate.<P>

<P>

(27) In some instances the base year is not 1990-91, but for the purposes of tables 2 and 5 the agreed base year has been used in the calculation.<P>

<P>

(28) The figures quoted here for the Home Office have been weather-corrected in the same way as for all departments. Figures quoted elsewhere were provisional, not yet weather-corrected and therefore showed higher apparent progress.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will provide financial assistance to Ryedale District Council under the Bellwin scheme for costs incurred following the severe flooding between 5 and 14 March.  [92882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified in the case of Ryedale District Council given the exceptional nature of the floods and the damage caused. A scheme will, therefore, be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant will be paid to the authority to cover 85 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold which have been incurred by the authority in dealing with the flooding.

 My Department and the National Assembly for Wales are today publishing 'Building Control Performance Standards', on behalf of the Construction Industry Council, the Local Government Association and the Association of Corporate Approved Inspectors, whose Building Control Services Steering Group drew up the document.

<a name="90722w04.htm_para12">Competition between local authority building control departments and approved inspectors is an important spur to efficiency, and beneficial to the builders and developers who are the immediate clients for the building control service. Building control must also be effective in helping to secure the compliance of building work with the requirements of the Building Regulations, which exist to promote the health, safety, welfare and convenience of building users, as well as energy efficiency.

 To ensure the most effective support for people living in our communities who need it, I am establishing a new reference group to work with the Government on implementing our 'Supporting People' policy.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para16">This is a cross-Government initiative, which will be co-ordinated by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). It will work closely with the Departments of Health and Social Security, the Home Office and other parts of Government.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para17">The reference group will comprise individuals nominated by organisations representing local authorities, other statutory agencies, service providers, and those using support services. In due course we will also be inviting a number of people with experience of day-to-day operation of the services to participate in a small Practitioners' Group. By working closely with interested parties to develop the detail of the new arrangements, my Department will ensure that our long-term objective becomes a workable and effective reality.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The London Mayor and Assembly elections on 4 May 2000--subject to Parliamentary approval--provide an excellent opportunity to introduce a more up-to-date system of counting of votes, more in keeping with modern technology and systems.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para22">Following my announcement on 5 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>378</i>; of our shortlist of potential suppliers of electronic equipment for the London Mayor and Assembly elections, we have been considering in more detail the equipment on offer from these suppliers. If the count for the London elections next year--which will comprise three ballots--is conducted in the traditional manual manner, it could take up to three days. That is why I am particularly pleased that three of the suppliers have offered electronic counting equipment. These machines have the capacity to scan many thousands of ballot papers an hour and so could reduce the count to a matter of hours. They are also more accurate than manual systems. We have therefore decided to proceed in negotiation with the three suppliers offering electronic counting equipment: Data & Research Services plc; Election Systems & Software Inc. with Unisys Ltd.; and Smurfit Ltd.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para23">The final decision on whether to award a contract is likely to be made in September when the proposals have been fully evaluated. We will be looking for value for money, and we will need to be absolutely confident that the chosen method is accurate and efficient. All the equipment we are considering has been tried and tested in elections elsewhere.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library the scientific advice received from English Nature concerning the notification of the River Tweed as a candidate special area of conservation under the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora.  [88617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 June 1999]:</i> With the agreement of the Scottish Executive, I have placed in the Library of the House a paper written by the Chief Scientist of Scottish Natural Heritage (English Nature's equivalent in Scotland) in 1995 setting out a scientific analysis of the case for proposal of the River Tweed as a Special Area of Conservation. That document is the best summary of the agency's advice. The Government and the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 1999 : Column: 589</I><P>
statutory nature conservation agencies subsequently discussed the various scientific factors which had to be taken into account in making a decision about whether to propose the site to the European Commission as a candidate Special Area of Conservation.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para24">The Government concluded that the River Tweed should not be proposed to the European Commission as a candidate Special Area of Conservation. The Government believed that there were a number of reasons why, applying the criteria for site selection specified in the Habitats Directive, the River Tweed was not an outstanding candidate for Special Area of Conservation status for Atlantic salmon. These included the relatively poor state of the spawning salmon stock, the very substantial modification by man of the watercourse, and discharges into the river environment. The Government have proposed five other rivers to the European Commission as candidate Special Areas of Conservation for salmon, which we believe better meet the selection criteria of the Habitats Directive.
<P>

<a name="90722w04.htm_para25">The implementation of the Habitats Directive in Scotland is now a matter for the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B>

<P>
<a name="90722w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 1999]:</i> I have received no applications for consent to release this type of genetically modified (GM) plant. Any such applications would be subject to a scientific assessment of risk carried out case-by-case on the basis of an environmental risk assessment. It is likely that any such experiments would be carried out in containment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the maximum number of fields and the maximum field size that will be permitted in the farm scale trials of genetically modified oil seed rape, maize and sugar beet; and which body will determine these numbers and sizes.  [91415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The farm scale evaluations of the impact of the management of genetically modified (GM) herbicide tolerant oilseed rape and maize on farmland are being guided by an independent scientific steering committee. The steering committee will determine the number of fields necessary to ensure the statistical validity of the study. Preliminary analysis has indicated that 20 paired comparisons of each crop in each year will be sufficient, although more detailed analysis of the appropriate sample size was called for by the steering committee and it may be necessary to revise the number in the light of this.
<P>

<a name="90722w06.htm_para0">In the current research programme, the intention is to carry out ecological studies in a realistic cropping scenario, that is within fields of a size representative of UK agricultural practices. A size of about 10 ha was chosen; in the case of maize, many fields are likely to be smaller--about 6-7 ha and, in the case of oilseed rape, fields may be larger than 10 ha.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the farm scale test sites planned for autumn 1999 and the crops to be grown; if interim test results from earlier trials will be available before their planting; and if he will make a statement.  [92095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The release of genetically modified autumn sown oilseed rape will be carried out under a consent granted to AgrEvo. The legislation requires that the proposed sites are advertised in a local newspaper and that my Department discloses the locations on the public register. The sites for this autumn's releases have not yet been selected.
<P>

<a name="90722w06.htm_para2">It is unlikely that interim results will be available before the autumn sown crops are planted. The ecological studies being carried out in the spring sown crops are still being gathered and will continue to be gathered after harvest. Analysis of the results will then be carried out and reviewed by the Scientific Steering Group at their next meeting in October. It is not considered necessary to have the results of the wildlife studies in the spring sown crops before sowing the autumn sown crops. The different sowing times influence the wildlife in a crop quite significantly and great care needs to be taken in the interpretation of the results in this respect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w06.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government have been well aware of concern about the level of traffic noise arising from motorways and other high speed roads. Our proposals for dealing with the problem arising from those roads for which the Secretary of State has responsibility were explained in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England". We announced the annual budget which was being ring-fenced for this purpose on 22 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>50-51</i>, together with criteria which would target the most serious and pressing cases.
<P>

<a name="90722w06.htm_para13">The Highways Agency has assessed a number of locations where traffic noise had been a particular cause for concern against the sift criteria. The Agency will shortly be undertaking detailed studies of those locations meeting the criteria where there are no immediate plans to replace the existing road surface with a quieter one. The studies are necessary to discover the most appropriate means of dealing with the problem. There has been no differentiation between urban and rural areas, but the studies will take into account the proximity of housing to the road.
<P>

<a name="90722w06.htm_para14">The Agency has also made good progress in the use of lower noise surfaces when maintenance is due on existing roads. Approximately three quarters of maintenance contracts undertaken since last year have used these new surfaces.

We are also aware of the concerns raised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights with regard to the treatment of Mr. Ocalan's lawyers. We understand that an appeal is now pending. It is in the first place for the Appeal Court to review the outcome of the trial. We will continue to monitor closely the appeal proceedings.

 Every effort is made to offer an appointment at the earliest convenient opportunity. At peak periods for travel, waiting times may extend to three or four weeks. Since most visit visa applicants plan to travel on specific dates, it is only where there are compelling compassionate circumstances that interview appointments can be brought forward ahead of others who are waiting. For this reason we encourage travellers to apply for their visas well ahead of their intended date of travel.

<a name="90722w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Iran is aware of our serious concern about the Baha'is. Persecution of individuals on religious grounds is totally unacceptable. The EU-sponsored United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution on Iran adopted on 23 April reaffirmed international concern about their situation. We regularly raise with the Iranian authorities our concerns about the Baha'i community. I personally did so with the Iranian Ambassador on 24 May.

 We prefer sponsors of visa applicants worldwide, not only from India, to submit documents in original form rather than photocopied because it is easier for entry clearance staff to establish their authenticity. It also saves the sponsor the time and expense of having photocopies made and notarised.

<P>
<a name="90722w09.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Quinquennial Review of The Buying Agency, which I announced on 29 October 1998, has now been completed. Cabinet Office, with the help of its consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers, has considered the performance of the Agency over the last five years and the options for the future of its function in the context of the Government's policy on civil procurement.
<P>

<a name="90722w09.htm_para1">TBA's main aims are to increase the volume of goods and services procured and to generate a return on capital employed through its Trading Fund. An evaluation of its performance over the five year period 1994-98 showed that over the first four years sales and income performance had been disappointing, due mainly to a substantial change in the Agency's market. Over the period as a whole, TBA met six of its thirteen financial targets, three of nine efficiency and productivity targets, six out of ten customer satisfaction targets and all nine targets for measures of internal quality and environmental management. The evaluation concluded that better measures and targets were needed to assess the efficiency and added value of the Agency's work.
<P>

<a name="90722w09.htm_para2">A review of prior options rejected abolition and privatisation which would deprive government of an instrument for central procurement. The consultants 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 1999 : Column: 606</I><P>
considered that TBA's purchasing and energy procurement services have sufficient potential to justify retention of the whole Agency and therefore recommended that its agency status should continue subject to certain changes in business practice. The Review also concluded that the merger of TBA's functions with another department or agency was a matter for the review of civil procurement being conducted by Peter Gershon.
<P>

<a name="90722w09.htm_para3">Having considered the recommendations of the Review, I have decided that TBA should remain as an executive agency following the satisfactory completion of a comprehensive programme of short term business improvements aimed at developing its relationships with customers and suppliers and demonstrating the savings obtainable from its central purchasing. From 1 January 2000, it will become an executive agency of the new Office of Government Commerce on which my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is making a separate statement.
<P>

<a name="90722w09.htm_para4">I am placing a summary of the consultants' report on prior options in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="90722w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 I have arranged for a report on the performance of the main Departments and agencies to be placed in the Libraries of the House. This is the second report on performance against the six service standards and reflects our continuing commitment to openness and to reporting transparently on our performance.
<P>

<a name="90722w10.htm_para0">The report shows that, in many cases, performance in responding to correspondence from the public has improved over the past year. There have been some exceptional performances, although there have also been some disappointing results. Overall, there is still room for improvement, and all Departments and agencies are striving to do better this year. The performance of the main Departments and agencies is summarised in the table.
<P>

<a name="90722w10.htm_para1">Against the other standards, the report shows that users with pre-arranged meetings are usually seen within 10 minutes of their appointment, that all Departments have at least one telephone inquiry point, and that all Departments now have complaints procedures in place covering all their services. The report also shows some of the innovative ways in which Departments and agencies are consulting their users and making their services more accessible.
<P>

<a name="90722w10.htm_para2">The Modernising Government White Paper announced some changes to the standards for this financial year, in particular the introduction on 1 October 1999 of new standards covering the length of time users should wait to be seen in public offices, the setting up of e-mail inquiry points, and how long users of telephone inquiry points should have to wait before their calls are answered.

The permanent headquarters will therefore, be based at Ensleigh with a progressive move to be completed by 1 April 2000. The headquarters will be small and strategic and the vast majority of the DLO's staff will not be directly affected.

Mr. Birchall's application was one of a number that could not be determined until the review was concluded in April 1999; I am sorry that it took so long to do so.

<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will place in the Library a copy of the recent review of section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.  [91828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 This review was conducted by means of communications between Ministers and officials of various Departments, and legal advice to Ministers. The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information indicates that such internal discussion and advice is exempt from the commitment to provide information in that Code. The review did not lead to any change of policy or practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many wrongfully convicted people, excluding motoring or summary offences, have been granted compensation since 1990; and what is the average time taken to process a claim.  [91827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew1"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 There have been 154 successful applications for compensation for wrongful conviction or charge, under the statutory or the ex-gratia schemes, since 1990. (This figure excludes a large group of successful applications stemming from the quashing of a high number of convictions for drink-driving in Greater Manchester, between 1987 and 1989, but not any other motoring or summary offences.) The average time from the date of these applications to the decision to pay compensation is 210 days. Once such a decision has been taken, the time taken to make the final payment of compensation depends primarily on how quickly the successful applicant submits the full details of the claim (to allow the independent assessor to determine quantum) and accepts the subsequent award. The average time from the date of those successful applications since 1990 in respect of which a final payment has been made, to the final payment, is 895 days.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department following the Bentley case, what assessment he has made of the benefits of granting compensation where miscarriage of justice has been caused by judicial error.  [91797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 It is my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's policy to pay compensation for a wrongful conviction caused by judicial error, under the ex-gratia arrangements announced by the then Home Secretary (Mr. Hurd) in his reply to Mr. Tim Smith on 29 November 1985, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>689-90</i>, in cases where the judicial error is of an exceptional nature. The Divisional Court in the case of R <i>v.</i> Home Secretary ex parte Garner & Others held that it would be "a very rare case indeed" where the judicial misconduct is of the exceptional nature required to justify an ex-gratia payment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes are proposed in the charging policy for the policing of football matches for the 1999-2000 season; how those charges are assessed; and if he will make a statement.  [91915]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 It is for chief constables to decide when to charge for special services such as the policing of football matches. The scale of charges is determined by the police authority. Under Home Office guidelines, the level of charges should represent the full economic cost of providing the special service.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes are proposed in policing costs for road closures for sporting and public events; and if he will make a statement.  [91916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has issued guidance that the current practice by police forces of using their powers to achieve road closures during sporting events, such as football matches and other public events, is inappropriate. The ACPO advice is that, for planned events, it would be more appropriate for the organisers to apply to the relevant local authority for a road closure order. The fees and charges involved would be a matter for the local authority to determine.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the percentage of cases where election is made for trial by jury and the defendant changes the plea to guilty prior to the start of the trial.  [91914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Crown Prosecution Service statistics for 1998 show that 18,500 defendants elected trial in 1998 in addition to 47,185 either-way cases directed to the Crown Court by magistrates. During the same period, 76 per cent. of defendants in either-way cases pleaded guilty before the commencement of the Crown Court trial.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_wqn7"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he is proposing as a follow-up to the Forum on Animal Experiments held on 11 July <i>(a)</i> to reduce the number of animals used in experimentation and <i>(b)</i> to co-ordinate research on alternatives to animal experimentation.  [91918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 For the reasons I outlined in my reply to the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) on 11 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>51</i>, the total number of scientific procedures involving animals is not a true measure of the effectiveness of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The total number of procedures is dependent on a number of factors, including the implications of scientific breakthroughs and the buoyancy of United Kingdom industry.
<P>

<a name="90722w14.htm_para0">We will, however, continue to work to minimise the amount of suffering caused and the number of animals used by ensuring that alternatives (which replace animal

<P><I>22 Jul 1999 : Column: 624</I><P>
use, reduce the number of animals needed for a particular purpose and refine protocols to lessen suffering--the 3Rs) are used wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="90722w14.htm_para1">Following the Forum I hosted on 9 July, I am keen to see whether it might be possible to co-ordinate more effectively the various programmes of work aimed at developing, testing or validating alternatives. I have already written to a number of colleagues in other Departments to obtain information on their funding of such work and have asked officials to write over the summer to other bodies that sponsor, commission or undertake such work, including charities, animal welfare bodies and industry. I will also be asking the Animal Procedures Committee for advice on this matter.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what further meetings he is planning with animal welfare organisations, research organisations and others with an interest in animal experimentation as a follow-up to the Forum on Animal Experiments held on 11 July.  [91917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 In the last 12 months, I have met with a number of such organisations and I have visited a number of establishments designated under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. I expect to continue to do so. I do, as far as possible, maintain an "open door" policy and generally find meetings with all those with an interest in the use of animals in scientific procedures to be very useful and constructive.
<P>

<a name="90722w14.htm_para2">I am currently giving consideration to the possibility of holding further events, similar to the Forum, but have no firm plans at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are being taken to prevent early retirement by police officers under investigation by the Police Complaints Authority.  [91836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w14.htm_spnew9"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Retirement cannot take place where a police officer is suspended. Under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999, a chief police officer has the power to suspend an officer where there has been a complaint which indicates that the officer's conduct does not meet the standards set out in the regulations, whether or not the matter has been investigated. In the case of early retirement on ill health grounds, police authorities have discretion to delay retirement until misconduct proceedings have been concluded.

We had decided in principle that the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales should, from April 2000, become the commissioning and purchasing body for secure accommodation for children and young people on remand or under sentence.

 Her Majesty's Government has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) or the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on behalf of Gibraltar, Jersey or Guernsey. The UNCRC and CEDAW were extended to the Isle of Man on 7 September 1994 and 7 May 1986 respectively.

[92139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w15.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There were a total of 126 appointments made to Home Office non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) between 1 June 1997 and 31 May 1998. Six of the appointees were Asian and six were from other ethnic minority backgrounds.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90722w15.htm_para1">The Home Office Public Appointments Equal Opportunities Plan for 1999-2002, which was published on 25 May 1999, sets the Department the objectives of achieving 9 per cent. membership of ethnic minorities across its major public bodies (excluding the Commission for Racial Equality) and 9 per cent. for all its public appointments. On the latest available information, the figures achieved are respectively 10 per cent. and 14 per cent.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many deportation orders are outstanding against asylum seekers whose applications have been refused; and if he will list <i>(a)</i> how long they have been outstanding and <i>(b)</i> his Department's estimated timetable for when they will be carried out.  [92103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information relates to persons recorded on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's central immigration enforcement database (HOMIES) who have an unenforced deportation order outstanding against them and who have also had an asylum application initially refused. Some 1,575 such persons were recorded on HOMIES on 4 January 1999, the latest reliable snapshot figure. The breakdown by length of time since signing of the deportation order is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="90722w15.htm_para2">In addition to those cases where further representations are being considered or where the decision to remove is subject to legal challenge, in many of these cases the subject of the deportation order has absconded and his or her present whereabouts are unknown. In some instances, it is even possible that the individual concerned has left the country of his or her own accord without the knowledge of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. In these circumstances, a timetable for completing the removal of the outstanding cases would have little meaning.

 This information is not available to the Home Office. Currently, asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute may receive support in one of two ways. Those who apply at their port of entry are eligible for social security benefits and can find their own accommodation. Those who apply in-country may be supported by local authority social services departments under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989. Asylum seekers make applications for support by local authorities direct to an individual local authority. The Home Office does not co-ordinate this information centrally.

On average, families will gain &#163;24 per week.

 The Government announced in their publication "Quangos: Opening up Public Appointment 1999-2002" (copies deposited in the Libraries of both Houses) their commitment to the equal representation of women and men in public appointments and a pro rata representation of members of ethnic minority groups. In moving towards achieving these commitments, the Chancellor's departments have set an ambitious overall goal that each of the Chancellor's departments' public bodies should include at least one appointment from a member of the ethnic minorities by 2003, and that ethnic minorities should account for a minimum of 4 per cent. of appointments to larger bodies. In 1998, about 5.4 per cent. of all appointments by the Chancellor's departments and agencies were held by members of the ethnic minorities.

 Whenever possible, children placed in local authority care should be given a medical examination and a written health assessment before they are placed. A child should then be medically examined every six months up to the age of two, and at least every twelve months thereafter. Once assessed, the medical needs of children in local authority care should be set out in the general care plan for each child. Children would be registered with a general practitioner and any necessary medical treatment and drug prescribing would be carried out under the supervision and guidance of the child's general practitioner or, if a child is in a hospital, under the supervision and guidance of the appropriate hospital medical staff.
<P>

<a name="90722w19.htm_para6">Details have to be kept of all medicinal products administered to children placed in a residential home, and by whom they are administered. This must be recorded in writing on each occasion in a central record and on the child's individual record. Where a medicinal product may not be safely self-administered by a child it should be undertaken only by a member of staff of the home or by a doctor or nurse. Children aged 16 and over are in general entrusted with the retention and administration of their own medication, and should be provided with a secure place to keep medication.
<P>

<a name="90722w19.htm_para7">Children of 16 and 17 are entitled to consent on their own behalf to medical treatment, as are those under 16 who have sufficient understanding of what is proposed. Where a child is subject to a care order, the local authority acquires parental responsibility for the child and may consent to treatment on behalf of the child, including in circumstances where the child's parent has refused to consent.

More recent guidance published in 1995 in HBN 40 volume 2 indicates that this should be increased to 2900 mm x 2700 mm to reflect the increasing use of hoists, extra space around the bed for access and movement and in recognition of the space needs for those who depend on walking frames and wheelchairs to assist mobility.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 1999]:</i> The decision to establish the clinical negligence scheme for NHS trusts as a voluntary risk pooling scheme took account of the fact that no established commercial insurance arrangements were available for clinical negligence. As I said in my answer of 2 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>399-400</i>, the NHS Executive has consistently discouraged trusts from using commercial insurance for clinical negligence risks on value for money grounds.

 Although the functions of the Crown Estate Commissioners in managing the Crown Estate are reserved, properties and interests which form the Crown Estate in Scotland are subject to the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. However, the power of direction over the Crown Estate Commissioners will remain with the United Kingdom Government and is exercised jointly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.

As part of the Government's commitment to ensuring that its policies are relevant to the lives that people live today, my Department is working closely with the Women's Unit to develop good practices for carrying out gender impact appraisal. When developing policies, we have considered how they would affect different parts of the community, although since new guidance on Equal Treatment was promulgated in November 1998, we have not had occasion to carry out any formal Gender Impact assessments.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 1999]:</i> The main vehicle for providing information to employers wanting to join New Deal is the "New Deal for Employers" booklet. This was produced in consultation with employers in order that the information contained in it is useful and relevant and presented in a clear, user-friendly way. A telephone survey of employers showed that 95 per cent. of employers were positive about its presentation. 83 per cent. said that they found the content relevant or very relevant.
<P>

<a name="90722w22.htm_para3">In addition to this main item of literature, the Employment Service staff, including Business Managers, pro-actively communicate with both large and small employers. This includes meetings with large groups and one-to-one discussions to explain the New Deal and provide a contact within the Employment Service to whom the employer can address any questions.
<P>

<a name="90722w22.htm_para4">The New Deal Task Force is stimulating wider engagement in the New Deal through employer coalitions in major cities, and through contact groups of Human Resource Directors, small and medium employers, and intermediary bodies with employer customers.
<P>

<a name="90722w22.htm_para5">The Task Force and Employment Service are working with key employers and employer organisations in major growth sectors such as hospitality, construction and retail to improve the information and enhance the engagement of employers in the New Deal in these sectors.

 We consulted widely on new Employment Zones with personal job accounts (PJAs) earlier in the year. I am today launching our invitation to tender to run the new Zones at a conference in London. A copy of the bidding procedures will be placed in the Library. There will be 12 Zones in England, two in Wales and one in Scotland, which will help 48,000 long-term unemployed people in areas where the problem still exists despite the improvement in the economy. The new Zones will offer both those who run them and those who benefit from them real flexibility in the way existing funds are used to move from benefits to employment. After a first step lasting no more than three months, those who have not left the register will move on to a personal job account with a fully costed action plan agreed between participants and their personal advisers. Personal job accounts will enable unemployed people to take more responsibility for their path back to employment. We intend to run Employment Zones in the following areas from April 2000: Brighton and Hove; Birmingham; Brent; Caerphilly, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil; Doncaster; Glasgow; Haringey; Liverpool and Sefton; Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland; Newham; North West Wales; Nottingham City; Plymouth; Southwark and Tower Hamlets.

<P>

<a name="90722w25.htm_para1">Krebs noted, however, that the absence of adequate experimental controls in previous badger clearances, including the East Offaly clearance, made it impossible to eliminate alternative explanations for the observed fall in herd breakdown rates or to quantify the contribution that badgers made to bovine TB. He recommended a controlled experiment to test rigorously the effectiveness of different strategies in Great Britain and to provide a sound basis for future policy.

<a name="90722w25.htm_para2">The Government accepted the Krebs' recommendations, and established the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, chaired by Professor John Bourne, to oversee their implementation and advise on other relevant scientific work.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the level of Government financial support allocated for the year 1998-99 for <i>(a)</i> organic farming and <i>(b)</i> conventional farming; how much has been spent to date; and how much is expected to be so allocated in 1999-2000.  [92405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90722w25.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The forecast for the UK for programmes on agriculture for 1998-99 is &#163;762.2 million, and &#163;660.0 million for 1999-2000, of which &#163;1.9 million and &#163;4 million respectively is for aid for conversion to organic farming. These figures are for national expenditure and do not include contributions from the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF. With EAGGF contributions, the figures for aid for conversion to organic farming are &#163;3.8 million for 1998-99 and &#163;8 million for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90722w25.htm_para3">In addition, organic farmers are entitled to receive all support payments available generally to farmers.

 In my statement to the House on 14 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 405, I made it clear that I am working for the day when we are able to trade in beef on equal terms with other member states. I will put proposals to the European Commission for further relaxations of the export ban when I judge that we have a strong case which can be justified by science. In particular, the resumption of trade in beef on the bone, and beef from cattle more than 30 months old, will need to be informed by the views of the Government's scientific advisers.

 My Department has sent detailed advice about the Scheme to all abattoirs that may be eligible to participate in the Scheme and set up a helpline to give advice. Abattoirs can, free of charge, make test applications to determine the proportion of their animals which might be DBES eligible. This is designed to help them make their commercial decisions, and my officials are prepared to offer any further advice necessary to help abattoirs and other meat processing establishments in their consideration of how they might benefit from the Scheme. The Department has established a Beef Export Liaison Group to exchange views of those involved in beef exports which will monitor progress of the DBES and identify key markets. In addition, I and my colleagues will be taking every opportunity to promote the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES) to industry here and customers abroad.

 The provisioning of the armed forces is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence.
