 Most if not all of the networks likely to be affected by these proposals operate under exemptions from the requirement for an electricity or gas licence. These exemptions are deregulatory in that, in most cases, networks are not obliged to apply for an exemption. It is therefore difficult to estimate the number of networks affected, but there are likely to be significant numbers. As part of the recent consultation the Government published an impact assessment which estimated that of 93TWh of non-domestic, non-industrial electricity consumption (DUKES 2010) half is supplied through private networks.</p>

 Where meters are required or upgrading is necessary to facilitate third party access, the costs associated with such work will ultimately be met by the customer or, on occasion, the prospective third party supplier.

Environmental barriers are being replaced on the M6 between junctions 8 and 10A as part of the current managed motorway scheme, which will open the hard shoulder as a running lane.

<i> [holding answer 3 December 2010]:</i><i> </i>DEFRA does not recommend any treatment for animals suspected of carrying tuberculosis (TB). Treatment of cattle for TB is explicitly forbidden in both the domestic and EU tuberculosis control legislation. There are several sound scientific and public health reasons for this, including the fact that treatment can mask the reactions to the TB tests in infected animals, thus causing false negative results. In addition, there are no veterinary drugs licensed in the UK for the treatment of TB in cattle or other mammals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="101207w0001.htm_para57"><a name="10120736000423">The interferon-gamma test is the only ancillary blood test approved for the detection of TB infected cattle in the European Union. It is down to member states to define the specific circumstances in which this test is to be deployed in their territory, always in conjunction with the primary tuberculin skin test. The field procedures for blood testing of cattle herds are laid down in the Operations Manual of Animal Health. The laboratory methods are set out in the Veterinary Laboratories Agency standard operating laboratory procedures. In certain prescribed circumstances, the application of the interferon-gamma test in cattle herds is mandatory, whereas in other scenarios its use is subject to a degree of discretion, professional judgement and risk assessment by Animal Health veterinary officers.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 November 2010]:</i> Conflict prevention activity is funded primarily through a tri-departmental fund called the Conflict Pool. This is managed jointly by the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence. The Conflict Pool has existed in various forms since 2005 (as the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, Africa Conflict Prevention Pool and Conflict Prevention Pool). Funding for the Conflict Pool is provided through the spending round, separately from departmental expenditure limits. The FCO does not normally contribute additional funds from its own budget. However, in financial year 2009-10 the FCO contributed an additional £2 million from its departmental budget towards a £20 million uplift to the Afghanistan programme.</p>

We will look to widen cost recovery in relation to businesses with a level of risk justifying a higher level of regulatory intervention or where material fault is found and enforcement action is necessary.

 We expect universal credit to improve take-up in two ways. First, universal credit will be much simpler than the existing arrangements, so it will be easier for people to understand whether they have an entitlement. Secondly, universal credit replaces support that is currently provided through a number of different benefits and tax credits. Under the current system people need to claim separately for these different benefits whereas in universal credit this support will be available through a single claim.</p>

 Over 2 million deposits worth £1.88 billion are currently protected in one of the three tenancy deposit protection schemes. Although some landlords continue to have reservations, the majority have found access to a free adjudication service under the schemes helpful in resolving disputes. At the same time, tenants welcome the increased security the schemes offer to their money. In view of this, the Government are committed to ensuring that tenancy deposit protection continues in future. In this context, we will be taking steps to put in place new insurance schemes when the existing agreements expire in 2013. The current custodial scheme will be in place to 2016.</p>

 The consultation paper 'Proposals for Reform of Civil Litigation Funding and Costs in England and Wales-Implementation of Lord Justice Jackson's Recommendations' does not propose any specific action in relation to before the event insurance, other than that the Government support Lord Justice Jackson's encouragement of the expansion of the before the event insurance market. For this reason, no specific assessment has been made.</p>

 Information on a prisoner's residence is provided by prisoners on reception into prison and recorded on a central IT system. Addresses include a prisoner's home address, an address to which they intend to return on discharge and next of kin. To analyse the population as a whole, if no address is given, a prisoner's committal court address is used as a proxy to determine the area in which a prisoner is resident. This is required for about 40% of the population and these figures are included in the answer. No address has been recorded and no court information is available for around 3% of prisoners and these figures are excluded from the answer.</p>

 There are different routes for a company to enter liquidation. Compulsory liquidations result from a winding-up order made by the court on the petition in most cases of a creditor. In a few cases the petition may be presented by a Government body such as the Insolvency Service in the public interest and very occasionally by the company itself.

 We expect signature of the EU-Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2011, before which the FTA would be subject to UK parliamentary scrutiny procedures. European Council legal advisers will determine whether the agreement is mixed competence, in which case it will need to be ratified by national parliaments. If, as expected, the FTA is mixed competence, we expect the UK ratification process to begin following signature later in 2011 or 2012. It would take several months to complete the secondary legislation required to ratify the FTA.</p>
