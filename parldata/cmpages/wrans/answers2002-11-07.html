<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> Imposing a tax on aviation equivalent to the current rate of duty on unleaded fuel in the UK has not been considered in ICAO and the Government has given an undertaking not to remove existing zero rating for VAT purposes of air transport. Imposing such tax increases on aviation would go well beyond what is justified on the basis of evidence of its environmental costs.

 The land transport of infectious substances within Great Britain is regulated by the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 2089) (as amended), the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 2095) (as amended) and the Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Classification, Packaging and Labelling) and Use of Transportable Pressure Receptacles Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 2092) (as amended). These regulations are made under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, with support from the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate. Mirror arrangements apply in Northern Ireland. Council Directives 96/49/EC (for rail transport) and 94/55/EC (for road transport) apply to transport between EU Member States, respectively, the provisions of the RID and ADR Agreements governing the international transport of dangerous goods, including infectious substances. Transport between the UK and third countries who are contracting parties to RID or ADR is governed by the detailed requirements set out in those Agreements. The Agreements are reviewed biennially in response to technical progress. Similar provisions apply in air and sea transport through application of the ICAO Technical Instructions and the IMO IMDG Code respectively.
<P>

<a name="21107w03.html_para0">The United Kingdom is at the forefront of an international initiative to draft provisions to enhance the security of dangerous goods in transport, which will apply particularly to the more dangerous infectious substances. We hope that by the end of the year we will see these provisions adopted in the UN's global multi-modal Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and by the European Commission, and included in due course in the provisions of the aforementioned Directives.

 I last met my French counterpart on 4 October when we discussed a number of issues including the A400M programme. We agreed on the importance of that programme and the need to launch it as soon as possible.

<P>
<a name="21107w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what indications he has received that Germany will order fewer than <i>(a)</i> 73 and <i>(b)</i> 60 A400M aircraft; [80014]

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I had a meeting with my German counterpart on 5 November when we discussed a range of defence topics, including the A400M programme. We both recognised the importance of the A400M programme and the need to launch it as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="21107w04.html_para0">The German government has made no final decision on whether it will need to change its previously stated requirement for 73 aircraft. It would therefore be premature to speculate on the impact of a reduced German order on the cost of the programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram MP: </B> 
 A non-Ministry of Defence funded study published in September 2000 showed that when compared to a control group of some selected civilians who were well, self-selected ill United Kingdom Gulf veterans had: <i>(a)</i> a lower concentration of paraoxonase and <i>(b)</i> its activity was less than 50 per cent. of that found in the control group. The level of paraoxonase found showed little variation among the Gulf veterans studied and no link to the severity of symptoms or to genetic composition was identified. The Ministry of Defence has since part-funded a study to confirm, or otherwise, the earlier findings which includes United Kingdom Gulf veterans, Bosnia veterans and non-deployed veterans. The study is complete and it is expected that the results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive radiological technique. It measures intracellular concentrations of specific abundant chemicals in small areas of the brain and is used to examine brain activity patterns and to identify very localised areas of damage within the brain.
<P>

<a name="21107w04.html_para1">MRS has not been used in Gulf veterans' illnesses research funded by the Ministry of Defence. Some patients who attended the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme have been referred to specialist neurologists who may have used this procedure. Gulf veterans also may have had MRS scans during investigations carried out during their health care under the National Health Service or Defence Medical Services.

A number of possible explanations have been put forward to explain the excess mortality rate above for Gulf veterans. These include that the veterans may have had some sort of neurological impairment caused by an exposure in the Gulf, that their perception of risk may have been altered by the experience of conflict or that this may have been a disguised form of suicide. We are discussing with the scientific community how best to conduct an analysis of the factors underlying the figures.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w05.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We announced on 30 September 2002 that the Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) has been selected to meet our Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) requirement. This decision represents a major step forward for the United Kingdom's future expeditionary air power capability, and builds on our unique and valuable knowledge of STOVL aircraft acquired during nearly four decades of operations with Harrier on land and at sea.
<P>

<a name="21107w05.html_para6">The announcement has also been welcomed by British industry, which is playing a key role in the JSF programme and will help ensure that the UK retains its leading position in a major area of aerospace technology. Indeed, industry estimates that its involvement could be worth up to #27 billion over the whole life of the programme, creating or securing some 8,500 jobs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w05.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR) requirement is to deliver a surveillance and attack capability in open ocean and littoral areas in support of maritime, joint or combined operations using a maritime helicopter operating from assigned frigates and destroyers. The requirement will include targeting, Anti-Surface and Anti-Submarine weapon delivery, and battle damage assessment. In addition, it will provide Search and Rescue (SAR), humanitarian support and constabulary capabilities.
<P>

<a name="21107w05.html_para7">SCMR will succeed and enhance the capability currently provided by the Maritime Lynx Mk3 and Mk8 helicopters. These have, for decades, provided excellent service on our frigates and destroyers, but are nearing the end of their useful life. SCMR will be capable of operating from Type 23 frigates, the Future Surface Combatant, and Type 45 destroyers. SCMR is currently in its Assessment Phase and is planned to be phased into service during the second half of the decade.

[78634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In response to the latest Army Continuous Attitude Survey, 197 members of those surveyed indicated they believed that harassment, discrimination or bullying are problems within their immediate work area; this represents 11 per cent. of those who responded and 5 per cent. of those surveyed. In addition, 878 members of the Army indicated, in the same survey, that they believed harassment, discrimination and bullying are problems within the British Army; this represents 43 per cent. of those who responded and some 22 per cent. of those surveyed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Stage 2 of the CVF Assessment phase completes on 20 November. We then intend to select a preferred contractor not on the basis of a traditional bid analysis but through an assessment of the contractors' performance and output since the start of the Assessment phase in November 1999. An announcement on the preferred contractor is scheduled for early next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) programme is progressing well and the recent announcement of the innovative adaptable design is evidence of this. Risk reduction and design work is continuing and we remain on course to select our preferred contractor early next year and approve investment in the build programme at the end of 2003. The In Service Dates of the two ships remain 2012 and 2015 respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w06.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is still too early in the Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) programme to make an accurate forecast of the number of jobs that will be created or sustained by the CVF programme. Much will depend on the shipbuild strategy adopted by the preferred prime contractor and the split of work between the participating construction and final assembly facilities. However, taking into account the supply chain, the programme may involve around 10,000 jobs throughout the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w06.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The primary aircraft for the Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) will be the Joint Combat Aircraft. The Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter has been identified as the aircraft with the best potential to fulfil that role and this was reinforced by the announcement on 30 September that we had selected the Short Take Off Vertical Landing variant to operate from CVF. The ships will also carry Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control aircraft and helicopters from all three services in a variety of roles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w06.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Equality of opportunity for all staff is a key feature of Civil Service employment. The Ministry of Defence's personnel and employment policies and procedures have been subject to equality-proofing, including the removal of any unfair discrimination on the basis of age. To underpin this, the MOD has a programme of action on equality and diversity involving the training and development of line and personnel managers, and the monitoring of recruitment, selection and performance management statistics. Training in equal opportunities is mandatory for all recruitment panel members.
<P>

<a name="21107w06.html_para0">In addition, the MOD, like other Departments, has conducted a thorough review of its age retirement policy in light of the Government's commitment to tackle ageism in the workplace as set out in the Code of Practice for Age Diversity in Employment published in 1999.

 In line with Government policy on warship construction the Royal Navy's two new Future Aircraft Carriers (CVFs) will be built in the United Kingdom. This is clearly understood by both of the candidate prime contractors for CVF&#151;BAE SYSTEMS and Thales&#151;and as part of their work to date they have assessed the capabilities of a number of sites throughout the United Kingdom that have the potential to participate in the build (construction and outfitting of modules or blocks of the vessel) and assembly (the joining together of the blocks into a whole ship in a suitable dry dock). No final decisions have yet been made.

incidence of multiple myeloma, other cancers and other causes of death amongst nuclear test veterans. This study follows on from two earlier studies, the results of which were published in 1988 and 1993. The results of this third study are expected to be published early next year. Funding is also provided to the NRPB for the maintenance of a database that has been used during the compilation of these studies.
<P>

<a name="21107w06.html_para1">No funding has been provided for health studies of the offspring of nuclear test veterans. Current information on radiation health effects suggests that studies of cancer among people exposed to radiation are likely to prove a more sensitive means of detecting such effects than studies of their children. There is no scientific or medical evidence that shows that the health or other physical problems suffered by the offspring of nuclear test veterans can be attributed to their father's or grandfather's participation in the test programme.

 Many independent reports have been produced that consider the battlefield effects of using depleted uranium (DU) munitions, but none has found widespread DU contamination sufficient to affect the health of the general population or deployed personnel.

We support proposals by the World Health Organisation to carry out studies to address public health issues in Iraq, including a proposal to explore health effects of environmental risk factors, including DU.

It has been assumed that by ''operational costs'' the hon. Member is referring to the operating cost of 32 (The Royal) Squadron. As such I can confirm that the charges quoted comprise entirely of the variable cost of operating the aircraft and no fixed operating costs of the Squadron are included. The charges include engineering and airframe support costs, costs incurred for handling and landing at civil airports, fuel and travel and 



subsistence. Unlike the BAe 125 and 146, the Twin Squirrel is a wholly leased aircraft and the charge applied represents the contracted cost of the aircraft.<P>

 HMS Albion is the first of a new class of Landing Platform Dock vessels. She is being constructed by BAE Systems Marine Ltd at their Barrow in Furness shipyard. Technical difficulties encountered during her construction have been largely due to the use of a computer aided design tool that was new to the shipyard, immature design information being released for production, the use of modern build techniques and some novel warship design features such as the diesel/electric propulsion system. It is not unusual for technical issues to arise during the design and construction of the first of such a complex warship class and BAE Systems are working hard to overcome each of the issues. A revised programme for Albion has been agreed with BAE Systems Marine and she is expected to

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what changes there have been to the British Army's practice in clearing unexploded ordnance in foreign training grounds used by our forces since his Department's payment of compensation to the victims of British munitions in Kenya;  [80291]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The British Army employs the same robust procedures for clearing unexploded ordnance overseas as it does in the United Kingdom. In Kenya there has been an increase in Explosive Ordnance Clearance (EOC) in the last two years, in order to minimise the risk to local civilians. This work includes the location and destruction of unexploded munitions irrespective of which nation's armed forces have fired them. No change in practice have been made subsequent to compensation payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The British Army employs two Locally Employed Civilians (LECs) as Range Officers on behalf of the Kenyan Department of Defence (DoD). These LECs do not participate in the destruction of munitions, as this is the responsibility of Army personnel. The British Army conducts clearance operations on all areas of ranges that it uses for live firing.

<P>
<a name="21107w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Each year, the British Army conducts an education programme for the local civilians regarding the hazards of unexploded munitions. This informs people in the Archer's Post area, including the nomadic farmers, of the different types of Kenyan and other munitions that they might find in the area.

<P>
<a name="21107w14.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 All doctors must work within the limits of their professional competence, as required by General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, <i>Good Medical Practice</i>. Doctors should not therefore be given or take on responsibility for patients if they are not competent to do so. This is to ensure that patients receive the highest quality of care and have the best chances of making a full recovery.
<P>

<a name="21107w14.html_para5">The National Health Service in England employs doctors in training grades who are not yet qualified to work independently and staff grade doctors, some of whom are trained specialists. NHS Consultants supervise the work of all of these doctors and are responsible for the care patients receive. Consultants are all trained specialists included on the Specialist Register held by the GMC.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has received a range of representations including parliamentary questions, letters from hon. and right hon. Members, patients and health care professionals about the safety of Seroxat.
<P>

<a name="21107w15.html_para3">Seroxat (paroxetine) is a member of a group of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Before a product is granted a licence for use in the UK it must meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. After licensing the safety of all medicines including SSRIs is continually monitored by the MCA and the independent expert advisory body, the committee on safety of medicines (CSM) and any new evidence which emerges is carefully reviewed.
<P>

<a name="21107w15.html_para4">The MCA/CSM carried out a major review of all side effects associated with SSRIs, which was completed in 2000 and resulted in product information for all SSRIs including Seroxat being updated and harmonised to reflect the common safety profiles of these medicines. An article in ''Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance'' in 2000 informed prescribers about this review and reminded them about the risk of withdrawal reactions.
<P>

<a name="21107w15.html_para5">Withdrawal reactions are an important and well-recognised side effect of Seroxat and also occur with the other SSRIs. The MCA/CSM warned prescribers about the possibility of withdrawal reactions associated with Seroxat via an article in the bulletin ''Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance'' in 1993. The CSM re-reviewed the issue of withdrawal reactions and possible dependence with Seroxat and the other SSRIs in 1998&#150;99. From detailed review of all available data, the CSM concluded that all SSRIs may be associated with withdrawal reactions on stopping but on current evidence they are not associated with dependence. As a result of this review product information for all SSRIs was updated in relation to withdrawal reactions. This issue was also reviewed at a European level by the committee on proprietary medicinal products which reached similar conclusions.
<P>

<a name="21107w15.html_para6">The product information for Seroxat which includes the summary of product characteristics for prescribers and the patient information leaflet, contains full details of side effects and warnings about withdrawal reactions.

 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its Expert Working Group on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) have reviewed the long-term safety of HRT as new information has become available. In 2001, the United Kingdom was actively involved in a European-wide review of all available evidence relating to HRT use in order to provide consistent core product information throughout Europe. Following the publication of further studies relating to the long-term effects of HRT earlier this year, the CSM re-convened its Expert Working Group (EWG) on HRT to examine in detail all the latest evidence. In light of the findings of its EWG, CSM has made further recommendations for product information to ensure that the advice for women and doctors accurately reflects current knowledge.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 511W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21107w16.html_para5">A very small increase in the risk of developing breast cancer in women on long-term HRT was first recognised in 1997. Women and health professionals were warned of this risk through an article in the drug safety bulletin ''<i>Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance</i>'' and product information was updated. Among women aged 50 who do not use HRT, approximately 45 in every 1000 will develop breast cancer by the age of 70. Recently published studies have confirmed that this number will increase to about 47 per 1000 women who take HRT for 5 years, about 51 per 1000 women who take HRT for 10 years, and about 57 per 1000 women who take HRT for 15 years.
<P>

<a name="21107w16.html_para6">In the UK, HRT products are indicated for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, and some products are also licensed for the prevention of osteoporosis. Data relating to the effectiveness of HRT in preventing bone fractures were reviewed by CSM at the time of licensing and were judged to support ''the prevention of osteoporosis'' as an indication for HRT. Further evidence was provided in studies published earlier this year for a significant reduction in the number of hip fractures with long-term HRT use.
<P>

<a name="21107w16.html_para7">A recent trial in women with pre-existing heart disease examined cardiovascular effects of long-term HRT and also considered ''quality of life'' indicators. Although the findings of this trial were mixed, the women suffering from post-menopausal symptoms experienced an overall improvement in ''quality of life''. Based on all currently available evidence, the benefits of short-term use of HRT for the relief of menopausal symptoms are judged to outweigh the risks. The decision to use HRT should be discussed by a woman with her doctor on an individual basis and the risks and benefits regularly reappraised with continued HRT use.

 Information collected centrally about the cause of deaths does not systematically record whether a death is attributable to alcohol misuse. A number of health and lifestyle factors can contribute to diseases such as cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease, and it can be difficult to isolate alcohol consumption as the most important of these factors.

 In 1998 the United Kingdom Anti-Drug Co-ordination Unit (UKADCU) developed the national drug strategy. The focus of this strategy was illegal drugs, crime reduction and enforcement. Key planks of the strategy centred upon availability and supply issues that would clearly not have been applicable to legal substances. As alcohol is not illegal it was decided it would be inappropriate to include it in this strategy.
<P>

<a name="21107w17.html_para6">The Government are committed to implementing the national alcohol harm reduction strategy by 2004, and work on developing the strategy is currently being taken forward by the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit, the Department of Health and other Government Departments. The strategy is due to be published in Summer 2003, and it will contain recommendations on the most effective ways of implementation across Government, including any links to be made with the implementation of the drugs strategy.

<a name="21107w17.html_para7">Progress to date has been slow. We have therefore asked Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, to work with the NHS and the voluntary sector to develop proposals for a new approach to specialist palliative care funding that will ensure delivery of the #50 million increase and develop a mechanism to secure long term investment. Professor Richards has been asked to report to Ministers later this Autumn.

 <i>Reforming Emergency Care</i> recommended breaking down over rigid demarcation barriers to enable more flexible ways of working throughout National Health Service emergency care provision. This included separating patients into ''streams'' according to need and enabling nurse practitioners to take a much greater role in dealing with patients. Central investment of #40 million has already enabled the recruitment of 600 additional accident and emergency (A&E) nurses to support the separation of services for patients with minor injuries or illness from those with more serious conditions.

<P>
<a name="21107w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> The Department has not established a foundation trust consultative group. However, the initial framework for policy on National Health Service foundation trusts was developed through consultation with the first cohort of three-star NHS trusts as part of a series of national events on earned autonomy. In addition, Departmental officials have been seeking views from a number of chief executives from several different NHS trusts, primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and from other sources. These discussions have provided an important sounding board for our proposals.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> This information is not centrally available at present as waiting times are collected by specialty not procedure. We are investing #65 million New Opportunities Fund money and #15 million Treasury Capital Modernisation Fund money to expand angiography facilities. When completed, this should allow an extra 14,000 angiograms to take place each year. The planning and priorities framework for 2003&#150;06 sets the National Health Service a target to reduce waiting times for angiography and we plan to monitor progress against this target.

<a name="21107w19.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> Scrapie is not known to be transmissible to humans. Nonetheless there is a theoretical risk that the occurrence of apparent scrapie cases may be concealing BSE in sheep. The question of appropriate precautionary and advisory action to protect and inform consumers about this risk has been extensively considered and publicised by the Food Standards Agency in recent times.
<P>

<a name="21107w19.html_para2">The European Commission has meanwhile issued proposals for action amongst other things to prevent certain susceptible sheep from entering the food chain. These proposals relate only to those holdings where scrapie has been confirmed as present.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> There is epidemiological evidence that homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increasing levels of some B vitamins, including B6, may reduce blood levels of homocysteine. However, there is not yet conclusive evidence that reducing blood homocysteine&#151;through increased intake of B vitamins&#151;has a direct impact on the incidence of CVD. There are on-going randomised controlled trials assessing the impact of lowering homocysteine levels on the incidence of heart disease.
<P>

<a name="21107w19.html_para6">The evidence to date suggests that B6 may have a positive effect on pre-menstrual symptoms, but this is based on limited information from poor quality trials. Further trials are required to confirm an association.

 Where a patient has a medical need for transport as determined by the clinician in charge of their case, then transport should be provided free of charge, as part of National Health Service treatment. Where patients need financial assistance the hospital travel cost scheme has been established as part of the NHS low income scheme. This provides financial assistance to the patients who do not have a medical need for ambulance transport, but who nevertheless, require assistance in meeting the cost of travel to hospital for transport.

<a name="21107w21.html_para6">It is very important that children with speech and language difficulties access appropriate intervention as soon as a problem is identified.

 Since 1997, information about meningitis and septicaemia has been included in both the <i>Guide to Childhood Immunisations</i> and the <i>Guide to Pre-school Immunisations</i>. These leaflets are made available to all parents of every new baby and all parents of every preschool child.

<a name="21107w23.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department has not made an estimation of the number of asylum seekers in each London Borough who do not have access to a general practitioner (GP). Asylum seekers are regarded as ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and therefore entitled to free treatment by a GP. The use of initiatives such as local development schemes and personal medical pilots have assisted asylum seekers and other vulnerable sectors of the population accessing GPs and other primary care services.

<P>
<a name="21107w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Following the South Staffordshire strategic review public consultation, it was decided that day surgery should be concentrated at Tamworth and Cannock, in order to provide the highest quality facilities for South Staffordshire patients in purpose-built environments, and to maximise the potential of day surgery usage in the county, by concentrating three sites onto two.
<P>

<a name="21107w24.html_para0">Day surgery at Lichfield ended in December 2001 and there are no plans to re-provide day surgery in the new hospital at Lichfield. It is, however, planned that the new hospital will benefit from, for example, an improved minor injuries unit, better x-ray services, more examining rooms in the outpatients department and modern facilities for the public.

 The Department has carried out two surveys of National Health Service use of the independent sector for acute elective care in 2000&#150;2001. The first survey, begun last October, sought information on actual use in the first half of the year, along with planned use in the second half of that year. Information on actual use in the second half of the year was sought in a further survey begun in August this year. The results of that further survey are now being collated. We will consider the best way to make the findings publicly available once the analysis of the second survey has been completed.

 All the research that the Medical Research Council (MRC) supports is biomedical research. An estimated 60 per cent. of the Department's research expenditure is used in the National Health Service to support research by the MRC, by medical research charities and by other research collaborators, a substantial part of which is to support the clinical stages of biomedical research. The Department and the NHS also directly fund health services' biomedical research; for example, through genetics knowledge parks and other programmes. Some 40 per cent. of the Department's policy research programme expenditure is on biomedical research.

The MRC has appointed an independent scientific advisory group, which will draw on the report of the Chief Medical Officer's Working Group, published in January 2002, on other recent expert reviews in this field and on research reported in the peer reviewed literature. The MRC is committed to the development of a research strategy for CFS/ME that will advance understanding of the aetiology, epidemiology and

 I have been asked to reply. The Prison Service's strategy to reduce self-inflicted deaths includes changes to the physical environment, such as the re-design of cell windows and furniture to reduce ligature points. It has already produced, tested and procured a safer cell design, a number of installations of which have already been completed and are in use. Safer cell designs address the design of furniture, toilets and basin fixtures, windows, lighting and heating. The Prison Service is also developing a second stage safer cell design as well as reviewing current cell furniture designs and producing new ones, so that standard-issue cell furniture may benefit from an improved reduced-ligature design.

<P>
<a name="21107w30.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are confident that the proposed transfer of responsibility for alcohol licensing from licensing justices to local authorities will assist its efforts to reduce crime and the fear of crime. Since 1998 local authorities have had a leading statutory role in preventing local crime and disorder and the link between alcohol and crime is therefore a strong argument for them taking responsibility for alcohol licensing.
<P>

<a name="21107w30.html_para0">The transfer of responsibility should not however be considered in isolation. The Government's proposed Alcohol and Entertainment Licensing Bill will also include a whole package of measures designed to reduce crime and the fear of crime. These will include providing the police with extended powers to close pubs, clubs and off-licences that create disorder. The Bill will strengthen the law on the sale of alcohol to under-18s and will give the police greater powers to confiscate alcohol in certain public areas. It will abolish the artificially early closing times that are the source of much of the trouble on our streets at night and there will be enhanced police powers to confiscate alcohol. Local residents will also be able to object to any premises licence application, or request a review of a licence that has been granted, if they have concerns about that licence in relation to crime.

<a name="21107w32.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many illegal meat imports were identified by Customs and Excise entering the UK in each of the last 10 years, broken down by category and where they were discovered. [78656]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The records held by Defra on the seizure of illegal food imports date back to 1 April 2001. Prior to that date, information on seizures was not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="21107w32.html_para2">Since 1 April 2001, HM Customs and Excise have reported a total of 2147 seizures to Defra. Of those, there have been 1473 seizures of meat, 269 of fish, 58 of dairy products, 330 multiple seizures in which more than one type of produce of animal origin was found and 17 other seizures (which included products such as honey).
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which of the notifiable diseases mentioned in Schedule 2A of the Government's Animal Health Bill 2001 she estimates are able to enter the country by illegally imported bushmeat.  [75933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no precise definition of the term bushmeat, but this is generally understood to mean the meat of wild animals hunted for food, derived mainly from Central and West African countries.
<P>

<a name="21107w32.html_para3">As part of our Action Plan on illegal imports, we are carrying out a risk assessment to provide information on the likelihood that infected meat will enter the country undetected and infect susceptible livestock. This risk assessment is nearing completion. The risk assessment is focussing initially on the risk posed by Foot and Mouth Disease, though further work will follow on the swine diseases (Classical and African swine fever, swine vesicular disease). It would be possible to use the risk assessment model for other diseases as listed in Schedule 2A, where necessary and appropriate.
<P>

<a name="21107w32.html_para4">Of the diseases listed in Schedule 2A of the Animal Health Bill, Bluetongue and African horse sickness are not transmissible through meat/meat products (they are insect-borne). Other diseases are transmissible via meat, although the risks vary considerably. Generally, the viruses and bacteria present will depend on the species of meat, handling following slaughter, the processing it has undergone (for example, viruses are unlikely to survive the drying or smoking process), whether the product is on the bone, or has large quantities of offal, the temperature at which it has been kept and the length

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many prosecutions there have been since January 2000 of persons found to be selling illegally imported meat products.  [75929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Responsibility for enforcing the law on imported meat products at the point of sale lies with local authorities. Information on prosecutions is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="21107w32.html_para5">Defra is aware that in 2001, HM Customs and Excise prosecuted three people for offences relating to the import of meat covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Two were convicted on CITES offences and one was acquitted, but convicted under a separate Animal Health charge. This year, we are aware of one successful prosecution brought by Crawley Borough Council in July, and six cautions issued by the London Port Health Authority in October. All related to the illegal importation of animal products.

<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; if she will list the biosecurity measures, introduced by the Government at UK air and seaports since the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak.  [77541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Biosecurity measures are in place at various points in the production chain. For example, leaflets giving advice on biosecurity have been issued to farmers. Due to the increased numbers of animals being imported to replace livestock, surveillance for certain diseases, (for example brucellosis) has been enhanced. The Government has introduced new biosecurity requirements for premises assembling live animals for intra-Community trade. These are in addition to the EU animal health rules covering assembly centres.
<P>

<a name="21107w32.html_para6">The Government's Action Plan on Illegal Imports, published on 28 March set out measures to reduce the risk of animal and plant diseases entering the country. Since publication of the Plan, a number of measures have been put into place specifically at air and seaports. On 22 May, enforcement officers were given additional powers to search commercial consignments and personal baggage for illegal imports. We have increased the number and improved the locations of posters explaining our import controls at the major UK airports. On 19 September, a six month pilot using detector dogs began at Heathrow. In this financial year, an extra #1.5 million has been allocated for checks to be conducted by additional enforcement officers at certain ports and airports. A risk assessment was commissioned to ascertain the amount of illegal imports, the risk that they are infected with a major animal disease, and the probability that the disease could enter the food chain, infecting our livestock and wildlife. The results of this risk assessment are due later this autumn and will help us determine the extent of the problem and the appropriate level of response.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what research has been conducted by her Department on assessing the role of consumer choice in product purchase and its impact on energy efficiency and total energy demand from domestic electrical appliances.  [77594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department's Market Transformation Programme (MTP), working with the Energy Saving Trust, the Carbon Trust, manufacturers, retailers and other experts, carries out or acquires market research and analysis to help develop measures for reducing the total energy consumed by domestic appliances and other equipment. MTP currently maintains detailed consultative Policy Briefs accounting

for around 90 per cent. of domestic energy consumption with baselines and projections to 2010 and beyond. All this information is open to scrutiny and review on the programme web-site (www.mtprog.com)
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para0">The role of consumer choice and reliable consumer environmental product information is a central consideration in constructing effective action programmes. The approach is to achieve better choice of efficient products by stimulating innovation and competition (for example, by mandatory EU ''A to G'' energy rating labels); encouraging market take-up of the best available products (for example, by the ''Energy Efficiency Recommended'' endorsement scheme and the Energy Efficiency Commitment); and discouraging the poorest performing equipment, by regulation or by voluntary agreements with industry.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para1">Our analysis shows that this approach has been very successful in increasing consumer choice of efficient products and in raising overall efficiency levels. For example, in 1995 the most efficient fridges and freezers generally available to UK consumers would have been rated ''B'', with nearly half of UK consumers choosing the least efficient categories ''D, E and F''. Today, the range of choice is within a much higher band of energy performance: the most efficient products actually exceeding the ''A'' rating and only a very few available below a ''C'' rating.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government take the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria very seriously and is developing policies to minimise unnecessary use of antibiotics in controlling animal diseases.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para2">One of the key planks of the Government's strategy to reduce the amount of antibiotics used on farm is to encourage the prudent use of all medicines. The Government actively supports the activities of the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture (RUMA) alliance in helping to promote this message.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para3">Government policy on this issue is informed by the advice of its specialist advisory committees. My Department funds a research programme with a principle aim of reducing the use of antibiotics by developing alternative approaches to animal disease control.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para4">The Government also monitor annually the sale of antibiotics for use in animals in the UK. In February 2002 the Government published the latest of its annual reports for sales of antimicrobial products used as veterinary medicines, growth promoters and coccidiostats. The report showed that 437 tonnes of active ingredient of therapeutic antimicrobials were sold for food producing animals in 2000. This slight increase over the previous period is believed to be due in the main to the EU ban of some antimicrobial growth promoters in June 1999, which resulted in a rise in clinical infections in animals that required treatment. There has also been an increased need to treat secondary infections in pigs suffering from two new diseases in the pig

 I represented the UK at Environment Council on 17 October, accompanied by Mr. Ross Finnie, the Scottish Executive Minister for Environment and Rural Development. This was the first Environment Council of the Danish Presidency. It was also the first to be held under the Council's new rules of procedure, which provide that final debates and votes on legislative proposals subject to co-decision with the European Parliament are held in public. The Council reached political agreement on 3 proposals and made progress on a range of other important issues.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para7">The Council reached political agreement on a Common Position on the revision of the EC Directive on packaging and packaging waste, which was along the lines of the general approach adopted at June Council. I strongly supported this proposal, which sets targets for recovery and recycling that the UK will find challenging, but achievable. These include a minimum 60 per cent. recovery target and recycling targets between 55&#150;70 per cent., with a 2008 deadline for implementation. The only opposition was from Belgium and the Netherlands, who would have preferred even more demanding targets.

<a name="21107w33.html_para9">Political agreement was also reached on a Regulation to complete implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in relation to transboundary movements of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) from the Community. Along with the Commission, I argued that the Regulation should be as closely consistent with the Protocol as possible. After lengthy negotiations we secured significant improvements to the text, namely that the form of identification of GMOs in mixed bulk shipments should be consistent with other EC legislation, including existing legislation on the release of GMOs and the forthcoming proposed Regulation on traceability and labelling. Furthermore, express consent from the importer will be required for the first international transboundary movement of GM material. On the basis of the improved text I was able to support the political agreement.
<P>

<a name="21107w33.html_para10">There was a short discussion on the proposed Regulation on traceability and labelling of GMOs in products. This focussed on links with a proposal to cover GMOs in food and feed, which had been discussed at Agriculture Council earlier in the same week.

 The Government monitored progress on Local Agenda 21 (LA21) until the end of 2000. By then over 93 per cent. of local authorities in England and Wales had LA21 strategies in place. There had also been a number of studies into LA21 in the UK. The Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on local authorities to prepare community strategies for promoting the economic, social and environmental well being of their communities and contributing to sustainable development in the UK. The Government's statutory guidance says that authorities should build on the experience of partnership working and community engagement gained through LA21. The Government does not require authorities to submit their community strategies. However, there is a Best Value Performance Indicator which monitors authorities' timetable for preparing community strategies whilst checking that they adhere to the key aims and components set out in the guidance.

The above amounts score within Departmental Expenditure Limits, and exclude overheads for central services provided by the core department. They are subject to in year review and adjustment.<P>

The three Executive Agencies (*) operate on a net administration costs basis, whereby gross costs are matched by income, and have full cost recovery targets. To make their budgets more meaningful the offsetting income has been excluded from the above table.<P>

The NDPBs&#151;Countryside Agency, Environment Agency, and English Nature&#151;resource and capital allocations for 2003&#150;04 will be finalised shortly. Those for the executive agencies are still under review and will be confirmed as part of the Business Planning process.<P>

 The final number of responses received by the Government in reply to the public consultation letter of 27 March 2001 on the proposal to ban swill feeding reached 351. Of those a minority objected to the proposed ban. To review all those responses again for the details requested would involve my Department in disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="21107w34.html_para2">A letter was sent on 9 May 2001 to all those that were consulted to advise on the decision that had been reached and to provide advice for producers who were feeding swill at that time. The advice was re-issued 2 days later to clarify certain paragraphs and to delete some of the advice on the disposal of unprocessed swill which was incorrect.

<P>
<a name="21107w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU subsidy is intended to encourage the consumption of milk by children by reducing the cost of its provision in schools. In the UK it may be claimed by those education authorities which choose to provide children up to the age of 11 with milk. In the UK there were, in the 2000&#150;01 school year, 208 such claimants.

 The prices charged by retailers, or those negotiated between farmers and purchasers, or between processors and retailers, are private commercial matters. Defra Ministers cannot and have not sought to get involved in price negotiations with farmers, retailers or processors, although the market situation in the diary sector is naturally an issue that does arise during discussions. Meetings of an informal dairy supply chain group, chaired by my noble friend Lord Whitty, have addressed the issue of supply volatility and its effect on farmgate milk prices and, at its last meeting in September, representatives from different parts of the supply chain reported their views on the recently announced price increases. The Governments welcomes any action that will assist the long term sustainability of the dairy sector.

 The Parrett Catchment Project is an independent body. I am advised that up to July 2002, the Chairman has claimed second class train fares, mileage and subsistence. These claims were made at standard County Council rates up to June 2001, and thereafter at Environment Agency rates, for meetings attended on Parrett Catchment Project business. Claims for the period since July 2002 have not yet been made.

<a name="21107w35.html_para1">The above claims contain animals whose eligibility could not be established under the Commission Regulations, which govern the bovine schemes. The RPA regrets the delays and the impact on farmer's cash flow, but cannot ignore the discrepancies discovered through cross-checks, or indeed any other verification method employed by the Agency. Failure to act on the findings identified will result in significant disallowance.
<P>

<a name="21107w35.html_para2">The Commission have indicated that all cross-checks should be carried out prior to payment as they view these checks as a key control to the fund. If RPA were found to be making unsafe payments it would inevitably face disallowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if the Government will introduce legislation to compel the use of biodegradeable materials for packaging of goods. [70260]<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w36.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Some retailers are using a substitute for plastics in some types of packaging made from potato starch. This material is entirely biodegradeable and can be composted. Other biodegradeable materials are manufactured based on modified plastics made from mineral oil. These materials still have to be sent for recycling after use. We do not therefore plan to introduce legislation to compel the use of biodegradeable materials for packaging of goods, but we do strongly support the development of biodegradeable materials from non-fossil sources.

<P>
<a name="21107w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2002]:</i> The European Commission has yet to bring forward its proposals for the management of commercial fish stocks in 2003, following the recent recommendations from international scientists for a moratorium on most directed cod fishing and also on fishing for other species unless the taking of cod as a bycatch can be eliminated. We are working closely with the fishing industry to devise a package of measures which we can advocate in the EU and which will respect the scientific assessment whilst as far as possible keeping fishing opportunities open for the industry. We have already reminded the Commission of our view&#151;substantiated last year by detailed scientific analysis&#151;that curbing nephrops fishing brings minimal benefit to cod.

<a name="21107w36.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Alan Reid: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to the Answer from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute at European Standing Committee A on 23 April, 2002 <i>Official Report</i>, column 7, if she will place in the Library <i>(a)</i> her Department's evidence to the European Commission which demonstrated that the level of cod by-catch in the nephrops fishery was very small and that the Commission's figures were an overestimate and <i>(b)</i> the European Commission's response; and if she will make a statement.  [80055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w36.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Fisheries Departments in the UK submitted material to the European Commission on several occasions in 2001, refuting in detail the Commission's argument that cutting nephrops fishing significantly benefits cod stocks. The specifics of this correspondence are confidential, but the basis of the case was figures demonstrating that landings of cod did not increase in line with landings of nephrops. This material was submitted in support of the UK's request for in-year restoration of the cuts that were made to the Total Allowable Catches for nephrops in the North Sea, in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland in 2001: in response, the Commission did not agree to restore the cuts, but did subsequently largely withdraw its 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 585W</I><P>
proposals for further substantial cuts for 2002. Restoration of the cuts made in 2001 is an issue we are still actively pressing with the Commission.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w36.html_wqn5"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what estimate her Department has made of the weight and value of cod discarded in each of the fish management areas in the seas around the UK as a result of an unintentional by-catch of over quota cod in each year since 1997 and the latest available estimate for 2002;  [79022]
<P>
<UL>(2) if her Department has estimated the total weight and potential value of fish discarded by UK fishing vessels as a result of the unintentional by-catch of over quota fish.  [79023]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w36.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Estimates of discards are obtained by placing observers on a random sample of fishing vessels. Observers are not in a position to establish fully the reasons why fish are discarded, but the main reasons appear to be that fish are undersized, not of sufficient quality, or damaged. We are not able at this time to provide estimates for discards of all species in all sea areas. Estimates of the weight of cod discards (in tonnes, gutted) by <i>(a)</i> English and Welsh vessels in the North Sea and Irish Sea and <i>(b)</i> UK vessels landing into Scotland, are set out below.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> The UK is obliged under Community law to match-fund, pound for pound, money raised through modulating Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) production subsidies. Under current plans, the rate of modulation will rise from the present 3 per cent. to 4.5 per cent. by 2006.
<P>

<a name="21107w36.html_para3">The spending plans for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, set out in the 2002 Spending Review White Paper ''Opportunity and Security for All'' (Command Paper 5570) presented to the House on 15 July by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, include provision for match funding of #75m in 2005&#150;06. This would be necessary if the rate of modulation were to be increased to 10 per cent. from 2005&#150;06, as recommended by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. However, a decision on increasing national modulation has yet to be taken. The final decision will depend on factors including the success of a pilot to test the Policy Commission's recommendation for an entry-level agri-environment scheme, and the outcome of negotiations on the Mid-Term review of the CAP.

<a name="21107w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Defra Ministers hold many meetings with farming organisations to discuss all manner of topics. However, there have been no recent meetings to discuss fly tipping specifically. The Government is, however, keen to find out more about the causes of fly tipping and has commissioned research into fly tipping on agricultural land.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 587W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para0">Fly tipped waste is a blight on our countryside and towns. There are stringent controls in place to ensure that waste is dealt with properly. Where waste is disposed of illegally, it is clearly essential that steps are taken to dispose of the waste safely and properly to eliminate the risk of environmental pollution or harm to human health. The Environment Agency and local authorities, in their role as waste collection authority, may themselves take steps to remove fly tipped waste. DEFRA works closely with the fly tipping stakeholders forum to develop practical ways to combat the problem.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para1">A Tidy Britain Group Report <i>Effects of the Landfill Tax on Fly Tipping</i> (published in 1998) did not establish any clear link between the tax and increased fly tipping. Indeed, the Report states that in 1997&#150;98, domestic waste was, overall, the type of fly tipped waste most frequently collected by local authorities. As the tax does not directly affect householders it is unlikely to cause householders to fly tip waste. Moreover, each Waste Disposal Authority has a duty under section 51 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to provide civic amenity sites for the deposit of household waste.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Since an additional #3 million was made available to the State Veterinary Service earlier this year, veterinary, technical and administrative staff have been recruited to bring the administrative and veterinary teams dealing with TB in the Gloucester Animal Health Divisional Office up to full strength. Twenty temporary and casual staff have been recruited specifically for TB testing in addition to the normal complement of veterinary officers. This is starting to have a significant impact across the range of critical TB areas.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para2">In early October Defra announced additional measures for the control of bovine TB in England, which included a timetable for the imposition of movement restrictions on herds with overdue tests. Within the Gloucester region the backlog of overdue tests is being actively managed to ensure that the number of herds put under restriction early next year as a result of the new measure is kept to a minimum. A dedicated team of six administrative staff has been set up to support the process. Letters will be sent out shortly to those farmers potentially affected encouraging them to arrange early TB tests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, how many climate change agreements within the meaning of paragraph 47 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000 and variations, she has entered into and what the name is of the other party or parties to each such agreement or variation; if she will make a statement in relation to each such agreement on the description of energy-intensive installations within paragraph 51 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000 to which it relates; and if she will place in the Library copies of all such agreements and variations.  [78726]<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There is one climate change agreement under paragraph 47 of Schedule 2 to the Finance Act 2000, which provided for the unique case where there was only one company operating a specific eligible IPPC process. The agreement under this paragraph therefore combines the provisions of the umbrella and underlying agreements within the meaning of paragraph 48. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House and on the DEFRA website. The agreement contains the names of the relevant parties and a description of the type of the installation covered by the agreement. There have been no variations to this agreement.

[80349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There were two main outcomes from the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in New Delhi, India from 23 October to 1 November 2002.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para5">The first was that good progress was made on several technical issues which are key to building the architecture for effective implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para6">The first report of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board, established at COP7 in Marrakech, was approved. This will allow for the prompt start of the CDM and projects should start to come through the system next year. This should result in investment benefits for developing countries and help developed countries meet their Kyoto commitments. Work on how to include afforestation and reforestation projects under the CDM continued and is on track for agreement on schedule at COP10.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 590W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para7">The final element of the guidelines on the reporting and review of accounting for total emissions under Marrakech Accords (the rules implementing Kyoto) was agreed. Regular reporting and review is essential, for transparency in the system and to ensure that parties are keeping to detailed trading rules.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para8">There were also productive discussions on legal and institutional matters, in particular on how the first meeting of the Kyoto Protocol governing body should be convened in conjunction with the Convention governing body.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para9">Guidance was also agreed on how developing countries should report information to the COP in their national communications. This is essential for assessing the size of the global problem and as a basis for informing decisions on future action. Guidance was also agreed for the new funds agreed in Bonn and Marrakech last year.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para10">The second outcome was the Delhi Declaration on climate change and sustainable development. Negotiations on the text were dominated by the developing country concerns of vulnerability to climate change and the fneed for countries to adapt to it effects, and by their reluctance to initiate a process for considering what more needs to be done by the international community until greater progress has been made in implementing existing commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The final text was therefore less forward-looking than we and our EU partners would have liked. Nevertheless, the Declaration makes important points about setting climate change in the context of sustainable development and puts a welcome focus on the needs of developing countries in trying to adapt to climate change.
<P>

<a name="21107w37.html_para11">There were no UK submissions on issues discussed in New Delhi because the EU negotiates as a block in the UNFCCC. Denmark, which currently holds the Presidency, made submissions on behalf of all Member States. I have today placed copies of all EU submissions relevant to UK policy in the library, along with those from other Parties to the UNFCCC on the same subjects, and a copy of the final text of the Delhi Declaration. When they are available, I will also place copies of the formal EU statements made during the conference in the Library.

<P>
<a name="21107w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 These data are not collected centrally in the format requested. However, the Environment Agency estimate that about 13 million tyres are currently stockpiled in 38 sites in England. The majority of the tyres are held within 8 sites, including one which holds about 9 million of the tyres. This site is covered to provide protection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w38.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government in partnership with the tyre industry through the Used Tyre Working Group (UTWG) is investigating alternative disposal, recycling and recovery options for those tyres displaced from landfill with the aim of ensuring that sufficient capacity is available to handle those tyres.
<P>

<a name="21107w38.html_para0">The prospect of the extra required tyre recovery capacity being developed in time for the 2006 ban appears encouraging. It is likely that cement kilns (who use tyres as fuel) will take very significant numbers of tyres provided they obtain the necessary authorisations (four kilns already use tyres).
<P>

<a name="21107w38.html_para1">In addition, the market for tyre granulate is growing. Tyre granulate has a number of applications including carpet underlay and sports and safety surfaces. Government is supporting a number of end-use studies including its incorporation in road surfaces and as an aggregate replacement in concrete. Other studies are looking at new processes to break down used tyres as well as looking at ways of improving the efficiency of present materials recycling operations. Government is also supporting research into the use of tyres in coastal and flood protection schemes.
<P>

<a name="21107w38.html_para2">There is also research underway, funded through the Landfill Tax Credits Scheme in collaboration with the Transport Research Laboratory and the Institute of Civil Engineers, to produce guidance on civil engineering applications for used tyres to stimulate market development. Whole tyres are already used extensively as an engineering material in landfill sites.
<P>

<a name="21107w38.html_para3">More widely, research is underway on creating longer-lasting tyres (without compromising safety) in order to help reduce the amount of tyres entering the waste stream in the first place.

<i>[holding answer 5 November 2002]:</i> No grants are available for Beef Assurance Scheme members who are having difficulties finding local abattoirs willing to slaughter cattle aged 30&#150;42 months because of EU requirements on testing and the removal of vertebral column. However, the Food Standards Agency will seek to put members in touch with abattoirs which will slaughter such cattle.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w38.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A number of changes to the 20 day whole farm standstill rule have been made over recent months, following detailed discussions with industry and veterinary organisations. These include exemptions, subject to risk mitigating conditions, for breeding animals, calves, tack sheep and all movements direct to slaughter. Most recently, an exemption from the whole farm standstill was introduced on 6 September 2002 for cattle and sheep moved for breeding purposes, if they remain in approved isolation facilities for 20 days.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if she will make an amendment to the 20 day standstill rule in the event of livestock being brought to feed for a period ranging from three to 12 months where the bid price is not reached to enable the producer to take livestock home and to prevent cattle and sheep from being slaughtered. [79437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w38.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The mixing of animals at auction markets and their subsequent dispersal poses a particular disease risk so it is unlikely that any special exemptions to the 20 day rule will be introduced to cover these particular circumstances.

 It is not possible to provide data relating to the Shrewsbury and Atcham area. This is because the sample size of the Farm Business Survey (the basis of the income data) is too small to enable robust regional analysis to this level of disaggregation. The closest region available is England West.
<P>

The data for each year provide the best estimate of income levels in each year in isolation but they should not be viewed as a time series. Each year is not directly comparable due to changes in the underlying sample that occur each year in the Farm Business Survey (the basis for the income data).

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21107w40.html_para1">This information is not held centrally in the form requested, because ''beneficial use'' is not a criterion in the main regime which helps to secure the remediation of land affected by contamination. From April 2000, Part IIA (''contaminated land'') of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 placed local authorities in England under a duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land, as defined in the Act, and secure its remediation on the ''suitable for use'' principle. Some 40 sites have so far been formally identified under this regime, and remediation is underway in some of these cases. The main aim of this regime is environmental protection, rather than future land use, and contaminated sites may well be in beneficial use already.
<P>

<a name="21107w40.html_para2">The majority of remediation, however, takes place as part and parcel of the development of land, regulated through the planning system and building regulations; through urban regeneration programmes including the activities of regional development agencies and English Partnerships; through voluntary action by landowners including many major companies; through enforcement of environmental protection regimes; and through the programme of supplementary credit approvals for local authorities operated by my department. An overview is provided by a recent Environment Agency report, ''Dealing with contaminated land in England'', copies of which have been placed in the Library.

<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he has contingency plans to allow the Armed Forces access to standard fire service fire engines during Fire Service strikes.  [77024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We are currently reviewing the availability of all appliances that could be deployed in the event of a strike by firefighters.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he has taken to provide for emergency cover in the event of floods during any strike by fire brigade personnel.  [77793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The role played by the Fire Service in relation to flooding is to assist with rescue and to pump water from flooded properties. In the event of industrial action, the military response will be primarily directed towards saving life. It is therefore important that local authorities should ensure they are up to date with names of contractors and equipment suppliers who could be called upon to assist during a flooding event. They should also formulate plans to arrange early evacuation if severe flooding is forecast.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para8">The Environment Agency's flood warning systems will continue to operate as normal. The Agency has also reviewed its emergency plans, in close liaison with local authorities and the police. The Agency will seek to assist the emergency services and local authorities as far as practicable by mobilising their resources including pumps and equipment, once it has ensured that its own systems and defences are secure.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what his estimate is of the number of fire fighting emergency vehicles which will be available in Somerset in the event of a firefighters strike; how many are available in a non-strike situation; and if he will make a statement;  [77002]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the Government's target is for the maximum time taken to get a fire engine to an emergency call-out within Somerset; what assessment he has made of whether this target will still be met during the planned firefighters' strike; and if he will make a statement; [77521]
<P>
(3) what correspondence he has received within the last two months from the Leader of Somerset County Council about the firefighters' strike; if he will publish his response to such correspondence; and if he will make a statement;  [77522]

(5) how many fire engines will be available for deployment in the Yeovil constituency during the planned firefighters' strike; what assessment he has made of the minimum safe level; and if he will make a statement.  [77525]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Emergency cover in Somerset is currently planned to consist of a number of elements including five Green Goddesses, three breathing apparatus teams (BARTs), rescue teams equipped with specialist equipment, (RESTs) and the police. The Somerset Fire Brigade has 48 pumping appliances, although not all these will be operational at any one time. Two Green Goddesses and a BART will be based at RNAS Yeovilton, 2 Green Goddesses, a BART and a REST will be based at Taunton. 1 Green Goddess and 1 BART will be based at Bridgewater.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para9">The provision of Ministry of Defence emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to minimise call-out response times and maximise the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para10">The command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, whether from within a county or from assets deployed nearby in neighbouring counties. The deployment of firefighters will be based on the assessment of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible. The deployment will be kept under review.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para11">The target attendance times for Fire Brigade appliances vary according to the location of the reported incident, ranging from five minutes in busy high risk city centres to twenty minutes in rural areas. In the event of a firefighters strike it is not expected that military emergency cover would be able to match these attendance times in all cases. In providing emergency fire cover the Ministry of Defence would not be seeking to replicate the current fire fighting capability. The Armed Forces role during any strike will be to ensure 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 604W</I><P>
that essential services are maintained by providing emergency cover and, by so doing, minimise the risk to life.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para12">The Leader of Somerset Council wrote to the Deputy Prime Minster on 4 and 25 October. My reply, which I have copied to local MPs, reflects what I have said above about the provision of emergency cover by the Ministry of Defence.

<a name="21107w41.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Djanogly: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what preparations he has made to ensure the safety and continuity of service to the public in Cambridgeshire in the event of a firefighters' strike; and what the cost is to the Department of these actions.  [79566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Emergency cover in Cambridgeshire is currently planned to consist of seven Green Goddesses, three breathing apparatus teams (BARTs), a rescue team equipped with specialist equipment, (a REST) and the police. The Green Goddesses and BARTs will be based at Peterborough, Huntingdon and Cambridge. The REST will be based at Cambridge.
<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para13">The provision of Ministry of Defence emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to minimise call-out response times and maximise the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.

<P>

<a name="21107w41.html_para15">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will meet the additional costs incurred by the Ministry of Defence in providing emergency fire cover in England and Wales, net of savings in wages lost by striking firefighters. But it is very difficult to predict exactly what the cost will be. It will depend very much on what strike action the Fire Brigades Union actually takes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w41.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Laws: </B>

<a name="21107w41.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Independent Review of the Fire Service is being conducted by Professor Sir George Bain, who has an outstanding record in industrial relations and academia. He is being assisted by Sir Anthony Young, past President of the TUC, and Sir Michael Lyons, who until recently was the Chief Executive of Birmingham City Council. The membership of the Independent Review team has not changed since it was announced in early September. Sir George hopes to be able to publish the final report in December.

<a name="21107w42.html_para9">No formal sustainability audit was carried out but sustainability issues, such as the accessibility of the venue by public transport, were factors in the criteria for selecting the venue.
<P>

<a name="21107w42.html_para10">Debate on urban issues at the Summit took place not just in the plenary sessions, but also in 28 themed sessions. The key messages and ideas which came out of those sessions are being gathered together and will be fed into the development of the long term plan for sustainable communities which the Deputy Prime Minister will be presenting to the House in January 2003. A report on the Summit's proceedings will be deposited in the House of Commons library.

 The following information relates to appeal decisions about telecommunications development generally, as information is not held about appeal decisions for mobile phone masts and base stations specifically.

 The Government do not collect information about the number of persons granted refugee status or exceptional leave to remain who are allocated housing accommodation by local housing authorities under Part 6 of the Housing Act 1996, or allocated accommodation by registered social landlords. Nor does the Government collect information specifically about the number of persons granted refugee status or exceptional leave to remain who are accepted as owed a duty by a local housing authority under Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 (as amended by the Homelessness Act 2002).

The degree of response and the quality of data received varied widely and the data we hold for the April to June 2002 quarter are not considered reliable. Information for the July to September 2002 quarter will be available in December 2002. These data do not, however, identify refugees and persons granted exceptional leave to remain who were not accommodated by NASS.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister which of his Department's Public Service Agreements relate to fuel poverty reduction; and what progress has been made to date in achieving them.  [79502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w45.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Public Service Agreement to bring all social housing up to a decent standard and to increase the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector who live in homes that are in decent condition by 2010 will contribute to a reduction in fuel poverty. To be classed as decent, a home must provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort by providing efficient heating and effective insulation, measures which will make homes cheaper to heat.
<P>

<a name="21107w45.html_para7">On the social sector side of the target, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is on track to meet its interim target of tackling a third of the worst social housing by 2004 and is working to ensure it meets the target by reviewing all policies that contribute to the delivery of decent social housing to ensure they are as effective as possible and provide value for money.
<P>

<a name="21107w45.html_para8">For the private sector side of the target, officials are in the process of drawing up a delivery plan with colleagues in DEFRA responsible for the home energy efficiency scheme. The plan will set out in detail how the target will be delivered and include the steps that will be taken to ensure the contributing policies and procedures are working together as efficiently as possible.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will estimate the number of fuel-poor households who occupy dwellings that meet the Thermal Comfort criteria of the Decent Homes Standard; and how many households in this sector will remain fuel poor after all social housing complies with the standard.  [75904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w45.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We will not have up-to-date figures of the numbers of fuel poor households living in decent homes until we complete the relevant parts of the analysis of the 2001 English House Condition Survey, in early 2003. This work will be undertaken jointly between ODPM, DEFRA and DTI.
<P>

<a name="21107w45.html_para9">To estimate the numbers of households who will be living in fuel poor households after all social housing is brought up to a decent standard in 2010 requires a number of assumptions about influencing factors such as energy prices and incomes. We are not able to provide a robust estimate of these factors at this time.

Ministers set the Housing Corporation a target to complete a minimum of 21,000 dwellings in England in 2002&#150;03. The Corporation's Investment Bulletin, published in April 2002, forecast that approximately 5,200 of these units would be in London.<P>

The bidding round for the 2003&#150;04 approved development programme (ADP) is now in progress. The Housing Corporation's Investment Bulletin for 2003&#150;04 will be published early next year.<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister collects information about previously developed land, distinguishing between that in the ownership of the private sector, local authorities and other public sector bodies, and the borough in which it is located. ODPM published National Land Use Database&#151;Previously Developed Land (NLUD-PDL) data for 2001 on 12th September 2002 and this is available at www.odpm.gov.uk, including a Supplementary Table on ''Previously developed land that is unused or may be available for redevelopment by land type and Planning Authority: England 2001''.

proposed measures will include a requirement for local authorities in England & Wales to licence those HMOs in their areas that pose the greatest risk to the health and safety of their occupiers. Underpinning the licensing regime and applying to all residential properties will be a new risk assessment based approach to housing conditions, which will replace the current prescriptive standards, and enable local authorities to target those HMOs with the worst housing conditions, including energy efficiency standards.

 Setting of council tenants' rents remains a matter for individual local authorities. Future council rent levels will be influenced by, among other things, the outcome of future Spending Reviews.
<P>

<a name="21107w47.html_para5">However, were London boroughs to follow our policy on rent restructuring, we estimate that on current assumptions the average rent paid by council tenants in London in 2011&#150;12 at the end of the ten year rent restructuring period, would be #8.17 higher in real terms in 2002&#150;2003 prices. This represents a real increase of 12.8 per cent., as a percentage of the Housing Revenue Account rental income of London boroughs for 2001&#150;2002 in today's prices.
<P>

<a name="21107w48.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There were 97 objectors to Policy SA 22 and 90 objectors to Policy SA 23 of the Deposit Draft of the Shropshire Waste Local Plan 2002&#150;2014. It is the responsibility of Shropshire County Council to consider these objections and to take the plan through all its stages. Information on the objectors and the details of each objection are not held in Government. Shropshire County Council intend to place all the objections to this Waste Local Plan on their website, www.shropshire-cc.gov.uk. In the meantime, they can be viewed by prior appointment at the Community and Environment Department, Shropshire County Council, Shirehall, Abbey Foregate, Shrewsbury (Telephone: 01743 252595).

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the steps which he is taking to promote building integrated renewables, with special reference to solar thermal and solar photovoltaics in new housing developments through the planning process.  [79792]<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w48.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We will be issuing a draft Planning Policy Statement note on Renewable Energy and Planning for consultation at the turn of the year. This updated PPS revises PPG22. It will include guidance on including integrated renewables in developments such as housing. Also, through our planning policies for housing we encourage local authorities to adopt policies which promote the energy efficiency of new housing where possible.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer of 22 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 283W, on the Seaside and Country Homes Scheme, if he will commission research into <i>(a)</i> the capacity of seaside and country areas in South East England for an expansion of the Seaside and Country Homes Scheme and <i>(b)</i> the likely popularity and take up of the Scheme.

<a name="21107w48.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is leading in the procurement of a new service to improve mobility, especially labour mobility for social housing tenants, throughout the UK. As part of the procurement of this service (currently going under the working name HEMS&#151;Housing and Employment Mobility Services) the operation and extent of the Seaside and Country Homes scheme is being reviewed. We expect to award the HEMS contract in March 2003 and for delivery of the new service to begin in July 2003.

<a name="21107w49.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister, what legislation is in force relating to overcrowding standards in housing; and when each provision came into force.  [80092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w49.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The current overcrowding standards are set out in Part X of the Housing Act 1985. The Room Standard is breached if two people of opposite sexes who are not living together as husband and wife must sleep in the same room. The Space Standard specifies the number of people who may sleep in a dwelling according to the number of rooms and their floor area. Both standards must be met. The 1985 Act is a consolidating Act. The standards were carried forward from the Housing Act 1957, which itself consolidates those which had originated in the Housing Act 1935.
<P>

<a name="21107w49.html_para0">In respect of houses in multiple occupation, local authorities also have powers under section 358 of the 1985 Act to serve an overcrowding notice where they are satisfied that there are, or there may become, an excessive number of people living in a property having regard to the number of rooms available. Such notice must specify the number of people who can occupy the property. Contravention of the notice is a criminal offence.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w49.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer of 22 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 284W, on overcrowding, if it is his policy <i>(a)</i> to end the practice of counting living rooms as rooms available to sleep in, <i>(b)</i> to end the practice of not counting babies under the age of one and <i>(c)</i> to lower the age at which males and females should no longer be expected to have to sleep in the same room for the purposes of determining overcrowding.

 We are considering whether overcrowding is best tackled through a modern set of standards&#151;updating the present legislative framework&#151;or through the new Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), which we hope to introduce as a replacement for the housing fitness standard when Parliamentary time allows. It will be possible to assess and tackle hazards from crowding and

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what contributions the United Kingdom has made through the EU to the North Korean light water nuclear reactor programme; and whether the United Kingdom was represented at the foundation laying ceremony in August.  [79928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w51.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The light water reactor project, established under the 1994 Agreed Framework, forms part of a package of measures introduced to bring DPRK into line with its international obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The UK contributions, made through the European Atomic Energy Commission, amount to a total of #10.64 million (up to the end of Financial year 2001&#150;02. This year's contribution has not yet been made).

<P>
<a name="21107w51.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The residents of Ascension Island voted overwhelmingly in August this year to establish an Island Council. This was a key step towards a 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 640W</I><P>
democratic system of government, the first in the island's history. The election of Councillors took place on 1 November, and has resulted in a broad cross-section of the island's population being represented on the Island Council. We hope that the Island Council will work closely with the Administrator and the Governor for the long-term benefit of Ascension Island.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the application for an export licence for the supply of two de-mining vests to the United Nations Office for Project Services in Sudan.<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w51.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Government recently approved an application for a licence to export two de-mining vests for the United Nations Office for Project Services in Sudan. Although the demining vests are on the Military List, they will be used to open roads and increase the cost effectiveness of the UN relief operation which is working to alleviate the suffering in Sudan. This decision does not affect the Government's continued support for the EU common position on arms exports to Sudan.

 Our views on Anwar Ibrahim's continuing imprisonment were expressed in an EU statement of 12 July 2002. That statement recalled our deep concern about the fairness of the trial and expressed disappointment that the verdict had been upheld on final appeal. Our High Commissioner has also discussed this issue with Malaysian ministers.

 Missile defence issues are discussed regularly in the course of official UK/US contacts. It remains the case that there has been no formal US request for the use of UK facilities for missile defence purposes. If a request is received, the Government will consider it. But the Government would only agree to use of UK facilities if satisfied that the overall security of the UK and NATO would be enhanced.

 There have been no formal assessments of the impact on the Consulates in California of the local Regional Development Agency (RDA) offices. However, if an RDA wishes to open a new (or expand an existing) overseas office, it is required to present a business case for prior approval by my noble Friend the Baroness Symons, and by the Consulate General.
<P>

<a name="21107w52.html_para0">Although the RDAs have no diplomatic remit, their presence can strengthen the FCO's public diplomacy effort, for example, when issues arise concerning a particular area of the UK (e.g. Northern Ireland).
<P>

<a name="21107w52.html_para1">Our Consulates in California have a good relationship with the RDAs, and integrate their business activities where practicable. To ensure there is no ''double handling'', the inward investment activity of the RDAs is regulated by the Committee on Overseas Promotion Guidelines, which require them to notify the relevant Post in advance before visiting companies within the Post's area of responsibility.

 The Charter is a political declaration. The Government strongly supports it. People need to know their rights and the EU institutions need to respect them.
<P>

<a name="21107w52.html_para2">The Government has always maintained that there are legal and practical problems linked to giving the text as its stands legal status. The Laeken European Council mandated the participants in the Future of Europe Convention to consider the Charter's status. We have worked hard in the Convention's Charter Working Group to find solutions to the issues of legal certainty that would need to be resolved before the UK could consider a change in the Charter's status.
<P>

<a name="21107w52.html_para3">In looking at the Charter's status, two key aspects of the existing text must be maintained: that the Charter is addressed to the Institutions and the Member States only to the extent they are implementing Union law; and 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 645W</I><P>
that the Charter creates no new power or tasks for the EC and does not modify powers or tasks defined by the Treaties.

 There was a fall in the number of preventive inspections between 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 from 116,652 to 75,237. Over the same period, there was a 35 per cent increase in the number of investigations. 



<P>

 Tenants in the pilot areas will have their rent paid to them rather than to their landlord. However, we appreciate that not all tenants will be able to cope with this responsibility. For this reason safeguards will be in place to ensure that landlords and vulnerable tenants are protected.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para5">For example, as now, where it is considered appropriate, the pathfinder authority will be able to make the first payment of benefit direct to the landlord.

 The standard local housing allowance will repeal the pre-1996 Housing Benefit restrictions in pathfinder local authority areas. The benefits to the gainers in the pathfinder areas will depend on the local conditions in those authorities that volunteer to become pathfinders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w53.html_spnew13"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) has an ongoing programme of inspections to help councils identify and act on weaknesses in their benefit services, and drive up standards of administration. On 25 September the BFI published a report of an inspection of Swale Borough Council conducted in spring 2002. The report commended Swale for clearing its backlog of benefit claims since the previous BFI inspection in 2000, and for improvements in the council's speed in processing benefit claims.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para9">Although it made further recommendations to help the council address ongoing weaknesses, we recognise the detrimental effect that delays in processing Housing Benefit claims can have on the ability of tenants to meet their rent responsibilities. That is why a key aim of our strategy for reforming Housing Benefit is to improve its administration.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para10">However there is no evidence to show a direct link between poor benefit administration and homelessness.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what reasons underlay his decision on the length of the period before landlords can begin receiving housing benefit directly if a tenant gets into arrears; and what assessment he has made of the impact of his decision on possession cases in shorthold tenancies. [80255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w53.html_spnew16"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The requirement that housing benefit payments must be made to the landlord if a tenant builds up rent arrears of 8 weeks is an established part of the benefit scheme and is linked to housing law, under which the establishment of at least 8 weeks' worth of rent arrears is a ground for eviction. We intend to maintain this requirement for the standard local housing allowance pathfinder areas, together with other safeguards to protect landlords and vulnerable tenants.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para13">We have made no assessment of the practical impact of the 8 week limit on possession cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on how the rapid re-claim facility for housing benefit will operate; and what targets have been set for the time taken to process these claims.  [80256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w53.html_spnew17"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We introduced Rapid Reclaim for Housing Benefit recipients on 28 October 2002.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para14">Rapid Reclaim removes barriers to taking and declaring work by reducing Housing Benefit recipients' concerns about the delays in reclaiming benefit if a job does not last. People of working age can re-claim Housing Benefit within 12 weeks of the end of their last claim, using a shortened, simplified claim form which includes a declaration that their circumstances are the same as when they previously claimed. Providing there have been no significant changes in circumstances, the local authority can process the claim based only on that declaration.
<P>

<a name="21107w53.html_para15">No clearance time targets have been set for Rapid Reclaim cases over and above the targets and performance indicators that already exist. However, the nature of Rapid Reclaim means that claims will be processed much more quickly than new Housing Benefit claims and that customers will therefore receive their benefit sooner.

 Our strategy for tackling fraud focuses on prevention by tightening the gateway to benefits, making stringent checks to verify a person's identity and details of their claim at the outset.
<P>

<a name="21107w54.html_para0">People from abroad who wish to claim benefits must first provide sufficient evidence of their identity and circumstances for a National Insurance number (NINO) to be allocated.
<P>

<a name="21107w54.html_para1">This process involves a rigorous face to face interview, scrutiny of supporting documentation, and corroborative checks made on the information provided prior to the allocation of a NINO. The process applies to all foreign nationals requiring a NINO. If during the allocation process suspicions are raised as to the legitimacy of an individual's right to be in the country, the case is referred to the Department's National Identity Fraud Unit for further action.
<P>

<a name="21107w54.html_para2">Upon arrival in this country asylum seekers are initially supported by the Home Office National Asylum Support Service. Contact with this Department for the allocation of a NINO will therefore not normally take place until a decision has been made by the Home Office on the person's application for asylum. Once this has taken place (or if the person has been in the country for more than 6 months and is still awaiting a decision), an application for a NINO can be made.
<P>

<a name="21107w54.html_para3">There are arrangements in place between this Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in the Republic of Ireland which allow fraud investigators to compare information held by both departments relating to individuals suspected of committing fraud.

 Over the last 12 months, a total of 1,051 complaints have been received at the Harrow Social Security Office regarding late payment of benefits.
<P>

<a name="21107w55.html_para0">The last 12 months have seen substantial change in what was Harrow Benefits Agency and a period of industrial action which has had some impact on performance. The Harrow Social Security Office now forms part of the Jobcentre Plus District for Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon. The District has already begun an improvement programme including re-training for

staff in some areas of their work. This is already showing improved results in customer service and performance, with a corresponding reduction in the number of complaints received. There were 153 complaints about late payments of benefit in October 2001. By October 2002 there were only 13 complaints.

 Two medical assessments are used to determine incapacity for work for benefit purposes: the Own Occupation Test, which is applied during the first 28 weeks of incapacity, and the Personal Capability Assessment. Attendance Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are self-assessment benefits and as such there is no requirement for a medical assessment. However, Decision Makers may request further evidence which can include a report from an examining medical practitioner.

<P>
<a name="21107w56.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the cost was of the Pay 2002 information pack circulation; and if he will make a statement in respect of targeting information to recipients  [78337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w56.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The cost for design, print and distribution of the Department 2002 Pay Offer information pack was #1.34 per pack. Around 146,500 copies were issued to staff.
<P>

<a name="21107w56.html_para2">Distribution of the package was based on payroll information for staff from the former Department for Social Security, and the most recent ''census'' information for staff from the former Employment Service.
<P>

<a name="21107w56.html_para3">This year's pay offer to staff was particularly significant because it was the first since the Department was formed in 2001, where staff were brought together from the former DSS, Employment Services and Department for Education and Employment. For the past year different terms and conditions have applied within the Department.
<P>

<a name="21107w56.html_para4">The offer package provided staff with comprehensive details on a raft of harmonised changes to their terms and conditions, pay structure and conditions of employment for staff in the Department for Work and Pensions. The proposed changes to terms and conditions contained in the 2002 pay offer were complex and contractual. It was therefore, essential that all staff had the opportunity to read, understand and ask questions about the changes. The only way to ensure that this was achieved was to distribute personal copies of the information package to all staff in the Department.

There are no plans to make significant changes to job functions in the short term. In the longer term the migration of existing Jobcentres and Social Security Offices into fully integrated Jobcentre Plus offices and the development of The Pensions Service may lead to changes in job functions in order to deliver improved services to customers.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions which disability-specific national programmes his Department is funding for supported employment; and what plans he has to fund a national supported employment programme for people with autism and Asperger Syndrome.  [77282]<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w58.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 WORKSTEP is a national supported employment programme for disabled people who have complex barriers to finding and keeping work. The programme is not specific to any one disability but instead is designed to help all disabled people meeting the criteria to work in a supportive environment and, where possible, to progress in mainstream employment.

<a name="21107w58.html_para0">In addition, Disability Employment Advisers based in Jobcentres work with local employers to place people into jobs, making use of other specialist programmes such as Access to Work where necessary. These arrangements have enabled people with many different disability-related barriers to work, including those with autism and Asperger syndrome, to move successfully into jobs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w58.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that up to the end of June 2002 1,011,934 stakeholder pensions had been sold. A detailed breakdown of sales will not be available until next year. Sales of over a million in their first 15 months on the market represents a very encouraging start.
<P>

<a name="21107w58.html_para1">In addition the ABI figures show that 330,296 employers had designated a scheme for their workforce. This means more people have the chance to save for a decent income in retirement through the workplace.
<P>

<a name="21107w58.html_para2">The ABI said that stakeholder pensions have also had a wider beneficial effect on pension provision by helping to increase the size of the overall pensions market. Stakeholder pensions have driven down other personal pension charges, some employers have widened access to their occupational pension schemes and other employers have set up group personal pensions with an employer contribution.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21107w58.html_para7">To qualify for a grant under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, now marketed as Warm Front Team, the householder or their spouse must be in receipt of a qualifying income or disability related benefit. Householders in Receipt of the Disability Living Allowance are currently entitled to assistance up to the value of #1500. There are currently over 241,000 recipients of Disability Living Allowance aged under 16. If Warm Front was extended to include this group, allowing for a 100 per cent. take up the extra cost to the scheme would be over #361 million.
<P>

<a name="21107w58.html_para8">Warm Front is aimed at householders on low income.

2. The data do not include respondents whose eyesight problems are effectively compensated for by wearing glasses or contact lenses. However, the LFS may overstate the numbers because some of those who identify difficulty in seeing would not necessarily be diagnosed as blind or partially sighted.<P>

3. The term ''not in employment'' includes people who are not actively seeking work as well as those who are covered by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment. The ILO unemployment rates for people with visual impairments are only available for England and the UK because of small sample sizes.<P>

<a name="21107w59.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Where a person is not in receipt of Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, entitlement to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit is assessed by comparing a person's net income with an amount which is broadly similar to what they would receive on either Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. For each pound that their income exceeds that level, the amount of benefit payable is reduced by fixed tapers of 65 pence for Housing Benefit and 20 pence for Council Tax Benefit. As a consequence people will generally see an improvement in their overall financial position.

 I welcome this Business Manifesto, which sets out how the CBI sees the important interaction between the public and private sectors to achieve a better economic future. The Manifesto addresses many of the issues which are of critical importance to the development of the Northern Ireland economy and which relate closely to the strategic priorities developed by the Economic Development Forum. I look forward, with my ministerial colleagues, to exploring the proposals contained in the Manifesto.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21107w62.html_para0">In February 2000, the United Nations Security Council accepted Indonesia's pledge to conduct its own enquiry and prosecute those responsible for crimes committed in East Timor in 1999. This led to the establishment of an Ad Hoc Tribunal on 14 March 2002. As it is still considering several of the cases it would be premature to push for an alternative justice mechanism now. If we judge that it has not delivered justice we will certainly consider the case for an international tribunal with our EU partners and others in the international community. Officials in Washington and Dili have already discussed the idea of an international tribunal with US and UN officials and representatives of the East Timorese government.
<P>

<a name="21107w62.html_para1">The East Timorese government with the assistance of the UN Special Crimes Unit is also investigating serious human rights violations that have taken place during the last 25 years.

 President Museveni and President Kagame recommitted themselves and their Governments to the Understanding they signed last November in London on not interfering in each others' political and security affairs.

 Water has long been a major problem for rural Palestinian communities. The severe economic and social decline caused by closures and curfews has compounded the problem. Many villages without water networks are facing shortages, as water tankers cannot access villages, or people can no longer afford the escalating price of tankered water. The situation has been exacerbated by the recent Israeli ban on drilling for water in the West Bank. Households cope by going into debt, seeking alternative water sources (that are often not clean), and cutting back on consumption. All of these responses pose threats to family well-being. In conjunction with other donors, we are working with the Palestinian Water Authority, and a number of rural

 Since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970, the pay gap has reduced from 37 per cent to 19 per cent. today. Action taken by the Government to close the pay gap is having a positive impact.
<P>

<a name="21107w63.html_para2">We are leading by example, through our commitment to equal pay reviews in the Civil Service. We are making it easier for women to get equal pay through changes in the Employment Act 2002. We are making it easier for employers to pay fairly through the work of the Fair Pay Champions and the Castle Awards. We are tackling the wider causes of the pay gap by helping mothers stay attached to the labour market, investing more resources in childcare, improving the skill levels of those already in the labour market and helping employers make the most of their female workforce.

 Annual EU expenditure on the Dairy CAP runs at almost 2 billion euro. Over the last year, mindful of the difficult market situation in the dairy sector, measures have taken in Brussels, backed by the Government, to increase support in the sector. For example, export refunds have been increased for skimmed milk powder, whole milk powder and butter to help encourage exports by making up the difference between Community and world prices. Despite this considerable expenditure, the farmgate price of milk remains below the level at which many dairy farmers can

Furthermore, my noble friend Lord Whitty has convened a number of meetings of an informal dairy supply chain group, including representatives of dairy farmers, which has addressed issues of concern to those in the dairy supply chain that came out of these reports. This group is also likely to consider how the industry can best address any lessons that emerge from the ongoing KPMG study on the structure of the UK dairy sector and milk pricing, which was commissioned by the Milk Development Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on Directive 2002/36/EC (OJ L116, 3 May 2002) as it relates to measures in the United Kingdom; and in what circumstances, as per Recital 8, <i>(a)</i> applicant states and <i>(b)</i> OCTs are included as European states for political definitions. [77249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w65.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Directive 2002/36/EC amends the technical annexes to the Plant Health Directive (2000/29/EC) to provide better protection against the introduction into, and spread within, the EC of a number of serious pests and disease of plants. Three new pests are added to the list of those which are prohibited. The scope of the plant passport regime, which governs movements of plants within the Community, and the scope of import controls on plants from outside the EC, are extended to reflect more accurately the wide range of host plants attacked by some listed pests. The amendment also strengthens measures to ensure that plants are free from Bemisia tabaci before entering the area recognised as a Xprotected zone" for that pest (which includes the whole of the UK). Directive 2002/



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 700W</I><P>
36/EC will be implemented in the UK by amendments to the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993 and the Plant Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1993.
<P>

<a name="21107w65.html_para6">Decisions on listing countries and regions in the Annexes of the Plant Health Directive are based on their plant health status. In the case of Malta and Cyprus the ranges of plant pests and diseases which occur in those countries are known to be similar to those of continental Europe. Conversely the EC Overseas Countries and Territories are treated separately from European territories, according to Article 1.1 of the Plant Health Directive, because of the different pest risks in those territories.

 Under the Energy Crops Scheme, grants to plant crops are payable to growers. In the case of crops to provide fuel for the ARBRE power station, the Department was asked by the growers to make the payments to ARBRE Energy. The scheme requires that crops are used to produce energy, and the Department would be required to consider recovering grant from growers where crops are used for other purposes. It is too early to consider this as discussions on the future of ARBRE are continuing. In addition, if it does become necessary, the Department will work closely with growers to access the alternative energy markets which are being developed.

 The UK's carbon dioxide emissions in 2000, the last year for which confirmed data are available, were 152.1 million tonnes of carbon, compared to 152.5 million tonnes of carbon in 1997. A provisional estimate of carbon dioxide emissions for 2001, based on energy use, was published by the Department for Trade and Industry in March in its XEnergy Trends" publication. This estimated that carbon dioxide emissions were 154.4 million tonnes of carbon, approximately 6 per cent. below the UK's 1990 baseline emissions of 164.4 million tonnes of carbon.

<a name="21107w65.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have estimated that the additional policies and measures in the UK climate change programme, published in November 2000, could by 2010 reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the domestic sector by at least 7.8 million tonnes of carbon; in the transport sector by 5.7 million tonnes of carbon; in the business sector, which includes both the industry and commerce, by at least 4.5 million tonnes of carbon; and in the public sector by at least 0.5 million tonnes of carbon.

 It is estimated that the quantified policies and measures identified in the climate change programme could lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 19 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Carbon savings, which have not been quantified, from additional policies in the programme, could help us achieve our domestic goal. There will be a formal review of the climate change programme in 2004, which will be an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of existing policies and, if necessary, to develop new ones.

 The Market Transformation Programme (MTP) does not itself set targets, but operating largely in the public domain, seeks to establish and maintain an informed consensus on the risks, potential and scope for achieving sustainable beneficial market changes over time (e.g. increased volume sales of energy efficient appliances or elimination of inefficient products by specified dates) and, in parallel, on the detailed policy measures and other actions necessary to achieve those changes, taking into account underlying trends, timing and wider issues. In that regard, my Department both sponsors and participates in MTP's open consultations on feasible market transformation targets and it seeks to negotiate integrated programmes of policy measures to meet them. These include, for example, EU directives to label and to set minimum standards for domestic refrigeration, voluntary agreements with industry on improvement targets, public domain product procurement information, the promotional programmes supported by the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust, including the Energy Efficiency Recommended scheme, the Energy Efficiency Commitment and Enhanced Capital Allowances.

<i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> The release and marketing of GMOs in the EU is governed by European Directive 2001/18/EC. In England, Directive 2001/18 is implemented by part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2002. The devolved Administrations for Scotland and Wales are responsible for implementing Directive 2001/18 in their respective territories.
<P>

<a name="21107w66.html_para2">The above legislation covers any proposed release of GM fish into the environment for research or commercial purposes, including any proposed release of GM fish in nets, tanks or cages in the sea or in rivers, lakes or streams. Before any such release could go ahead, it would have to be authorised by a consent from the relevant authority. Decisions on whether or not to allow a release would be based on a detailed assessment of any risks that may be posed by the GMO to human health or the environment in each case. It is difficult to envisage any circumstance in which a release of GM fish would be authorised in England.
<P>

<a name="21107w66.html_para3">There are no GM fish being held in aquatic net-pens in the UK and no approval has yet been sought or granted for the commercial production of GM fish.
<P>

<a name="21107w66.html_para4">The Department for International Development is funding research on GM techniques that may accelerate the growth rate and confer sterility in tilapia, a freshwater fish widely farmed in Africa and Asia. This work is being carried out by the University of Southampton in strictly controlled contained tank conditions in accordance with GMO (contained use) legislation. It is designed to provide a better understanding of how poor producers and consumers in developing countries could benefit, and to help these countries to decide for themselves whether they want to use the techniques.

<i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> The Government issued the UK Climate Change Programme in November 2000, and its publication was widely publicised. The programme sets out the key elements of the Government's policy on HFCs to enable industry and users to make investment decisions with more certainty. These elements include that HFCs should only be used where other safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist, and that HFCs are not sustainable in the long term. The Government have a voluntary agreement with the UK fire-fighting industry in order to reduce emissions of HFCs and PFCs, which is currently under review.

 We are concerned that re-use and recycling of plastic remains very low and that non-biodegradeable plastic remains in and litters the environment almost indefinitely. A substitute for plastic made from potato starch is now being developed, which is being used for some types of packaging by some retailers. Such material is entirely biodegradeable and can be composted. A number of companies are marketing degradeable plastics technology and products manufactured from these materials. These new technologies are based on modified plastics manufactured from mineral oil and still have to be sent for recycling after use. But we do strongly support the development of boidegradeable plastics made from non-fossil sources.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> The Government do not regulate the use of SF6 from the electricity transmission and distribution sectors. Emissions from electrical insulation currently account for less than 20 per cent. of the UK's total emissions of SF6. While there has been a small increase in emissions from this sector since 1995, and they are forecast to continue increasing until 2010, estimated emissions reduction in other sectors are projected to offset this increase and lead to a fall in total SF6 emissions of about 3 per cent. between 1995 and 2020.

Works) standard format to reflect Government policy on its own timber procurement. The Government committed Departments and their agencies in July 2000 actively to seek to procure their timber and timber products from legal and sustainably managed sources.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para0">The National Building Specification does not contain specification clauses for the procurement of timber. It is left to the specifier to decide the content of the specification because currently, NBS considers the issue of sustainability complex, imprecise and the subject of conflicting information. However, general guidance to the National Building Specification refers to advice from the Forests Forever Campaign, that was established in 1990 by the Timber Trade Federation. This says: X. . . as yet there is no internationally agreed definition of, or accepted criteria for, 'sustainability'. At present a supplier may only be able to provide evidence that timber comes from a 'sustained yield' source i.e. managed to provide a continuous supply of timber . . .".
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para1">NBS is compiling a dossier on the subject of timber procurement and has agreed to meet officials to discuss the issue. In the meantime, we have asked Government Departments to ensure that anyone employed by Government on any construction, maintenance or supplies contract is made aware that the Government's policy on timber procurement should be complied with when drawing up specifications. This message will be reinforced by an Information Note to be issued by the Office of Government Commerce shortly.

 Central funding for village halls, from the recent Government and the National Lottery has increased substantially in recent years. About #10 million per year was available in the 1980s, which increased to around #50 million per year in the late 1990s, largely due to the contribution from the Millennium Fund which funded over 500 village halls and community centres to the value of nearly #100 million. That programme was specifically intended as an injection of extra funds over the millennium period and has benefited many local communities. Since the millennium the annual assistance to village halls remains three times the previous level at approximately #33 million per year now.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para2">It must be remembered that the finances of village halls have traditionally come from local sources with come support from central government and that this Government have been active in encouraging local

action. While this approach has been productive the contribution of central government must not be seen as an alternative to local leadership and fund raising.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para3">Nevertheless the Government are working with stakeholders to quantify the funding needs of village halls and how best to meet these needs. My officials met representatives of Action with Communities in Rural England and others on 22 October to discuss how available funds, from central and local government and the lottery distributors, can best support local investment in village halls and the services and facilities they provide for their local communities. I shall be meeting the National Village Halls Forum during November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what regulations there are and how they can be enforced by <i>(a)</i> the Environment Agency and<i> (b)</i> local councils, to prevent developers dumping contaminated waste on sites that are being recontoured and are not licensed tips.  [77241]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w68.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The disposal and recovery of waste is regulated primarily through the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, for which the Environment Agency is the competent authority and primary regulator. Paragraph 9 of schedule 3 of the 1994 regulations allows certain types of material to be spread to land for the purposes of reclamation or improvement under an exemption from waste management licensing. This material includes soil, rock, ash or sludge, or waste from any dredging of inland waters or arising from construction or demolition work. The material can only be spread provided it meets the requirements of Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive ie to ensure protection of the environment and human health.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para4">Any activity being carried out under this exemption must be registered with the Environment Agency, and failure to adhere to the 'general rules' of the exemption is an offence that is punishable by a fine if convicted in court.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para5">The Government will be consulting shortly on amendments to some exemptions (including paragraph 9). These amendments are being designed to tighten the requirements and to prevent abuse of the controls.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 714W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para6">Along with the Environment Agency, local authorities have more general powers under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to fly tipping, ie depositing controlled waste without a waste management licence ore registered exemption. In the event of a conviction, severe penalties are available to the courts including an unlimited fine or imprisonment of up to five years.

 There are at present 14 municipal solid waste incinerators in the whole of the UK, two of which are in Scotland. Details of facilities where planning applications are determined by local planning authorities are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="21107w68.html_para7">There are many hundreds of other incinerators for sewage sludge, hazardous waste, clinical waste, production waste from factories etc. In England and Wales, the larger plant generally is regulated by the Environment Agency and details of their locations are available on the Environment Agency's public register. Other plant that is part of another process regulated by the Agency may not be shown separately on the register. Smaller plant is regulated by local authorities. In Scotland, all such plant are regulated by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

There may also be other planning applications or amendments which have been submitted to local authorities over which the Agency has not been consulted. The planning status may have been changed since the data were supplied.

In May 2000 we issued comprehensive Guidance on the Education of Children and Young People in Care to help local authorities, in their role as corporate parents to raise the educational attainment of children and young people in public care and to bring them closer in line with those of their peers. The Department seeks through it's policies to help LEAs work towards achieving the PSA target set by the Department of Health that, by 2004, 15 per cent. of children leaving care at age 16 or over shall have achieved at least 5 GCCEs at grade A*-C.

 The School Governance (Constitution) (England) Regulations 2003 are currently out for consultation. The suggested wording in Schedule 6 on disqualifying governors from holding, or continuing to hold, office is triggered by an individual's refusal to agree to an application being made for a criminal records certificate when a request is made. While this wording does not in itself require all governors or potential governors to automatically undergo a Criminal Records Bureau check we will consider whether this disqualification should be removed or reworded before the Regulations are laid next spring.

 There are currently 100,000 more young people on Advanced Modern Apprenticeships and Foundation Modern Apprenticeships than at the same time in 1998. The Government has published a target for 2004 for at least 28 per cent. of young people to start a Modern Apprenticeship by age 22. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a lead role in meeting the target and has in place robust plans to do so. It is working closely with the Connexions Service, the new Sector Skills Councils and others to increase demand for places from both young people and employers. The LSC and Ministers are advised on MA developments by a Board made up of employers and others. New publicity campaigns are underway, including one aimed at employers which began last week.

 I have not received any significant representations on higher level skills shortages in the Information Technology (IT) sector in the last six months. Skills deficits in the sector have declined from their peak in 1999 when the Stevens report, ''Skills for the Information Age'' highlighted these issues. Since that time, an #8 million programme of measures has been put in place to improve the image of the IT industry, build greater understanding of the labour market and strengthen links between education and industry.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has made a concerted effort to raise awareness of the need to report every event, which could lead to an allegation of malpractice or maladministration in national tests. This has led to an increase in the number of events reported. All such reports are logged, but not all merit further investigation. Reports which do not normally require further investigation would include, for example, where a school has received its test pack with the external sealing damaged.

An additional #250,000 per programme may also be available to the programmes, if needed, to meet further capital expenditure in year 4 and 5 or earlier.
<P>

<a name="21107w72.html_para5">We have also established a pilot initiative of 50 smaller Sure Start programmes (48 programmes approved to date) in rural areas and pockets of deprivation, which would not normally be covered by the traditional Sure Start model. These programmes are managed through Early Years Childcare and Development Partnerships and linked to Neighbourhood Nurseries, Early Excellence Centres or other existing provision to deliver Sure Start-type services to some 150&#150;170 children in each catchment area. Revenue funding up to #100,000 for each year and capital of up to #250,000 is available. The total budgeted provision for these programmes in 2002&#150;03 is #10.25m. 48 of the 50 Mini Sure Start programmes have now been approved.

<P>
<a name="21107w73.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Data for OECD countries shows a positive correlation between the proportion of GDP spent on higher education institutions and levels of Gross Domestic Product. It is difficult to isolate the impact of higher education on growth due to the many other things which determine economic growth. Evidence suggests that higher education is more important for growth in developed countries than other levels of education. The returns from higher education enjoyed by individuals are high. For example, graduates earn around 64 per cent. more than non-graduates. Participation in higher education generates wider social benefits such as improved health and reduced crime. Research also suggests that the spill-over effects of higher education R&D on productivity are extremely high.

<P>
<P>

 In Cambridgeshire Local Education Authority 46 schools had a fall in their cash budget share in 2002&#150;03, but of these only 7 also had a fall in their cash budget share per pupil. Changes in pupil numbers are the principal reason for changes in budget share from year to year. 199 schools had a rise in their cash budget share, but of these 12 had a fall in their cash budget share per pupil: this was largely in cases where small primary schools had rising rolls and therefore received less of the extra funding that goes to the smallest schools under the authority's formula.

 Most additional funding for schools is allocated to local education authorities and cannot be disaggregated between different types of schools. The following table shows the additional funding that is specifically allocated for secondary education in Staffordshire and Hertfordshire in 2002&#150;2003. Secondary schools will receive more than this from grants that cover all types of school, but the exact amount will depend on local decisions.

 The Department has answered 87 letters on the funding of education in Staffordshire since June 2001, and has received 5 petitions from schools. In addition a number of Staffordshire residents responded to the consultation on Local Government Funding reform which closed on 30 September: to identify precisely these letters from amongst the very large numbers of responses to the consultation would incur disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, what percentage of students from families resident in each government office region were <i>(a)</i> exempt from tuition fees, <i>(b)</i> paying less than full tuition fees and <i>(c)</i> paying no fees at all in the academic year 2002&#150;03  [80047]<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w74.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, if he will place in the Library the research analysis that led to his conclusion that a graduate had lifetime earnings #400,000 greater than non-graduates; from which period these data were gathered; whether the sum stated is gross or net of tax; and if he will estimate the sum <i>(a)</i> gross and <i>(b)</i> net of tax.  [80065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w74.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The relevant data come from the four quarters Autumn 2000 to Summer 2001 in the Labour Force Survey. The #400,000 figure is gross, and is consistent with conventional practice used by ONS when quoting earnings figures. The equivalent figure, net of income tax, national insurance and other contributions, is around #250,000. For the avoidance of doubt, #400,000 is the earnings premium of a graduate over that of the national average rather than for a non-graduate. The premium over a non-graduate would be significantly higher.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w74.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 At the end of the 2000&#150;01 financial year there were some 2,253,000 borrowers with student loans, either mortgage style or income contingent. This 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 735W</I><P>
includes 705,000 borrowers with loans which have been sold to the private sector. The total amount outstanding on student outlay was #7,833.2m of which #1,789.9m was in respect of loans sold to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="21107w74.html_para0">The resource cost for student loans issued in the 2000&#150;01 financial year was estimated to be #794m.
<P>

<a name="21107w74.html_para1">Student loans are charged interest at the rate of inflation. A full market rate of interest would be higher and would not increase the costs to public funds. It would, however, increase the total amount repaid by HE leavers and graduates. It would also increase the time taken to repay their loans and the likelihood of loans being written off.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w74.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 No such discussions took place. There was never any question of continuing with the prosecution while withholding disclosure of the information and no attempt was made to do so. No Minister was asked to give a PII certificate or signed one, nor was a draft certificate ever prepared, nor was any consideration given by anyone to preparing such a certificate to place before the judge. The judge agreed to postpone the disclosure of the information in the public interest until further enquiries had been carried out and a fuller picture obtained so as to enable properly informed decisions to be made, in particular as to the future conduct of the trial.

 On the information known to the Crown Prosecution Service at the time of the decision last year to bring a prosecution, I have no reason to doubt the assessment made that there was a realistic prospect of securing a conviction and that the public interest was in favour of a prosecution.

<P>
<a name="21107w74.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Attorney-General first learnt about the case shortly after his appointment. The Director of Public Prosecutions had drawn the case to the attention of his predecessor in May last year. Thereafter, the case was included in a list of high profile cases in respect of which brief reports are provided to Law Officers on a monthly basis. The Law Officers were not asked for and did not give their views about whether the case should proceed. On Tuesday last week, the Crown Prosecution Service and prosecution counsel drew the attention of the Attorney-General to the new information that had been disclosed by the Palace to the police. Naturally, the Attorney-General's views were sought on how to proceed in the light of that development and he gave them. But in the end, as he made plain should be the case, the decision was made by the CPS following further consideration and having taken leading counsel's advice. At the time that decisions were made, the Director of Public Prosecutions was abroad. He kept in close touch with his office and approved the decision, but there were no direct discussions between the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. They first spoke directly of the matter on 3 November.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2002]:</i> A police investigation file relating to the death of Robert Hamill was received in the Director's Office on 7 August 1997. Following consideration of that file a direction was issued on 27 January 1998 to prosecute one person, Paul Hobson, for the scheduled offence of murder and affray. On 25 February 1999 at Belfast Crown Court Hobson was found not guilty of murder but guilty of affray and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment.

On 7 May 2002 at Craigavon Crown Court the two persons pleaded guilty to the offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will list the pesticides and pest repellent chemicals that have been withdrawn from use in commercial products following EU directives in the last five years; and what the reason was for their withdrawal in each case.  [79378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w75.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Directive 91/414/EEC concerns the marketing of plant protection products (these are basically pesticides and pest repellent chemicals used in agriculture). From 1998 to 2002 the following chemicals were withdrawn from the market under the first stage of the 91/414/EEC review programme: chlozolinate; dinoterb; DNOC, fentin acetate; fentin hydroxide; fenvalerate; lindane; monolinuron; pyrazophos and quintozene. Decisions to withdraw a further 8 chemicals have been taken but in all these cases the marketing can continue into 2003&#150;2004.
<P>

<a name="21107w75.html_para0">Chlozolinate, fenvalerate, monolinuron and pyrazophos were withdrawn because the companies concerned did not provide, sufficient information to support their review. The other chemicals were withdrawn because they did not meet the requirements laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. In all these cases concerns were expressed regarding the safety of operators potentially exposed to the chemicals and for some there were also concerns regarding the behaviour of the chemicals in the environment and their possible impact on non-target organisms.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 738W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21107w75.html_para1">Finally, marketing authorisations for 320 chemicals throughout the EU (of which 45 had UK approvals) will be withdrawn in July 2003 (although a few ''essential uses'' of some of these chemicals can continue to 2007). In all these cases withdrawal arises because the companies concerned have not supported the chemicals in the second and third stages of the review programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) of 17 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, c. 891W, what criteria are being used in the development of the United Kingdom wind speed database.  [80063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w75.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK windspeed database has now been made available on the DTI website at: http://www.dti.gov.uk/renewable/windspeed/online.html.
<P>

<a name="21107w75.html_para5">The data is the result of an air flow model that estimates the effect of topography on wind speed. Each value stored in the database is the estimated average windspeed for a 1 km square at 10m, 25m and 45m above ground level. The database does not take account of local thermally driven winds, topography on a small scale or local surface roughness. The data is intended as a guide to be followed by on-site measurements.
<P>

<a name="21107w75.html_para6">The database uses the Ordnance Survey grid system for Great Britain and the grid system of the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, what percentage of the United Kingdom's energy is generated from wind energy; and what percentage it will have to be if the Renewables Obligation is to be met in 2010.  [80011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w75.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In 2001 0.03 per cent. of the total primary inland consumption of energy in the United Kingdom was accounted for by onshore and offshore wind, with all renewable sources together accounting for 1.3 per cent. Electricity generated from wind accounted for 0.3 per cent. of electricity sold in the UK in 2001 with all renewable sources eligible for the renewables obligation together accounting for 1.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21107w75.html_para7">The Government have a target for 10 per cent. of licensed electricity supplies in the UK to be generated from sources eligible for the Renewables Obligation by 2010, but this Obligation is a market based approach and the deployment levels for individual renewables technologies are for the industry rather than the Government. We would, however, expect a significant contribution to the 10 per cent. target to be from onshore and offshore wind energy.

[77568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w76.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 At the end of the World Summit on sustainable Development (WSSD) Bali Prepcom in June, the Chair asked Member States for ideas on how to resolve those areas (which included parts other trade text amongst others) of the Plan of Implementation which had yet to be agreed. The European Commission (acting in accordance with its general mandate from EU member states to negotiate trade issues) and the US agreed a non-paper on the trade, finance and globalisation texts which was submitted to the South Africans as an informal contribution in advance of WSSD in Johannesburg. This was not a formal EU position agreed by member states. The formal EU position was adopted in the Development Council conclusions on WSSD agreed in May prior to the WSSD Bali Prepcom.
<P>

<a name="21107w76.html_para0">All discussions on trade liberalisation issues at Johannesburg itself were based on text negotiated at the Bali Prepcom and developed through subsequent drafts produced by the Chair of the Trade Group (the Antiguan Ambassador to the UN) during WSSD itself. I welcome the fact that the final trade sections of the WSSD text strongly reinforce the commitments made at the WTO Ministerial in Doha in November 2001. The text as agreed by consensus is publicly available on the WSSD website (www.johannesburgsummit.org/).

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w78.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I am taking a number of measures to promote British engineering. British engineering is able to benefit from the services of British Trade International in competing in overseas markets. And there is a range of specialist activity such as the ''Capability Statement'' documents on education and training in the oil and gas industry which describe the roles UK trained and educated engineers play in all the major centres of oil and gas production world-wide.
<P>

<a name="21107w78.html_para2">The Department promotes engineering in key overseas markets through the deployment of International Technology Promoters who promote collaboration between UK firms and overseas counterparts. Smaller engineering firms have access to additional support through a secondments programme, which enables SMEs to improve their competitive position by spending up to a year in a foreign company.
<P>

<a name="21107w78.html_para3">I am taking a range of measures: to encourage young people to consider engineering as a rewarding career choice; to increase the attractiveness of degree courses in engineering; and to provide a clear progression path though school, FE and HE. I am particularly keen to ensure individual learners and employers are offered flexible training opportunities for people in the workforce.
<P>

<a name="21107w78.html_para4">The Government accept that without an adequate supply of young people studying the sciences, technologies, engineering and mathematics, the UK's long-term prospects are bleak. The Government aims to increase young people's engagement in science and technology through increased activity in schools that will inspire young people and improve perceptions of the relevance of the curriculum to the world of work. For its part the DTI is working closely with our colleagues in the DfES to ensure that in response to Sir Gareth Roberts' Report ''SET for Success'' a number of measures are taken to improve the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills. For example: an additional investment of #100 million a year by 2005&#150;06 (in addition to extra resources for the Department for Education and Skills) to implement the recommendations of the Review
<P>

<a name="21107w78.html_para5">Government will also be funding the Research Councils to increase the minimum PhD stipend to #12,000 by 2005&#150;06, which should also enable the average PhD stipend to rise to over #13,000 by 2005&#150;06 and investing in research careers by increasing funds for PhD training.
<P>

<a name="21107w78.html_para6">Sir Gareth's Report recommends that the Government increase its support for SETNET, (the Science, Engineering, Technology and Maths Network) and the UK-wide network of 53 SETPoints that it administers which channel Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) activities supported by industry into schools. This network also administers the

 There are no plans to introduce banding of the Renewables Obligation. The Renewables Obligation is a market led measure and will remain so. The Obligation is helping the UK renewable industry to take forward those renewable technologies that are close to becoming commercially competitive. Government grants continue to support the development of technologies still some way from commercial viability.

 I am not able to put the requested information in the House of Commons library. As we said in the Explanatory Memorandum which we laid before this house in May 2002, ''there is an issue as to whether the directive can cover pay. The proposal applies an equal treatment principle to certain 'basic working and employment conditions' listed at article 3.1<i>(d)</i>, including 'pay'. However, Article 137(6) provides that, 'the provisions of this article shall not apply to pay'. In the light of this, the Government took the view when agreeing to directives 97/81/EC and 99/70/EC on part-time work and fixed term work respectively, that these directives, which also have article 137 as a legal base, could not cover pay. On the face of it, it seems difficult to reconcile the specific inclusion of pay in the directive with the provision in Article 137(6).'' The House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee has endorsed this approach, following a scrutiny debate on 10 July 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w81.html_spnew12"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The Government have made clear its commitment to effective monitoring of the end-use of UK defence exports where this can make a genuine contribution to preventing their diversion or misuse. However, follow-up monitoring can only confirm if UK exports have been misused or diverted <i>after</i> the export as taken place. We believe that the most effective way to prevent misuse or diversion of UK equipment is by rigorous assessment at the export licensing stage. To this end we have taken a number of steps to strengthen end-user risk assessment in the export licensing process. Before taking a decision on export licences, Ministers take into account all reliable information about end-users of potential concern, including reporting from other Government Departments and UK posts overseas, and also from any relevant information received from Non-Governmental Organisations and other external sources. Overseas posts have standing instructions to report any misuse of UK-origin defence equipment so that it can be taken into account in the licensing process. These measures do not require legislation and the Government does not therefore propose to include specific provisions on end-use monitoring in the secondary legislation to be introduced under the Export Control Act 2002.

 The Export Control Act 2002 contains a new general power that allows controls to be introduced on arms trafficking or brokering (referred to in the Act as trade) by persons in the UK and UK persons overseas. The Government has stated that it will use these powers to introduce extra-territorial controls on trade in controlled goods to embargoed destinations, trade in equipment the export of which has already been banned because of evidence of its use in torture, and trade in long-range missiles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w83.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government remain fully committed to reaching the UN 0.7 per cent. ODA/GNI target. In the 2002 Spending Review we made substantial increases to the aid budget. The UK's level of overseas development assistance will be increased to 0.33 per cent. by 2003/04, up from 0.26 per cent. in 1997, and will reach 0.40 per cent. of GNI by 2005/06. This is the largest ever increase in UK aid and represents a 93 per cent. real terms increase since 1997.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para0">Aid effectiveness is also important as well as aid volumes. We are committed to redirecting the development assistance budget to the poorest countries, particularly those with effective governments pursuing high growth and pro-poor economic and social policies.

<P>
<a name="21107w83.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government are very concerned about food crises in Africa and is acting decisively to limit the impact of famine on those countries affected. We have already committed a total of #68 million for humanitarian assistance and recovery programmes to the region and will continue to monitor the situation closely. Of the eight countries currently affected by famine, 4 are already benefiting from US$11 billion of debt relief that has been committed under the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para1">DfID's Southern Africa Humanitarian Crisis Unit (SAHCU) is currently being established in Johannesburg. The unit will assist the ongoing DfID response, carry out situation and needs assessments; and identify opportunities for further UK interventions if necessary.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para2">As part of this commitment to providing humanitarian assistance, DfID is supporting infrastructure programmes, such as the rehabilitation of the rail link between the port of Nacala in Mozambique and land-locked Malawi. The improved link is essential to the special emergency operation being run by the World Food Programme on behalf of the Malawian government to get food to those most at need. The total cost of the programme is #4.26 million, #4.1 million of which will be funded by DfID.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para3">In Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe food shortages have followed a poor season when coping mechanisms are already stretched. Poor governance has played a major role in the shortages, particularly in Zimbabwe where lack of inputs for small-holder agriculture, and the ruling party's disastrous economic and land policies, have both caused shortages and undercut survival strategies. Throughout the region HIV and AIDS has also weakened communities' capacity to cope with additional stress.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para4">The crisis underlines the need for good governance in Africa. The three worst affected countries (Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) have been hit by drought, but have also suffered in varying degrees from economic problems and poor governance, which have turned a fall in agricultural production into a crisis. The drought has been exacerbated by corruption in Zambia under the previous administration, poor management of food stocks in Malawi, and disastrous land and economic policies in Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para5">At the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the UK argued strongly that we should be prepared to use the flexibility in the HIPC initiative to provide additional debt relief to ensure a robust exit from unsustainable debt, particularly for those countries affected by extreme circumstances.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para6">The Government is working to strengthen the HIPC initiative to help the most vulnerable countries. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session last year, the Chancellor set out the UK's agenda for strengthening the HIPC initiative. In addition to pressing for more cautious forecasts to assess debt sustainability, the Chancellor stressed the importance of additional debt relief (or topping-up) at Completion Point for those countries which have

<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 769W</I><P>
experienced external shocks such as natural disaster. In order to deliver these reforms, the UK has called for a further $1 billion to the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para7">At Kananaskis the UK was at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief, helping to secure agreement from the G7 that they fund their share of the $1 billion financing shortfall in the HIPC initiative. The UK is the second largest donor to the HIPC Trust Fund, pledging over $300 million in total since 1999.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para8">Ahead of the September meetings the UK made clear that, once again, we were prepared to shoulder our share of the burden, and called on other countries to follow our lead. The Development Committee welcomed these announcements of support and called upon other countries to make firm pledges and contributions as early as possible. I am pleased to report that, at a recent HIPC Technical Meeting in Paris, not only did the UK reaffirm its commitment to providing $120 million towards the $1 billion financing gap, but was joined by nearly all donors in making firm commitments totaling around $850 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w83.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Credit unions have an important role to play in tackling financial exclusion and in providing greater choice and diversity in the financial services sector. That is why we have been involved in initiatives to help the movement grow and to enable credit unions to offer a greater range of services to their members.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para9">We are in the process of delivering a programme of legislative and regulatory changes to help improve the operational flexibility of credit unions. Also, through the Financial Services and Markets Act, we have brought credit unions under the regulatory supervision of the Financial Services Authority and given depositors with credit unions similar protection to those with banks or building societies. The new regulatory system, combined with our programme of deregulation, will give the movement a strong position from which to build and thrive.
<P>

<a name="21107w83.html_para10">The Government will continue to work closely with the movement to support and encourage its future development.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate by how much public borrowing as a percentage of GDP would have to be raised to cover the capital expenditure of all current and past projects financed through PFI/PPP.  [76012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w84.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is estimated that, by the end of this year, the value of PFI/PPP contracts signed will increase private sector capital expenditure on public services to over #25 billion. Revised estimates are published annually in the Budget and updated during the financial year under arrangements agreed with the National Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="21107w84.html_para3">It is not possible to calculate accurately the increased level of public debt that would be created if these projects were funded instead by the public sector. That would depend on the way in which the project was taken forward. Since the abolition of universal testing, public authorities choose the method of procurement which is best suited to individual projects.

 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> The information to answer the HM's question about the amount of stamp duty paid by the Mapeley consortium is covered by the Inland Revenue's legal duty of taxpayer confidentiality which is laid down by S182 of Finance Act 1989 which states, at sub section 1.

<P>

<a name="21107w85.html_para1">Valuation of the Inland Revenue and Customs & Excise buildings was carried out as part of the STEPS process by independent valuers. This was performed by Insignia Richard Ellis in conjunction with Gerald Eve. Their opinion of Market Value was #370 million.
<P>

<a name="21107w85.html_para2">Under the Mapeley contract the Inland Revenue pays Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd for the provision of fully serviced accommodation. A full appraisal was done at the time of the contract and that appraisal indicated that there would be a significant benefit to the Departments from the proposed arrangement over the lifetime of the contract compared with the status quo at that time.
<P>

<a name="21107w85.html_para3">The table below lists the Departments' properties which (with three exceptions) were transferred to Mapeley STEPS Ltd which is registered in Bermuda. The three exceptions were Custom House Southampton, Rutland House Bradford and 23 Piccadilly York which were sold to Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd which is UK registered. Some buildings were considered to be of particular importance (including primarily buildings of historical significance) and were not sold. Those properties within this category over which Mapeley STEPS Ltd are granted a long lease are included on the list. The maintenance and day to day services are provided by Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd which is a UK registered company.

Given the Government's long term ambition to reduce the persistent gap in performance between regions, the Spending Review established a new Public Service Agreement target to make sustainable improvements in the economic performance of all English regions and over the longer term reduce the persistent gap in growth rates between the regions. This target, as described in full in the 2002 Spending Review White Paper, is jointly owned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, DTI and the Treasury.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> statutory, <i>(b)</i> economic and <i>(c)</i> security reasons preventing the Treasury from splitting its contract for circulating coins between manufacturer, design and specification.  [78347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w87.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Royal Mint, a government department financed by a trading fund, is the part of central government currently responsible for the manufacture and issue of UK circulation coins. It carries out these functions in agreement with HM Treasury as the department with overall responsibility for the economy and financial affairs. The Royal Mint Advisory Committee, a separate public body, the members of which are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Chancellor, is currently responsible for advice on coin design.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w87.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The detail of the Royal Mint's agreement with the Treasury for the supply of domestic circulating coin is commercially confidential and cannot be disclosed in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The agreement is a challenging one for the Mint, providing a commercial rate of return below that expected of the business overall. The Mint believes that there is no cross-subsidisation involved between the UK circulating coin element of the business and the overseas business, and is preparing with the involvement of the National Audit Office a confidential note for the Public Accounts Committee which sets out the evidence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w87.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 There are no insurmountable statutory obstacles to putting the arrangements for the supply of circulation coins out to tender. Of key importance however is security of supply.
<P>

<a name="21107w87.html_para2">The Treasury keeps the arrangements for the supply of circulation coins under review. The current arrangements with the Royal Mint have several years to run. They are designed to enable both the Treasury and the Mint to plan for the medium term on a commercial basis, and to ensure a cost-effective supply of coins to meet demand.
<P>

<a name="21107w87.html_para3">It is only finished coins that are obtained from the Royal Mint. Whether to purchase blanks from outside sources, for use in the production of UK circulation coinage, is a commercial decision for the Mint.

 The extension of the stamp duty relief for non-residential property in disadvantaged areas is a key part of the Government's overall drive to regenerate deprived areas. We have already exempted from stamp duty all property transactions in disadvantaged areas where the consideration is less than #150,000.
<P>

In addition, I met Commissioner Monti in September to discuss our application for approval as state aid of this measure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w89.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Within the European Union there are no personal allowances for tobacco imports. Since the creation of the Single Market in 1993 travellers have been able to bring back as much EU duty paid tobacco and alcohol as they wish as long as it is for their own use. The recent changes to indicative levels simply act as a guide to assist shoppers and make it easier for Customs officers to distinguish between the honest shopper and the illegal smuggler.
<P>

<a name="21107w89.html_para0">The new package of measures against tobacco smuggling, which I announced on 29 October, is designed to continue the successful crackdown on the illicit supply of cigarettes. It is this illegal supply of cheap, unregulated cigarettes which presents the principal threat to keeping the effective price of smoking high in support of the Government's health objectives.

In his latest report, the chief inspector points to encouraging signs of progress, such as the publication of CAFCASS's first corporate plan and their work on developing draft national standards.

<P>
<a name="21107w92.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Some Sikh organisations have argued that Sikhs should be monitored as a separate ethnic group rather than subsumed in one of the generic monitoring categories used in the 2001 census. The fact that case law has established Sikhs as an ethnic group for the purposes of the Race Relations Act does not, of itself, justify different treatment from the many other ethnic and racial groups in the United Kingdom. Therefore, we do not intend to amend the statutory Code of Practice.
<P>

<a name="21107w92.html_para0">The statutory Code of Practice is not prescriptive about the form of ethnic monitoring. Rather it encourages authorities to use the same ethnic classification system as used in the 2001 census, or categories that match them very closely. However the statutory Code also recognises that authorities may choose to collect more detailed information to reflect local circumstances. Public authorities with significant Sikh populations in their area may opt to do this. Helpfully, demographic information about British Sikhs will be available for the first time from the results of the religious identity question in the 2001 census due to be published next February.

While there is always the possibility of a low level attack (eg, website defacements or narrowly targeted denial of service attacks) we think the current likelihood of a successful major damaging attack against United Kingdom interests is low. However, we keep the situation under constant review, a task which lies with the National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) (see www.niscc.gov.uk). Although focused on CNI institutions, other systems administrators may like to look at the advice and information available through the NISCC website, and also at the linked Unified Incident Reporting and Alert Scheme, www.uniras.gov.uk which contains information on best practice, new vulnerabilities and mitigating actions. www.dti.gov.uk also contains useful information on information security.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what the clear-up rate by police force was for burglaries in <i>(a)</i> urban, <i>(b)</i> rural and <i>(c)</i> suburban areas in each year since 1979;  [78757]
<P>

<P>
<a name="21107w94.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Recorded crime and detection statistics are not recorded by whether the crimes are committed in urban, rural or suburban areas. The requested figures for clear-up (detections) rate by police force area for each year since 1979 are given in the table, which has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21107w94.html_para3">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which increased the total number of crimes counted in each police force area, and therefore may have affected the detection rate. Detection rates after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.
<P>

<a name="21107w94.html_para4">There was also a change in the counting rules for detections on 1 April 1999, the new instructions providing more precise and rigorous criteria for

securing a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. For example, detections obtained by the interview of a convicted prisoner were no longer included. Numbers of detections before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="21107w94.html_para5">The adoption of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002, aimed to move the crime counts for the 43 forces of England and Wales onto a more consistent national basis, and to take a more victim-centred approach to crime recording. A small number of forces adopted the principles of the standard prior to April 2002. As a result both recorded crime and detection rates will have been affected for 2001&#150;02. Had this effect not occurred, it has been estimated that the overall detection rate in England and Wales in 2001&#150;02 would have been 24 per cent., the same as the previous year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many burglaries with entry per 10,000 households in <i>(a)</i> 2000&#150;01, <i>(b)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(c)</i> 2002&#150;03 took place in <i>(i)</i> urban and (ii) rural areas of England and Wales; and if he will break them down by region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107w94.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 5 November 2002]:</i> Recorded crime statistics are not recorded by whether the crimes are committed in urban, rural or suburban areas. However, the British Crime Survey (BCS), indicates the percentage of households victims of burglary with entry (once or more) by area type for interviews conducted in the 2001&#150;02 financial year. The BCS estimates that 1.2 per cent. of households in rural areas were victims of burglary with entry (once or more) compared to 2.1 per cent. of those in urban areas.
<P>

<a name="21107w94.html_para6">The latest British Crime Survey produced for the first time, for BCS interviews conducted in 2001&#150;02 estimates of burglary with entry per 10,000 households, and attempted burglary per 10,000 households, by region. Figures were not recorded on this basis before this, and the figures for 2002&#150;03 are not yet available. Regional figures are only given for the BCS due to the variability of specific offence figures at police force level. The figures for 2001&#150;02 BCS interviews are given in the table.

<P>
<a name="21107w97.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2002]:</i> Details for the financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02, were published in table 8.01 of XCriminal Statistics England and Wales 2000", and are given in the table. A copy of the publication is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para1">As different police forces have different crime mixes, comparing overall detection rates between forces is of limited value. This is because different types of crime tend to have different detection rates, and so a police force with which has a higher proportion of types of crime with high detection rates will tend to have a higher overall detection rate. Also, police forces may give 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 823W</I><P>
priority to tackling particular types of crime, with the detection rate of those crimes having some effect on the force's overall detection rate.
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para2">The detection rates for 2001&#150;02 may have been affected in comparison to those of the previous year as a result of some police forces implementing the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard in advance of its national implementation on 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para3">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which increased the total number of crimes counted in each police force area, and 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2002 : Column 824W</I><P>
therefore may have affected the detection rate. Detection rates after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para4">There was a change in the counting rules for detections on 1 April 1999, the new instructions providing more precise and rigorous criteria for securing a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. For example, detections obtained by the interview of a convicted prisoner were no longer included. Numbers of detections before and after this date are therefore not directly comparable.

<i>[holding answer 20 October 2002]:</i> The Prison Service has already issued policy guidance for the management of disabled prisoners and staff to all establishments. This reflects the requirements of each stage of the implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA).
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para5">Prisoners are required to review and change, if necessary, their procedures and practices and to make reasonable adjustments to their services and facilities to ensure that they are accessible to disabled people. Prisons have also published local policy documents outlining what people with disabilities are able to expect at that establishment.
<P>

<a name="21107w97.html_para6">The Prison Service is developing a comprehensive disability strategy which will ensure disability issues are reflected in its practices and policies. This will raise awareness and commitment, and enable the Prison Service to implement the final stage of the DDA in 2004.

<a name="21107w98.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The results of three major drug education programmes, developed by the Home Office, have been published during the past five years.
<P>

<a name="21107w98.html_para5">In 1997, the Home Office published an evaluation of Project CHARLIE (Chemical Abuse Resolution Lies in Education). This project involved 44 children in primary schools in Hackney between 1991 and 1993. Four years after the programme both tobacco and illegal drug use were significantly lower among Project CHARLIE children than among pupils who had not been involved in the project.
<P>

<a name="21107w98.html_para6">In 2001, final results of the NE Choices programme were published. This prevention programme, based in the north-east of England, was targeted at young people aged between 13 and 16. There was no evidence of an impact of the programme on the overall prevalence of drug use. However, a small proportion (2 per cent.) of pupils changed their drug taking behaviour from consumption of Class A drugs to the use of cannabis, solvents or nitrites or to non-use.
<P>

<a name="21107w98.html_para7">Similar findings are found in the 2002 results of the evaluation of the Integrated Programme (IP). The IP is based on North American evidence that school programmes that are reinforced by parent involvement and community engagement have an impact on reducing drug taking. The IP was designed and delivered to adolescents in Northern England during 1998 to 1999. The IP was a demonstration project that was too small to generate significant reductions in prevalence. However, the results suggest that young people who received the IP were more likely to reduce harder drug use and maintain a lower-risk drug-taking repertoire than those who had not participated in the programme.
<P>

<a name="21107w98.html_para8">Since these three projects were commissioned, an overview of international research has been completed. This identified two prevention programmes with the greatest impact on behaviour which had been developed in the United States. On the basis of this evidence, the Government have established a research programme called XBlueprint". This will determine whether elements of US Xwhat works" programmes: (1) can be implemented within the UK settings; (2) have potential to be effective in reducing drug use, and (3) have added value for schools, parents and young people.

 Open prisons hold large numbers of short-term prisoners who have been carefully assessed and identified as low risk.

<a name="21107101.html_para0">In addition to their role with short-term prisoners, open prisons contribute towards the resettlement of prisoners coming towards the end of medium and long-term sentences, including life sentence prisoners. This aspect of their work involved the selection and oversight of prisoners engaged in unpaid community work and, for those within 12 months of their parole eligibility date, in full-time paid employment. These opportunities are only available to prisoners who have passed a stringent risk assessment process, and whose progress and behaviour are subject to constant review.
<P>

<a name="21107101.html_para1">The arrangements for the resettlement role of open prisons are contained in the National Framework of Requirements for Resettlement Regimes which was issued in November 2001. The Prison Service will shortly review the way in which the National Framework has operated during its first 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21107101.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The original business case for replacing the obsolete passport production system (PIMIS) and improve the efficiency, effectiveness and security of the passport document compared a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) solution with non-PFI which resulted in the PFI solution being #32 million cheaper to public funds over the proposed 10 years of any system:

<P>

<a name="21107101.html_para3">Since the business case was completed in July 1997 there have been many changes to the Agency, with major initiatives including modernisation, anti-fraud and customer service improvements. The flexibility within the PFI contract has allowed the Agency to drive forward on these initiatives in the most economical fashion calling on our private sector partners' expertise and achieving improvements through a controlled and negotiated contract change control process.
<P>

<a name="21107101.html_para4">Now that the PFI solution is fully in place at all seven passport offices an efficiency strategy for the remaining years of the contract is being formulated with efficiencies expected to be realised for financial year 2002&#150;03 onwards.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave him on 22 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 243W, on the action I am taking to increase the time police officers can spend on the streets rather than dealing with paperwork. The introduction of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for police officers has the potential to make a major contribution to that aim.
<P>

<a name="21107102.html_para0">The Police Bureaucracy Taskforce identified a clear and pressing requirement for officers to be able to remotely update force systems via a hand-held device. A number of forces are now taking this forward and are piloting the use of hand-held devices. However we need to ensure that any hand-held device is useable in an operational environment and that the technical and information management infrastructure is also in place to provide and send data. That is why we are taking a pilot approach.
<P>

<a name="21107102.html_para1">Our aim is to identify and spread good practice and provide practical advice and guidance to forces on the implementation and use of mobile data services. We are also providing forces with the new Airwave radio communication system, which when fully implemented will deliver mobile data facilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is on the maximum distance between the place of arrest and a custody suite persons in police custody should be transported.  [77766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107102.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There is no central policy on the maximum distance persons should be transported between arrest and a custody facility. Such transfers fall within chief constables' operational discretion. Chief constables are required to designate the police stations which are to be used for the purpose of detaining arrested persons. However, the location and distribution of such stations is entirely a matter for chief constables to decide. Constables do have the power to take arrested persons to non-designated stations in certain specific circumstances. For example, where they are working in an area covered by a non-designated station and they think it will only be necessary to detain the person for a relatively short time.
<P>

<a name="21107102.html_para2">A further important development in this area will be the planned introduction of Xstreet bail". This will remove the absolute obligation on police officers to take arrested persons to a police station as soon as practicable. Officers will be able to exercise discretion and decide to bail arrestees on the street on the basis that they must undertake to attend a police station at a later time.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> When first appointed in January 2001, the Director of the Standards Unit, Mr. Kevin Bond was seconded to the Home Office from his employers, Earth Tech Inc. The effect of this was that Mr. Bond's duties and obligations were equivalent to a full-time permanent member of the civil service, but that the Home Office reimbursed Earth Tech for the cost of his services.
<P>

<a name="21107102.html_para4">From October 2002, Mr. Bond ceased to be an employee of that company and the secondment agreement was replaced with a fixed term employment contract with the Home Office. The salary of #195,000 which Mr. Bond receives from the Home Office is the same as applied under the secondment agreement.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what figures he has collated on the extent of stalking of women; and how many women aged 16 to 24 years old have been stalked in the last three years.  [78820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21107104.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The 1998 British Crime Survey included an innovative computerised self-completion questionnaire designed to provide the first reliable measure of the extent of 'stalking' in England and Wales. A nationality representative sample of 9,988 16 to 59 year olds were asked whether they had been subject to 'persistent and unwanted attention' during their lifetime and during the preceding year. Persistent and unwanted attention was described to respondents at the beginning of the questionnaire in the following way:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>XPeople may sometimes be pestered or harassed either by someone they know or a stranger. This person might do things like phoning or writing, following them or waiting outside their home or workplace".</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21107104.html_para2">Those who had been subject to such incidents were asked details about their experience. The questionnaire was deliberately designed to capture a wide range of experiences that could potentially be regarded as incidents of 'stalking'. However it should be stressed that these incidents were not necessarily regarded as crimes by the respondents and do not equate to offences under the Protection for Harassment Act 1997.
<P>

<a name="21107104.html_para3">These results are published in Home Office Research Study 210, which is deposited in the Library. This report indicates that four per cent of women had experienced persistent and unwanted attention in the last year, compared to two per cent of men. 17 per cent of women aged 16 to 19 and eight per cent of those aged 20 to 24 had experienced such in this period. It is possible that those patterns are, at least in part, accounted for by differences in how men and women, particularly young women, interpret both the term persistent and unwanted attention and their own experiences.

 The Prison Service currently has no plans to build a prison for women in Wales. The Prison Service view is that new prison development should primarily be concentrated in areas of the greatest shortage of places. Currently these are the north west, the Midlands and London.
<P>

<a name="21107105.html_para0">The number of women prisoners from Wales, currently around 170, does not justify the building of a female prison. However the Prison Service is well aware of the geographical difficulties being posed for some small sections of the prison population, and their needs would certainly be a consideration in any future plans for the development of the prison estate.

<a name="21107106.html_para2">In 2001, the European Investment Bank invested Euro2,337 million (#1,469 million) in respect of projects in the UK. This comprised individual loans (for projects in a single sector or region) of Euro1,734 million (#1,090 million) and global loans (for projects covering more than one sector and/or region) of Euro603 million (#379 million). Individual loans focused on energy (Euro144 million (#91 million)), communications

(Euro736 million (#463 million)); three-quarters of which were for improvement of telecommunications networks, water management, together with urban infrastructure (Euro641 million (#403 million)) and health and education (Euro212 million (#133 million)). Information on individual projects has been published in the EIB's Annual Report 2001, a copy of which is available in the Library. Information on the EIB's project pipeline is available on the EIB website (www.eib.org). This includes information on loans signed, approved and under appraisal. Annual Reports can also be accessed from the website.
<P>

<a name="21107106.html_para3">A total of Euro8,434 million (&#163;5,174 million) will be available from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for projects in the UK over the current funding period, 2000&#150;06. As with the European Investment Bank funding, detailed information on individual projects could be obtained only at disproportionate cost as it is not held centrally by the DTL However, if you are interested in a particular ERDF or EIB-backed project, please write to me again and I will endeavour to obtain the relevant information.
