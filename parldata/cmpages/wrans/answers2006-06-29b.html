of&#163;15.8 million to support public sector research on
improved seed varieties, including plant breeding, over the past three
years. The vast majority of research supported has been carried out
overseas, with some advanced research being carried out at UK
institutions, including the John Innes centre and the university of
Leeds.</p><p><a name="06062978000041">DFID is already
working with the World Bank and other donors to see how we can increase
the quality and quantity of aid given for agricultural research. For
example, we are working in Africa to support regional agricultural
research programmes. We expect this will lead to increased grants and
loans for research from the World Bank and other donors. We expect some
of these funds will be used to support plant breeding and development
of new seed varieties that meet the needs of poor
farmers.</p><p><a name="06062978000042">DFID&#146;s
Plant Sciences Research Programme managed by the centre for arid zone
studies at the university of Wales at Bangor allocated &#163;3.6
million over the last three years for plant breeding research with
overseas partners. This included work on: resistance of pearl millet to
downey mildew, nematode resistance of rice, banana and potato,
aluminium tolerance in wheat, new breeding methods based on farmer
participation in design and selection of varieties of rice, maize and
cassava, and genetic marker assisted methods for pearl millet
improvement.</p><p><a name="06062978000043">DFID
also provides core funding to the international agricultural research
centres of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR). Centres vary in the proportion of their budgets
devoted to plant breeding. Of the core support DFID has given to
centres, over the last three years, we estimate that &#163;12.2
million has been used to support research on plant breeding and
improving crop varieties for the benefit of poor people in developing
countries.</p><p><a name="06062978000044">DFID has
not undertaken, or commissioned, research into the extent of, and
impact on, the role of the private sector within the global seed
industry. However policy research has been carried out which examined
the pros and cons of revenue generation from public plant breeding and
links to the private sector. (Tripp and Byerlee 2000,

Thomas:</b> DFID&#146;s assessment is that there are
circumstances when the private sector can play a role in meeting the
needs of poor people. This is because, in spite of extensive technical
assistance, public water utilities in developing countries have found
it difficult to improve their performance and outreach. This has come
about for a variety of reasons that we need to understand and learn
from. DFID continuously assesses and learns from examples of public and
private sector participation in delivering
water.</p><p><a name="06062978000049">There are good
and bad examples of both public and private service provision. The best
approach often involves partnerships between the public sector, the
private sector and communities. An important factor for success is
effective regulation, with enforceable contracts that set out clearly
what is expected. One example is a four-year public-private partnership
in South Africa focusing on poor rural communities, which has brought
water to more than nine million people in five

the continuing process of preparing to operate the Joint Strike Fighter

wide range of discussions with US counterparts on all aspects of the
Joint Strike Fighter programme. As my noble Friend, the Minister for

discussions have raised the issue of information access and explained
the UK&#146;s requirements for operational sovereignty. These

and can improve an individual&#146;s health and well-being. Our Green
Paper sets out proposals aimed at achieving an employment rate
equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. We will do
this by reducing the number of people on incapacity benefits, by
helping lone parents into work and by increasing the number of older
workers.</p><p><a name="06062980000101">We propose to
significantly reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits
through a three pronged approach: reducing the number of people who
leave the workplace due to illness; increasing the number leaving
benefits and better addressing the needs of all those on benefit with
additional payments to the most severely disabled
people.</p><p><a name="06062980000102">Work is still
under way in relation to the proposals, and an assessment of the
potential impact on child poverty will form part of this. We are
currently reviewing the DWP contribution to reducing child poverty
across all current and planned policies and, in the autumn, we will be
setting out our new strategy for how we can make faster progress
towards reaching our goal of halving child poverty by
2010.</p>

noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful
comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has
been recorded. In particular whilst the volume of stage 1 written
complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002-03 and 2003-04, this is likely
to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints
received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three

Whilst the Agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to

Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between
December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded
throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with
later years.  <sup>(3)</sup> Whilst the Agency did receive
complaints directly to the Chief Executive, treat official complaints,
and MP complaints to Business Units prior to 2000/01, their volumes
were not recorded.  <sup>(4)</sup> During 2003-04 complaints
sent directly to the Chief Executive were not recorded separately from
those complaints that were escalated to him as part of the 3-stage
process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received
during 2003-04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints
received by the Chief Executive directly (as opposed to those escalated
via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with
data for earlier years.  <sup>(5)</sup> In April and May of
2004, the Chief Executive received a total of 1,435 complaints however,
is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the Chief
Executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the
complaints process). From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such
complaints were recorded separately, the Chief Executive received 4,393
direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2.
Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this
category with earlier years.  <sup>(6)</sup> Treat official

are:</p></ul><a name="06062980000858"><ul><p class="tabletext">The

contract realignment included resolution of outstanding CSR contractual
issues with EDS. As part of this agreement, EDS is required to deliver
a staged programme of work to fix agreed defects on CS2. The Department
is monitoring delivery of this programme to planned milestone dates and
to agreed testing acceptance and implementation quality criteria. Once
all the relevant services have been transformed, application

is no longer an Executive agency of the Home Office but is now a
limited company, wholly owned by the Home Office. As such, it is a
commercial organisation operating in a competitive environment. The
information requested concerning the income generated from individual
police forces could have adverse commercial consequences for the FSS if
released and could serve to benefit private forensic science service
providers who compete for business against the FSS, but who are not
subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the same way. I am therefore

The overall purpose of sexual assault referral centres is to deliver a
holistic and high quality service to victims of rape and sexual assault
including medical care, counselling and support, and to provide
enhanced facilities for gathering evidence. Rape crisis provides a
network of co-ordination, support and advocacy for member voluntary and
