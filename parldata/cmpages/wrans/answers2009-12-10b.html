For example, earlier this year, we hosted an international workshop in Reading which reviewed the 2010 indicators and considered implications for post 2010 indicator development. We have also been feeding into key discussions at EU and global level on the development of the post 2010 framework. Linked to this, we will co-host an international workshop with Brazil in January.

 The Secretary of State co-hosted this roundtable event along with Ashok Khosla, the President of the International Union of Conservation and Nature, in support of the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration. In the co-chairs' summary, "The London Challenge", they recognise the progress made by the partnership since its establishment in 2003, the considerable potential for forest restoration globally and the important role of forest restoration in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Work on restoration complements the work we are doing to tackle deforestation and forest degradation. The summary goes on to reflect issues raised by participants and actions to take forest restoration forward in the coming months.

(or £1.7 billion), since 2001-02. We also know that more patients have been helped, with crisis resolution teams providing over 106,000 home treatments to patients in the year 2007-08.</p>

 The Department is working towards publishing a White Paper on care and support in early 2010.

Our core modelling assumptions have changed quite significantly since then as a result of our stakeholder engagement, responses to our consultation and developments such as the Prime Minister's announcement on free personal care.

 The Coal Health Compensation Schemes have been closely scrutinised by a range of reviews including the Boys Smith Review conducted in 2005 for the then Minister for Energy, my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks); the Trade and Industry Select Committee Review in 2005; and the National Audit Office report in 2007 on the schemes and the subsequent Public Accounts Committee hearing in 2007 and Committee's Report in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para0"><a name="09121069001091">I am proud that we are now moving towards the conclusion of these schemes under my ministerial 'watch'. We believe these are the biggest personal injury schemes in British legal history. They are complex schemes that were set up in agreement between the Department and the miners' solicitors' representatives following the original judgments in the 1990's and then endorsed by the High Court. This ensured that miners and their families received the level of compensation to which they might reasonably have been entitled had they pursed their claim in common law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para1"><a name="09121069001092">I believe that objective has been achieved as we now draw near to the completion of the vibration white finger (VWF) and respiratory disease schemes. In all almost 760,000 miners' claims have been processed and compensation now totalling £4.1 billion has been paid out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para2"><a name="09121069001093">The VWF litigation was wound up in the High Court on 1 May 2009 following the completion of processing nearly all the 170,000 claims. There are now fewer than 10 VWF general damages and 20 special damages scheme claims left to settle. There are also a small number of claims involving individual mediations or court actions to be concluded. For the respiratory scheme where we had nearly 590,000 claims there are now less than 2,000 active claims left to be settled and we are on track to achieving settlement of the majority of these by mid 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para3"><a name="09121069001094">However, it has not all been plain sailing. Clearly we have all learnt lessons from the operation of these schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para4"><a name="09121069001095">One of the key issues remains the conduct of solicitors in making deductions from compensation. I continue to hold regular meetings with the Legal Complaints Service (LCS) and Solicitors Regulatory Authority (SRA) and I know that this work remains an important focus for both organisations. I welcome recent developments both in terms of action taken against individual firms of solicitors and actions being taken by solicitors to offer repayment of deductions. I would urge firms that have not taken such actions to co-operate with the LCS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para5"><a name="09121069001096">I also recognise that despite the scale of these schemes it has taken too long for some claimants to receive the compensation they were entitled too. I apologise to those people who have had to wait so long. The key lesson here is about making sure information required to process claims is obtained at an early stage and the use of tight and binding timescales for all parties to manage the claims to be settlement. The successful fast track risk offer scheme has also demonstrated how claims can be settled more rapidly for some claimants.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what assessment he has made of the merits of including in his Department's report, Appraisal of sustainability of the draft national nuclear policy statement: main report, published on 9 November 2009, an appraisal relating to the uranium mined for the nuclear fuel used in new reactors. [305241]</p>

 The Appraisal of Sustainability is intended to assess the environmental and sustainability impacts of the draft Nuclear National Policy Statement and therefore focuses on those impacts which arise from the draft Nuclear National Policy Statement itself. The draft Nuclear National Policy Statement provides guidance to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on the construction and operation of new nuclear power stations. It does not cover mining or milling of uranium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="91210w0008.htm_para7"><a name="09121069001100">The Government have previously considered the environmental impacts of uranium mining and milling as part of the 2007 consultation on nuclear power. The Government published their response in the Nuclear White Paper in January 2008. In the Nuclear White Paper, the Government set out that conventional uranium mining do not differ significantly from mining of other metalliferous ores or coal for other types of power stations. Furthermore, an increasing proportion of the world's uranium now comes from in-situ leaching. This is a process that does not require the ore to be mined and generates much less waste, though it can have a negative impact on the water table and is not suitable for all types of uranium deposits. There are established environmental constraints, such as the regulations governing uranium mining in Australia which cover, among other things, environmental protection and the requirement to meet environmental approvals before mining proceeds. Additionally, most uranium mining companies in Australia and Canada, which supply much of the world's uranium, have achieved certification from the International Organisation for Standardisation. This body sets the standard for, and undertakes audits of, environmental management systems. These environmental constraints minimise the environmental impacts of mining operations.</p>

 Corruption is endemic throughout society and state. Pervasive corruption within government and the security forces undermines the legitimacy of the government and corrodes consent.

President Karzai made a commitment to tackling corruption in his inauguration speech.

 Environmental specialists studying the effects of climate change in Bangladesh believe that as many as 30 million Bangladeshis could be affected by a one metre rise in sea level. When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dipu Moni at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Port of Spain on 28 November 2009, they discussed the importance to Bangladesh of a robust deal on climate change. This included calling for a fair, equitable and global deal at Copenhagen, particularly on adaptation and mitigation, and sufficient, predictable and additional international finance. We will continue to work closely with the Bangladesh Government and civil society to secure an equitable deal at Copenhagen this week.</p>

 The Food Strategy Task Force was established by the Cabinet Office in July 2008, to oversee the delivery of activities identified in the Food Matters cross-Governmental strategy on food. It was comprised of civil servants from Cabinet Office, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the Department for Health, the Chief Scientific Adviser, the Department for International Development, the Treasury, the Food Standards Agency, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Energy and Climate Change, and the Devolved Administrations. Progress of this work was set out in the "Food Matters One Year On" report which was published in August 2009. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Following completion of most of the agreed actions, the Food Strategy Task Force was wound up and responsibility for ongoing cross-Governmental co-ordination of food policy was transferred to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills if he will issue a letter of intent to repay capped funds withheld by the Learning and Skills Council to the training providers of apprenticeships for those aged 19 years or more. [304263]</p>

<p><a name="st_289"><a name="09121096001083"><a name="91210w0017.htm_spnew2"><a name="09121096002642"><b>Kevin Brennan:</b>
 We have no plans to issue any such letters. Funding of Apprenticeships is the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The LSC contracts with FE colleges and training organisations to deliver training places funded up to a maximum contract value. In March 2009, providers were advised in writing by the LSC not to exceed or to further exceed Apprenticeship contract values for adults. Recruitment of new apprentices could continue up to maximum contract values and the LSC has committed to funding the training of apprentices who had already started on their programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_506"><a name="91210w0017.htm_para2"><a name="09121096001084">The LSC has a clear responsibility to manage its finances within agreed budgets and made it clear to providers that any further commitments above their agreed maximum contract values would not be funded. However the LSC has sought to ensure, through performance management actions, that funding is moved to the highest performing providers. Where possible, for 19-24 provision this has resulted in increases to agreed contract levels, but as demand has been so high for those aged over 25 the LSC has had to continue to take actions to manage demand to remain within the overall funding limits it has available.</p>

Part of the work of this group is to carry out exercises responding to emergencies, in order to ensure any recovery can take place as soon as possible.

 With respect to campaign contact by candidates, the Queen's Regulations prohibit all forms of political activity, including political meetings and speeches, in service establishments. Canvassers may visit at the discretion of the commanding officer, but no material issued by or on behalf of a political party may be distributed in service institutions. There is good internet access in service establishments, including those overseas, and personnel may access campaign information in this way. They may also access television election broadcasts. Campaign literature may be sent to those electors who have a UK address on the electoral register.</p>

The declaration period for service voters is to be extended from three years to five as soon as parliamentary time allows, which will increase convenience for these voters. However, service voters face unique challenges in exercising their vote. I recently met armed forces families' representatives and MPs to discuss service voting and a range of suggestions were made to further assist service personnel and their families. I have also set up a working group to consider possible improvements to the current system for this election and to identify a more comprehensive solution to be taken forward in the next Parliament.</p>

The publication is normally scheduled for late autumn of the following year to which it refers. The length of time from end of the year to publication is due to the extensive validation checks that are carried out to ensure where possible individual data are consistent with both legislation and the actual outcome at court.

 Young adult offenders aged 18 to 24 may, depending on the circumstances of the offence and offender, be sentenced to a community order. The community order is available to courts on conviction under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and may include a programme requirement, an activity requirement or an attendance centre requirement, among others. The purposes of sentencing set out in the Act include the reform and rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_563"><a name="91210w0023.htm_para0"><a name="09121096002439">A programme requirement requires the offender to participate in a particular accredited programme at times and places specified in the order. Under an activity requirement offenders may be required to take part in activities at places and times specified in the order. An attendance centre requirement means that the offender must attend an attendance centre at the times specified and engage in occupation or receive instruction as required. Some of these programmes, activities, etc. could be described as training courses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_564"><a name="91210w0023.htm_para1"><a name="09121096002440">A court may impose an ancillary order in addition to or instead of a community order. Some such orders for example, a parenting order, may include elements of training. Programme, activity and attendance centre requirements may also be imposed on 18 to 24-year-olds as part of a suspended sentence order.</p>
