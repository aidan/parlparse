 I understand that in 2007, the last full year for which figures are available, Ecclesiastical Insurance, which insures most Church of England churches, received 2,300 claims relating to the theft of metal from Anglican churches with a total value of &#163;9 million. This compares with 80 claims totalling &#163;300,000 in 2005. By the end of September this year, they had already received claims for more than &#163;8 million so 2008 will clearly be the worst year yet for the theft of metals (predominantly lead) from churches.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 October 2008]:</i> DVLA operates a strategy of education, warning and direct enforcement to help tackle non-compliant unlicensed foreign vehicles. Education activities have involved presentations to community leaders, articles in the media, the issue of information leaflets and warning notices placed on vehicle windscreens. Vehicles circulating in breach of the rules are subject to enforcement action including wheel clamping and impounding. Since 2006, nearly 1200 non-compliant foreign vehicles have been subject to direct enforcement action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="81027w0001.htm_para9"><a name="0810271000113">Every year, the overall costs incurred and revenues generated from DVLA&#146;s enforcement activities are published in the Agency&#146;s Annual Report and Accounts. Activities relating to foreign vehicles are not accounted for separately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="81027w0001.htm_para10"><a name="0810271000114">In terms of offences committed by drivers of foreign registered vehicles, under new provisions in the Road Safety Act 2006 the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency will, in future, be able to issue fixed penalties to offenders as well as prohibiting vehicles and drivers for various offences. In addition, any driver who does not have a satisfactory address in the UK will be required to pay an immediate deposit equivalent to the amount of the fixed penalty&#151;or the level of fine the offence would be likely to attract if prosecuted in court. The police will also be able to require the immediate payment of such deposits.</p>

 Parking companies may obtain data from the DVLA vehicle record where they have reasonable cause. Legislation providing for reasonable cause disclosure has been in existence for over 40 years, predating the establishment of the DVLA. On application for disclosure, all relevant information must be provided to enable checks to be made to establish the veracity of the applicant and the reasonable cause claimed. If approved, the vehicle keeper&#146;s name and address are released together with the make, model and colour of the vehicle. A record is kept on the vehicle register of all such disclosures enabling the applicant to be identified if there are later inquiries.</p>

 When the new member states acceded to the EU in 2004, the Government decided to allow A8 nationals to take up work freely in the UK subject to registering with the Workers Registration Scheme. Information collected via the scheme records show that by June 2008, some 85,000 accession nationals had registered to take up work in the agricultural sector. Of these, around 6,400 were specifically registered to work as fruit pickers, and 12,900 as crop harvesters.</p>

Given the importance the industry attaches to SAWS, Government agreed not to phase out the scheme until 2010 in order to give the industry time to adapt to a labour market expanded by nationals from the new member states.</p>

This meeting concluded with a commitment to maintain a dialogue between Government and the industry on this matter, and this is ongoing.</p>

Tier 3 of the PBS provides a potential route for low-skilled workers from outside the EU to take up work in the UK but is suspended for the foreseeable future, while restrictions remain in place for A2 nationals.</p>

In addition, in the low incidence areas of the country we use the more sensitive gamma interferon blood test alongside the skin test to identify as many infected cattle as possible at the earliest opportunity and try to clear out infection in the herd quickly.</p>

Data for lost/stolen passes for Veterinary Laboratories Agency are not available for 2007 due to a change in responsibility of pass production. Figures do not include Animal Health as information is not available. All electronic passes reported as lost or stolen are cancelled immediately on access control systems making them invalid. Losses of paper escorted and unescorted visitor passes (which are not able to activate access control points) are rare and are not recorded.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 October 2008]:</i> In association with the Kennel Club, the Forestry Commission published its guide, Managing Dogs in the Wood, in March 2007. This advocates the promotion of car parks that are attractive and well suited to dog walkers in order to reduce the potential for conflict with other interests. The Forestry Commission has no plans to designate car parks as dog-free but access to some other areas by dogs is actively discouraged, for example in children&#146;s play areas.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 September 2008]:</i> DEFRA has overall policy responsibility for flood risk management and provides funding for schemes to Operating Authorities (Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). The funding for flood risk has been administered by the Environment Agency since April 2006. Information on potential projects is collected from operating authorities and the Environment Agency decide which projects to promote and their timing to meet the targets set by DEFRA. Since the projects are not formally approved until funding is confirmed none will have been postponed or have had their commencement delayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="81027w0004.htm_para7"><a name="0810276000605">Some projects do, however, take longer to deliver than is originally envisaged. From 2004-08 the Environment Agency's National Capital Programme Management Service was responsible for a total of 146 completed projects. Of these, 83 were completed early or on time and 63 were completed after the expected date. 70 per cent. of these projects were delivered within two months of the expected completion date.</p>

 The Environment Agency allocates funding to Regional Flood Defence Committees for both new capital schemes and to maintain existing defences on the basis of national priorities to ensure that the funding is spent to optimum effect. This inevitably means that the allocation to each Regional Flood Defence Committee is likely to change year on year, particularly as capital schemes are completed.</p>

 A set of nine outcome measures for flood and coastal erosion risk was published, following public consultation, in June 2007. The measures are described on the DEFRA website and the first measure, overall benefits, will include monetary estimates of the benefits to the national economy, with the expectation that in time the costs and benefits for different sectors will be identified separately. The term &#147;flood security&#148; is ambiguous, but a review of the outcome measures is under way and this will include consideration of alternative and additional measures.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 October 2008]:</i> On 8 July 2008 the European Commission published a proposal providing for the introduction of a voluntary EU-wide school fruit scheme for the supply into schools of fruit (including bananas) and vegetables. The proposals are principally for the provision of &#8364;90 million of European funds for the purchase of the fruit and vegetables themselves, allocated to member states on the basis of their population of school children aged between six and 10 years. A member state which chose to take part in the scheme would be required to provide co-finance and to submit a national strategy. EC funding cannot be used to replace existing national funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="81027w0005.htm_para5"><a name="0810276000792">The proposals for the scheme are currently being finalised in Brussels, with the intention that an agreement should be reached by the end of this year. As the proposals develop, they are being assessed and considered by officials and Ministers across Government and also with the devolved Administrations and external stakeholders.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 October 2008]:</i> There is no specific assistance available to low income families towards the costs of sewage or water pipe repairs. All water companies do however offer some degree of free or subsidised repair and replacement for domestic customers&#146; water supply pipes. This is undertaken as a leakage control measure as part of the water companies&#146; statutory duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. The exact nature of the repair policy and any restrictions to that policy are dependent on the water company and its operating conditions.</p>

 The properties of the group of herbicides to which aminopyralid belongs&#151;pyridine carboxylic acids&#151;have long been recognised. As a result of this, when the Advisory Committee on Pesticides considered the evaluation of aminopyralid in 2005 it concluded that products containing it should carry warnings on their labels that manure that could contain aminopyralid should not be used on susceptible crops, or on land intended for growing such crops, until all plant material had fully decomposed.</p>

 We do not routinely collate data on the number of insurgents killed by UK forces in Afghanistan. Collecting and verifying data is extremely difficult given the nature of the conflict. As we have said repeatedly, our long-term strategy towards defeating the insurgency in Afghanistan is through a wide range of military and non-military activity and not through an attritional, purely military campaign.</p>

Procedures are in place, and being constantly updated in the light of experience, both to minimise the risk of these casualties occurring and to investigate any incidents that do happen. Wherever possible, local populations are warned of impending operations. We should remember the insurgents are the real threat to the safety and security of the Afghan people by their indiscriminate use of violence. ISAF forces are not present on a permanent basis in many parts of Helmand province, which makes it difficult to monitor atrocities against the civilian population by the Taliban. It is therefore impossible to estimate with any confidence the number of civilian casualties in Helmand province in 2007-08 that have been caused by the current conflict.</p>

For example, a diabetic individual deployed on operations may experience difficulties in monitoring blood or urinary glucose levels; accessing medication; taking regular meals; maintaining a regular sleep pattern; accessing shared-care diabetic clinics; and accessing specialist services such as ophthalmology or chiropody. Such circumstances would adversely impact upon their diabetic control, thus increasing their risk of micro and macrovascular complications. Furthermore, an uncontrolled diabetic may constitute a risk not only to themselves, but also to others in a military or operational context. The single services manage individuals who develop diabetes during their service careers, according to their specific operational requirements and each case will be considered on an individual basis.</p>

 The inclusion of a trade on the pinch point register is subjective. There are a variety of factors, not of all which reflect a manning shortfall that will determine the inclusion of a trade. Single services review their list quarterly. Recent improvements in the analysis of problem trades has narrowed the focus on trades to specific rank ranges or has sub-divided a trade in order to better focus resources at the problem. This has led in part to the gradual rise in the number of pinch points. For example Merlin Aircrew has now been sub-divided into Merlin pilots, Observers and Aircrewman. By narrowing the focus into rank areas such as Infantry Pte-LCpl resources are better focused and the impact more apparent.</p>

 For the armed forces pension scheme 1975, the 2006 change constituted the introduction from 6 April 2006 of a preserved pension age of 65 for future service. The preserved pension age for service before that date is 60.</p>

In addition further savings were realised by the overall scheme design. For example, removing the immediate pension for those leaving before the age of 55 and replacing it with early departure payment (EDP) scheme benefits for those who serve until at least age 40 and have at least 18 years service. EDP income, which is paid until the preserved pension comes into payment at age 65, is paid at a significant lower level that would have been the case if the pension had become due on leaving the armed forces.</p>

 Contingency planning at AWE Burghfield is based on the output of a rolling programme of assessments undertaken as part of the site safety cases. Before the 2007 flooding these concluded that the surface water management system would be adequate to prevent flooding of the operational facilities in normal circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="81027w0007.htm_para8"><a name="0810276000941">Prior to the 2007 event, localised flooding was experienced at AWE Burghfield, which resulted in further contingency measures being implemented. This involved clearing and dredging the Burghfield Brook, which runs through the site, and reprofiling its banks to allow a greater amount of water to be contained and a constant flow to be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="81027w0007.htm_para9"><a name="0810276000942">Although the measures taken mitigated the effects of the July 2007 heavy rainfall, flooding still occurred as run-off from surrounding fields migrated to the site. Water sampling was completed throughout the site and no abnormal results were detected. At no time was there any threat to the operational safety of AWE sites, to the public or the environment.</p>

 It is important to bear in mind that the Ministry of Defence employs staff in a wide variety of occupations and professions. Some, such as our teachers and lecturers, belong to the teachers pension scheme while our medical and nursing staff belong to the NHS pension scheme. These, of course, are in a minority. The vast majority of MOD civil servants are eligible to belong to the civil service pension scheme&#151;although some choose not to join a pension scheme or opt for a partnership pension account. Consequently, the number of staff belonging to the four specified pension schemes falls short of the Department's total civil service strength which, as at 1 September, stood at 79,510 (full and part-time).

Since November 2006, a limited service to engage temporary staff has been provided through the People, Pay and Pensions Agency (PPPA). This does not yet cover all grades employed by the MOD, and therefore business units are still making their own arrangements where necessary. This means that information on total expenditure during each of the last five years could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 Explosion suppressant foam (ESF) was not fitted to the wing tanks of Hercules XV 179 in 2002 because it was not judged to be a sufficiently high priority at that time in relation to the assessed threat and emphasis was instead placed on implementing a range of other protective measures. The loss of XV179 showed that judgment was incorrect in relation to the threats which subsequently existed in 2005.</p>

 I am grateful for the very thorough and professional manner in which David Masters, HM Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon conducted the inquest into the loss of the 10 personnel tragically killed when Hercules XV179 crashed in Iraq in 2005. He brought a number of lessons to our attention and it is clear that there have been failures in our procedures for which I apologise. We will address all the issues raised during the inquest, where we have not already done so.</p>

<i> Quality of care:</i><br>
Data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and present all of these.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Discharges:</i><br>
A discharge episode is the last episode during a hospital stay (a spell), where the patient is discharged from the hospital (this includes transfer to another hospital).<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Length of stay (duration of episode)/Length of stay (duration of spell):</i><br>
Length of stay (LOS) is calculated as the difference in days between the admission date and the discharge date, where both are given. LOS is based on hospital spells and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded (unless otherwise stated). Information relating to LOS figures, including discharge method/destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.<br>
These data are restricted to discharge episodes which had the following types of admission method:<br>
21 = Emergency: via accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider<br>
22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)<br>
23 = Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau<br>
24 = Emergency: via consultant out-patient clinic<br>
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider.<br>

2. PCT expenditure is from the audited summarisation schedules 2001-02 to 2007-08.<br>
3. Population figures are ONS estimates 1997-98 to 2007-08.<br>
4. Note that the expenditure reported by PCTs does not represent all NHS spending, e.g. strategic health authority and dental and pharmaceutical services expenditure is not included, therefore figures for the PCTs are not comparable with the all England totals.<br>
5. Two tables have been provided for the PCTs owing to the reorganisation of the NHS in 2006 resulting in mainly new merged PCTs.<br>

2. Data on hepatitis D are not collected. Hepatitis D is a defective virus that replicates only in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.<br>
3. Notifications of hepatitis E are not recorded separately and are included under the category of other viral hepatitis.<br>
4. Hepatitis F is a hypothetical hepatitis virus. Several hepatitis F virus candidates emerged in the 1990s. Further investigations failed to confirm the existence of the virus, and it was delisted as a cause of infectious hepatitis.<br>
5. Data are not routinely collected on hepatitis G. Extensive worldwide investigation has failed to identify any association between the hepatitis G virus and hepatitis, and its clinical significance is unknown.<br>
6. There is currently no virus designated as hepatitis H.<br>

<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE):</i><br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Consultant Main Specialty:</i><br>
This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for care of the patient is contracted. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>
Consultant main specialties included:<br>
710 = Mental illness<br>
711 = Child and adolescent psychiatry<br>
712 = Forensic psychiatry<br>
713 = Psychotherapy<br>
715 = Old age psychiatry (available from 1990-91).<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

However, the Department gathers relevant information through analysis of sickness absence statistics; reviews of trends emerging from casework; and regular liaison with the staff disability network.

 The Government have taken steps to help people avoid having to sell their homes during their lifetime to pay for residential care. Since October 2001, local councils have been able to enter into a deferred payments agreement with people about to enter residential care. This allows people with property, but without income and other assets sufficient to meet their assessed financial contribution to the cost of residential care, to have a legal charge placed on their property to meet any shortfall. The local council then meets the cost of the person's residential care and reclaims the debt from the person's estate when their affairs are wound up. This gives people more options for meeting care home fees and avoids the need for their property to be sold during their lifetime.</p>

Local authorities also may not know if this has happened in the case of those who arrange their own care, for example, where a person sells a property and contracts with a care provider privately without involving social services. It is not, therefore, possible to estimate the number of homes that may have been sold for this purpose.</p>

 The use of false identity documentation is a problem which we take very seriously. Our response is led by the UK Border Agency National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) based at Status Park near Heathrow which is recognised both at home and abroad as the leader in its field. NDFU devises and conducts forgery detection training for all UK Border Agency personnel, ranging from basic training for new entrants, through intermediate to expert level. NDFU also delivers training to the police, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and the Department for Work and Pensions. This in turn leads to substantial numbers of falsified documents being discovered within the United Kingdom and inhibits the ability of people to adopt false identities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="81027w0018.htm_para3"><a name="08102732000416">The Government are keen to ensure that there are effective deterrents in place for those who use false identity documents. On 7 June 2006 we brought into force section 25 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. Law enforcement agencies continue to use these and other legislative provisions to undertake investigations and prosecutions against those who manufacture, sell and utilise false identity documents for a variety of criminal purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="81027w0018.htm_para4"><a name="08102732000417">In addition, the Passport Validation Service provided by the Identity and Passport Service allows organisations to validate the status of a UK passport that has been presented to them as evidence of identity, and has been operational since July 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="81027w0018.htm_para5"><a name="08102732000418">Government are aware that it can be difficult for organisations in the public and private sector to recognise fraudulent identification documents. The implementation of the National Identity Scheme will provide people with a highly secure means of protecting their identity and help citizens to prove their identities easily, quickly and with vastly improved security.</p>

The guidance makes clear that pupils with SEN and disabilities must not be excluded from school for being bullied, even if the school believes they are doing so for the child&#146;s benefit. The guidance also includes useful case studies illustrating how schools have successfully tackled the bullying of autistic pupils, and how schools should respond in situations where autistic pupils are provoked into attacking other pupils.

The date will be 7 November whether the election is held in May or June. This replicates the approach taken for the 2004 elections.</p>

 Reforms to the Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales took effect from 1 April 2008 based on benchmark costs provided by the Government Actuary&#146;s Department and agreed with key stakeholders, within a total cost envelope of 19.5 per cent. of total pensionable payroll. The net assumed annual savings arising from the reforms in respect of future accrual of pension rights is estimated at some 1.3 per cent. of pensionable payroll, which was estimated to be some &#163;30 billion for the year 2007-08.</p>

I wrote to chief executives of local authorities on 18 June 2008 to clarify the powers available under the Licensing Act 2003 and to seek their views on whether these, and other controls, are sufficient to respond to the concerns of local people. This attracted 117 responses, the majority of which felt that additional legislation should be introduced to provide controls which are specific to lap dancing and similar premises.</p>

At that stage, the economic impact assessment did not indicate a positive case for a roll-out of smart metering to all domestic customers. However, in a project of this scale the figures carry a high degree of uncertainty and many of the benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Officials have therefore been undertaking further work with stakeholders, including contracting some independent consultancy work, to ensure that the Government have the best possible understanding of costs, benefits and issues relating to smart metering. The intention is for Ministers to take a decision soon on whether to roll-out smart meters to domestic customers.</p>

In order to ensure competitive pricing, the Office of Fair Trading monitors the UK petrol and diesel market. It is empowered to act if the price level appears to be the result of anti-competitive behaviour. The best way of ensuring a competitive market is for consumers to shop around to support trades who reduce prices and punish those who do not by not buying there.</p>

 Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the Government. Since 2000, the Government have spent &#163;20 billion on fuel poverty benefits and programmes. The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy was published in November 2001 and sets out the approach of the Government (and the Devolved Administrations) for tackling fuel poverty. The latest version of the Fuel Poverty Strategy reflects the requirements of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act to do all that is reasonably practicable to end fuel poverty amongst the vulnerable by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="81027w0032.htm_para2"><a name="08102749001438">From 1996 to 2004, the Government made good progress with 4 million households lifted out of fuel poverty as a result of our energy efficiency programmes, falling energy prices and rising incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="81027w0032.htm_para4"><a name="08102749001440">The Government's Sixth Annual Progress Report on Fuel Poverty was published on 2 October 2008. It shows that in 2006 there were approximately 3.5 million households in fuel poverty across the UK, an increase of 1 million households since 2005. Around 2.75 million of these are vulnerable households (containing children, the elderly or a person who is disabled or suffering from a long-term illness).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="81027w0032.htm_para5"><a name="08102749001441">In England, the overall number of households estimated to be in fuel poverty in 2006 is 2.4 million of which around 1.9 million are vulnerable. This represents a rise of 900,000 households since 2005 and a rise of 700,000 vulnerable households over the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="81027w0032.htm_para6"><a name="08102749001442">The rise in the number of households in fuel poverty during 2006 was due to increases in consumer energy prices. The overall cost of energy to domestic consumers rose by 22 per cent. in real terms between 2005 and 2006, with gas prices rising by 29 per cent. and electricity prices rising by 19 per cent.</p>

The projections made for 2007 in England show that further price rises are likely to have pushed a further 0.7 million households into fuel poverty, which would mean a total of around 3.1 million households. Projections for 2008 show a further increase in fuel poverty for England of around 0.5 million households; this amounts to a total of around 3.6 million households. These projections are based on known price changes along with estimates for income and energy efficiency improvements.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate he has made of the number of convicted prisoners with severe psychiatric disorders in each of the last 10 years; and if he will make a statement. [229468]</p>

 No annual assessment is made of the number of convicted prisoners with severe psychiatric disorders. However, we are aware that there are a number of people in custody in England and Wales who experience mental health problems. The 1997 Office for National Statistics&#146; survey, for example, indicated that as many as 58 per cent. of male and 75 per cent. of female remand prisoners, and 39 per cent. of male and 62 per cent. of female sentenced prisoners met criteria for a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Rates of psychotic illness were also higher than in the general population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="81027w0034.htm_para3"><a name="08102818000408">Accurate identification of people needing mental health treatment and care is important at all stages in the care and offender pathway. This is why all prisoners are screened at reception for risks of mental ill health and previous history of psychiatric treatment. The Offender Assessment System (OASys) helps to ensure that any person judged to be at risk and/or of needing mental health treatment and care can be identified and referred, where appropriate, to the mental health in-reach team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="81027w0034.htm_para4"><a name="08102818000409">By 2005-06 nearly &#163;20 million was being invested recurrently in mental health in-reach. There are now 102 MH in-reach teams and all prisons now have access to them: a total of 360 extra staff altogether. There are also new systems to monitor and support those at risk of harming themselves.</p>

 Eight years after the adoption of UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1325, the resolution has had a positive impact on the inclusion of women in post-conflict negotiations and reconstruction. It has drawn international attention to the issue, it has resulted in greater inclusion of women in political dialogue in countries where the UN Peacebuilding Commission is operating, and mandates for UN peacekeeping missions now routinely request that the role of women is fully recognised. But we recognise that work must continue to ensure the systematic involvement of women at all stages of the conflict cycle. The adoption of UNSCR 1820 in June this year was a significant step forward in strengthening previous calls to address women&#146;s under-representation. In September, the UN Security Council held an Open Debate on &#145;mediation&#146; in conflict resolution reiterating this call and in October, the UN Security Council Open Debate will focus on the need to enhance the role of women in peace processes.</p>

We were among the first countries to draw up a national Action Plan setting out action for Government personnel and Departments to implement UNSCR 1325 and have encouraged other countries to do the same. Several European countries have since developed their own action plans. We regularly review the plan in partnership with civil society. We are raising awareness of gender in conflict by ensuring references in all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, and are promoting the role of women in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding through forums in a range of conflict affected countries.</p>

 The following tables show the negative DEL included in central Government departmental budgets published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2008 (HC 489). This shows the expected income as at the 2007 comprehensive spending review, updated with classification and policy changes. The main components are sales of goods and services (including by NHS and foundation trusts), grants from the EC and transfers from other Departments, for example, in respect of co-funded non-departmental public bodies.
