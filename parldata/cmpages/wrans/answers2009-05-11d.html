I am advised that the Bloody Sunday inquiry has spent &#163;11.5 million on such administration costs since its establishment to the end of March 2009.

 No such estimates have been made yet.

In recognition of this, the Secretary of State recently announced additional funding of &#163;4.3 million for bee health which includes supporting the implementation of the initial phase of a 10 year plan to improve and protect the health of honey bees in England and Wales. This additional funding will allow DEFRA to contribute &#163;0.5 million per annum over five years to a wider research programme on pollinator decline which was announced on 21 April.</p>

Places of worship, inter faith bodies, schools and colleges, local authorities and other public agencies will be holding their own local events. Activities will also aim to increase public awareness of the various faith communities of the UK, focusing on the contribution which their members make to their neighbourhoods and wider society.

Minor changes have been made each year to the survey content and reporting to reflect the changing information needs of government.

The forensic science laboratories are already accredited to testing international standards; accreditation that includes assessment of practitioner competence by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). The accreditation option is available to all practitioners. Registration with the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners was a voluntary process that left the majority of practitioners either choosing not to register or not able to register (front-line scientists in the laboratories who are covered by the UKAS accreditation could not register with the Council).</p>

Minimum levels of tax for HGVs as set out in directive 1999/62/EC are set according to similar variables. However, the weight limits in VED do not correspond to the weight limits as set by the directive. Furthermore, the directive sets different rates for vehicles depending on their suspension type, whereas rates of VED are not dependant on suspension type. In order to set all HGV VED rates at the minimum level permitted by the directive, it would be necessary to reform the entire structure of HGV VED. The Government have therefore not calculated the potential revenue effect of reducing VED rates for HGVs.</p>

 I and other UK Ministers have had many such discussions to try to improve the provision of aid to Sri Lanka. These include my visit to Sri Lanka on 27-28 April where I met the Sri Lankan Government, international agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). I pressed on the Government of Sri Lanka the need to: ensure international humanitarian access to those in the conflict zone; protect people from disproportionate use of force; and ensure early return for those who have been displaced. I also pressed the Government of Sri Lanka to improve the conditions for people in displacement camps, especially through allowing international organisations and NGOs better access.

 There are no figures available for the number of people who have died of starvation in Zimbabwe in the last 12 months as public record-keeping systems have, in many cases, broken down. According to the most recent UN nutritional assessments, malnutrition rates have continued to remain below emergency levels. Death from disease (including HIV/AIDS, TB, cholera and other gastro-intestinal conditions) is far more likely than starvation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para1"><a name="09051148000463">Since the early 1970s HSE has maintained a long term research study of more specific groups of workers in the British asbestos manufacturing industry, now including the current asbestos removals industry, to monitor their long term health status, in particular, their cancer and mortality rates, and to evaluate the effectiveness of legislation protecting their health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para2"><a name="09051148000464">Most recently the HSE (with Cancer Research UK) commissioned Professor Julian Peto of the Institute of Cancer Research to measure the lung asbestos content in individuals with the asbestos-related cancer, mesothelioma, and those with and without it, including young men only potentially exposed more recently, to better assess the level of past exposure associated with disease and predict the future impact of current exposures. This follows HSE-funded research by Professor Peto on mesothelioma risk in specific occupations and from other potential sources of exposure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para3"><a name="09051148000465">The programme enables the HSE to document and predict overall trends in the occurrence of key asbestos related diseases; identify changing patterns of occupational risk; monitor the long term health of those working in occupations covered by legislation on asbestos exposure at work; collate scientific information to improve knowledge about risk from different types of asbestos and at different exposures; and improve, and evaluate preventive measures.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 24 March 2009]:</i> Inquiries about employment and support allowance use the same modem telephony infrastructure as do inquiries to other DWP services. This ensures that we can satisfy our customers&#146; needs in an effective and efficient way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para7"><a name="09051148000490">DWP&#146;s executive team agreed last year that initial calls to inquire about and claim benefit should be free, so we should use 0800 numbers to ensure that the most important&#151;and longest&#151;calls are free to the majority of our customers. Subsequent calls for other reasons, such as offering further information or progress on the claim, take less time to resolve and should be charged at a standard rate for the majority of customers, so we should use 0845 numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para8"><a name="09051148000491">The telephony market is constantly changing but it would be unreasonable to expect customers to continually keep up with alterations to our telephone numbering in order to allow us to match the latest pricing by different service operators. Costs of calling 0845 numbers remain lower than many alternatives, but we keep the market under review. Using BT landlines to call 0845 numbers is usually the lowest cost option. BT account for two-thirds of landline provision and recent research shows that over 80 per cent. of our customers contact us using landlines. Therefore, we concluded that 0845 numbers offered the best solution for the majority of our customers. The Department receives no revenue from use of any of our numbers, including 0845.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="90511w0015.htm_para9"><a name="09051148000492">Alternatives to the service are for the customer to use the free phones provided in jobcentres to make inquiries. In the event the jobcentre does not have a free phone available, local arrangements are in place to provide the customer with the opportunity to use a standard Jobcentre Plus phone.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Northavon of 17 March 2009, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 1038-39W, on pensioners: social security benefits, what estimate he has made of the number of people who would receive more in benefits payments if tariff income rules were abolished and upper capital limits were retained.

 With the abolition of tariff income rules for pension credit and housing benefit and council tax benefit (for those who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit) while keeping the current upper capital limits in housing benefit and council tax benefit, approximately 710,000 pensioner households would receive higher income-related benefits at a cost of approximately &#163;560 million (2009-10 prices) per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90511w0016.htm_para1"><a name="09051148000550">The Government believe it is right that people with capital should contribute towards their own living costs, and right that support is targeted on those that need it most. That is why the current rules ignore the first &#163;6,000 of savings (&#163;10,000 for those in care homes) and why those with savings above this are expected to contribute a small amount to their weekly expenses.</p>

This change will take effect from November 2009 and will allow these customers to retain up to &#163;10,000 of capital before it affects their benefit. This change represents a generous increase in the capital thresholds for pension credit recipients and a significant simplification to the benefit.

1. In April 2006 Jobcentre Plus reorganised its counter fraud resources into two new services. The Fraud Investigation Service was established, focussing on high value cases with a view to securing criminal sanctions including prosecutions. At the same time a customer compliance approach was deployed to deal with less serious cases more speedily with an emphasis on benefit correction, recovery of overpayments and warning customers on their future conduct.<br>
2. The figures for 2006-07 reflect this with the number of investigations shown relating to criminal investigations only from this point. The number of customer compliance activities completed in 2006-07 and 2007-08 were 290,476 and 371,592 respectively.<br>

This will allow the customer in conjunction with their personal adviser to agree activities that are tailored to their individual circumstances and will best help them move closer to work.

 2. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such the figures represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises.

This is because these are not legal expenses. The proposal was put forward following discussions with CAFCASS, who confirmed that subject to suitable resources being available they agreed with the point in principle. The consultation responses are now being analysed since the close of the consultation on 3 April. We will have further discussions with the Legal Services Commission, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and CAFCASS, in the light of the evaluation, to agree a response to the consultation.</p>

Although the rate of progress in the number of pupils achieving five or more good GCSEs in Coventry has exceeded national rates over the same period, more is needed to reduce the gap in attainment still further. Under the National Challenge, the Department is providing wide-ranging support to eight of the authority&#146;s schools this year. The National Challenge supports schools with the lowest GCSE results, so that by 2011 in every secondary school at least 30 per cent. of students will achieve at least five GCSEs at A*-C including English and maths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90511w0022.htm_para2"><a name="09051148002152">The National Strategies also provides support to schools in Coventry and this includes support and challenge in relation to school improvement, English, maths, science, behaviour and attendance, SEN and ethnic minority achievement. The strategies have also supported the provision and delivery of city-side GCSE English and maths revision courses (held at the Ricoh stadium) for year 11 pupils (April 2009).</p>

 The Teachers&#146; Pension Scheme (England and Wales) is a statutory scheme and pension payments are determined in line with regulations.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss progress in implementing the Bologna reforms to date and priorities for the coming decade. We welcomed the fact that there continued to be good progress overall in implementing the reforms, and agreed that we needed to redouble our efforts at European, national and institutional level to ensure full implementation across the European higher education area.

retention rates are stable and we have seen no sudden outflow of personnel. There is real concern, however, that in some important areas exit rates are too high. These areas are continuously reviewed and the Department has put in place a wide range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the armed forces including: career management, improvement to conditions of service and work/life balance, extensions to normal engagement lengths, commitment bonuses and targeted Financial Retention Initiatives. Examples of schemes and incentives in place are: Golden Hellos, Commitment Bonuses, Recruit Bounty Schemes and targeted Recruitment and Retention Incentives. Each incentive is tailored to meet specific Service requirements.</p>

 The Army Rejoin Bounty was introduced in November 2002 to offer a partial solution to critical manning shortfalls in certain Career Employment Groups.

It has been agreed to further expand the scheme under the Exceptional Action Measures to increase the amounts payable and widen the eligibility of those who qualify.</p>

 It is not possible to answer the question as asked without incurring disproportionate cost.

<i> [holding answer 7 May 2009]:</i> The MOD follows Health Protection Agency (HPA) guidance in planning for an outbreak of pandemic influenza. In 2007, defence medical centres assessed their emergency requirements for infection control consumables, and around 275,000 masks and 150,000 pairs of gloves were distributed to centres in the UK and overseas bases. An additional three months&#146; stock, calculated at three months&#146; regular usage and amounting to around 8,000 masks and 48,000 pairs of gloves, is held by the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA), to provide stock for operations overseas and ships afloat.

 The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which took over from the Healthcare Commission (HCC) on 1 April 2009, has informed us that the reasons for the 85 alerts were because data received by HCC suggested that the rates of mortality in relation to a number of specific clinical areas were statistically higher than otherwise would have been expected. Statistical alerts relating to mortality rates do not necessarily equate to problems with clinical care. The alerts could be caused as a result of poor data quality, chance events, differences in the complexity of conditions treated or there could be evidence of poor quality care.</p>

 Lorenzo release 1.0 provides functionality for clinical documentation, and requests and results. Of the three Lorenzo release 1.0 early adopter sites, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust is currently using the radiology requests and results functionality in its general surgery and urology wards, and has begun making plans for its use for inpatient, outpatient, and accident and emergency discharge summaries. South Birmingham Primary Care Trust (PCT) has a number of podiatrists using the system, working in eight different physical locations in the PCT. Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust went live for radiology results and requests in a nurse-led orthopaedic clinic at the end of March 2009.</p>

In June 2008 the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust went live with the next phase Cerner Millennium which features a link to the NHS spine. The trust uses the system to manage patient admission, transfer and discharge details and is linked to accident and emergency, theatre scheduling, maternity, therapies, as well as electronic radiology and pathology test ordering and reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="90511w0031.htm_para6"><a name="0905124001975">In October 2008, following a review of the progress of the deployment of the Cerner Millennium system, an improvement programme was set up to concentrate on resolving the issues that were being experienced by the live trusts. At the Barts and The London NHS Trust some unresolved issues are being tackled as part of a wider comprehensive improvement programme that is addressing identified weaknesses in the trust&#146;s information management and administration systems. At the other three trusts improvement programmes have been substantially delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90511w0031.htm_para7"><a name="0905124001976">Due to the good progress made with the improvement programmes and greater confidence in the functionality and stability of the system, the London Acute Programme Board recommended in January 2009 that the implementation of Cerner Millennium should continue in London.</p>

Under these arrangements, the eight live sites in the south will first be transferred to a BT data centre and then upgraded to the post- improvement programme configuration of the electronic patient record software that has been developed for London Cerner trusts. The transfer to the BT data centres and the subsequent upgrade of software are expected to be completed for the live sites by the end of 2010.</p>
