 Five key targets have been set for the Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency for the financial year 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="10426w01.html_para0">The first key targets apply to projects covered by the Major Projects Report which have passed their main gate approval. Key targets 2 and 3 are consistent with targets set in the Department's 1999-2002 Public Service Agreement (PSA), adapted to cover cumulative performance. The fourth key target relates to improvement in DPA customer satisfaction and the fifth to a reduction in the cost of running the agency. Key target 5 exceeds the target featured in the PSA. They key targets are:

<a name="10426w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the quinquennial review of the Ministry of Defence Police Agency will take place; and what <i>(a)</i> the aim of, and <i>(b)</i> the arrangements for, the review will be.  [159534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The quinquennial review (QQR) of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) will begin in April 2001. The review will examine the role, operations and organisation of the MDP with a view to establishing the requirement for its services in the future, and how these can best be delivered.




<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2001 : Column: 308W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10426w01.html_para1">Work to prepare for the QQR has already begun. This has principally involved canvassing the views of the MDP's customers about its effectiveness, and gathering other information with which to assess the MDP's performance since it became an agency in April 1996. Stage one of the QQR will address three fundamental questions: to what extent is there a continuing requirement for the services currently provided by the MDP; how far could organisations other than the MDP contribute to meeting those future requirements; and, if a continuing requirement for MDP services is confirmed, what organisational configuration should it have. If continued agency status is confirmed, the second stage of the QQR will develop more detailed proposals for continuing improvements in performance and quality of service delivery.
<P>

<a name="10426w01.html_para2">The MDP is by no means the only organisation involved in providing policing and security services to the MOD. The review will therefore examine its interface with other practitioners (including Service police forces) to ensure that the MDP operates in a 'joined up' way with them, focusing in particular on the scope for partnership- working and the spread of best practice. It will also examine the way the relationship between the MDP and other UK police forces is evolving.
<P>

<a name="10426w01.html_para3">I expect to see advice arising from stage one of the review in the summer, and from stage two, if pursued, in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="10426w01.html_para4">The review team will consult widely with all stakeholders, including customer organisations, the MDP management team, Agency staff, the Defence Police Federation, Civil Service trades unions, other police forces, and the relevant policy staffs in MOD, the Home Office, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. The MOD is also keen to hear the views of other organisations or individuals with an interest. These can be sent to the MDP QQR Team, Room 4113, MOD Main Building, London, SW1A 2HB.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of road accidents during each of the last five years in which driver tiredness was <i>(a)</i> the cause and <i>(b)</i> a contributing factor.  [158740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Statistics on the main contributory factors in road accidents are not available. Research on behalf of the Department indicates that for car drivers in particular, driver fatigue may have been a principal factor in around 10 per cent. of accidents across the road network in Great Britain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Department began its research programme on fatigue in December 1992 and research work continues. Data from the programme have greatly improved our understanding of the effects of fatigue on driving. The results have been developed into recommendations to drivers that have been incorporated into the Highway Code. In addition, the Department launched last August a long-term programme of publicity and advice on measures to counter driver fatigue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made since May 1997 on introducing minimum fuel efficiency standards for all vehicles.  [158660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The UK played a leading role in the development of the voluntary agreement between the European Commission and European car manufacturers, secured in 1998. This commits manufacturers to improve the sales-weighted average fuel efficiency of new passenger cars by 25 per cent. on 1995 levels by 2008. Similar agreements have been reached between the European Commission and the Japanese and Korean car manufacturers' associations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Key fares are already capped at 1 per cent. below the rate of inflation and this will continue for replacement franchises. Train operators are free to price other fares according to market demand and competition from other forms of transport. But we expect train operators to bear in mind the need to increase passenger numbers when considering whether to increase unregulated fares.

<a name="10426w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of the change in the level of public subsidy on rail fares.  [158418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No explicit assessment has been made. Subsidy levels were agreed at the time of franchising after a competitive bidding process. Franchising agreements protect key rail fares so that their prices are restricted by a cap that rises by PRI-1 per cent. annually. The key fares include all Saver tickets, or unrestricted standard returns where no Saver exists, and all standard weekly season tickets. Further regulation applies to London commuter fares, linking performance to the permitted increase.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) was established to provide independent advice to Government on the implementation of integrated transport policy and to review progress towards meeting the Government's objectives. Although the Government have not specifically asked CfIT to comment on the CPRE report, the commission has been asked to report on progress against the objectives and outcomes of the 10-year plan (including the target to reduce road congestion) and to advise on further policy measures. We are committed to periodic review of the 10-year plan and will pay close attention to CfIT's advice in doing so.

 The information requested is not available centrally, although the indications are that few injuries were caused by people drunk in charge of pleasure craft on British waterways. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a small and irresponsible minority of those in charge of such craft pose a risk to safety by choosing to navigate while under the influence of excessive amounts of alcohol.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to publish his response to the recommendations of the panel that conducted the public examination of draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-east; and if he will make a statement.  [159666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing for public consultation proposed changes to the draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-east (RPG1). They are largely based on the recommendations of the independent panel that held a public examination into the draft RPG1 last summer.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para3">Since then my right hon. Friend has published a number of new Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Notes, which have been taken into account in preparing the proposed 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2001 : Column: 314W</I><P>
changes. Important issues for the region to take forward are also contained in the Urban and Rural White Papers issued last November.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para4">Draft RPG was prepared by the Association of North East Councils (ANEC). Its overall strategy aims to create a more sustainable region and achieve urban and rural renaissance by focusing development in the region's main towns and cities making best use of previously developed land. We support this and, as recommended by the panel, we are proposing changes to ensure that the strategy is more clearly expressed and relates more clearly to the policy chapters. It is important that the implications for development plans and other strategies are clear in order to make a real difference on the ground.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para5">A key issue for the region is to stem population decline by encouraging economic growth and regeneration in a sustainable way. To achieve this we are proposing changes which identify four priorities for regeneration: to accelerate the renaissance of the Tyne, Wear and Tees conurbations; to provide job opportunities and support communities in the former coalfield areas; to adapt and revitalise the region's town and city centres; and secure rural regeneration to combat social exclusion, improve access to jobs and services, and sustain viable communities.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para6">We propose a review of the existing employment land allocated in development plans in the region to ensure that the north-east has a robust portfolio of sites in terms of size, quality and distribution in the most sustainable locations. In this context we would particularly welcome views during the consultation on the proposal to reduce the number of proposed new greenfield strategic employment sites from four to one. We propose to accept the panel's recommendation on this matter against the background of an over-provision of employment land in the region, and concern about the loss of greenfield sites. ANEC is committed to preparing an overall review of RPG1 in 2002-03, which will provide them with the opportunity to establish the need for additional strategic employment sites and set out their broad location or location criteria.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para7">We are proposing a modest reduction in the amount of additional housing in the region, as recommended by the panel. By reducing the need for additional greenfield housing allocations, it will help to concentrate house building more on areas where sites are already available particularly on previously-developed land. The new proposal is to provide 5,000 dwellings per year for the first half of the guidance period (1996-2006) and 6,000 per year for the period 2006-16. The distribution of housing is also proposed to change to reflect the strategy aim to locate the majority of new development in the region's conurbations to avoid unnecessary development in the countryside, and help to create a better balance between where people live and work. 4,000 of the proposed housing provision will be distributed as part of the early review of RPG1 in 2002-03 pending the completion of urban housing capacity studies by the constituent authorities in the region's conurbations.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para8">We also propose to set the region a challenging target of 65 per cent. of this additional housing to be provided on previously developed land and by reusing existing buildings.




<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2001 : Column: 315W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para9">It is proposed to significantly revise the transport element of RPG taking on board many of the panel's recommendations. The changes seek to provide a framework for the integration of land use planning and transport and to set the context for the development of the Regional Transport Strategy, which is currently on-going in the region.
<P>

<a name="10426w02.html_para10">There will now be a 12 week consultation period on the proposed changes which will end on Thursday 19 July 2001. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the House Library and provided to all of the region's MPs.

A key role of the RCU is to consider proposals for new or extended area based initiatives. Formal arrangements for assessing the impact of such policies on the regions came into force in November 2000. Since then the following initiatives have been subject to the 'double key' assessment involving both the RCU and the Government Offices: Children's Fund, Creative Partnerships, Neighbourhood Management, Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, Playing Fields and Community Green Spaces, Safer Communities Initiative and Sports Action Zones. The RCU has also considered a large number of other initiatives not subject to the full 'double key' procedures.

<a name="10426w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The Government are committed to cracking down on benefit fraud. In his report "The Informal Economy", Lord Grabiner recommended testing the use of advertising as a tool for changing public attitudes. The North West Pilot Campaign was developed during 2000 in line with this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para2">The overall objectives of the campaign, were to positively reinforce honest behaviour, to create a climate of intolerance to benefit fraud and to undermine the social acceptability of it. It was designed to work on two levels: Level 1, to make 'fiddling' harder to justify by showing that fraud is unfair; and Level 2, to create a climate of unease by using facts to build a fear of detection. Considerable development work was undertaken and the evaluation indicated that the campaign was effective in changing public attitudes towards benefit fraud. In taking the campaign to a national audience as part of a long-term public information programme, only minor refinements were considered necessary.
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para3">The national TV advertising did not include the hotline number because it was aimed at a wide audience and was designed to change public attitudes about the social acceptability of fraud (ie a Level 1 objective). Other material did include the hotline number because it was intended to create unease among fraudsters (ie a Level 2 objective).
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para4">The first phase of the national information campaign concluded on Saturday 31 March. The campaign will not run in the event of Parliament being dissolved under the normal rules relating to Her Majesty's Government advertising.
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para5">So far, the costs of the Targeting Fraud information programme have been &#163;2.2 million for the north-west pilot, including production, media buying, website development and research. The costs for the March phase of the national campaign are &#163;3.2 million for TV advertising, &#163;0.6 million for radio advertising, &#163;0.7 million for press advertising, and &#163;0.2 million for other costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Occupational schemes are not required to pay pension benefits before the normal pension age for the scheme. Some scheme rules do provide for pension benefits to be paid earlier for reasons such as ill-health. This is usually at the discretion of the scheme trustees and there is no legal requirement for them to provide reasons where they reject an ill-health pension application, although many schemes regard it as good administrative practice to do so.
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para7">Where an ill-health pension application has been rejected, the member can ask for the matter to be reconsidered under the scheme's internal dispute resolution procedure, and can seek assistance from the Office for Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS).

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w03.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Employers who provide occupational pension schemes do so voluntarily and, ultimately, they decide the nature of the scheme and its benefit structure. Trustees are required to provide extensive information to members about the scheme and their rights to pension benefits.
<P>

<a name="10426w03.html_para8">Generally, members must consent to a transfer of their accrued pension rights to another pension scheme. When employers are taken over, merge, or restructure their pension provision a consequent bulk transfer of members' accrued rights can be made without consent, provided that an actuary certifies that the rights to be acquired in the receiving scheme are broadly no less favourable than the rights to be transferred.

 The framework of legislation governing occupational pension schemes is intended to provide protection for members without imposing undue burdens on employers who provide those schemes.

<P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para2">We have always recognised that there will be some people who we will be unable to pay directly through bank or building society accounts, and some payments that cannot be made this way. This is reflected in our Public Service Agreement target of 85 per cent. of our customers having their benefits paid into bank or building society accounts by 2005. For those payments which we cannot make directly into bank or building society accounts, we are considering what alternative simple electronic money transmission system, which could also be accessed at post offices, will be commercially available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what progress he has made on reducing his Department's sickness absence rates; what baseline figure was used to assess his Department's compliance with its PSA target on reducing sickness rates; what the Department's actual figure for 2000 was; and if he will make a statement.  [159168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department's PSA targets are to achieve a reduction on sickness absence rates of 20 per cent. by the end of 2001 and 30 per cent. by the end of 2003. The targets are measured against the 1998 baseline figure of 12.1 average working days lost per person.
<P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para3">All appropriate recommendations of the Cabinet Office report "Working Well Together" have been introduced and action plans are in place across the Department to improve performance in managing attendance.
<P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para4">Performance for the year 2000 was 12.6 average working days lost. Performance was adversely affected at the start of the year by the influenza outbreak which was higher than normal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what sanction has been applied to his Department in cases where it has failed to meet its public service agreement targets.  [159167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The purpose of the Public Service Agreement is not to set sanctions. It is to set high level objectives and challenging targets which can be properly measured and monitored.
<P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para5">The Department's performance against its 1998 Public Service Agreement targets was set out in the Social Security Departmental Report (Cm 5115, March 2001). This shows that the majority of the targets have been met or are on course to be met. Only one target had not been met--that relating to payment for goods and services within 30 days of receipt.

<sup>(1)</sup> The costing assumes that pensioners would be assessed annually.<P>

<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> This cost covers the IT changes to DSS computer systems which would need to be made in order to give pensioners the option of how the payments were made to them. Several different computer systems would need to be partially recoded. The cost here relates mainly to man hours dedicated to recoding. We have assumed that 



these system changes would be made in such a way as to allow pensioners to subsequently change their payment option without further need for recoding.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> This covers the cost of mailing forms to 10.5 million pensioners every year asking them to choose how the payments are made to them.<P>

<P>

<sup>(4)</sup> This covers the costs of processing the responses to the annual mailshot and would be the largest single component of the extra cost. It is estimated that, to the extent that processing 10.5 million payment request options every year was possible at all, it would require the equivalent of an additional 3,000 full-time civil servants. <P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para8">The NHS Cancer Plan announced new investment of &#163;570 million, which will address inequalities in access to services for cancer, including the provision of diagnostic CT scanners.
<P>

<a name="10426w04.html_para9">For funding of CT scanners we have produced a database of the numbers of CT scanners per head of population and have calculated the number of additional machines required in order to bring up the numbers in those regions which currently have a short-fall compared to the mean number of CT scanners per head of population nationally.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many cases of epilepsy have been recorded between 1 November 1999 and 28 February 2001 related to yellow cards submitted in connection with meningitis C injections;  [157552]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) what research is being conducted into the incidence of cases of epilepsy which may be related to meningitis C injections.  [157549]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w05.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 On 1 November 1999, a national immunisation campaign commenced to vaccinate all children under 18 years with one of the new meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. The campaign finished at the end of January 2001. As of 16 February 2001, 18.5 million doses of meningitis C vaccine had been distributed.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_para0">The Medicines Control Agency and the Committee on Safety of Medicine (CSM) has received three Yellow Card reports of suspected epilepsy following vaccination with the meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. A total of 291 reports of suspected seizures have been reported in association with the meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. CSM has concluded that there have been very rare reports of seizures following meningitis C vaccination and individuals have usually rapidly recovered. A significant number of the reported seizures are thought to have been faints.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_para1">A report of a particular suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it has been caused by the drug. The Yellow Card data can not be used to calculate the incidence rate of a particular suspected adverse reaction, nor can it be used to measure changes in the rate against time.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_para2">The Medical Research Council has research programmes looking into epilepsy and meningitis, but no program that is examining the incidence of epilepsy after meningococcal C conjugate vaccination.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has estimated that approximately 1 per cent. of all school-aged children (about 69,000 six to 16-year-olds in England) met the diagnostic criteria for Hyperkinetic Disorder, the more severe type of ADHD. The prevalence of all types of ADHD is considerably higher, around 5 per cent. of school-aged children (345,000 six to 16-year-olds in England).

 We are committed to equality of opportunity and to increasing the diversity of those appointed to public bodies.

Currently the youngest board member is aged 26, and the oldest 86.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_para9">Appointments to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, the National Health Service Tribunal, the Protection of Children Act Tribunal and the Registered Homes Tribunal are subject normally to a lower age limit of 35 and an upper age limit of 62. The age limits are applied flexibly and are based on advice from the Lord Chancellor. They are made clear in any advertisements for such posts. The lower age limit is intended to give the public the confidence that those appointed have sufficient experience and maturity to fill the different roles involved appropriately.

 It is for the National Health Service locally to make arrangements for financial support for hospices, given the extent of local diversity both of the services provided and of alternative sources of local support. Accordingly, we have issued no guidance specifying a set percentage of hospice revenue costs that individual health authorities and primary care groups should meet.
<P>

<a name="10426w05.html_para10">We are, however, committed to increased investment in palliative care services overall. The NHS Cancer Plan set out one commitment to increase NHS investment in specialist palliative care by &#163;50 million by 2004, to end inequalities in access to care and enable the NHS to make a realistic contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. As a first step, the NHS Plan Implementation Programme for 2001-02 requires all cancer networks, in partnership with voluntary organisations, to develop and begin implementing costed strategic plans for palliative care. This is the context within which the NHS contribution to individual hospices such as the Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice will be considered.

<P>

<a name="10426w09.html_para3">The key requirement in the early stages of this important public awareness campaign was to ensure that the maximum number of potential visitors to the countryside had access to information on the foot and mouth situation as quickly as possible.

 I have received representations from the Rare Breeds Survival Trust and various individual breed societies and owners. The Ministry published proposals on measures to reduce the risks which make culling of rare breeds of sheep necessary on 19 April. Copies are on the Ministry's website. We have also supported the establishment of the Heritage Gene Bank, to preserve germ plasm from sheep breeds which are particularly threatened by foot and mouth disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w09.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 2001]:</i> The UK imports livestock under EU or national rules only from countries or areas officially recognised as being free from foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10426w09.html_para5">Community legislation recognises that disease is present in some countries, but has been contained in specific regions. The importation of meat is permitted from a limited number of countries where foot and mouth disease is present, but only where the disease is so contained. Imports of fresh meat are permitted only from those regions of the relevant countries that are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk may be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Columbia and Uruguay.
<P>

<a name="10426w09.html_para6">Community law allows member states to take action to prohibit imports from countries where a particular disease risk has been identified pending the amendment of Community laws to reflect the new disease situation. Because of their FMD situation prohibitions are currently in place on imports of meat of FMD susceptible species from South Africa, Swaziland and Argentina.
<P>

<a name="10426w09.html_para7">All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at Border Inspection Posts to ensure that proper import requirements are met.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will close the road past Wick Farm, Layer-de-la-Haye, near Colchester, to avoid further spread of foot and mouth disease.  [153945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w09.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B>

<P>
<a name="10426w09.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will grant discretionary powers to highway authorities to close roads past livestock holdings where stock may be at risk of infection by foot and mouth disease and where alternative routes may be available.  [153946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w09.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> The Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983 allows a Ministry or local authority inspector to prohibit the entry of any person onto any land or into any agricultural building that lies within an infected area.

<a name="10426w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Woodland makes an important contribution to the rural economy and is essential to the character of the English countryside. However, many of our woods are under-managed and are not delivering the potential range of benefits to their owners or to society as a whole. The Forestry Commission plays a key role in ensuring the sustainable management of our woodland.
<P>

<a name="10426w10.html_para0">I have therefore asked the Commission to review its support for the sustainable management of existing woodland in accordance with the priorities of the Government's Forestry Strategy for England and in the light of the UK Forestry Standard.
<P>

<a name="10426w10.html_para1">The review will help focus the Commission's work on finding ways to engage woodland owners effectively in implementing the England Forestry Strategy. This will help owners sustain their own plans while supporting the rural economy and improving the environment for the benefit of all. While the review will consider the effectiveness of existing Forestry Commission grant schemes, I am keen to see ideas emerging on the whole range of support measures through partnerships, advice, training and market development.
<P>

<a name="10426w10.html_para2">The review will be managed by a steering group including woodland owners and managers and representatives from appropriate Government Departments and agencies, as well as from Wildlife and Countryside Link.

 The pay gap between men and women's full-time hourly earnings has halved since the introduction of the Equal Pay Act. But women still earn only 82p for &#163;1 a man earns.

<a name="10426w11.html_para2">The teachers' pay arrangements for 2001-02, and the &#163;200 million teacher recruitment package announced by my right hon. Friend on 12 March will help build on this success. We are introducing a welcome back bonus for people returning to teaching; a teacher retention and recruitment fund to support schools in areas where there are difficulties; extension of &#163;4,000 golden hellos for newly-qualified teachers of shortage subjects to English; funding for 570 more places in a full year on the graduate teacher programme; and 500 more places on refresher courses for those returning to teaching, which include training grants of up to &#163;150 a week and help towards child care costs. My right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Women's Employment and Pay Review, led by Denise Kingsmill, Deputy Chair of the Competition Commission, will examine ways to increase diversity and flexibility of the labour market, for example through high value part-time and flexible working arrangements such as job shares, term-time contracts and contracts for 'job-pools'. It will look to produce a strategy for the promotion and implementation of voluntary pay reviews by all employers to ensure pay equality within their organisations. The review will advocate the benefits to business of voluntary pay audits and will work in collaboration with the EOC and employer and trade union representatives to help build support for a voluntary approach. It will identify further areas where understanding and awareness of existing equality law can be increased among employers and female employees. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2001 : Column: 356W</I><P>
The review will draw on experiences of good practice both in the UK and internationally. Ministers across Government will be available to assist the review, but the work will be autonomous.
<P>

<a name="10426w12.html_para0">We aim for the review to be completed by the end of October. The final report will include non-legislative and cost-effective proposals to improve women's employment prospects and participation in the labour market, taking account of the Government's Work-Life Balance Campaign. Denise Kingsmill will present her report to the conference on Women's Employment, Pay and Prospects in December.

 We are committed to raising standards of education and supporting teachers to do this by providing the training and development they need.

 Through our range of New Deal programmes which are operated through the Employment Service we are providing tailored help to meet the variety of needs of those without work. The personal adviser approach is at the heart of all these programmes providing support to some of the most vulnerable people in the labour market.
<P>

<a name="10426w12.html_para1">For some this will mean full-time work but for others, perhaps those with other responsibilities such as bringing up children, part-time work will be the better option. The advisers can offer advice and assistance, including help with calculating in-work benefits, child care arrangements and appropriate training to help them into work. And, from the end of this month, lone parents who take up part-time work of less than 16 hours will be able to get help with child care costs for their first year in work.

 On 19 March this year, we introduced joint claims for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Both members of young unemployed couples without children have to be available for work and to seek work actively, and each has to agree a Jobseeker's Agreement detailing what steps they will take in looking for work. Each member of the couple is required to attend the Jobcentre every fortnight to discuss their job search. Full payment of JSA is conditional on both carrying out their full responsibilities. Both will be helped by advisers to secure work and will be referred to programmes and New Deal assistance as appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what powers he has to overrule the policy of <i>(a)</i> a local authority and <i>(b)</i> a passenger transport executive relating to subsidy of public transport for students at independent schools of music on the basis of local education authority contribution to fees.  [158953]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w13.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 A local education authority must by law provide free school transport for a day pupil attending an independent school if it is the nearest suitable school to the pupil's home, and that home is beyond the statutory walking distance. Local education authorities have discretion to provide free or subsidised school transport for pupils who do not satisfy those criteria; but they are under no obligation to do so. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no powers to intervene in a local education authority's discretionary policy in such cases, except where he is satisfied that the authority is acting unreasonably in the exercise of statutory powers or duties. He has no relevant powers in relation to passenger transport executives. For pupils aided under my Department's Music and Ballet Scheme at four independent specialist music schools in England, means- tested help is available through that scheme towards transport costs.

Total local education authority expenditure in England on home to school transport, including discretionary free and subsidised fares, in the relevant financial years was as follows.

 In July 1999 we placed a responsibility on local education authorities to phase in full-time education for all permanently excluded pupils by September 2002, compared to the two to three hours all too typically offered in the past. Data from the 2000 Schools Census indicated that around a third of PRUs were providing full-time education and two thirds were offering 13 or more hours of education each week. All LEAs must offer full-time provision to all excluded pupils from September 2002. Since 1997 there has been an expansion of PRU provision with over 1,000 additional pupil places and nearly 600 more teaching and support staff.

<a name="10426w14.html_para2">A number of PRUs have amalgamated to rationalise and improve the quality of provision following Ofsted concerns about standards in PRUs in 1995. Ofsted now reports that pupils in most PRUs are making satisfactory or better progress and teaching in 90 per cent. of units is at least satisfactory. Almost all PRUs now improve pupils' behaviour and attitudes to learning.
<P>

<a name="10426w14.html_para3">A net total of 13 new PRUs have opened in the last year. Since 1997 the number of pupil places at PRUs has risen by over 1,000 and the number of teaching and support staff is up by nearly 600. The pupil:teacher ratio is 4.3 the same as in 1997. Local authorities were planning to spend 13 per cent. more on PRU provision in 2000-01 compared to the previous year. This reflects the tenfold increase in funding to tackle poor behaviour in schools

 Permanent exclusions must be reviewed by the governing body of a school through its discipline committee. Where a parent or pupil appeals against permanent exclusion, an independent appeal panel will consider the case.
<P>

<a name="10426w14.html_para4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's guidance to appeal panels is that they should decide whether the pupil did what they are accused of doing, and if so whether, considering all relevant factors, permanent exclusion is a reasonable response to that conduct. He has advised that reinstatement would not normally be appropriate where the circumstances involve:

 The Carrefour network provides information about the European Union to rural communities. In 1994 six Carrefours from five countries of the European Union, including the north-west England Carrefour, bid for and were successful in securing funding for a small project under the Youth Information Action Programme to research the provision of European Information in rural schools.
<P>

<a name="10426w15.html_para2">The six Carrefours reported to the European Commission on the project in April 1997. As the project was commissioned and funded directly by the Commission, this Department had no involvement in the project and therefore does not have access to: information on the schools that participated; the polling questions; nor the project report. The Commission document "At the Very Heart of Europe" which reports on the work of the Rural Information and Promotion Carrefours and which refers to the project described above, is available from the European Commission.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what was the average time taken from charge to the start of trials and what was the average number of hearings in an indictable-only case in <i>(a)</i> 2000 and <i>(b)</i> the first quarter of 2001.  [158927]<P>

<P>

 Information is not available in the exact form requested and is instead provided for defendants in indictable and triable either way cases that were committed for trial at the Crown court.
<P>

<a name="10426w15.html_para3">In 2000 the average time taken from charge or laying of information to committal for trial was 87 days for defendants in magistrates' courts. The average time taken from committal for trial to first main hearing in the Crown court was 100 days in 2000. There were on average three adjournments per defendant per case in the magistrates' courts. There is no information held centrally on the number of adjournments in the Crown court.
<P>

<a name="10426w15.html_para4">These figures provide only a broad indication of the total time taken from charge or laying of information to first main hearing for defendants who are tried in the Crown court, as the data from magistrates' courts and the Crown court will not relate to exactly the same defendants.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when she expects her Department to achieve its PSA target of reducing asylum appeal decision times to four months or less.  [159033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w15.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department does not have a PSA to reduce asylum appeals, but does have an asylum Service Delivery Agreement which makes up part of a wider PSA. The relevant target, which refers to the year 2002-03, is for 65 per cent. of all cases to be cleared through both tiers of the Immigration Appellate Authorities within four months.
<P>

<a name="10426w15.html_para6">To acknowledge the importance of this target, and the significant progress already made, the Court Service has agreed a key performance indicator, in the same terms, for the 2001-02 year. Therefore we expect that level of performance over the year to be achieved by 31 March 2002. Accordingly, we expect the SDA target to be achieved by 31 March 2003.

<a name="10426w17.html_para7">The Bristol Youth Offending Team (YOT) during 2000-01 has worked with 2,200 young offenders and supervised 330 young people on community-based orders. The YOT has prepared more than 450 court reports and its appropriate adult volunteers have attended 350 interviews with young people at police stations. The YOT has established offender-victim mediation services and is providing intervention programmes to confront young offenders with the views of their victims. The YOT is also working to deliver the Government's pledge to halve the average time taken from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders, from 142 to 71 days. The most recent figure for Bristol is 89 days.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para8">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is currently providing funding for one bail support and five intervention schemes through its development fund. The Prince's Trust operates an education project, FIVE, that is based in five cities in England and Wales working with young offenders and those at risk of offending, aged 14-17, through the provision of two Prince's Trust programmes. This has been awarded a YJB grant of &#163;340,000. Fairbridge West run an education, training and employment project, Constructive Alternatives Through Life Skills for Life that works with persistent young offenders and those on final warning in trying to build personal, social and independence skills. This is receiving YJB funding of approximately &#163;64,000. &#163;128,000 is provided towards a project run by Include. This is an education, training and employment project called Post 16 Bridge Course, that works with 16 and 17-year-old persistent offenders who have poor educational achievements and limited employment prospects. Bristol YOT runs a parenting scheme, Bristol Parenting Support Project, that supports parents of young people who are offending so that they may help their child reduce offending. This project receives &#163;60,000 of YJB funding. A grant of &#163;82,000 has been awarded to the Children's Society for a prevention programme it operates called Right Track, which provides support for black children and young people aged 10-17 who are involved in the criminal justice system.

<a name="10426w17.html_para24">The Metropolitan police in conjunction with the London borough of Southwark were awarded &#163;65,000 under round 1 of the RBI, for a scheme in the West Camberwell area. Interventions include: establishment of a lock-fitting service to target burglary victims and vulnerable properties and establishment of a detached youth project. The quality of service to victims has been improved and a problem solving approach to burglary and improvements in relevant monitoring and communication systems is being developed. &#163;65,000 was awarded to a scheme in the Parkside Plus area correcting physical vulnerability of vulnerable estates in the target area. It is also helping to develop new ways of working with offenders in the area.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para25">Under round 2 of the RBI, approximately &#163;30,000 was awarded for a scheme in the Herne Hill and Croxted Road, West Dulwich areas. This project aimed to tackle situational vulnerability and unmarked property by using electronic alarms and property marking as well as increasing neighbourhood watch activity. &#163;153,000 was awarded for a scheme in the North Southwark Corridor. The scheme aims to improve property marking and to work with offenders and work towards community building.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para26"><i>Youth Offending</i>
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para27">North Southwark and Bermondsey is covered by Southwark Youth Offending Team (YOT). The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is contributing funding for five intervention schemes and one bail supervision scheme. Approximately &#163;170,000 is being used to fund a Restorative Justice Conferencing Project. Southwark Mediation Centre works with the YOT to provide direct and indirect victim-offender mediation and family group conferencing services. Family Group Conferencing is offered to young people remanded into local authority accommodation, young people subject to throughcare and young people made the subject of Action Plan Orders.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para28">A Positive Parenting and Behavioural Change Programme includes the assessment of cognitive abilities. The YOT caseworkers provide consultation and life supervision via social skills training, anger management and cognitive behavioural interventions. The YJB are contributing &#163;119,000 to this project. The YJB are also providing approximately &#163;117,000 to an Appropriate Alternatives through Skills for Life (Cognitive Behaviour) programme. This project aims to provide integrated effective supervisory and mentoring support for 80 offenders.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para29">Approximately &#163;69,000 is being provided to fund a Development Officer scheme. The Development Officer facilitates cross-borough communication and ensures congruence in development of services. A Parent Support Group has been established with a YJB contribution of approximately &#163;43,000. This project offers support and information to parents and carers of young people who 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 2001 : Column: 378W</I><P>
are behaving in an anti-social or criminal manner. The YOT has supervised 26 Parenting Orders since April 2000 and has received positive feedback from parents attending these groups either voluntarily or as a condition of an order. The YJB are also providing approximately &#163;104,000 to a bail support scheme, being run in partnership with NACRO. This has reduced the rate of re-offending while on bail, while also reducing the numbers of young people remanded into local authority accommodation, or custody.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para30">A functional team within the YOT is dedicated to providing preventative and early intervention services. A multi-agency Risk Management Panel has been established, designed to manage the risks presented to the public by a small number of prolific offenders, through an intelligence led approach. This activity will be supported by the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Project to be launched in July 2001. The YOT has provided and/or co-ordinated a number of crime reduction initiatives including innovative work in schools, alongside police officers, in support of Operation Arrow; the Youth Inclusion Programme in the Elephant and Castle area and Midnight Basketball in partnership with the Youth Service and the National Playing Fields Association. The YOT provides groupwork programmes in schools for disaffected pupils at risk of exclusion and co-ordinates monthly truancy patrols, which have dealt successfully with over 200 truants in the past year.
<P>

<a name="10426w17.html_para31">Easter and Summer Splash Schemes have been run in the following estates: Aylesbury Estate, Rockingham; Astley Cooper estates; Heygate Estate and Peckham. These schemes were set up across England and Wales to address offending by young people (especially 13 to 17-year-olds). The five areas traditionally associated with youth crime--burglary, motor crime, criminal damage, street robbery and juvenile nuisance all showed significant reductions compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The combined drop for these crimes was 14 per cent.

The Yew Tree project aims to follow resource intensive police 'Crackdowns' with a structured multi-agency approach to target hardening and crime reduction methods ('Consolidation'). Crime prevention information packs will be given to every house on the target estate, together with Smartwater property coding for identified vulnerable premises. Persistent offenders will be evicted by the local authority from the estate and promotion of neighbourhood watch schemes will be encouraged and diversionary work with young people on the estate will be carried out. The Smethwick estate will undertake a crime reduction awareness programme encouraging households to receive property marking and a home security survey. An assessment of estate design and management will be carried out, leading to initiatives to design out crime and targeted police patrol strategy, concentrating on the most prolific offenders supported by strict pre-sentence bail enforcement. The probation service will work with ex-offenders to manufacture ornamental security grilles that can be used for target hardening as part of the community service order programme.
<P>

<a name="10426w18.html_para3">Under round 3 of the RBI, Sandwell Metropolitan borough council was awarded approximately &#163;371,000 in partnership with West Midland police and Sandwell local education authority for a project in North Sandwell. The proposed interventions include a programme for educating residents about preventing and tackling crime, a dedicated enforcement team to tackle the most prolific offenders, target hardening, neighbourhood wardens and designing out crime. West Midlands police in partnership with Sandwell Metropolitan borough council, Education and Life Long Learning and Sandwell Youth Offending Team have been awarded &#163;120,000 to tackle prolific young offenders through an approach successfully used by the Brandon Centre in Camden, London.

The YOT works in partnership with a local Nacro (National Association for the Care and Rehabilitation of Offenders) project in the delivery of some of the Final Warning programmes. Crime Concern is running the Youth Inclusion Programme for the Greets Green neighbourhood in Sandwell. Community service is provided by the Probation Service. All service users are assessed using the Youth Justice Board (YJB) Asset assessment tool. In addition if there are concerns regarding a young person's mental health of substance use further specialist assessments are undertaken by the YOT community psychiatric nurse (CPN) or drug worker. The YOT is a multi-agency team consisting of members from: Social Service; Probation; Police; Education officers; Bail Support workers; Youth Justice workers; drug worker and a CPN.
<P>

<a name="10426w18.html_para10">The YOT provides the following services: appropriate adults, bail support, court reports, programmes in support of final warnings, delivery of reparation orders, action plan orders, supervision orders, community rehabilitation orders, community punishment and rehabilitation orders and young offender through care. In support of final warnings the team have used offending behaviour group work in partnership with Nacro and are also using the "Prison No Way" and "Impact Roadshow" packages. Funding has been obtained to run a particular cognitive behavioural programme (the Brandon Centre Programme) for persistent young burglars. This programme has been rigorously evaluated and shown to reduce recidivism in the target group. The YJB are providing funding for one bail support scheme and two intervention schemes. The bail supervision and support scheme has been awarded a grant of approximately &#163;74,000 over three years making a total project investment of &#163;376,000. This project aims to ensure that young offenders will be assessed for and, if suitable, offered bail support as well as ensuring that those remanded to local authority care are appropriately placed and supported. It is attempting to reduce the number of young people in local authority and custodial remand placements by 50 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 23 April 2001, how he proposes to measure his performance against the first and fourth of his targets in his Tackling Drugs strategy; what figures he is currently using for the numbers of young people using illegal drugs and the amount of drugs available on the streets; and how he has arrived at these estimates.  [158935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The target covers young people aged under 25 years, and is based on measuring the proportion of people who report use of Class A drugs (heroin, crack cocaine, powder cocaine, ecstasy, magic mushrooms, methadone and LSD). This is measured principally by the British Crime Survey (BCS) which is a nationally representative victimisation survey of households in England and Wales. The survey is administered annually (from 2000) using computer- assisted interviewing to a random sample of households, with a sample of 40,000 (from 2001 onwards), aged 16 and upwards.
<P>

<a name="10426w19.html_para1">The results from the 1998 BCS form the baseline. The proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting use of Class A drugs in the last year was 8.3 per cent. and in the last month was 3.4 per cent. The report on the drugs component of the 1998 BCS published in 1999 as Home Office Research Study 197, and is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10426w19.html_para2">The baseline information from the BCS will also be supplemented by other available research, including the results of a school-based survey.
<P>

<a name="10426w19.html_para3">The baseline in terms of drug availability will be based on a range of current and planned research (including intelligence estimates). The 1999-2000 baseline that determines the availability of drugs in the United Kingdom will be measured in a forthcoming Home Office research study. This study will estimate the size and extent of the United Kingdom drugs market for selected drugs including heroin, crack and cocaine. The Home Office will publish the findings of this research in the summer of 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what has been the total cost to public funds of the Crime Reduction Directors in England and Wales, their offices and support staff.  [159037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The 10 Crime Reduction Directors took up post between June and October last year. The total cost of the directors, their support staff and associated running costs was &#163;2,043,000 in 2000-01. Crime reduction support staff were employed prior to the appointment of the directors, principally to manage the crime reduction programme funding, and their total cost in 1999-2000 was &#163;529,000.

<P>
<a name="10426w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The data are not available in the form requested. But as of 20 April 2001, there have been 3,026 arrests in connection with football-related offences at Premier League and Nationwide League grounds this season. This is comparable with last season's figure of 3,137. Football-related arrests continue to be a small proportion in relation to total attendances, which exceed 25 million per season.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Work is currently in progress to develop an accurate and reliable indicator of the level of disorder. It is expected that the indicator will be based on information gathered from the British Crime Survey. As the relevant questions have been included in the survey only since the start of this year, it is not possible at present to produce a baseline figure. We expect to be able to determine a baseline in the autumn.

<P>

<a name="10426w20.html_para4">Criminal Justice Units are a practical example of independent organisations working together to secure reductions in delay and duplication by sharing resources and developing a common administration. Separate targets or performance indicators have not been set for these jointly staffed units. Police and Crown Prosecution Service staff employed within these units will continue to work towards discrete departmental targets that have been set by their respective and independent organisations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10426w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office has a Public Service Agreement (PSA) target of reducing the rate of reconvictions of all young offenders by 5 per cent. by 2004 compared to the predicted rate.
<P>

<a name="10426w20.html_para5">The baseline is derived from Police National Computer data on offenders aged 10 to 17 cautioned or convicted in the first half of 1997. The one-year reconviction rate for this period is 33.7 per cent. The target requires that the number of reconvictions be reduced by 5 per cent. by 2004, compared to a predicted rate which incorporates the baseline data as well as other factors. If there were no other factors, the target would require a rate of 32 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10426w20.html_para6">The predicted rate will, however, make allowance for the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Any changes in the age, sex, offence and previous criminal history profile of sentenced or cautioned offenders. These factors are known to be associated with the risk of reoffending;</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> External factors associated with other PSA targets, which impact on reconviction, but not on the underlying rate of reoffending, where methodology allows.

 The Public Service Agreement for the whole criminal justice system, agreed in last year's Spending Review, included a target of increasing the number and proportion of recorded crimes for which an offender is brought to justice. ("Brought to justice" means that an offender has been cautioned, has an offence taken into consideration by the courts in passing sentence, or is convicted of an offence). In "Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead", we indicated that, specifically, there will be a criminal justice system-wide target to increase, by 2004, the number of recorded crimes ending in an offender being brought to justice by 100,000. In 1999-2000, 1,270,000 offences were brought to justice, which represented 24 per cent. of the 5,301,000 crimes recorded in that year.

 The Government's 1999 policy and awareness raising publication, "Living without Fear", set out information on domestic violence and other aspects of violence against women, with examples of the innovative interventions then under way to address them. It was designed as a basis for the future development of policy and described the measures the Government had themselves already undertaken, those they had in hand and those they were committed to taking. A number of these measures were to ensure that relevant issues were properly taken into account in general policy rather than being specifically and exclusively directed at violence against women. Current projects that are so directed are those within the Violence against Women Initiative of the Crime Reduction Programme, and information on them is given in a table which has been placed in the Library.

<a name="10426w21.html_para0">There are a wide range of economic and social costs associated with crime, not all of which are easy to measure, but the Criminal Justice Departments have jointly developed an indicator of the economic and social costs of crime as part of the PSA commitment. The methodology used to measure the economic and social cost of crime was published in a report in December 2000, "The economic and social costs of crime" (Home Office Research Study 217). This sets out clearly how the figures have been derived and estimates the total economic and social cost of crime to England and Wales in 1999-2000 to be &#163;60 billion.

<P>
<a name="10426w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Predicted two-year reconviction rates used in the measurement of Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets are not statistical forecasts, but are adjustments made once actual reconviction rates are known which make allowances for variations in the age, sex, offence and previous criminal history profile of persons commencing community sentences. These factors are known to be associated with the risk of reoffending. The purpose of the "predicted" rate is to ensure that comparisons between the reconviction rate when an improvement target was set and the reconviction rate when improvement is measured are meaningful.
<P>

<a name="10426w22.html_para0">The predicted rates will also take account of external factors associated with other PSA targets, which impact on reconviction, but not on the underlying rate of reoffending. The external factors include reduced delays in achieving a conviction (PSA target 8) and the increased proportion of recorded crimes where the offender is brought to justice (PSA target 6).
<P>

<a name="10426w22.html_para1">The predicted rate can be calculated only when the characteristics of offenders commencing community sentences in a given year are known.

 The definition of what amounts to a racially aggravated offence is contained in section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 in relation to the nine racially aggravated offences listed in sections 29 to 32 of that Act. Where race is concerned, the definition relating to the aggravating factor in sentencing, for all other offences, is contained in section 153 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. I believe these to be practical and enforceable definitions.

<P>
<a name="10426w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Recorded crime statistics include statistics on drugs offences, but do not record whether other offences are related to offenders' drug habits. The percentage of drugs offences in overall recorded crime in Lancashire in the last five financial years for which figures are available is given in the table. It should be noted that there was a change in counting rules on 1 April 1998 which increased the drugs offences counted. Before this date, only drugs trafficking was counted, whereas after this date possession and other offences were also counted. The change in counting rules also affected the general counting of offences, including other expansions of the offences counted, and so the percentages of drugs offences counted before and after 1 April 1998 will not be directly comparable.

<a name="10426w22.html_para18">Both the British Crime Survey and the new England and Wales Arrestees Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW- ADAM) programme of interviewing and drug testing arrestees shed some light on the links between drugs and crime, although these conclusions do not relate specifically to Lancashire.
<P>

<a name="10426w22.html_para19">For England and Wales as a whole, the British Crime Survey 2000 reported that 18 per cent. of victims of violent crime believed their attacker was under the influence of drugs.
<P>

<a name="10426w22.html_para20">The second report on the NEW-ADAM programme of interviewing and drug testing arrestees was published in August 2000 (Home Office Research Study 205, Drugs and Crime: The results of the second developmental stage of the NEW-ADAM programme). The research, undertaken by the University of Cambridge at four sites (London, Liverpool, Nottingham and Sunderland), found that 69 per cent. of arrestees tested positively for at least one drug, excluding alcohol.
<P>

<a name="10426w22.html_para21">It should be remembered that because an arrestee tested positive for drugs or a victim believed that a perpetrator was under the influence of drugs it does not necessarily mean that the consumption of drugs caused the crime to be committed. As a result, while the NEW-ADAM study and the British Crime Survey advance our knowledge of the links between drugs and crime, it will always be difficult to calculate a single percentage figure calculating precisely what proportion of crime is drug-related.

 As west Sussex is a part of the Sussex police force area, figures for west Sussex are not generally available. Recorded crime data for the Sussex police force area are given in the table. There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, and also an expansion of the offences recorded, which mean that figures before and after that date are not directly comparable. For example, from that date, figures for offences of violence against the person additionally include figures for common assault and assault on a constable, among other offences.
