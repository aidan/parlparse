<P>
<P>
<a name="80401w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 It is the Government's intention to ensure that the public has complete confidence in the operation and regulation of the National Lottery. To that end, the National Lottery Bill, which will shortly receive its Second Reading in the House, contains provisions to establish an advisory panel to help the Director General select the operator of the National Lottery.
<P>

<a name="80401w02.html_para4">While this panel would bring collective expertise to the selection of the operator, the final decision would remain in the hands of an individual--the Director General.
<P>

<a name="80401w02.html_para5">I have therefore been considering whether there is more we could do to broaden and strengthen the regulatory structure. I believe that there is a case for establishing a permanent collective body to bring a wider range of expertise and experience to the task of ongoing regulation as well as selection of the operator.
<P>

<a name="80401w02.html_para6">I therefore plan to introduce amendments to the Bill to replace the post of Director General, and the advisory panel, with a National Lottery Commission. The Commission, which will have the same statutory functions 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 1998 : Column: 525</I><P>
and duties as the Director General, will have five members and will be serviced by OFLOT. Its introduction will reduce the risk, actual or perceived, of conflicts of interest and regulatory capture, and remove the focus on an individual, while ensuring that a breadth of knowledge, experience and expertise is brought to bear on the regulation of the National Lottery. The necessary amendments will be introduced before the Bill is considered in Committee.

 As announced by my right hon.

The cash limit for 1997-98 has therefore been increased by &#163;11,000,000 from &#163;34,000,000 to &#163;45,000,000 reflecting partial take up of the announced EYF amount to finance additional payments to approved projects.
<P>

 The starting point for the sharing out with other European Union countries of the EU's legally binding 8 per cent.

We indicated before Kyoto that we were prepared to consider doing more than this as a legally binding target: but we would not do so simply to enable other EU countries to reduce their efforts.

As regards prosecutions for unlawful levels of emissions for heavy goods vehicles, it is not the Inspectorate's policy to prosecute in these cases as this provides no assurance that the fault has been rectified. Our usual practice is to issue the vehicle with a prohibition. This provides an effective sanction as in order to remove the prohibition the vehicle is required to be presented for a re-inspection once the fault has been rectified. Details of prohibitions issued to licensed operators are also passed to the Traffic Commissioners to consider whether action against an operator's licence is warranted.

There have been instances in which we have prosecuted serial offenders, single extreme cases or illegal unlicensed operators who are not answerable to the Traffic Commissioners. There were 2 successful prosecutions for unlawful levels of emissions in 1995/96 and seven in 1996/97.
<BR>
In cases where light goods vehicles, which fall outside of the operator licensing scheme, are prohibited (for any defect including exhaust emissions), a caution is issued and a new MOT certificate must be obtained for the vehicle before the prohibition can be lifted. This is required to be submitted to the Police for cross checking. Failure to repair (or scrap) the vehicle results in prosecution for the original offence. Almost all owners provide proof that their vehicles have been repaired following the issue of a prohibition and very few prosecutions are necessary. It is not possible to break down the figures for prosecutions to identify those relating to emissions.
<BR>
Details of prohibitions issued to heavy goods vehicles at emission only spot checks are shown in Table 2 below. Data is only available from 1992/93 as prohibitions issued prior to that date cannot be linked with sufficient accuracy to the defect identified.

 In response to a decline in certain bird populations, the South West Peak Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), part of the North Staffordshire Moor, was set up in 1993. This ESA included management guidelines specifically aimed at bird protection by minimising the risk of disturbance and nest damage. The 1997 Quinquennial Review of the ESA considered a further range of options for habitat management and creation. As a result, further measures have been taken to encourage the regeneration of extensive pasture land and recreation of traditional meadows, as well as supplementary payments designed to encourage farmers to follow a drainage management plan. This enables the creation of areas of wet land as suitable habitat for feeding and nesting birds.

<P>
<a name="80401w04.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The current UK and EU law dealing with the labelling of chemicals, including cleaning products, obliges suppliers to assess whether the chemical will cause sensitisation by inhalation or skin contact. If a product has this property it has to be labelled with a warning symbol and written advice including the chemical identity of the active chemical. I have no plans to introduce more specific legislation of the type described.

<a name="80401w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The statement "Planning for the Communities of the Future", Cmnd 3885, points out, in paragraph 33, the need for an orderly transition from the old to the new policy. The new approach will be introduced, as soon as possible, through reviews of Regional Planning Guidance. We will discuss with the Regional Planning Conferences how far it will be possible to introduce the new arrangements into existing review processes, some of which are likely to be completed next year. In the meantime, where development plans are being replaced or altered, they should continue to have regard, inter alia, to existing regional guidance. However, in considering whether to object to proposals put forward in development plans, the Secretary of State will treat each case on its merits, taking account of national policy, including that in the statement. A more detailed note on the transitional position has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<a name="80401w04.html_wqn5"><B> Helen Jackson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will publish the Government's consultation paper following the review of water charging in England and Wales.  [37660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80401w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I are publishing today our water charging proposals. The driving principles behind our policy on water charging are to have a system which provides for fair water charges and gives customers more choice in the way they pay for water. That system has to look after vulnerable customers. It also has to help ensure that water is used efficiently. We propose four key measures:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Those who currently pay on an unmeasured basis and use water only for essential domestic purposes should be able to continue to do so in their present home.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) We should remove the threat of disconnection from domestic customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) Domestic customers should have the choice of a meter, free of charge, if it suits their needs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) Targeted help should be available for consumers with special needs.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para3"><P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para4">For the foreseeable future, the majority of customers will pay their water charges on an unmeasured basis. We remain firmly of the view that customers should not, in future, be obliged to start paying for water in their present home on a measured basis, where they are not using significant amounts of water for non-domestic purposes like garden watering using a sprinkler. To allow this, we propose a change in the law to allow rateable value charging to continue beyond the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para5">We also propose to remove the powers of water companies to disconnect domestic water supplies in the event of non-payment. This will be particularly reassuring to those who are most vulnerable. Access to water is essential to the maintenance of general good health and well being, and the water charging arrangements need to reflect that. Of course, water companies are entitled to be paid for the services they provide, but other debt recovery procedures are available to them. Our concern about public health demands that we maintain the flow of water supplies to households in all circumstances.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 1998 : Column: 532</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para6">Measured charges may, in the right circumstances, encourage individual customers to use water efficiently. Some consumers, such as single people or pensioners in larger properties, will see an advantage in moving to a measured charging basis for their bills. We propose that in future customers should have the choice to have a meter fitted, free of charge. But those who choose a meter should also have the opportunity to revert to an unmeasured charging basis within a year if metering does not suit their needs.
<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para7">Companies should draw up imaginative new tariffs which increase customer choice. Those should bring benefits to customers who have not previously seen any point in being metered. And tariffs can also be designed to give customers strong incentives to economise on water for discretionary purposes without discouraging essential use. It must be for the companies to take the lead in developing such tariffs, but I look to the regulator to see that they do so. In particular, we see a strong case for ending standing charges for metered customers, which can be a particular problem for people on low incomes with low water use.
<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para8">For new homes, and those substantially altered since 1990, there are no rateable values. We do not believe that any of the unmeasured charging options for these homes are attractive. We therefore propose that metering should continue to be the normal charging method. But we will consider constructive proposals for alternative charging options which consultees wish to put forward, including possible unmeasured options for new houses.
<P>

<a name="80401w04.html_para9">A particular concern of this Government is the position of vulnerable customers. So we propose that households on low incomes, particularly large families, and those with special medical needs who live in houses with a metered supply should have the right to opt for a charge based on average use rather than their actual meter reading. This should provide targeted and effective assistance to the groups who could be most disadvantaged as a result of metering.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about the problems associated with the thaumasite form of sulphate attack on concrete.  [37704]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80401w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 During recent strengthening operations on two of the older overbridges on the M5 in Gloucestershire, an unexpected deterioration was noted in some of the concrete columns below ground level. Consultations with BRE identified this as the thaumasite form of sulphate attack. Foundations on a further three bridges were examined and were found to be exhibiting similar deterioration.
<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para0">The Highways Agency's view is that this does not pose a threat to the structural stability of the bridges, nor is there any risk to the safety of road users. The Agency are drawing up a programme to identify which bridges might be subject to this form of problem and to investigate those bridges.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 1998 : Column: 533</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para1">BRE has been conducting research into this form of sulphate reaction since 1990 for my Department. But until the cases on the M5 were discovered last week, only three such incidents of damage to concrete foundations had previously been identified in the UK. It appears that compliance with standard design guidance on protection against sulphate attack does not guarantee protection of concrete against the thaumasite form of reaction. At present, BRE are undertaking both laboratory and long-term field studies into this phenomenon. These studies have led them to the conclusion that this form of sulphate reaction can only occur when there is a combination of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) A source of sulphates, a commonly found in clay soils;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) Very wet, cold conditions; and</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para2"><P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para3">The expert independent advice received from the BRE is that, while they believe that their initial findings indicate the need for wider study, they are strongly of the view that any damage to buildings would be gradual and there is no danger to people in buildings.
<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para4">In the light of the problems discovered on the M5, I have today appointed Professor Leslie Clark to chair an expert group to study the phenomenon further and to report to me as soon as possible. The Group will develop guidance and advice on any implications for existing buildings and structures and on the design and specification of new construction.

<P>
<a name="80401w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to lay the regulations under section 58 of the Environment Act 1995 for mine operators to notify the Environment Agency before abandoning a mine or part of a mine.  [37705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80401w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am today laying before the House, together with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), The Mines (Notice of Abandonment) Regulations 1998. The Regulations will come into force on 1 July 1998. On 4 March, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) made the necessary Commencement Order to bring the remainder of section 58 and 60 of the Environment Act 1995 into force on 1 July. This period of notice will allow mine operators time to put in place the necessary steps to avoid a criminal liability for failing to notify the Agency of proposed abandonment.
<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para5">These Regulations are being introduced following extensive consultation with interested parties. Copies of the responses received are available from the Departments' libraries. The Regulations will help the Environment Agency ("the Agency") avoid an unexpected minewater breakout resulting in serious contamination of controlled waters by enabling the Agency to identify appropriate action to prevent pollution or treat minewaters when a mine or part of a mine is abandoned.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 1998 : Column: 534</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para6">The Regulations require mine operators to notify the Agency at least six months before abandoning a mine or part of a mine and to publish a notice in at least one local newspaper where the mine is situated. They set out the precise contents of both the notice to be given to the Agency and the public notice in a local newspaper. The notice for the Agency requires the operator to give an opinion as to the consequences of the proposed abandonment with relevant supporting information. Variations to the timing of the notice will apply where abandonment follows an emergency, and in some cases of insolvency. Where a phased programme of abandonment is planned, this could be notified to the Agency and published in local newspaper at one time, so as to reduce the burdens on the operator.
<P>

<a name="80401w05.html_para7">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has also brought into effect the remainder of section 60 of the Environment Act 1995. This removes the statutory defence against prosecution from the owners and former operators of mines abandoned after 31 December 1999, where a polluting discharge is "permitted" to flow from an abandoned mine or part of a mine.

&#163;15 million (1997/98 financial year) for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). We support and work closely with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), whose mandate is the protection of children's rights: in 1996/97 DFID provided a core contribution of &#163;8.5 million. We have also contributed a sum of &#163;200,000 in support of the work of the United Nations Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to ensure protection, healing and rehabilitation of war affected children.

 In 1996, there were 101 animal tests for cosmetics involving a total of 2,803 individual procedures on 2,791 animals. Of these, one test (1 per cent.) was for non-legislative purposes. It involved 45 rats (1.6 per cent. of the total number of animals). The test was carried out because of doubts about the safety of an ingredient which was to be used in trials involving human volunteers.

 It is our policy not to detain persons under the age of 18 save only in exceptional circumstances, such as when an unaccompanied minor arrives at a port of entry late at night and the Immigration Service is unable to make immediate contact with the local social services, or when the child's parent is detained, usually immediately prior to removal. The normal procedure is to grant temporary admission/release wherever possible, either into the care of a close relative or friend, or into the care of social services.

In addition, one unaccompanied minor asylum seeker, whose age was in dispute on 28 February 1998 but who was later found to have been 17 years of age, was held in detention on that date. The nationalities of the persons involved were Kenyan and Syrian; they were held at Tinsley House and Harmondsworth detention centres; and none had been in continuous detention for more than two months.

 Colchester Young Offender Institution has been closely monitored by all those involved in the project, either directly or indirectly. Ministers have been regularly updated on progress, and I have had the opportunity to visit both Colchester and Thorn Cross to see their operation at first hand.

The outcome of the review will be disseminated to all establishments.

 Juveniles held in custody on remand or sentenced can be placed in secure accommodation provided by the local authority, within its secure estate, or by central Government in Prison Service facilities, Secure Training Centres or in the Youth Treatment Centre.
<P>

<a name="80401w07.html_para8">At present, when juveniles--that is those between the ages of 10 and 16--are charged and not released on bail they have to be remanded to local authority accommodation under section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. The local authority may, if it can satisfy certain strict conditions, return to court and seek a secure accommodation order under section 25 of the Children Act 1989 to place the juvenile in local authority secure accommodation. The cost of such remands in these circumstances is met by the local authority and there are no proposals to change these payment arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80401w07.html_para9">Currently there are also special arrangements for 15 and 16-year-old boys who may be remanded to prison if the strict conditions set out in section 23 of the 1969 Act are met. The costs for these prison remands are met centrally and there are no proposals to change these payment arrangements.
<P>

Powers are contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill which will allow for the process of implementing the Government's commitment in this area to begin. This process will be implemented in stages with priority concentrated on the youngest and most vulnerable juveniles, because there is a limited number of available local authority secure places. The powers will apply, in the first instance to 12 to 14-year-olds, 15 to 16-year-old girls and some 15 and 16-year-old boys who are adjudged by the court to be vulnerable and where a local authority secure place has been identified.

For 1998-99, West Mercia Constabulary will be able to increase its spending by &#163;4.1 million, or 3.8 per cent. giving it a total spending power of &#163;112.2 million.

 <i>[holding answer 27 March 1998]:</i> The Government welcome the European Commission's draft Regulations and the objectives to contain the costs of the Funds and improve their administration and effectiveness. But the Government do not believe the proposals as they stand represent a fair basis for reform. We will work hard with the Commission and other Member States to ensure a fair deal for the UK and Scotland. The draft regulations published on 18 March propose that Objective 1 regions shall continue to be determined at NUTS level II on the basis of per capita GDP of less than 75 per cent. of the Community average. The Highlands and Islands are unlikely to qualify on that basis. However, the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 1998 : Column: 560</I><P>
Government have and will continue to press for the region to be treated in the same way as other areas of sparse population within the EU. It is important to note that the Commission proposals will now be subject to detailed scrutiny and negotiation by the Member States. What is finally agreed may vary somewhat from the draft Regulations.
<P>

<a name="80401w12.html_para0">The Prime Minister and Cabinet colleagues have supported the case for Objective I status for the Highlands and Islands at meetings and in correspondence with President Santer and European Commissioners. I myself met with President Santer on 18 September 1997, with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on 8 January 1998 and 8 October 1997, and with Commissioner Flynn on 1 December. Discussion of European Structural funds formed part of the agenda on each occasion. The subject also formed part of the agenda at the Luxembourg European council in December 1997 and is likely to be discussed at the Cardiff Summit in June. Reform of the Structural Funds will be the subject of the second day of the Informal meeting of Ministers to be held in Glasgow on 9 June 1998 at which I will be present. There have been no other European Council of Ministers meetings at which the future of the Structural Funds has been discussed.

<a name="80401w13.html_para1">In addition to the oil and gas fields currently in production in Liverpool Bay, exploration programmes are continuing in areas off the north and west coasts of Wales, both of which have proven hydrocarborn potential.
<P>

<a name="80401w13.html_para2">New licences will be offered to the north of Wales in the 18th Seaward Licensing Round, which I hope to announce very shortly, and to the west of Wales in the following round. In both cases, the advice of interested departments and environmental authorities has been or will be taken as to the suitability of areas for licensing and unsuitable blocks will be excluded from offer. Further safeguards for the environment will be offered by the forthcoming introduction of regulations that will require appropriate assessments to be carried out on offshore petroleum projects that are likely to have a significant effect on the environment.
<P>

<a name="80401w13.html_para3">Exploration does not always lead to discovery, nor discovery to development, but there are proven hydrocarbons off the Welsh coast and continuing work and new licensing opportunities will help to ensure that their economic potential is properly assessed and, where possible, exploited.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the proportion of the total health budget allocated to health promotion.  [34014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80401w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Health promotion is an integral part of the National Health Service and features in one form or another in nearly all contacts between patients and health care professionals. Much of this activity is not, however, separately or comprehensively identified in NHS accounts, nor separately allocated at the beginning of the year.
<P>

<a name="80401w15.html_para3">Advice on healthy living and disease prevention is intrinsic to the activity of general medical and primary health care teams. Most consultations in primary care will include an element of opportunistic health promotion. The cash-limited and non-cash-limited total general medical services allocation for 1997/98 is &#163;3,055 million.
<P>

<a name="80401w15.html_para4">There is a centrally held budget for health education and promotion campaigns which is separately allocated. In 1997/98, the Department allocated &#163;43.6 million to health promotion nationally, of which the Health Education Authority received &#163;39.1 million.
<P>

<a name="80401w15.html_para5">Health authorities and trusts do not receive a specific allocation for health promotion. Provisional figures for 1996/97, the most recent year available, show that expenditure by NHS trusts and health authorities on health education and promotion was &#163;79.6 million, but this figure excludes those functions of health authorities and trusts which indirectly support health promotion.

<a name="80401w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Portman Group's sensible drinking campaign is their own initiative. It is intended to reflect the Government's sensible drinking message and to complement the alcohol health education campaign run on the Department's behalf by the Health Education Authority. The Portman Group consulted the Department to ensure that their campaign messages reflected accurately the Government's advice on sensible drinking.

 Since 1 April 1994, the Department and the Public Health Laboratory Service have commissioned the Microbiological Research Authority to provide reference services to the National Health Service for the diagnosis of anthrax, and of infections caused by other exotic biological agents such as arbovirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, and rickettsia.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State invited the chairmen and chief executives of health authorities and trusts in England to meet Ministers to discuss the use of the additional resources obtained for the National Health Service in 1998-99 to reduce waiting lists. These meetings are being held on a region by region basis on 26, 30 and 31 March and on 7 April. The meetings are all being held in one of the buildings occupied by the Department and consequently the major costs are those of travel and subsistence for those attending the meetings. These are being met from the administration budgets of the individual health authorities and trusts. Information is therefore not available centrally on the total cost.

 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> I undertook a number of official engagements in the United Kingdom during January, most of them in London. All involved use of a car at some stage. With the exception of my attendance at the Oxford Farming Conference, where the train timetabling was inconvenient, none was sufficiently far away to merit travel by rail, or to require me to take a plane. I did, however, take the train from Gatwick to Victoria on my return from visiting the Windward Islands.

The following estimates are for the CTS as a whole. In September 1997, the decision was taken to move the issue of cattle passports from Agriculture Department regional offices to the British Cattle Movement Service. This significantly increased the scope and set up costs of the CTS project, and means that the estimates are not strictly comparable.

(27) The Department's Chief Scientist's Group (CSG) will stay in the decant building, St. Christopher House for a further year until MAFF's new Westminster building is ready in the summer of 1999. An earlier return to Whitehall Place early in 1998 would have meant a double move. The vacated space in Whitehall Place is being utilised by units servicing the Phillips Inquiry into BSE and other policy initiatives.<P>

<P>

Much of the charge for the decant building is an "opportunity cost rent". Whilst it is an additional cost to the Department, it largely substitutes for other costs previously borne elsewhere by the Exchequer. The only additional costs to the Exchequer from MAFF's occupancy are those for utilities and other office services.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 31 March 1998]:</i> We have fulfilled all of the pre-conditions for the resumption of beef exports laid down in the Florence Agreement.

All cases were considered on their individual merits.

<a name="80401w19.html_para3">Normal policy was to exercise the discretion to backdate a war pension in a number of different circumstances.

 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed over the next two years (1997-98 and 1998-99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of winter fuel payments to almost ten million eligible pensioners, in over seven million households, before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency. This will have been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment of &#163;50 during January. A further 8.3 million eligible pensioners received a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10 during March. Where they live alone, are the only eligible pensioner in a household, or are of no fixed abode, they are entitled to &#163;20; otherwise, they are entitled to &#163;10.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Three different methods of payment have been used to make the payments to all eligible pensioners. A number of factors were taken into account in determining the appropriate method. The factors included: the normal method of payment used by the customer to receive their benefit; the ability of the relevant benefit system to make one-off payments by a number of different methods; the speed in which payments could be made; and, the cost and timescales required to introduce new methods of payment to individual computer systems. Payments have been made by the three routes as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>--Automated Credit Transfer (ACT) direct to the pensioner's bank or building society account where the qualifying benefit is paid in this way (except where the qualifying benefit was Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Invalid Care Allowance, an industrial injury benefit, or one administered by the War Pensions Agency);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>--Payable order sent to the pensioner's home address, where the qualifying benefit is Invalid Care Allowance, an industrial injury benefit, or one administered by the War Pensions Agency; otherwise,</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>--Girocheque sent to the pensioner's home address or the Post Office where the pensioner collects their qualifying benefit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The decision to send girocheques to the pensioner's Post Office was based on the fact that these customers represented by far the largest qualifying group and this was considered the most secure method of payment for them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thank you for the opportunity to explain the position.</FONT></UL>

 The Child Support Act 1995 applies only where both parents and the child are habitually resident in the UK. Where both parents and the child have addresses in the UK they are normally assumed to be habitually resident unless there is evidence to the contrary. In such a case, the child support officer would decide on the evidence available whether that person should be treated as habitually resident for child support purposes. An individual's immigrant status is decided by the Home Office. The Home Office decision on whether an individual can stay in the country will be key for the

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1998]:</i> An environmental statement was submitted to the London Borough of Greenwich as part of the Millennium Experience planning application in October 1996. The subsequent approval of the application was conditional upon the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) establishing procedures to ensure that environmental issues properly inform the decision making process both for construction and operation. A draft environmental plan to meet this condition has been submitted to the London Borough of Greenwich and consultations on it are underway. The NMEC has also commissioned assessments which address a wide range of environmental matters including the health and safety of employees and visitors. Together with English Partnerships, the NMEC is undertaking an audit of the remediation work that has been done to prepare the site for the Millennium Experience.

<a name="80401w20.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 I am delighted to say that the consultation exercise on the Government's Freedom of Information White Paper, <i>Your Right to Know,</i> received a very good response with some 557 replies received from a wide variety of individuals and organisations, as shown in the breakdown in the table. The great majority of the comments we received, even where they suggested changes or expressed disagreement with some aspects, were in favour of the fundamental content and broad direction of our proposals. This shows the wide support that exists for legislation of the sort proposed in our Manifesto, and set out in detail in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="80401w20.html_para2">Although the consultation period formally ended on 28 February, many responses were still coming at the stage and, in the interests of full inclusiveness and fairness, we have included in our analysis as many replies as possible which were received after the end of February.
<P>

<a name="80401w20.html_para3">I am pleased to report that 172 (or 31 per cent.) of the replies were made by e-mail and 48 of these replies came via the Internet site set up for an open discussion of the proposals by UK Citizens' Online Democracy (UKCOD) with the support of the Cabinet Office. This shows the important role information technology can play in consultation exercises of this type.

<a name="80401w20.html_para4">I am today placing in the libraries of the House a list of those who responded (except where they requested anonymity) and copies of the responses received (except for those respondents who wished their comments to remain confidential). The apparently substantial number of replies requesting anonymity or confidentiality very largely consists of responses concerning the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 made by licence holders under the Act. Replies of this sort made up 100 of the 117 responses in these categories.

 Using plain language is important if the European Commission is going to communicate effectively with the citizens of Europe. British linguists in the Commission's translation service are holding a 'Fight the Fog' campaign to encourage the use of plain language by the Commission's authors and translators. The UK Government are fully supporting this work. Plain language is also vital in legislation so that citizens and business can know what is required of them. As Presidency, the UK is working with the Commission, European Parliament and other Member States on an initiative to improve the quality of drafting of EU rules.

 When I took the UK seat at the Cambridge informal meeting of Internal Market Ministers on 13 February, many EU Ministers present spoke enthusiastically in favour of regulatory reform at European level. As a result of this support, I hope to see the launch under the UK Presidency of a pilot European Business Test Panel. The purpose of the panel will be to help regulators understand better the impact of new rules on business by consulting firms of all sizes on legislative proposals in advance of their becoming law. The UK will be a leading player in this pilot.
