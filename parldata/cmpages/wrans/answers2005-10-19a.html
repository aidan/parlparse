 Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous system of many species of birds. The general symptoms may include loss of appetite, diarrhoea, generalised weakness, swelling of the face and legs, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, blue discolouration of the skin or membranes, a drop in egg production, sneezing, coughing and laboured respiration. In disease caused by highly virulent types of virus, there may be no warning signs, with birds either being found dead or dying suddenly. The presenting clinical signs in different domestic species are influenced by husbandry conditions (e.g. whether birds are housed or not) and by the presence of intercurrent bacterial or other viral diseases.

 The Government encourage all local authorities to have in place a strategy for managing their municipal waste. However, it is for individual local authorities and not DEFRA to decide on the strategy that best suits their needs relating to waste and the particular waste management options (which may include generating energy from waste) employed within that strategy.

 The outbreak of Newcastle Disease in pheasants in Surrey in July 2005 was dealt with according to the published Defra Contingency Plan. A national disease control centre was established in London and a local disease control centre was set up in Reigate to manage the local response. The control policy was implemented quickly, the birds on the infected premises were culled, movement restrictions were imposed to limit the risk of disease spread and surveillance was carried out in the local area to detect any signs of disease. The outbreak was limited to one premises.

<a name="stpa_34">Rapid exchanges of information with the French authorities identified the farms in France that had supplied birds to the infected premises. Newcastle Disease was subsequently confirmed on one premises in France and the authorities took appropriate action.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has asked chief officers and police authorities to submit proposals for restructuring by the end of the year.

He has also emphasised that he fully endorses HM inspectorate of constabulary&#039;s conclusion that the creation of strategic forces offers the best business solution.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many air miles were accrued through departmental ministerial travel in his Department in 2004&#150;05, broken down by Minister; how many were <i>(a)</i> foregone and <i>(b)</i> donated to charity, broken down by charity; and whether air miles accrued by officials were required to be (i) foregone and (ii) given to charity.  [17328]</p>




<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51019w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Ministerial travel is conducted in accordance with the &quot;Ministerial Code&quot; and &quot;Travel by Ministers&quot;. Guidance for Ministers on the use of air miles is set out in the &quot;Ministerial Code&quot;. The guidance makes clear that air miles should be used only for official purposes or else forgone. However, if it is impracticable to use the benefits for Government travel, there is no objection to Ministers donating them to charity if this is permissible under the terms of the airline&#039;s scheme and the charity is one chosen by the airline.

<p>
<a name="51019w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_93">Similar rules are in place for officials. However, the Ministry of Defence has no central record of air miles accrued by either Ministers or officials, and is unable to provide details of those forgone or donated to charity.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what procedures have been put in place to

ensure that funding received by QinetiQ from the Department on a non-competitive or allocated basis is used for the purposes for which it is intended.  [16833]</p>




<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51019w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The funding QinetiQ receives is tied to specific tasks that need to be completed to the satisfaction of the MOD customer. The MOD has a formal enabling contract with QinetiQ and the specific tasks are awarded against that contract. The procedures follow the principles of contracting applied to any supplier. Progress and completion of individual tasks are monitored by MOD staff against agreed criteria.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the full procedure and timetable is for <i>(a)</i> selecting and <i>(b)</i> formally agreeing a new name for a regiment, with particular reference to the King&#039;s Lancashire and Border Regiment.  [17695]</p>




<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51019w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 In selecting the names for new infantry regiments there has been a great deal of consultation at local and regimental level about potential new titles. The responsible Division of the Infantry then makes a recommendation to the Executive Committee of the Army Board, which in turn seeks the approval of Ministers and, ultimately, Her Majesty the Queen.
