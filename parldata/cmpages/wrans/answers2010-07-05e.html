 Security audits in 2004 and 2009 both recommended that the Embankment entrance by the Norman Shaw South building should be closed. This recommendation was endorsed by Members of both Houses on the Joint Committee on Security (JCOS). A significant amount of upgrade work would be needed to make the entrance safe-both for the occupants of the adjacent Norman Shaw buildings and for the security staff on duty at the post. The entrance was therefore closed in May 2010.</p>

 The 2009-10 budget for security was set out in the House of Commons Corporate Business Plan 2009-10 at £22.786 million. The outturn against this budget was £21.279 million. The difference between budget and outturn was, in the main, due to effective contract management and the efficient management of the security personnel.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 June 2010]:</i> The section of A5 between M1 junction 9 and Flamstead, formed part of the A5 Beech Road Dunstable to M1 junction 9 Lighting Replacement Scheme. The scheme included the replacement of existing street lighting, installation of safety barriers, kerbing, footways, fencing, earthworks, road markings and renewal of some traffic signs. The overall cost of the whole scheme when final accounts are agreed will be approximately £2,440,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100705w0001.htm_para13"><a name="10070527000185">The Highways Agency does not have a breakdown of costs of specific sections of the A5 included in the scheme, but it estimates that the cost of replacing the street lighting and associated works on the section between M1 junction 9 and Flamstead was around £810,000.</p>

 The Department for Transport fully supports the important work that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) undertakes in respect of counter-piracy. The IMO's Maritime Security Circulars together with the Department's Marine Guidance Note on measures to counter piracy armed robbery and other acts of violence against merchant shipping (MGN 298), and the industry's own Best Management Practices to counter piracy in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia (BMP) represent a sound body of advice that is developed and supported collectively by the IMO, government and industry bodies including the International and UK Chambers of Shipping. In particular the BMP has significantly reduced the risk of successful pirate hijack, especially in the critical Gulf of Aden trade artery.</p>

This grant was chosen for reduction because it was evenly spread across local authorities and thus provides equal incentive to local authorities to make efficiencies to compensate for the reduction in road safety grant. At the same time, a substantial tranche of local authority grant was de-ring-fenced, allowing local authorities greater flexibility in spending. The reduction in road safety grant is not intended to signal that local authorities are expected to reduce spending on road safety disproportionately.</p>

 The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued his latest report on Iran on 31 May 2010. The report makes it clear that Iran has shown no sign of suspending its enrichment- related activities as required by six UN Security Council Resolutions, and continues to stockpile enriched uranium.

 In addition to supporting the nationwide Three Diseases Fund in Burma, the Department for International Development (DFID) has expanded its aid for the health sector in border areas. We now provide TB treatment for Burmese people along the Thai border through the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit. We support the Shan Women's Action Network who provide basic health services to displaced people, and provide medical supplies through the Mae Tao Clinic. We are also expanding our cross-border health support from China. At least 345,000 people in remote border areas have benefited from this programme since 2006. I am currently considering a new proposal for health support for displaced people in conflict-affected parts of Eastern Burma.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) welcomes the United Nations' (UN) efforts in Burma to improve the coordination of humanitarian assistance to internally displaced people.

 The Electoral Administration Act 2006 extended the existing provisions for making polling places and stations, as far as practicable, accessible for electors who are disabled. Under the Act local authorities were required to undertake a review of polling places in their area within 12 months of the obligation starting to apply to them.

 The advice I have received is that standstills confer significant protection against the spread of fast moving diseases such as foot and mouth. The biggest factor in the size of an outbreak is the length of time between the disease entering the country and its detection (the so called silent spread period-typically three weeks). Properly observed standstills limit the number of movements livestock can make during this period and hence reduce the number of potentially infected premises. Standstills are not effective against slower moving diseases such as bovine tuberculosis. As I said in my reply to the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron), the six-day rule will be considered by the taskforce.</p>

The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is committed to supporting the Special Constabulary and increasing its numbers across England and Wales. As part of this the NPIA created nine regional coordinator posts to help police forces increase numbers and improve retention rates. In particular, they are working in partnership with police forces to develop effective marketing and recruitment strategies and to implement the National Strategy for the Special Constabulary. This aims to make the management of the recruitment process easier for police forces. Work is also ongoing to engage employers support to enable their staff to volunteer as special constables.</p>

 These matters were initially considered in detail and assessed by Blackpool council, as local planning authority. The case was referred to the Secretary of State for consideration on whether or not he should call the application in for his own determination. In this context the relevant issues which this proposal raised, along with the representations made, were considered and assessed in relation to the national planning policies to which you refer. I have previously outlined the issues considered in relation to Planning Policy Statement 1, Planning Policy Statement 9, Planning Policy Guidance 13 and Planning Policy Guidance 17. On Planning Policy Statement 3, growth point status; development proposed around the "M55 Hub"; the council's assessment of its five-year supply of housing land; the availability and considerations of suitable, alternative brownfield sites; the density of dwellings on site; and affordable housing provision were all considered.</p>

 None. Once the Secretary of State gave his decision not to call in this application he has no further jurisdiction on this matter. Blackpool council was initially responsible for assessing and achieving the housing provision set out in the regional spatial strategy (RSS). Following the recent announcement regarding the abolition of RSS, it remains a matter for the council to assess how to meet its housing needs based upon a robust assessment of need within its area. Abolition of the housing figures in RSS will give the council responsibility for determining numbers, based on the evidence available to them.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 June 2010]:</i> In the Emergency Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a 2.5 percentage point increase in the standard rate of value added tax (VAT). Analysis of the impact of indirect taxes, of which VAT is the most significant change, is provided in Annex A of the Red Book on both an income decile and expenditure decile basis. The Office for National Statistics and others have suggested expenditure deciles may better represent a household's expected lifetime income, and therefore better represent the impact of changes in VAT on households. The analysis provided in the Red Book is scalable to give the impact of a one percentage point increase in the main rate of VAT.</p>

 Pension funds are well diversified and invest for the long term in a range of assets. However, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill will have had a detrimental impact on pension funds due to the fall in the BP share price, the decision by BP to suspend dividend payments and the falls in share prices of other companies operating in the oil and gas sector.</p>

We estimate around 2% of total annual income was attributable to BP dividend payments. Consequently, the decision not to pay further dividends in 2010 should not have a significant impact on pension funds in the long term.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Following the introduction of the Libra case management system during 2008, offenders at magistrates courts can now be recorded as sex 'Not Stated' or 'Other', as well as 'Male', 'Female'. In 2008 1.5% of offenders sentenced were recorded as sex 'Not Stated'. Detailed comparisons by gender may be no longer be valid.<br>
<i> Court Categorisation</i><br>
Crown Courts: area categorisation based on the prosecuting police force area (which is not necessarily the area of the sentencing court). If another agency has brought the prosecution, area categorisation is based on the criminal justice area of the sentencing court.<br>
Magistrates Courts: As part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates' courts during 2008, a change was made to the categorisation by area. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while others are categorised in the same way as the Crown Court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates' courts were using Libra. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates' courts) outside their areas. Only around 0.01% of sentences at magistrates courts were affected in 2007 and 2008.<br>
Police force areas correspond to criminal justice areas except for the Metropolitan and City of London Police, which are combined to form the London criminal justice area.<br>
This data have been taken from the Ministry of Justice Court Proceedings database. These data are presented on the principal offence basis. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed. Where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.<br>

 Six trusts were vested in the first wave of probation trusts in April 2008. These were South Wales, Dyfed Powys, Humberside; Leicestershire and Rutland, West Mercia and Merseyside. Two further trusts were vested in April 2009. These were Lancashire and Greater Manchester. All probation boards were required to apply for trust status and a rigorous examination took place of their performance and management capability. All areas were successful in this application process. During 2009 a number of probation boards decided that they would be better placed by proposing voluntary amalgamations. All remaining probation boards achieved trust status on 1 April 2010 with the following succeeding as amalgamated trusts: Durham Tees Valley, Norfolk and Suffolk, Wales Probation Trust (the former South Wales and Dyfed Powys Trusts) and the Probation Boards of Gwent and North Wales; Surrey and Sussex; West Midlands and Staffordshire.</p>

Enquirers requiring more detailed or tailored guidance can contact the ACAS helpline.</p>
