 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what factors he took into consideration when authorising the budget increase for the A628 Mottram Tintwistle bypass; what the main reasons were for agreeing to the increase; and upon what date he agreed to the increases. [130424]</p>

 I took account of a number of factors in agreeing to an increase in the approved cost estimate for this scheme. In particular, I noted that important causes of the cost increase were, firstly, the decision, arising from the North West&#146;s advice on priorities for major transport schemes, to slip the proposed start date of this scheme to 2012-13; secondly, the use of more realistic forecasts of construction inflation up to the scheme&#146;s new start date; and thirdly, the inclusion of additional works to restrain the amount of traffic passing through the Peak District National Park following the construction of the scheme. I also took account of all the impacts, including the benefits that the scheme will provide. These include relieving the communities of Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwistle of high volumes of through traffic and providing improved journey times for travellers. In the light of the overall balance of costs and benefits I decided that it was appropriate to agree the increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="70328w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07032871000055">I took this decision on 30 January 2007. However, I recognise that at the higher cost estimate this scheme represents an additional pressure on the funding allocation for major schemes in the North West region. Officials will be discussing this with the North West region shortly and I will take account of any views that they may wish to offer on the provision of funding and timing of delivery of this scheme in the light of the higher cost.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on what date he paid &#163;103,974.92 to the account of Brims and Company Ltd., mentioned at item 5 in the third interim award of 16 October 1998 in the Greenhead A69 diversion arbitration. [129038]</p>

 Brims and Company Ltd. were contractors working on the A69 Greenhead diversion scheme. The company went into receivership in 1990. Receivers were appointed and an arbitration was brought against the Secretary of State. A settlement figure was agreed and ratified by the arbitrator in November 2002. This was a full and final settlement and explicitly included the payment of interest and costs. The agreed settlement figure was paid to Brims and Company Ltd. shortly thereafter. The settlement was enshrined in a consent award which attracts the confidentiality which is implicit in the arbitration process. The confidence is owed to the administrative receiver of Brims and Company Ltd.</p>

 The UK has been concerned by the unrest and political instability in Guinea arising from the general strike earlier this year, and has supported the efforts of ECOWAS and regional leaders in helping mediate during the crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"><a name="70328w0004.htm_para0"><a name="07032871000237">The situation has calmed with the lifting of martial law on 23 February, the ending of the strike, and the appointment of Lansana Kouyate as Prime Minister. We hope that he will soon appoint a new, broadly-based and consensus government which will work to move Guinea forward. But the recent crisis has brought the already devastated economy to a near standstill. It has severely affected the provision of health and other public services and the population's access to them. Food supplies have been disrupted, with the price of staples such as rice, flour, sugar and vegetables, as well as fuel, increasing sharply.</p>

In response to the crisis and the increased humanitarian risks, we have agreed to provide &#163;350,000 through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to be focused on meeting urgent medical and nutritional needs, and to maintain preparedness in case of further civil unrest with humanitarian consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="70328w0004.htm_para2"><a name="07032871000239">DFID has also recently agreed to provide &#163;270,000 to the World Food programme humanitarian air service for West Africa, which facilitates the movement of humanitarian personnel and urgently needed non-food items between Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

 The new fixed-dose combination drug artesunate and amodiaquine (ASAQ) was launched on 1 March 2007 and it is too early to assess the rollout. Although countries can buy the drug now, most will wait until it passes through the World Health Organisation (WHO) pre-qualification process. After this the drug can be procured through international drug purchasing facilities, such as the global fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_531"><a name="70328w0004.htm_para5"><a name="07032871000248">The drugs for neglected diseases initiative (DNDi) will monitor all aspects of the rollout to ensure that the drug is taken up by countries and delivered to patients. ASAQ has been produced in partnership with the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis who have extensive distribution networks in Africa. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO for the treatment of malaria, and ASAQ is an ACT recommended first line treatment in 20 African countries. Because of this and the fact that ASAQ is easier to use and less expensive than existing ACT drugs, DNDi expects quick take up by countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_532"><a name="70328w0004.htm_para6"><a name="07032871000249">ASAQ can only be used where there is no pre-existing resistance to amodiaquine, so it is most relevant for use in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the 20 countries where it is already recommended for first line treatment. It is less likely to be used in Asia  <br>

 Following the election of the Hamas-led Government, the European Union (EU) has suspended a number of technical assistance projects. A breakdown of specific projects from all member states is not available. Ten European Commission (EC) projects have been suspended, though some of these might have been suspended regardless of Palestinian political developments. The EC re-designed some projects in order to achieve the same results without channelling funds through the Palestinian authority (PA). No new budget support agreement was put into place (though budget support was not technically suspended). EU (EC and member states) humanitarian assistance commitments were &#8364;165 million in 2006, more than double the 2005 figure. Overall, EU assistance increased by 27 per cent. in 2006 to &#163;442 million, including &#163;123 million for Palestinian basic needs through the temporary international mechanism.

The only UK-led project that has been suspended is a planned project covering hydrometric monitoring to the Palestinian water authority (PWA) worth &#163;431,000. No new budget support agreement was put into place. In 2005-06 (prior to the election of Hamas) DFID provided &#163;10 million in budget support to the PA. DFID humanitarian assistance has remained unaffected. The UK maintained the same level of support (&#163;30 million) in 2006-07 as in 2005-06, and will increase this slightly to &#163;30.6 million for 2007-08.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 9 March 2007]:</i><i> </i>There is no specific requirement for staff and volunteers from outside a school to have<i> </i>training in relation to bullying, although we would expect those who operate extended<i> </i>school schemes to be equipped with the necessary skills to tackle it when it occurs.</p>

We supplement this training with guidance and advice designed to address the specific needs which school staff have in this area, for example, with regards to tackling prejudice-driven bullying.

<i>  [holding answer 9 March 2007]:</i><i> </i>While there is not a specific legal requirement for school anti-bullying policies to cover<i> </i>activities that take place outside of regular school hours, there is a duty on schools to<i> </i>tackle all forms of bullying and so we would expect school policies to be couched in<i> </i>sufficiently broad terms that bullying on school premises outside school hours would be<i> </i>covered. The guidance to accompany the school discipline provisions in the Education<i> </i>and Inspections Act 2006, &#145;School Discipline and Pupil Behaviour Policies&#146;, will make<i> </i>clear that the Government believe extended school activities, sports events and<i> </i>breakfast/after-school clubs should be covered by the school behaviour policy and that<i> </i>schools should apply disciplinary penalties for poor behaviour (including bullying) that<i> </i>occurs at such activities.</p>

also evidence to suggest that the provision of extended services by schools may, in itself, help to counter bullying. In particular, we know that on-site provision of family and community services can have a positive impact on pupil behaviour and attendance generally. Part of the Behaviour Improvement Programme included the development of &#145;full service&#146; extended schools, and the &#145;core offer&#146; of extended services which we want all schools to provide by 2010 includes services of direct relevance to issues around bullying such as parenting support and easy access to a wide range of specialist support services.</p>

1. These estimates refer to the HB expenditure and caseload within the scope of the HBR sample. We assume 15 per cent. of expenditure is missing. Most of this is due to long processing times. For more information see the technical appendix.<br>
2. The estimates will not therefore match the extrapolated figures published in the report &#147;Fraud and Error in the Benefits System April 2005 to March 2006&#148;.<br>

 The Department will consider PFI as an option when assessing the best value for money route to deliver its services. The Department for Work and Pensions uses a PFI route to obtain estates services under the Private Sector Resource Initiative for the Management of the Estate (PRIME) contract. PRIME is a 20 year PFI partnership deal, competitively let to Trillium (now Land Securities Trillium) on 1 April 1998. The deal involved the transfer of ownership and management of the majority of the then Department of Social Security premises to the private sector. Following the creation of the Department for Work and Pensions, PRIME was expanded in 2003 to cover ex-Employment Service estate. The Department secured a range of important new value for money mechanisms, bringing the deal in line with new Government guidelines for PFI deals.</p>

 The 16 hour rule, defined in regulations, affects entitlement to housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance (JSA). People may study for up to 16 hours a week and still be entitled to those benefits, but their benefit entitlement ends if they exceed 16 hours. Financial support for full-time students (with some exceptions) is the responsibility of the education and not the benefits system. The 16 hour rule exists to support that principle and, in the case of JSA, to ensure that people concentrate on looking for a job.</p>

people at risk of homelessness to receive housing benefit while in full-time study. We accept that some young people in these circumstances may need a second chance at learning and are considering how we might be able to help. We also continue to receive approaches to waive the JSA 16 hour rule in specific circumstances. Our response is to clarify the rule's purpose and effect and that the Employment and Training Act 1973 allows us to target unemployed people who face particular labour market disadvantage, by removing them from JSA and the requirement to actively seek work, instead paying them training allowances to undertake full-time training. We are using these arrangements in the &#145;Adult Learning Option&#146; pilots which are supporting our customers towards achieving a Level 2 qualification. The budget that supports training allowances is finite and this route to full-time learning has to be carefully targeted on those most in need.</p>

 On 9 November 2006 my Department published a Cancer Control Programme for Northern Ireland. This plan sets out recommendations and actions for the further strengthening of cancer services, including lung cancer services, and the setting of standards for the delivery of those services. In addition the Northern Ireland Cancer Network has established a Regional Lung Cancer Group which reviews existing standards and guidelines and develops regionally agreed standards of care. I am confident that this programme of work aligns effectively with the principles set out in the Lung Cancer Patients&#146; Charter.</p>

The guarantees, in effect, allow movement of live fish of susceptible species only from areas that are considered free of the parasite.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_613"><a name="70328w0016.htm_para4"><a name="0703291001606">The revised additional guarantees were agreed only after they had been scrutinised by leading UK fish health scientists and assessed by them as posing a negligible risk of introducing Gs into the UK. Subsequently, the EU Permanent Advisory Network for Disease in Aquaculture, made up of international fish health scientists, also considered the measures and came to the same conclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_614"><a name="70328w0016.htm_para5"><a name="0703291001607">DEFRA has contingency plans in place which have been drafted in close consultation with the Environment Agency, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and other interested parties. In the event of identification of Gs in either farmed or wild freshwater fish stocks, the objective would be to contain and, if possible, eradicate the parasite. Officials are also in regular contact with their counterparts in other Departments and the devolved Administrations about contingency planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="70328w0016.htm_para6"><a name="0703291001608">My Department has also carried out publicity campaigns to raise awareness among the general public (especially those involved in angling) about the dangers of introducing Gs and other diseases through travel to and from high-risk areas. A further campaign is being considered for the near future. Advice on how to keep Gs out of the country is contained in our &#147;Keep Fish Diseases Out&#148; series of guidance leaflets.</p>

 We remain deeply concerned about the continued use of the death penalty in Iran. After China, Iran executes more people than any other country in the world. Despite announcing a moratorium on juvenile executions in 2005, Iran still imposes the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18. Reports suggest that between five and eight juvenile executions took place in 2005, and at least two in 2006. This is a clear contravention of Iran's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are also concerned that basic standards surrounding the application of capital punishment are absent in Iran and that death sentences are often carried out in public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="70328w0021.htm_para14"><a name="07032913000136">We make frequent representations to the Iranian authorities about the use of the death penalty, both bilaterally and through the EU.

On 21 January and 4 March, the EU presidency in Tehran raised our concerns about specific juvenile death penalty cases and reiterated the EU's longstanding objection to the death penalty in all circumstances. In the last two years, through the EU, we have raised the death penalty with the Iranian authorities at least 15 times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_692"><a name="70328w0021.htm_para15"><a name="07032913000137">We also take action through the UN, and were pleased that all EU countries supported a resolution on human rights in Iran at the UN General Assembly in December 2006, which expressed serious concern at "the continuing of public executions, including multiple public executions, and, on a large scale, other executions in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards" and "in particular, deplores the execution of persons who were under the age of 18 at the time their offence was committed".</p>

 The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Mission to Sudan issued a damning report on 12 March, confirming what we already knew about the grave human rights situation in Darfur. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), and some Asian states, said that the council should not discuss the report on procedural grounds because the mission had not gone to Sudan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_701"><a name="70328w0022.htm_para2"><a name="07032913000162">I, and the UK permanent representative to the HRC, called on the council to take effective action on Darfur and not become mired in procedural debates. We do not accept that the mission report is not valid as the mission failed to go to Sudan. The Government of Sudan reneged on their commitment to co-operate with the mission and refused to grant visas to all members of the mission, so, rightly, none of the members went. The report is based on the assessments of UN humanitarian agencies, the African Union in Addis Ababa and UN High Commissioner for Refugees in eastern Chad. All of these organisations, which have large numbers of staff operating in Darfur and eastern Chad, continue to report an appalling human rights and humanitarian situation there. We will continue to press all members of the HRC, including those from the OIC, to take forward the recommendations in the report.</p>

<i> Guide to quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>
The true value is likely to be within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>
All of the figures on this table have a CV of less than 5 per cent.<br>
The median is the value below which 50 per cent. fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

 Data concerning the average waiting time taken to complete a disclosure are not a performance target and are not collated by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). The CRB operates to a set of published service standards (PSS) which include to issue 93 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days. For January 2007, the CRB issued 99.2 per cent. of standard disclosures and 90.8 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within PSS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_748"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para0"><a name="07032913000508">Within these overarching performance standards, there are a number of targets that are the responsibility of the CRB that the Bureau has been meeting consistently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_749"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para1"><a name="07032913000509">There are a number of other factors that can affect the timely completion of checks by the CRB, including but not restricted to the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with the initial application, the accurate completion of the application form, the clarity of the information provided, the existence of conviction or non-conviction information and the operational effectiveness of the disclosure units of the police forces involved in the enhanced disclosure process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_750"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para2"><a name="07032913000510">In order to address these, the CRB has provided more support to all counter-signatories and customers in the form of detailed guidance notes which accompany the application forms to ensure that applications are completed accurately and are accompanied by all relevant supporting documentation. The CRB has also established a rigorous compliance and assurance function to ensure that registered bodies make the best use of the disclosure service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_751"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para3"><a name="07032913000511">There have been fluctuations in the performance of some of the police disclosure units, caused by a combination of factors including a significant increase in disclosure applications and a combination of local staffing and IT problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_752"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para4"><a name="07032913000512">However, the police and the CRB have been working closely together to identify ways of tackling these problems in forces, which have included additional resources for disclosure unit managers and a greater degree of monitoring performance and support. These initiatives have been strengthened by a new service level agreement in April 2006 between the CRB and all the 43 forces in England and Wales, which focuses on service delivery. These measures have led to a substantial improvement in the overall disclosure process in recent months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_753"><a name="70328w0026.htm_para5"><a name="07032913000513">The CRB has issued approximately 285,000 applications each month in the last six months and as at 23 March 2007 162,826 applications are in progress.</p>

 Estimates of the prevalence of drug use among the household population in England and Wales are provided by the British Crime Survey (BCS), which has included a comparable self-completion module on drug use since 1996.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_757"><a name="70328w0027.htm_para1"><a name="07032913000857">The prevalence of self-reported drug use in the past year amongst those aged 16-59 in England and Wales from the BCS is shown in the following table. This shows that use of amphetamines and cannabis has declined significantly since 1998. Cocaine powder use has increased over the same period but most of this increase took place prior to 2000, since when use has remained generally stable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_758"><a name="70328w0027.htm_para2"><a name="07032913000858">It should be noted that general population surveys such as the British Crime Survey provide poor coverage of more problematic users, who are more likely to use heroin and crack. These figures are therefore likely to be an underestimate of use of these drugs. A three year research programme is currently underway which will provide us with a better assessment of trends in the prevalence of problematic opiate and crack use in the future.</p>

the results of the pilot project codenamed Lantern on the use of mobile fingerprint scanners. [129120]</p>

<p><a name="st_401"><a name="07032913000945"><a name="70328w0027.htm_spnew4"><a name="07032913002755"><b>John Reid:</b>
 The Lantern pilot is still in its early stages and the initial results and feedback received to date indicate that Lantern is delivering the expected business benefits and that officers are finding it easy to operate and a useful tool that they would not want to be withdrawn. Currently results are being returned to the device in less than two minutes with an accuracy rate of approximately 97 per cent. and a hit rate of 40 per cent. (i.e. 40 per cent. of people checked are recorded on IDENT1). This high hit rate reflects the environment in which the devices are being used&#151;proactive, intelligence led policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_761"><a name="70328w0027.htm_para5"><a name="07032913000946">A number of arrests have been made, particularly of disqualified drivers presenting false ID. Lantern has also been used to identify a vehicle occupant who presented a false identity but was wanted by three forces for fraud and ATM card skimming. In another case Lantern played a large part in apprehending a man described by police as &#145;the most wanted nominal&#146; in the area. In many of these cases the individuals would not have been arrested without the identifications provided by Lantern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_762"><a name="70328w0027.htm_para6"><a name="07032913000947">Results indicate that Lantern is showing time savings beyond expectations and hence allowing officers to spend more time on the streets and providing a visible deterrent. Establishing a person&#146;s identity at the roadside avoids the need to arrest a person and take them to a custody suite to do this&#151;a process which typically takes about three hours. Early results show that in encounters where officers have reported a time saving using Lantern, the average time saved has been about 90 minutes. There have also been a number of cases where Lantern has provided early identification of deceased persons carrying no ID and hence saved a considerable amount of police and coroners time and also enabled next of kin to be informed sooner. Cases have included fatal road traffic collisions, sudden deaths and suicide victims on railway lines.</p>
