To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will assess the benefits of using the concept of institutional <i>(a)</i> sectarianism and <i>(b)</i> anti- nationalism within the context of reforming policing in Northern Ireland.  [80723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government consider equality of treatment and respect for different cultures as fundamental aspects of the ethos of any police service.
<P>

<a name="90421w01.htm_para0">The terms of reference of the Independent Commission on policing, as established by the Good Friday Agreement, require the Commission to make proposals designed to ensure that policing arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that the police service in Northern Ireland can enjoy widespread support from, and be seen as an integral part of, the community as a whole.
<P>

<a name="90421w01.htm_para1">The Commission is consulting widely, and will report this Summer. The Government look forward to receiving the Commission's report.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if the cost of the Northern Ireland Assembly is drawn from the Northern Ireland grant; and what the costs of the Assembly <i>(a)</i> were in the 1998-99 financial year and <i>(b)</i> are projected to be in the 1999-2000 financial year.  [81037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Yes. 1998-99 expenditure was &#163;10.6m. It will be for the Assembly to determine its operating costs in 1999-2000. In February, the Assembly Commission estimated this at &#163;36m.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if the cost of policing civil unrest continues to be a charge against the Northern Ireland grant; and what the cost of this policing has been in the 1998-99 financial year.  [80914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Provision for the requirements of the Law and Order programmes is included within the overall Northern Ireland Departmental Expenditure Limit and will remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State after devolution.
<P>

<a name="90421w01.htm_para2">The additional costs of the Royal Ulster Constabulary operations at Drumcree and elsewhere during July 1998 amounted to &#163;11 million. Since July the additional costs incurred, in respect of the continuing presence needed to police the ongoing protest, are approximately &#163;0.4 million per month.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her answer of 4 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>825</i>, on CS sprays, for what reasons the Royal Ulster Constabulary has not been issued with CS sprays.  [80870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The use of CS spray is relatively recent innovation in British policing. The Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary keeps under review the personal protective equipment available to and approved for use by police officers throughout the United Kingdom. The risks and threats to police officers in Northern Ireland have demanded protective measure different from their colleagues in the rest of the United Kingdom. All options are however kept under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when research projects <i>(a)</i> started and <i>(b)</i> concluded at Porton Down into the development of an acellular DTP vaccine; how much the research programme cost; and when and for what reasons the Government decided to purchase such vaccines in the United States rather than continue development in the UK.  [80646]<P>

<P>
<a name="90421w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Work on acellular pertussis vaccine commenced at the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR) (as the then named Microbiological Research Establishment under the Ministry of Defence) in 1974 and continued until 1993-94. Costs for the period 1974 to 1979 when the centre was under the Ministry of Defence are not available. Costs to the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) and the Department from 1979 to 1993-94 (when the PHLS managed CAMR) were some &#163;2.7 million, although some additional costs would have been incurred by PHLS and the Medical Research Council for clinical trials and by Porton Speywood for vaccine manufacture and trials.
<P>

<a name="90421w02.htm_para3">The acellular pertussis vaccine development at CAMR was discontinued when the CAMR vaccine was not selected by international researchers for inclusion in trials comparing candidate pertussis vaccines.

manufactured vaccine, along with other components not in the CAMR vaccine. This Canadian vaccine has been shown in studies to be the only acellular vaccine to provide protection comparable to that from the presently used UK whole cell pertussis vaccine. The studies have also shown that there is little difference in the level of local reactions and fever seen after use of the United Kingdom whole cell pertussis vaccine when compared to acellular pertussis vaccines under the immunisation schedule used in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is his estimate of <i>(a)</i> the annual number of early deaths and hospital admissions currently attributable to particle pollution, <i>(b)</i> the reduction in early deaths and hospital admissions by 2005, if the whole of the UK were to meet its current national air quality objective for particles and <i>(c)</i> the reduction in early deaths and hospital admissions by 2005, if the whole of the UK were to meet the proposed EC Air Quality Daughter Directive Stage 1 limit value for particles.  [80782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department has quantified the impact on health from current and future levels of airborne particle (PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> ) concentrations in the United Kingdom as follows.
<P>

<a name="90421w02.htm_para5">The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants' report 'Quantification of the Effects of Air Pollution on Health in the United Kingdom' concluded that (PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> ) concentrations in 1996 were likely to have brought forward the deaths of around 8,100 people in the UK. It also concluded that PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  concentrations in 1996 contributed to about 10,500 respiratory hospital admissions, which may have been brought forward or additional. In both cases the people most at risk are likely to be the elderly suffering from chronic heart and lung diseases.
<P>

<a name="90421w02.htm_para6">The Government recently published their proposals for review of the National Air Quality Strategy, and, in particular, their proposals for revised and additional objectives for the pollutants. During the review process, as a result of a better understanding of the sources and types of particles in the UK provided by the work of the Airborne Particles Expert Group, it became apparent that the current PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  objective would not be achievable in a number of local authority areas with any measures that are currently practicable. The Expert Group's work also revealed the importance of non-UK sources and the limit to which local authority and central Government action alone could control levels of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> . The Government are consulting on a proposal to replace the current PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  objective with the Stage 1 limit values in the European Community Air Quality Daughter Directive, while retaining the current objective as an indicative level. Although sufficient information was not available to estimate the benefits of meeting the current objective across the whole of the UK, further work is planned to estimate the benefits of reducing levels of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  below the limit values as part of the next review of the Strategy.




<P>
<P><I>21 Apr 1999 : Column: 541</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90421w02.htm_para7">The Government will reconsider the indicative level for particles once clear evidence is available on the significance of PM2.5 for health with a view, potentially, to setting an objective based on concentration of this finer fraction. Discussions are also in progress with the UK's EC partners to explore ways of reducing the transboundary particle problem.
<P>

<a name="90421w02.htm_para8">There is expected to be a cumulative reduction of about 5,000 early deaths and about 4,000 respiratory hospital admissions over the period 1996 to 2005 as a result of agreed measures to reduce PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  <sup>1</sup> . (Calculations for the year 2005 alone would give about 900 fewer early deaths and about 750 fewer respiratory hospital admissions than in 1996). In a typical year, the predicted concentrations of PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  in 2005 would meet the proposed EC Stage 1 limit value at all urban background locations. There are however likely to be exceedences at busy roadsides in some large urban areas and possibly in the vicinity of some industrial plants.

 A national weighted capitation formula is used as the basis for allocating hospital and community health services revenue to health authorities. The purpose of the formula is to set targets to enable the equitable distribution of resources based on the health care requirements of different resident populations. This cannot be broken down into a mental health component.

 The allocation of central government funding for local transport projects will in future be based on 5-year local transport plans. Revised guidance for local authorities on preparation of their provisional local transport plans was published on 12 April. Where a major road scheme forms part of a plan we will expect it to have been assessed using the New Approach to Appraisal (NATA) developed during the 1997/98 review of the trunk road programme.
<P>

<a name="90421w03.htm_para4">NATA requires the identification of alternative options capable of addressing the transport problem. Possible options will depend on the nature of the problem. In the case of heavy traffic flows through a village they might

<a name="90421w03.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 At 31 December 1998, DVLA records showed a total of 2,669 licensed gas vehicles in Great Britain. Of these, 420 were licensed in exempt classes and the large majority of the remainder were licensed either as Private or Light Goods vehicles or as agricultural vehicles. We therefore estimate that the revenue cost of reducing vehicle excise duty to &#163;20 on these vehicles would be substantially less than &#163;1 million. However, the Government are encouraging the switch to gas and other low pollutant fuels and we would expect the number of gas-powered vehicles to increase significantly in the future.

They also include RDAs' own running costs. Regeneration programmes make up 87 per cent. of the total budget and variations in allocations reflect the regions' different regeneration needs.

 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> The information requested by the hon. Member is not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, my Department estimates that the cost of running a fleet of 50 38 tonne trucks will be about &#163;425,000 higher in France than in the UK; about &#163;600,000 more in the Netherlands; and about &#163;800,000 more in Belgium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> Explicit subsidy to the road haulage industry in EU Member States is generally prohibited by European Community State Aid rules, but assistance can be provided to promote research or the development of more economical transport systems and technologies, to eliminate excess capacity which causes serious structural problems, to facilitate the development of combined transport or to compensate for public service obligations. Information is not available about the extent to which such payments are made in other Member States.
<P>

<a name="90421w04.htm_para1">However, there is considerable variance in the extent to which the road haulage industries in Member States meet their full costs--to the economy, environment and infrastructure. This depends on the levels of taxation and haulage industry-related expenditure in each country.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his estimate of the extent of over-capacity of the road haulage industry in the United Kingdom; what proportion of the road haulage vehicles operating in the UK are (i) UK owned, (ii) UK registered and (iii) from other EU countries.  [81154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> No reliable comprehensive estimate of the over-capacity in the haulage industry in the UK exists at present but we believe it to be significant. A comprehensive assessment of over-capacity is an issue which may be addressed as part of the work of the Haulage Industry Forum.
<P>

<a name="90421w04.htm_para3">Information on the nationality of ownership of vehicles is not held by my Department. The proportion of international freight journeys to and from the UK undertaken by UK hauliers in the 12 months ending September 1998--the latest period for which statistics are available--was 44 per cent., which is little different from the long-term average. In 1997--the latest date for which we have information--we understand that the overall level of cabotage by EU hauliers within the UK accounted for substantially less than 1 per cent. of total freight moved.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the items he took into account when estimating the running costs of a goods vehicle in (i) the United Kingdom and (ii) each of the other EU countries.  [81153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> The estimates of relative running costs between the UK and certain other EU member states issued by my Department concerned the relative costs of setting up a fleet of 50 vehicles involved in international transport. Items taken into account included labour costs and taxes, corporation tax and annual circulation taxes (i.e. vehicle excise duty or its equivalent). For international operations, the estimates assumed the same levels of fuel costs, because those operating internationally--whether UK or foreign owned--can take advantage of the lowest fuel costs on their route.

ACRE has approached DETR for grant aid in support of the NLCB offer, and this is under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w06.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ennis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress is being made by UK offshore oil and gas producers and oil companies to deal with the millennium bug; and what measures have been taken by his Department to ensure the security of concessionary coal supplies over this period.  [81700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I can now report the findings of the independent assessment process established by the DTI which confirms that UK oil companies and offshore gas producers are on track to ensure that there will be no major disruption to supplies due to the Year 2000 threat to computer systems. The DTI has taken on the role of "responsible body" reporting to the ACTION 2000 National Infrastructure Forum on the Year 2000 preparations being made by the oil industry and UK's offshore oil and gas producers.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para0">The DTI has approached this task in a systematic way, making full use of the industry's own resources. It has engaged W. S. Atkins Consultants Limited--an internationally known and highly respected engineering consultancy with extensive experience within the oil and gas industry--to independently validate the process adopted and its results. The industry has fully supported this important work and provided full and frank access to all the relevant information and staff.




<P>
<P><I>21 Apr 1999 : Column: 554</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para1">The independent verification approach adopted by DTI has been agreed with ACTION 2000 and designed to build on the work already in hand by offshore and onshore companies to avoid duplication of effort. It has been closely supported by the relevant trade associations (UKOOA--UK Offshore Oil Operators Association, UKPIA--UK Petroleum Industry Association and AUKOI--Association of UK Oil Independents).
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para2">For the offshore sector, DTI arranged for companies to conduct a stringent assessment process supported by UKOOA, which involved preparation of a report on each operator's state of readiness and its independent confirmation by, either a "peer group assessor" or an external consultant.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para3">To further enhance the independent element in this process, W. S. Atkins carried out a programme of visits to review the process adopted, the supporting data and its conclusions. The format and extent of the visit programme was determined by W. S. Atkins. It covered all the key elements of the offshore oil and gas industry including production and onshore terminal/pipeline facilities, and was designed to ensure they could reach a fair view on the overall status of the upstream industry.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para4">For the downstream oil sector covering the supply and distribution of refined oil products, W. S. Atkins were engaged to carry out a more intensive role. They prepared and issued on behalf of DTI a detailed and closely targeted questionnaire to all the main downstream players. Following a detailed analysis of the responses W. S. Atkins conducted a series of detailed on-site follow-up visits designed to validate the questionnaire responses. Officials from DTI and other interested Government Departments also participated in some of the visits.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para5">Again the visit programme was determined by W. S. Atkins and designed to ensure that they were able to form a fair view of the overall status of the downstream industry. The programme was carefully planned to cover all aspects of the industry. It looked vertically through the supply chain and covered refining, pipelines, distribution terminals, and retail outlets. It embraced all sectors of the industry from the majors, and hypermarkets through mid- size players to smaller retailers. It extended throughout the UK covering locations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para6">Throughout the process, DTI has worked closely with Action 2000, other responsible bodies and the various trade bodies to ensure nothing was overlooked and ensure that the process adopted reflected good Year 2000 practice.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para7">At the National Infrastructure Forum meeting in January 1999, the industry attracted an overall "amber" assessment against the standard colour code adopted by ACTION 2000. I am pleased to report that W. S. Atkins have confirmed that the industry has since then made substantial progress both onshore and offshore. Copies of their summary reports have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and copies made available on the DTI internet site. W. S. Atkins have also confirmed that the validation process adopted by DTI provides an effective means of independently validating the industry's state of 



<P>
<P><I>21 Apr 1999 : Column: 555</I><P>
progress, both in terms of its suitability to the offshore/ onshore sector, and general good practice in relation to Year 2000 risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para8">In detail W. S. Atkins found that more than half of the offshore operators and almost two thirds of the downstream industry now merit a blue assessment (no identified risks of material disruption), and that the remainder were on track to attain that rating once work scheduled during the normal summer shutdown period has been completed, and residual contingency planning and external dependency issues had been finalised.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para9">The DTI has agreed a follow up plan with W. S. Atkins, to monitor progress on the outstanding issues and carry out a further programme of independent check visits to confirm that the scheduled work has been completed successfully. DTI will report on this work at the National Infrastructure Forum meeting in October 1999, and will continue to monitor the industry's progress throughout the millennium period.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para10">Regarding coal, the Department is responsible for supplying concessionary fuel to some 90,000 former employees of British Coal. This accounts for 20-25 per cent. of all solid fuel for domestic use. Currently, two large coal companies are under contract to DTI for the supply and distribution of concessionary fuel (CPL Distribution Ltd. and T. H. Fergusson).
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para11">The Department appointed Aon Risk Services Ltd. (risk management consultants) to assess the security of supply of concessionary fuel over the millennium period. This covered the fuel distributors as well as a number of major producers. In addition, Aon was asked to advise on the position in the wider retail market for household coal in so far that the same systems are used by the companies under contract to DTI for distributing concessionary supplies. Aon's conclusions are very encouraging with all the main operators achieving blue rating. The remaining 5 per cent. merit amber rating but are on course to achieve blue rating by October. Aon will be involved in continued monitoring of the position.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the initiatives taken since 1 May 1997 to help those over 50 years obtain employment.  [80790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Since 1 May 1997, we have introduced a wide range of new measures to help people over 50 to find work. These contribute to our policy of "Better Government for Older People".
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para12">In November 1998, I launched for public consultation the draft Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment. This was well received and the final version of the Code will be published in May together with case studies and guidance for employers.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para13">The New Deal for people over 50 was announced by the Chancellor in last month's Budget. This will help people over 50 who have been out of work and on income replacement benefits for more than 6 months, and their dependent partners. It introduces an Employment Credit of &#163;60 a week, &#163;40 for those working part time, for those with incomes of less than &#163;15,000 a year. There will also be learning support of up to &#163;750; guidance from a personal adviser wand extra jobsearch help. This will start in selected pathfinder areas in October and be extended to all parts of the country early in 2000. A consultative document on the detail of this New Deal will be issued shortly.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para14">People aged over 50 also benefit from the steps we have taken to strengthen services for unemployed people generally. Some of the prototype Employment Zones have been developing new approaches to tackling the barriers faced by people over 50. Elsewhere pilots under the New Deal for people over 25 have also been offering special help for people over 50. This New Deal offers a range of help and advice, including a subsidy of &#163;75 a week for employers who recruit people who have been without work for 2 years. The total number of 50+ clients invited to attend an initial interview for the New Deal 25+ pilots is around 2,000. The total number of 50+ clients joining Gateway is just under 2,000. For the New Deal 25+ (June measures) to the end of January 1999, 26,550 people aged 50+ had been invited to attend an initial interview.
<P>

<a name="90421w06.htm_para15">The New Deal for Disabled People is piloting a personal adviser service in 12 areas and innovative projects to help disabled people and those with long standing illnesses, many of whom are over 50.

Under the Employment Service Jobseeker's Charter, New Deal clients are able to raise any complaints through a number of avenues such as the New Deal Hotline, which is available to both clients and employers for compliments and complaints. Hotline inquiries are collated centrally as per the following table, however, the majority of any complaints are dealt with at local level with the New Deal Personal Adviser. The level of satisfaction amongst young people participating on New Deal is one of the Core Performance Measures. Information about this will be published, by Unit of Delivery, later in the year.

The principles which underpin the Strategic Defence Review remain valid, and are not affected by the current deployment in the Balkans. However, full account will be taken of any lessons learned.

 Personnel deployed in the field are normally fed using Operational Ration Packs when fresh food supply is not practicable or in the period before a fresh food supply chain can be established. The rations replicate normal feeding patterns by providing breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks together with hot and cold drinks and are designed either for consumption under group feeding arrangements or for issue to the individual. There are currently seven menu variations. The ration packs can have up to 24 components, which vary depending on the ration type and the menu. The constituents range from ancillaries such as can openers and toilet tissue through snack items, such as biscuits and beverage sachets, to main meal items of meat and vegetables and a dessert.

 The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the rates assumed in the latest long-term costing of the Defence programme (the hybrid estimate), is now &#163;9,756 million. Leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&#163;21 million and -&#163;1 million respectively), there has been a real cost reduction since last year of &#163;52 million. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 1998 represented some 94 per cent. of this estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to the latest long-term costing conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;12,870 million.

 The future structure of the Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Associations (TAVRAs) has been the subject of a joint study involving the TAVRAs themselves and the Ministry of Defence. I have accepted the joint recommendation of the Commander in Chief Land Command and Chairman of the Council of TAVRAs, to set in hand new arrangements to ensure that the areas of responsibility of TAVRAs in England are aligned to those of Government office regions. Arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be unchanged. As a result, there will be a reduction in the number of Associations from the present 14 to 13. This reduction will be achieved by the amalgamation of the South East and Eastern Wessex Associations to form a new Association covering the counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Responsibility for carrying out the Eastern Wessex Association's current functions in Dorset will transfer to the Western Wessex Association. This robust and coherent structure recognises the essential tri-Service nature of the TAVRAs, who provide an essential link between the community and the Armed Forces, whilst the changes to the financial

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 2 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>684</i>, how many times Ministers in his Department met their counterparts in the US Administration between 1 January 1998 and 1 June 1998, indicating the dates and locations of each meeting, the Ministers involved and the name of the US counterpart.  [80817]<P>

<P>
<a name="90421w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Foreign Office Ministers have frequent contact with members of the US Administration in the United States, in the UK and elsewhere overseas.
<P>

<a name="90421w09.htm_para1">The Foreign Secretary visited Washington from 15-16 January 1998 and had formal meetings with Madeleine Albright, US Secretary of State, who was accompanied by Tom Pickering (Under Secretary for Political Affairs), Stuart Eizenstat (Under Secretary for Economics, Business and Agricultural Affairs), James Rubin (State Department Spokesman), Marc Grossman (Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs), Donald Bandler (Senior Director for European Affairs at the National Security Council), Anthony Wayne (Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs), David Welch (Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs); he also had talks with Sandy Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. No other FCO Ministers visited the United States between 1 January 1998 and 1 June 1998.
<P>

<a name="90421w09.htm_para2">As stated in my previous answer, the information the hon.

<P>
<a name="90421w09.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We fully support the efforts made by ECOMOG to protect the civilian population of Sierra Leone from rebel atrocities. Nevertheless, we view with concern any reports of abuses by ECOMOG forces, including those reported by the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone. We have made our views clear on this to ECOMOG and to the Government of Sierra Leone. The abuses described by UNOMSIL, and any other such reports, should be fully investigated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The highest priority for the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in 1999 is that negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty should begin in earnest. We therefore wish to see the re-establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee set up in 1998 for this purpose. Such a treaty is the internationally agreed next step towards nuclear disarmament.
<P>

<a name="90421w09.htm_para6">Because the CD operates by consensus, the agreement of all participating countries on a work plan for the year must be obtained before substantive discussions can begin. We have therefore assessed all proposals made so far in the light of the prospects of their attracting such consensus support. Regrettably, none has yet done so. We will continue to press for a formula on which all can agree.

<a name="90421w10.htm_para3">Of the ERDF claims, some 173 have been delayed because the claims are subject of queries, or where the applicants are due to refund payments or other grants to the Department, or where there are other technical reasons why the claims are currently invalid for payment. In addition, the 28 claims from pre-1994 and 1994 relate to old pre-1994 programmes which became liable for payment only in February of this year. They will of course be paid as soon as possible. Most of the unpaid ESF claims for 1996 and 1997 relate to Government sector training programmes final payments for which, in terms of the appropriate European Regulations, are not due until after 31 March 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 20 April 1999]:</i> Pharmaceutical Services consist primarily of the supply of drugs and appliances prescribed by general practitioners.

Income from prescription charges collected from patients is offset against these costs.

However, in clinical settings where such testing is undertaken, this should be made clear to attenders by the use of posters and leaflets, which should also indicate that any person not wishing to have their sample tested in this way may refuse permission. Appropriate posters and leaflets are provided in antenatal care settings and in genito-urinary medicine clinics.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 1999]:</i> Each of the arrangements with individual sponsors differs in terms of the level of support for exhibit zones; associated National Programme activities and other aspects of the Millennium Experience. There is no direct correlation between the source of income and payment of invoices for particular aspects of the project. NMEC has been successful in achieving the majority of its sponsorship income target.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the current size of the backlog of failed asylum seekers liable for removal; and by when he expects that backlog to be cleared.  [78664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 March 1999]:</i> As at November 1998, the latest date for which a figure is available, the estimated backlog of failed asylum seekers liable for removal was 24,000. That figure represents a snapshot, taken from Immigration and Nationality Directorate port and enforcement databases, of failed asylum seekers, excluding dependants, who have exhausted their rights of appeal (including any who did not submit an appeal against the refusal of asylum) and who are liable for removal.
<P>

<a name="90421w12.htm_para1">The backlog figure includes a number of cases where there are one or more barriers to removal such as absconding, judicial review or lack of documentation. Therefore, it is unlikely ever to be the case that the whole of the backlog will be cleared. In light of the unpredictable influence that legal and other barriers exert on the removal process, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of when the backlog is likely to be cleared. However, we made clear in the Immigration and Asylum White Paper our commitment to strengthen enforcement of immigration controls. We have already taken a number of steps to deliver that commitment and further measures are included in the Immigration and Asylum Bill.




<P>
<P><I>21 Apr 1999 : Column: 579</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90421w12.htm_para2">Some 12,500 failed asylum seekers were removed or departed voluntarily between May 1997 and February 1999. This number is greater than the combined annual totals for 1993 to 1996.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 1999]:</i> The information requested is given in the table. It should be noted that some deportation orders may not be immediately executable because of legal reasons, or other barriers to removal such as absconding, and that in some cases where a deportation order has been signed, it is later decided that deportation is no longer appropriate. The Government will further reduce the use of Deportation Orders under the Immigration and Asylum Bill by increasing the use of administrative removal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many seizures of methylamphetamine have been made by <i>(a)</i> police and <i>(b)</i> HM Customs, in the last 10 years; and what was the total quantity seized.  [79902]<P>

<P>
<a name="90421w12.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Figures for the number of seizures of methylamphetamine made by the police and Customs and submitted to the Forensic Science Service for analysis between 1995 and 1998 are given in the table. It should be noted that full information is not available for 1996 and 1997. Equivalent figures for earlier years

<P>

<a name="90421w12.htm_para3">Until late 1997, methylamphetamine represented less than 0.1 per cent. of all amphetamine cases in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the amounts seized (mostly white powders) were generally small with typical purities of less than 10 per cent. The weight of tablets varies but is typically in the range 250-300 milligrams and perhaps has a drug content of 5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90421w12.htm_para4">Use of this substance is very rare in Europe but is more prevalent in the United States of America and Japan.

<P>

<a name="90421w14.htm_para0">"Misappropriation" in this context covers firearms stolen, obtained by fraud or forgery, or handled dishonestly but not accidental loss, for which the Home Office does not maintain records. Before 1995, the figures for the misappropriation of firearms were for the number of incidents. A single incident could relate to more than one firearm. From 1995, figures record the number of actual firearms reported as having been misappropriated. The figures cover all firearms including those that do not need to be held on certificate. Details of ownership are not recorded. The totals for each of the last ten years for which figures for England and Wales are available are given in the table.

<P>

<a name="90421w14.htm_para1">Prior to 1995, only estimates of the number of firearms and shotguns held on certificate were recorded centrally. Although details of actual numbers were subsequently recorded, comparing the figures for misappropriated firearms for the last three years against the total number of firearms held on certificate in those years does not provide a reliable estimate of the proportion of lawfully owned firearms that are misappropriated every year. The former figures include firearms that need not be held on certificate (eg air weapons, starting guns and imitation firearms) whilst the latter figures do not cover all lawfully owned firearms (eg they do not cover firearms held by registered dealers, those held by the Crown or those that do not require a certificate). Subject to those significant caveats, the figures given in the table provide a very rough estimate of the proportion of lawfully owned firearms in England and Wales which have been misappropriated since 1995.

 There are currently a total of 113 target shooting clubs at schools in England and Wales which have been approved by the Home Office under the terms of section 15 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.

 Although the revenue from duty on road fuel gas is currently small, cutting the duty rate to either <i>(a)</i> 8p per kilogram, consistent with the EU minimum rate, or <i>(b)</i> zero would result in switching from other road fuels, which could have a significant revenue cost.

 Over 1994-95, twelve countries took part in an International Adult Literacy Survey. The ranges of scores achieved by representative samples of each population aged 16 to 65 were grouped into five proficiency levels, of which level 1 indicated people with very poor literacy skills.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para0">Within the UK sample, 21.8 per cent. achieved only level 1 in prose literacy, which was defined as the knowledge and skills needed to understand and use information from printed texts, whereas the proportion of the German sample at this level was 14.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para1">There are no comparable figures for later years.

 The Government's aim is to ensure that every family and child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential by tackling the causes of inequality of opportunity. It is promoting employment opportunity for parents through the New Deals and by making work pay. This will reduce worklessness, a major cause of childhood disadvantage. It is also investing in early years learning and education to ensure that every child will have the chance to succeed in later life.

<a name="90421w15.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The approximate cost of the household leaflet is around &#163;1.5 million but the exact cost will depend on a number of factors, including the way in which it is distributed and the number of households receiving a copy. The cost will be firmed up in the run up to Budget 2000. Any expenditure will be met within the existing spending totals.

 Responses to several hon. Members have been given since 1 October 1998 on matters relating to the restricted access to closed census returns in England and Wales, only two of which were in response to inquiries referring specifically to censuses for the period since 1911. In each case the response given set out the Government's view that, whilst they recognise the sociological value of historical census records, it considers that the strict confidentiality assurances given about present and future censuses would be seriously compromised if it were seen to be departing from the assurances given about censuses in the past.

 <i>[holding answer 14 April 1999]:</i> In my written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) on 15 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>486-88</i>, I updated the House about progress that the Benefits and Contributions Agencies had made in addressing outstanding issues relating to the introduction of the new National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2).
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para3">From 1 April, when the Contributions Agency transferred to the Inland Revenue, joint arrangements have been in place to manage the NIRS2 programme. The Stabilisation and Recovery plans for 1999-2000, which include plans for reviewing the backlogs in the Benefits Agency, are currently being finalised.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para4">Good progress has been made over the last month and I am pleased to announce that arrangements are in hand to pay compensation at a flat rate of &#163;10 to claimants who have suffered an unreasonable delay as announced on 1 February 1999.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para5">Payments to Pensioners and Widows will be issued automatically at the end of April. Claimants who are in receipt of Incapacity Benefit and those Widows and Pensioners whose claims are handled clerically will be paid their &#163;10 when their case is reviewed and compensation under the normal rules will also be considered. Claimants will not need to make a claim for this payment.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para6">I am also pleased to announce that the Benefits Agency will begin to review the backlog of initial and emergency awards of benefit this week. Where a claimant has been underpaid, any arrears of benefit due will be paid and, if entitlement to compensation under the Department Special Payments scheme exceeds the &#163;10 already paid, cases will be identified. These payments of compensation will be handled centrally. Additional staff have been allocated to this task and the standard process has been streamlined to ensure payments of compensation are issued as quickly as possible following the review of benefit.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para7">It is planned that he Benefits Agency's review of cases will be completed in six months.
<P>

<a name="90421w15.htm_para8">It is expected that from the end of April information from NIRS2 will be used to process Retirement Pension forecast applications. This is the final benefit process to migrate from the NIRS1 to the NIRS2 system.

<a name="90421w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We are committed to alleviating fuel poverty amongst the elderly of this country, and to enabling all pensioners to share in its increasing prosperity. To help meet these objectives we have increased the Winter Fuel Payment fivefold for eligible pensioner households. It is also why, for this coming winter, we will make all payments before Christmas.
<P>

<a name="90421w16.htm_para0">Paying the Winter Fuel Payment through the same vehicle as Retirement Pension would not be straightforward. This is because they are designed to serve different purposes. The Winter Fuel Payment is intended to help each eligible household with the cost of its fuel bills. In order to do so, it takes into account household composition to provide an overall payment of &#163;100 to each eligible household, rather than each individual pensioner within it. Retirement Pension is designed to provide each individual pensioner with regular income. In order to do this, payments are based only on individual entitlements, regardless of household circumstances.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what action he takes on receipt of a complaint against a member of the judiciary; and if he will make a statement.  [81222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w19.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor takes complaints about members of the judiciary very seriously. In order to maintain the independence of the judiciary, judges are not accountable to the Lord Chancellor for their judicial decisions. The appropriate recourse against judicial decisions lies in the appeal or review process in the courts. However, when complaints are made about the personal conduct of a judge, the Lord Chancellor instructs officials to make inquiries on his behalf. These inquiries generally include drawing the matter to the attention of the judge concerned and giving him or her an opportunity to comment. Where necessary, the Lord Chancellor will also call for transcripts or other additional information. The judge's comments are considered by the Lord Chancellor and, if appropriate, are used by him to inform a reply to the complainant, and a copy is sent to the judge. Each complaint is dealt with individually.
<P>

<a name="90421w19.htm_para1">The Lord Chancellor's statutory powers are limited to the dismissal of judicial office holders, below the level of the High Court Bench, on the grounds of misbehaviour and incapacity and these are accordingly exercisable only in extreme cases. But the Lord Chancellor, as Head of the Judiciary, is able to guide, counsel, advise, or rebuke with a view to ensuring that judges uphold the standard of conduct which the public expect of them.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department how many complaints he has received about the behaviour of members of the judiciary in each of the last three years; how many have been upheld; and if he will make a statement.  [81246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90421w19.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The principle of judicial independence, which is central to our constitutional arrangements, means that it is not open to the Lord Chancellor or his Department to consider complaints about judicial decisions made by judges within their own independent sphere. The Lord Chancellor does, however, consider complaints about the personal conduct of members of the judiciary. In the period between August 1998 (when new internal arrangements for handling such complaints came into force) and March 1999, the Lord Chancellor received a total of 2,109 complaints about members of the judiciary, the majority of which related to judicial decisions. Of 



<P>
<P><I>21 Apr 1999 : Column: 604</I><P>
the remainder, 183 were taken forward for investigation as they related to personal conduct. To date, 26 of these cases are outstanding. Out of the 157 completed cases, there were five occasions when the Lord chancellor saw fit to take further action, either by writing to the judge or by arranging for him or her to be seen by officials. Comparable figures for the period before August 1998 are unavailable.

<a name="90421w19.htm_para3">The Government have no plans to exclude from legal aid people pursuing actions in England and Wales solely because they live outside this country. The Access to Justice Bill will, however, enable the Government to target available public money on priority needs. Because most sound claims for personal injury can be funded privately, using conditional fee agreements, generally legal aid will not, in future, be available to fund them.
