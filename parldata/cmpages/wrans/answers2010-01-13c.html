 DEFRA has not carried out any formal research on the potential for mob-grazing (an extra intensive version of rotational grazing) to permanently sequester carbon in soil. However, an initial assessment from a UK perspective suggests that mob-grazing has limited potential to increase soil carbon and may increase soil compaction and erosion, resulting in a subsequent loss of soil quality and soil carbon. As a result of the density of livestock, mob-grazing practices would also be likely to lead to nutrient 'hotspots' which could lead to increased nitrous oxide emissions (a more powerful greenhouse gas) or increased nitrate leaching into water courses.</p>

 Disposal of fallen stock by means of anaerobic digestion is not permitted under the EU Animal By-products Regulation 1774/2002. This is because of the animal and public health risk associated with such disposal. There is therefore no point at this stage in carrying out such an environmental or economic assessment. However, we are aware that there is ongoing research into the possibility of using anaerobic digestions as a pre-treatment and method of temporary storage of fallen stock prior to disposal by rendering or incineration.

SUDS can significantly reduce localised flash-flooding, reduce flooding downstream and slow down the rate at which areas begin to flood. They can also improve water quality. The Bill proposes to amend the automatic right to connect the surface water drainage systems of any new developments to the sewerage system, making it conditional on SUDS National Standards having been applied. For back gardens, local authorities already have powers to prevent the laying of impermeable surfaces where it poses a local problem, via Article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995.</p>

The Environment Agency and Severn Trent are currently co-operating on planning schemes at Alcester, Broom and Pershore in the West Midlands.

 Generally, rolling stock is not procured for particular routes unless there are special reasons, usually technical or operational, for doing so, and therefore it is not possible to identify additional trains provided specifically for services between Halifax and Leeds.

 North Korea has one of the worst human rights records in the world. Although North Korea denies access to human rights organisations, including the UN, information from a variety of sources, much of it from North Korean defectors, paints a picture of serious and widespread abuse, namely:</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how much funding his Department has made available to tackle antisocial behaviour in Coventry in each year since 1997; [309607]</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_5"><a name="10011367000462">(2) what recent discussions his Department has had with the Coventry Community Safety Partnership on the effectiveness of measures to reduce the incidence of antisocial behaviour in Coventry. [309608]</p>

 As with all other crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), Coventry was allocated £25,000 a year from 2003-04 as a contribution towards funding an ASB co-ordinator post. In 2005-06, in England the antisocial co-ordinators grant was pooled within the safer and stronger communities fund. This pooled budget supports the delivery of outcomes and indicators relating to antisocial behaviour in local area agreements (LAAs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="100113w0004.htm_para9"><a name="10011367000464">Other budgets also contribute towards the wider cross-Government strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour. The Government are committed to diverting young people from crime and antisocial behaviour as demonstrated by our investment of around £2 billion on prevention, including activity such as sure start children's centres, parenting support and positive activities. Last year we launched the Youth Crime Action Plan, a cross-government programme of action to tackle youth crime and antisocial behaviour and reduce re-offending. It set out a triple track approach of enforcement where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge to children and families where it is needed and better and earlier prevention. This builds on major progress we have made in the last decade in tackling youth offending. Backed by £100 million of new investment it has led to significant action over the past year and a half, which has made a real difference to young people, families and communities. The number of young people entering the criminal justice system for the first time is falling. The number in England fell from 94,481 in 2007-08 to 74,033 in 2008-09-a 21.6 per cent. decrease.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence is continually looking at ways of monitoring and mitigating the risk in operational areas, including the development of improved hearing protection which does not hamper the operational effectiveness of combat personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="100113w0008.htm_para2"><a name="10011367001006">The Surgeon General (SG) has set up a multi-disciplinary Defence Hearing Working Group (DHWG) to address the impact of current operations on the incidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in serving personnel, set in the wider context of the Health and Safety-led MOD Hearing Conservation Programme, changing legislation and emerging technology. Compared with civilians who may suffer hearing loss due to industrial noise exposure, the relationship between troops' exposure to noise on military operations and hearing impairment is a complex one. Since January 2009, MOD has been working with the charity Deafness Research UK to develop a number of lines of research that will not only provide a more robust means of diagnosis but will also ensure that personnel have the most effective possible protection from hearing loss. Deafness Research UK hosted a highly successful symposium in December 2009, bringing together experts from the field of hearing impairment with members of the Defence Hearing Working Group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="100113w0008.htm_para3"><a name="10011367001007">Regarding protective systems, on the present deployment in Afghanistan, some 3,000 sets of an improved hearing protection system known as personalised interfaced hearing protection (PIHP) are in use by front-line troops. This innovative system has been designed to protect against impulse and continuous noise, to be comfortable to wear for prolonged periods, to be compatible with personal radios, not to interfere with equipment designed to counter improvised explosive devices, and to allow the user to keep situational awareness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="100113w0008.htm_para4"><a name="10011367001008">Data held centrally does not allow a comprehensive summary of how many Service personnel are recorded as having experienced hearing loss as a consequence of their duty in each year since 1990. The DHWG work now in progress includes improved data capture to allow the effects of current operations on the hearing of personnel to be assessed op a proper basis. However, patients who have attended or been admitted to our field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan within the 'ear/nose/ throat' (ENT) medical classification can be identified. These data are shown in Table 1 and include UK Service personnel, other NATO forces, civilians (both UK and nationals) and detainees. Note that this information is not limited to those with complaints related to hearing damage, but includes all ENT patients.</p>

During the first flight itself, a number of minor anomalies were found which were successfully managed by the flight test crew. The relevant details have been made available to Partner Nations in confidence. As is demonstrated by the three and three quarter hour flight, which is at the upper end of the planned maximum duration, none of these anomalies were considered significant or in any way compromised aircraft safety. A successful second flight was undertaken on 23 December 2009 with a third flight undertaken on 7 January 2010.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is extremely concerned by the introduction of this Bill and is working closely with the Foreign Office and with European Union (EU) colleagues on this issue. The UK Government have made clear our concerns in representations to Ugandan Ministers, including by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to President Museveni and my noble Friend Baroness Kinnock to Foreign Minister Kutesa, at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The UK High Commissioner in Kampala has also lobbied the Prime Minister and other Ugandan Ministers on the issue. Sweden, as local EU presidency in Uganda, led an EU démarche to the Ugandan Foreign Ministry in December 2009. The Head of DFID Uganda has raised the issue with Uganda's Minister of Finance and senior officials.</p>

 Information on dental practices taking on new patients for national health service treatment is available nationally from NHS Direct and NHS Choices. Anyone having difficulty in finding an NHS dentist should contact their primary care trust (PCT). All PCTs provide helplines. New services are opening all the time as PCTs work towards providing access for all who want it by, at the latest, March 2011.

 Improving stroke care is a national priority for the national health service and is a tier one vital sign in the NHS Operating Framework. Data collected on primary care trusts performance against the vital sign show improvements in the delivery of patient care for stroke patients. Now almost 60 per cent. of people spend 90 per cent. of their time in a stroke unit; a marked improvement since publication of the National Stroke Strategy. The most recent Royal College of Physicians' "National Sentinel Stroke Audit" conducted in 2008 shows a consistent improvement in performance across nine key indicators; for example there are increasing numbers of hospitals with acute stroke beds with 96 per cent. of hospitals in England now offering specialist acute stroke care.</p>

Evaluation of the first part of the ACT F.A.S.T campaign has shown this to be one of the most effective public awareness campaigns having reached 82 per cent. of the population. The campaign has led to an increase of 55 per cent. in stroke-related 999 calls.</p>

 Scientific publications on the subject, for example, Kiehl and Trenberth (1997, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) report that carbon dioxide contributes around 27 per cent. to the globally averaged greenhouse gas effect, water vapour around 60 per cent., and methane about 3 per cent. The amount of water vapour present, and hence its contribution to the greenhouse gas effect, depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. It therefore acts to amplify the contribution of the other greenhouse gases.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 January 2010]:</i> This Government are committed to addressing global climate change and securing the UK's energy supply and has determined that new nuclear has a role to play in the UK's future energy mix. Government's policy is that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies to fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations and that Government will take active steps to make the conditions right for investment and enable new nuclear to come on line as soon as possible.. These actions are set out in the Nuclear White Paper ('A White Paper on Nuclear Power', pp134, section 3.4-3.6) and the current status is at:</p>

 Any estimates of total life cycle emissions of power stations necessarily contain a high degree of uncertainty and outcomes will depend strongly on market factors such as energy prices, electricity demand profiles and plant life times. With the exception of nuclear power the department has not produced any of the requested estimates. With respect to per unit life cycle emissions, the 2008 White Paper on nuclear power estimated that the life-cycle emissions from nuclear power were in the range of 7-22gCO2/kWh of electricity generated. The white paper references two papers which have produced estimates of life cycle emissions per kWh. Nuclear Energy and the Kyoto Protocol (2002) OECD Nuclear Energy Agency; Assessing the difference: Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Electricity Generation Chains (2000) IAEA Bulletin.
