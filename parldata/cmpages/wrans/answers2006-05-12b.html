Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration

65905)</p></ul><a name="06051266002718"><ul><p class="tabletext">Firstly, please
allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your
questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are
most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is
not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and
ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by
different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General
Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern
Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for
Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on
total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and
separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and
including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables
us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the
data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from
Denbighshire to collate the necessary
data.</p></ul><a name="06051266002719"><ul><p class="tabletext">Historical UK Electorate
by LA</p></ul><a name="06051266002720"><ul><p class="tabletext">Electoral data
are available on the number of people registered to vote in
Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to
vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only
available on a &#147;usual residence&#148; basis: the mid-year
population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the
mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is
possible to calculate an estimate of the &#145;registration
rate&#146; using &#147;the percentage of the usually resident
population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&#148; as
either Parliamentary or local/European
electors).</p></ul><a name="06051266002721"><ul><p class="tabletext">It is not
possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order
to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold
data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce
such a
&#145;split&#146;.</p></ul><a name="06051266002722"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information,
for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual &#145;usual
resident&#146; mid-year population; (ii) the size of the (a)
Parliamentary electorate and (b) local/European electorate; and (iii)
the percentage of the &#147;estimated usually resident
population&#148; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as (a)
Parliamentary electors and (b) local/European electors. These are
labelled as &#145;registration rates&#146; on the tables and this
term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the
closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is

<br><notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2006 : Column 488W</b><br>not possible to calculate the percentage of the
eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population
aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to
vote.</p></ul><a name="06051266002723"><ul><p class="tabletext">This
&#145;registration rate&#146; is not a published National
Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be
taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken
when considering local authorities where the usually resident
population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An
example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large
number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and
dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible
to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates
as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated
&#145;registration rate&#146; calculated for Forest Heath is
considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting
age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate
'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined
above.</p></ul><a name="06051266002724"><ul><p class="tabletext">The attached
tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and
annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest
available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in
the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate
(where available) and against local/European electorate. The
availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as
this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year
to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England
and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years.
For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years
prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual
paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For
Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available
shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when
they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary
electors by LA are not currently
available.</p></ul><a name="06051266002725"><ul><p class="tabletext">In order to
give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, 30
June, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral
data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population
estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to
calculate these weighted
comparisons.</p></ul><a name="06051266002726"><ul><p class="tabletext">Attainers
have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible
comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published
elsewhere.</p></ul><a name="06051266002727"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have
also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or
updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data
provide the best possible
comparison.</p></ul><a name="06051266002728"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary
electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are
included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the
local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties
remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is
usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of
the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people
who have more than one address may register in more than one place
(e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These
factors may have a differential impact from place to
place.</p></ul><a name="06051266002729"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is also
inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both
parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers
vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they
have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main
reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per
cent.</p></ul><a name="06051266002730"><ul><p class="tabletext">In order to aid
comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated
&#145;registration rates&#146; for all ten years. Table A shows
these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European
electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be
made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU
expansion) can change the size of the
electorate.</p></ul><a name="06051266002731"><ul><p class="tabletext">A copy of
the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2006 : Column 489W</b><br><a name="06051266002732"><ul><p class="tabletext">The tables provide as

establishment of DCS as an Agency on 1 November 2004 marked an
increased focus on understanding the needs of its customers through
early and proactive consultation with customer representative
organisations. As changes have been made to some of the Disability
Living Allowance (DLA) claim forms over the last year, DCS has
undertaken specific consultation activity with the DCS Advisory Forum
and where appropriate the wider lobby. The DCS Advisory Forum is the
Disability and Carers Service's (DCS) main mechanism for consulting
with the Voluntary and Community Sector. The forum was originally
established in 1998 to provide advice and guidance to officials of DCS
and the Department on the impact of change initiatives on disabled
customers.</p></ul><a name="06051266002765"><ul><p class="tabletext">We are

provided.</p></ul><a name="06051266002766"><ul><p class="tabletext">In July
2005, we consulted with the DCS Advisory Forum on the proposed DLA
Adult Claim form to be used within the Customer Case Management (CCM)
test taking place at Manchester and Bootle Disability Benefit Centres
(DBCs). At special events in July and September 2005, we also consulted
with a high number of local voluntary and community organisations
within the Manchester and Bootle DBC catchment
areas.</p></ul><a name="06051266002767"><ul><p class="tabletext">In January

this consultation activity, a number of suggestions were submitted,
many of which we have been able to incorporate. This has led to
improvements being made to the form which will make it easier for
customers to understand and answer the questions; provides customers
with the option to describe the help they need and the difficulties
they have at the end of each question; the layout, format and wording
have also been improved and makes the form visibly clearer and easy to
read.</p></ul><a name="06051266002769"><ul><p class="tabletext">When a

the provision for customers to make e-claims via the internet for a
range of DWP benefits was introduced, including DLA and AA. DCS took
the lead on consulting on behalf of the Department with Interactive
Demonstration and Preview events of the DWP e-Services taking place in
Manchester and Birmingham in November 2005. These events provided
customer representative groups with early sight of the DLA, Attendance
Allowance, State Pension UK, Jobcentre Plus, and Child Support
maintenance application e-forms. The DCS Advisory Forum, Jobcentre Plus
Key Stakeholders and the Pension Service Partnerships Against Poverty
Group were invited to attend these events, with representation from
wider customer representative organisations also attending on the day.
As a result of the comments received at these events, improvements to
the DLA e-claim form are to be made. Steps are now being taken to
include the provision for customer representatives to include their
details, an option to provide Textphone details and increasing the size
of text boxes.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2006 : Column 503W</b><br><a name="06051266002771"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our consultation approach via

Levitt:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on his Department's
progress in fulfilling its statutory obligation as a public body of
promoting the rights of disabled people.
[66008]</p><p><a name="06051266000633"><b><a name="06051266002870">Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new
duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people,
'the Disability Equality Duty'. This Department (DWP) has taken the
following steps to meet the Disability Equality Duty:</p><p><a name="06051266000634">DWP is host to the Office for
Disability Issues (ODI), which was launched on 1 December 2005 to take
forward the Government's strategy for improving the life chances of
disabled people. One element of this work will be to overset the
effective implementation of the Disability Equality Duty. The ODI is
working in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission to support
and encourage Departments to commit to meaningful actions that will
improve their policies and services and realise the potential of their
diverse workforces.</p><p><a name="06051266000635">The Department is already
working towards the publication of its disability equality schemes
by 4 December 2006. The process was formally launched in
April 2006 and will mean both central units and agencies involving
disabled people in developing action plans for tackling problem areas
and identifying positive actions to address these. We have also already
begun planning for the Secretary of State's report due in
2008.</p><p><a name="06051266000636">DWP is
currently revising its existing guidance on accessible communications
with a view to introducing a new standard for information
accessibility. This set of standards will form part of the disability
equality scheme referred to earlier.</p><p><a name="06051266000637">We have commissioned public
access audits of all its premises used by the public during 2003. A
total of 1,735 buildings were surveyed, and a programme of public
access improvement works commissioned on 1,032 sites which are
scheduled for completion in June 2006. The existing public access
provisions are subject to annual review and any future additional
requirement is built into the annual maintenance work programmes.
</p><p><a name="06051266000638">The Department wants
staff to understand and embrace diversity and an important part of
achieving this has been the development of a diversity toolkit which
makes all our diversity and equality policy and information easily
accessible in one place on an internal website. The toolkit also is now
being used by around 70 other organisations.</p><p><a name="06051266000639">The Department is keen to
ensure we meet the workplace needs of disabled staff and potential
staff and recently DWP has run two pilot exercises on a 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>11 May 2006 : Column 504W</b><br>revised process for delivering reasonable workplace
adjustments for staff. The development of the new process was partly in
response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable
adjustments into place, and partly to ensure that the recommended
adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. A third pilot is
due to start shortly. This will be followed by a formal evaluation
exercise. On completion of the first two pilots, and subject to the
evaluation, we will commence planning for national implementation
across the Department and agencies.</p><p><a name="06051266000640">DWP encourages all business
units to consider the potential impact of policy and services on all
equality groups, ahead of future legislation. For example, at least
three impact assessments have been completed to date by the Disability
and Carers Service, taking into account disability, with a number of
additional assessments in the process of being completed.</p><p><a name="06051266000641">The Department has been working
in partnership with the Employers' Forum on Disability in order to
address the needs of its disabled customers. In particular, it has
contributed, along with other public and private organisations, to the
interactive "Disability Confident" training resource pack which uses
both video and DVD format. This addresses the key principles of dealing
with disabled people in general, and particularly communications issues
relating to those with specific impairments. This earned a special
commendation in the prestigious 'World of Learning Awards'.</p><p><a name="06051266000642">Both the Minister for Disabled
People and senior officials participate in an annual series of meetings
with disabled customers and those with disability interests to explain
current and planned policy, and to gain a better knowledge of people's
views and concerns.</p><p><a name="06051266000643">DWP consults
with staff on disability issues through a National Disability Staff
Network Group. The Department has recently reviewed all of the staff
network groups with the intention of raising their profile and enabling
them to contribute to successful diversity outcomes for the Department.
Representatives from all of the groups have met with the recently
appointed Permanent Secretary twice and he has committed to meet with
them on a quarterly basis.</p><p><a name="06051266000644">DWP also analyses, and acts
upon, staff perceptions on diversity issues in the annual staff
attitude survey; and meets regularly with trade unions side to consider
disability along with other diversity issues. In addition, staff can
raise diversity issues at regular staff forum events held around the
country and via a site on the DWP intranet.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051266000038">Incapacity

up an increasing proportion of the overall caseload accounting for
almost 40 per cent. of the total caseload, compared with 25 per cent.
in the mid 1990s; although growth in the proportion of the caseload
with mental and behavioural disorders has been slowing in recent
quarters. This is both because they make up an increasing proportion of
inflows and because they have lower off-flow rates than other groups.
It follows that, people with mental health conditions are, on average,
much more likely to become long-term
claimants.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051266000039">Pension

Coaker:</b> Information on the Assets Recovery Agency's
progress on completed cases and the value of realised receipts is shown
in Tables 1 and 2. It is not possible to break down the Agency's
figures further by region. The Agency is currently finalising its
Annual Report 2005-06 which will set out progress in meeting its
targets. The Report will be sent to my right hon. Friend the Home
Secretary who will lay it before Parliament. Information on the current
performance of police forces, including Regional Asset Recovery Teams,
in obtaining orders for the recovery of criminal assets is set out in
Table 3. The regional teams are not part of the Assets Recovery Agency;
they are funded separately by the Home
Office.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i>Assets

2005.</p><p><a name="06051266001005">This resulted in
6,128 reports being made to law enforcement agencies and other national
hotlines around the world. The report also highlights the fact that
only 0.4 per cent. of potentially illegal child abuse content
identified by the IWF in 2005 was hosted in the UK. This represents a
major improvement from 18 per cent. in 1997, and demonstrates the
commitment of the IWF, the UK industry, and others, to work
collaboratively to remove potentially illegal child abuse content
wherever in the world it originates. The IWF report that there were no
instances of either criminally obscene content or criminally racist
content hosted in the UK during
2005.</p><p><a name="06051266001006">The Government
also pay tribute to the IWF for supplying a list of websites to ISPs,
mobile operators, search providers and filtering companies so they can
play their part in protecting UK internet users from being
inadvertently exposed to potentially illegal child abuse content by
various blocking techniques. The fact that the IWF's core funders have
grown in number to over 60 is evidence of their strengthening
reputation. The IWF is seen as a highly successful model of cooperation

Coaker:</b> We consider that the Sexual Offences Act 2003,
with its emphasis on consent freely entered into, is sufficient to
prosecute men who knowingly have sex with women against their will,
including women who have been illegally trafficked. The Act provides at
section 74 that</p><a name="06051266002775"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a person
consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to
make that
choice&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051266001135">If the
trafficked woman is engaging in prostitution under duress then we find
it difficult to see how she would be considered to be freely
consenting. There are also evidential assumptions at section 75 of the
Act which, if proven, will mean that the complainant is taken not to
have consented and these include the use and threat of violence and
unlawful detention of the victim. Furthermore, creating a further
offence of paying for sex with a trafficked woman may give the
appearance that it is a lesser offence than rape; it is
not.</p><p><a name="06051266001136">If the woman does
not freely consent to sex and if the defendant does not reasonably
believe that she consents, then regardless of her occupation, it is

Under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 it is a criminal offence to
publish any article which is considered to be &#145;obscene&#146;:

which the activity can be clearly seen and is not hidden, disguised or

concern. Following the flawed Presidential elections on 19 March the
Belarusian regime has moved to crack-down on the opposition and to
stifle any dissent. Demonstrations have been broken up and the main
opposition leaders and their key supporters have been arrested or
detained. The independent press remains muzzled or has been driven
underground. Non-governmental organisations are subject to harassment
and their funding severely curtailed. The attack on Mikola Kalinin, an
activist on Roma rights, is an example of the atmosphere of
intimidation that exists for those seeking to support the fundamental
freedom and right of civil society to express its
concerns.</p><p><a name="06051266001260">We deplore
this situation and the unjustified actions taken to prevent
demonstrators, human rights campaigners and opposition leaders from
exercising their right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.

those arrested for taking part in demonstrations and of those political
prisoners arrested before the election. My right hon. Friend the then

Healthcare. Fully funded NHS Continuing Healthcare will continue to be

not changed there is no reason to expect them to lose their entitlement

the NHS implemented major reforms to dentistry to build upon this
success. New contracts for dentists have abolished the traditional fee
per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a
greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental

significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a

patients.</p><p><a name="06051266002569">Dentists'

the CE mark indicating conformity to the directive.</p><p><a name="06051266002621">Before applying the CE mark the
manufacturer must ensure that all risks are removed or minimised and
any residual risks constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the
benefit to the user and are compatible with a high level of protection
of safety. If it is not possible to reduce these risks by means of

However, the regulation of the sale of medical devices available on the

Burnham</b><i>[holding answer 24 April 2006]: </i>As part of
the programme of work set out in &#147;Health Reform in England:
update and next steps&#148; (December 2005), the Department is
developing a new system of commissioning health services, which will
operate as a partnership between general practitioner (GP) practices,
primary care trusts (PCTs) and local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06051266002686">The
commissioning policy framework will be published in the summer of 2006.
This work is being led by the Department&#146;s Policy and Strategy
Directorate, with the support and advice of an external reference group
drawn from a wide range of stakeholder and partner
organisations.</p><p><a name="06051266002687">PCTs
are responsible for commissioning the choices offered at referral in
consultation with patient groups. The Isle of Wight PCT has
commissioned services from seven providers, four of which can be
reached within approximately one hour 30 minutes travelling time. Some
patients will need assistance with travel to hospital. PCTs are
responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services
(which could include patient transport services) to such extent as they
consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. It is,
therefore, for the local NHS to decide who provides patient transport
services for eligible patients in their area. In addition, patients on
a low income may be entitled to reimbursement of their travel costs
under the hospital travel cost scheme. This applies to any of the
hospitals on their PCT&#146;s choice menu.</p><p><a name="06051266002688">&#147;Our Health, Our Care,

sections, sections 72A and 72B, into the Medicines Act 1969 in relation
to the responsible pharmacist. The Government believe that the general
rule should be one responsible pharmacist, one pharmacy, if the
responsible pharmacist is to discharge his or her responsibilities for
the safe and effective running of the pharmacy. For the vast majority
of pharmacies, we expect each to have its own responsible pharmacist.
However, we also believe that there should be provision to consider any
exception to this rule, where circumstances justify such an exception.
Section 72A(2) provides for a pharmacist to be responsible for more
than one pharmacy at any one time only in circumstances to be specified
in regulations and where there is compliance with certain conditions
set out in the regulations. Our intention is to consult, in due course,
with all interested parties on what these circumstances and conditions
might be.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051266000135">Queen Mary's
