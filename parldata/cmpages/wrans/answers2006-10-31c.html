With respect to the Golden Triangle, I refer the right hon. Member to the reply I gave him today (UIN 96353).

 The Department for International Development envisages capacity building support to the African Union (AU) in two main areas over the next 12 months: assistance to the African Union Commission (AUC) to build its own institutional capacity; and support for specific programmes with which the African Union is involved.</p>

DFID is also considering support to help build the capacity of other African Union institutions, including the Pan-African Parliament.</p>

The Land Policy Initiative will be jointly managed by the AU, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA). This initiative aims to build consensus for land reform among AU member states and Regional Economic Communities and to establish a framework for common actions, partnerships and peer learning. The Climate Information for Development Needs in Africa programme (ClimDev Africa) will be led by the AU and jointly implemented by AfDB and ECA. It aims to strengthen the capacity of AU member states to obtain and use information on climate variability and change for development, eg by identifying services to help reduce rural poverty in semi-arid zones.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 October 2006]:</i> The Department received representations from the Confederation of British Industry, Association of British Insurers and Institute of Directors in response to the Government&#146;s consultation on the directors&#146; annual Business Review at the beginning of this year. The CBI and IOD did not support the introduction into the review of any additional reporting requirements from the former statutory Operating and Financial Review (schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985), but made no particular comments about contractual and other relationships. The ABI thought that companies should in any case be reporting the matters included in the previous legislation to the extent relevant for an understanding of the company and its capacity to succeed in the creation of shareholder value. The more pressing concern that these organisations raised was in relation to liability in respect of reporting and I subsequently introduced amendments to the Companies Bill to clarify the liability regime. We also received a recent representation from the IOD expressing concern about the timing, intent and effect of the Government&#146;s amendment to the Business Review. As I made clear at Report, it remains for the directors&#146; judgment to decide  <br>

 The Energy Saving Trust (EST) is funded by Government to encourage and promote, through partnership, the sustainable and efficient use of energy. Defra is providing EST with around &#163;28 million funding in 2006-07 to help support its work of promoting energy efficiency through advertising programmes, advice centres and the endorsement of energy saving products.

The overall campaign theme is &#147;Commit to Save Your 20%&#148;, and Energy Saving Week contributes to this by promoting the idea that ordinary actions make extraordinary things happen. The EST are aiming to highlight that through everyday, &#147;normal&#148; actions, consumers are able to make an enormous difference&#151;both to help the environment and save themselves money.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 October 2006]:</i> The Carbon Trust administers the Enhanced Capital Allowance (ECA) scheme for energy-saving plant and machinery and considers the technical merits of further technology classes for inclusion in the scheme. I understand that the trust has carefully considered an application for the inclusion of thermal mass and night time ventilation technologies. On the details provided to the Carbon Trust it appears that rather than comprising plant and machinery covered by the scheme, the primary components of these technologies are flooring and roofing. However, some equipment which is occasionally used with thermal mass or night time ventilation installation is included in the ECA scheme and can already qualify for the accelerated allowances.</p>

 The Government are committed to using all suitable policy instruments to remove the least efficient products from UK markets. Our current assessment is that, by removing ordinary incandescent light bulbs (GLS bulbs) from the UK market and encouraging sales of the most efficient alternatives, we could avoid approximately one million tonnes of carbon emissions per year by 2020.</p>

However, the Government are pressing the European Commission to make light bulbs a priority for regulatory action under the recently agreed Eco-Design for Energy Using Products (EUP) framework directive. We are also discussing with retailers and manufacturers how we can remove inefficient lighting products from UK shelves in advance of regulations.</p>

 Defra and the Environment Agency are working closely to mitigate any impacts from the recently announced reductions to the Agency&#146;s budget. These will be in the order of &#163;14.9 million from the flood risk management budget, and are focused on resource and not capital spend. Following these changes the Agency&#146;s flood risk management budget for 2006-07 is still 35 per cent. higher in real terms than in 1996-97.</p>

 Higher Education Institutions and student unions operate money advice services. Most institutions provide a range of student services for their students, and specifically for those students from poorer backgrounds who need particular help, including advice on managing their finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="61031w0006.htm_para8"><a name="06103178001519">Advice and support on money and debt management is also offered by a wide range of other organisations. For example, as part of the Financial Services Authority&#146;s financial capability initiative, Roehampton university have piloted their money doctors scheme, helping students to become financially competent, to confront debt and take control of their own finances; and 18 other institutions will be developing the piloted approaches. UNIAID provide tools, including a new student calculator, to develop budgeting skills and increase understanding of finance. Graduates have access to the same debt advisory services as other adults including citizens advice  <br>

The Government are providing more in upfront loan and grant support than ever before, particularly for low income students. Full-time eligible students are now entitled to maintenance grants of up to &#163;2,700, with HE institutions also providing bursaries of typically &#163;1,000.

 Since zebra mussels were first found on the hull of a boat in Kinnegoe Marina on 21 November 2005 further investigation has shown that very young zebra mussels are present at several points around the Lough.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority has conducted several reviews over the years which have included reviews of the safety data relating to category one and category two licensed aerodromes. Most recent were a review by the Light Aviation Airports Study Group and the Regulatory Review of General Aviation in the UK. The reports of these reviews were published in January 2006 and July 2006 and copies are available on the CAA website.</p>

 European agreements governing the application of VAT reliefs mean that while the UK can retain its existing VAT zero rates, such as those for approved works of alteration to certain listed buildings, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. It is therefore not possible to zero-rate alteration or repair work carried out to unlisted church buildings. Furthermore, the same agreements do not allow for the application of reduced rates in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="61031w0014.htm_para8"><a name="06110154001337">The Government recognise that listed places of worship are not just an essential part of our religious life but an important part of the history and fabric of our country, and that the need to use specialist craftsmen and costly materials means their upkeep can be a heavy burden, particularly on small congregations. That is why the Government have pressed the case at EU level for their repair and maintenance to be added to the supplies for which a reduced rate of VAT is available. However, while we recognise the importance of all places of worship within their communities, we also recognise that listed status means that the special architectural or historic interest in the church in question has been acknowledged and as such special tax treatment is justified on this basis.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 October 2006]</i>: Other than properties which are vacant pending families moving in, for work to be done or for administrative purposes, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) does not retain unused dwellings. The MOD sold the vast majority of service family accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales to Annington Homes Limited (AHL) in November 1996, with the arrangement that the Department would lease-back from them the accommodation we needed to house service families. When properties are no longer required, they are returned to AHL for them to dispose of as they see fit.</p>

 4. Figures are for trained Infantry Officers and Soldiers and include Infantry Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) personnel serving<br>

 Reliability and safety problems with the previous Mine Protected Vehicle (MPV), Mamba, led the Department to consider refurbishment and modification of Mamba or its replacement. Replacement through a competitive Urgent Operational Requirement was chosen as the best option with bids assessed against the user&#146;s requirements of survivability (predominantly against mines), mobility, fightability and supportability. In November 2001 the bid from Supacat of the Tempest vehicle, based on an early version of the Force Protection Inc Cougar, was selected. Tempest was the name of the vehicle not the programme, but it is no longer used and the vehicle is now known in UK service simply as the MPV.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2006]:</i> The introduction of the operational bonus will have no impact on the payment of X factor in 2006-07. The value of X factor will remain at 13 per cent. of basic pay for regular service personnel up to the rank of lieutenant colonel and equivalent at the mid pay point, beyond which it tapers. X factor is regularly reviewed by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The next review is due in 2007-08. My Department will therefore be submitting a paper of evidence on X factor to the AFPRB in 2007 to inform the body&#146;s deliberations for its 2008 report.</p>

 The Department&#146;s independent committee on carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment (COC) recently considered the potential association between certain environmental organochlorine insecticides and breast cancer. A statement was finalised in September 2004 and is available at www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/ocibc04.htm After a full consideration of all the large amount of information COC concluded that there is no convincing evidence for an association with organochlorine insecticides. The committee was aware that none of the organochlorine insecticides included in this review are approved for use in pesticide formulations in the United Kingdom but persist in the environment and exposure of the population has occurred mainly via the diet.</p>

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has policy responsibility for the new food hygiene regulation that came into effect on 1 January 2006, replacing and simplifying previous legislation. Enforcement of the legislation is largely through local authorities (LAs) that are provided with funds for this purpose as part of their revenue support grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para1"><a name="06110154001798">The board of the FSA discussed implementation of the regulation at its open meeting in March 2005 and agreed a package of additional measures to assist the food industry, focused on small businesses. Details of this discussion are available in a paper that has previously been placed in the Library of the House, and can be also found on the FSA website at: www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fsa050302.pdf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para2"><a name="06110154001799">The main change for food businesses resulting from the new legislation is the requirement to have documented food safety management procedures in place that assure good hygiene standards so as to protect consumers. It is for businesses to make arrangements to comply with the new legislation and most larger businesses already had effective systems in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para3"><a name="06110154001800">In England, a support programme called &#147;Safer Food Better Business&#148; has been launched to help small catering and retail businesses. &#163;11.5 million has been allocated to this programme over three years starting in September 2005. The main elements of the programme are free guidance packs for businesses along with a special grants scheme that supports LAs to provide training and advice. Up to October 2006, 175,000 packs have been distributed free of charge to businesses and 86 projects involving 254 LAs, some two-thirds of the total number have been funded, directly supporting over 52,000 small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para4"><a name="06110154001801">Grants were awarded to projects run by LAs following appraisals of applications. Appraisals were carried out by the FSA assisted by stakeholders, including the British Hospitality Association (BHA), the Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and an independent academic expert. Not all applications were successful. Between September 2005 and October 2006 just over &#163;3.5 million had actually been spent. All figures exclude value added tax (VAT).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para5"><a name="06110154001802">Similar schemes to support businesses are in place in other countries in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_555"><a name="61031w0019.htm_para7"><a name="06110154001804">In addition, the new regulation applies to farmers and growers, in many cases for the first time. In England, the FSA has allocated &#163;1.2 million excluding VAT in 2006-07 to train local authority officers to undertake this new work and to directly support inspections. This funding is likely to remain in place until arrangements have been made to provide funding through the revenue support grant from 2008-09. Plans to deliver this activity are under way from late 2006. No money had actually been spent up to October 2006.</p>

 The provisional number of training places in England projected by the postgraduate deans to be available next year is slightly in excess of 30,000.

SHAs can hold a reserve on behalf of their organisations to manage the overall financial position within their area. The size of any primary care trust (PCT) contribution to this reserve is a matter for local agreement between the SHA and the PCT, but the process is based on fairness. A PCT which makes a contribution will be entitled to have that contribution repaid within a period which does not normally exceed the three-year allocation cycle.</p>

We believe the barrier's route should be on or behind the Green Line, and not on occupied territory. Construction of the barrier on Palestinian land is illegal.

Its actions jeopardise regional stability in North-East Asia and pose a clear threat to international peace and security.

some areas where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved last year have been sustained and in some cases fallen. This is encouraging and shows that the strategy is working. Progress is also being made in other areas. Vital counter-narcotics legislation was passed last December; over 280 traffickers have been convicted to date; and a high security prison for serious drug offenders has been constructed in Kabul. To support alternative livelihoods over 12 million labour days have been provided; 8,800 km of roads rehabilitated, and US$187million in small grants and US$90 million in micro-finance loans have been disbursed.</p>

 Experience in the Golden Triangle demonstrates the need to adopt a comprehensive and long-term approach to counter narcotics in order to have a sustainable impact on the drugs trade. In developing its National Drug Control Strategy, the Afghan Government have had regular contact with the Thai authorities, whose holistic opium reduction strategy is considered to be one of the most successful in the world. The Thai strategy focuses on law enforcement, building infrastructure to support development, providing alternative livelihoods and demand reduction. Similarly the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which the UK supports, reflects these key priorities. However, sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, particularly when the challenges are as severe as they are in Afghanistan. In Thailand, where the problem was much less complex, cultivation increased before the strategy took effect and it took 30 years to achieve a sustainable solution.</p>

 The Counter Narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF), consisting of Afghan investigators, prosecutors and judges, was established to work with the counter narcotics police of Afghanistan (CNPA) to conduct drugs prosecutions involving 2kg or more of heroin, morphine or cocaine; 10kg or more of opium; and 50kg of hashish or other controlled drugs. There are currently 84 specially trained members of the CJTF. According to CJTF figures, by the end of September 2006, they had arrested over 690 individuals and completed over 260 cases. This has so far resulted in over 280 convictions. The longest sentence conferred to date is 18 years.</p>

 We believe all obstacles to trade in the region should be removed. The history of the EU demonstrates the power of trade to promote economic prosperity and political reconciliation. The preliminary findings of the World Bank report on the economy in northern Cyprus, are that the external constraints on access to EU markets for the Turkish Cypriot community are one of the two biggest constraints to economic development in northern Cyprus. I would endorse the conclusion that the long-term welfare of all Cypriots is in jeopardy if steps are not taken to ensure the convergence of living standards on the island. That is why we remain committed to supporting the Turkish Cypriots and the EU Commission in economic and regulatory reform, and to supporting the EU Presidency in its efforts to find a way for the Turkish Cypriots to trade directly with the EU.</p>

 The UK is a leading supporter of the African Union Mission in Darfur (AMIS). We were its first donor, and have to date provided &#163;52 million of assistance. This has been used for budgetary support, vehicles and other equipment, and to airlift troops to and from Darfur. The African Union has now decided to increase the strength of AMIS by two battalions (approximately 1,200 men). We stand ready to assist them in this. Meanwhile, at our urging, the UN is helping to bolster AMIS prior to any transition to a UN force. The UN will provide much-needed planning and logistics capability with the deployment of 163 staff officers to assist the military and civilian police wings of AMIS as well as its senior management. The UN will provide a further 36 armoured personnel carriers and a range of other equipment to help improve AMIS effectiveness. We are looking at what personnel the United Kingdom can provide to the UN assistance package.</p>

DFID has also committed &#163;25 million to assist the country's 1.3 million orphans and &#163;20 million to enable an additional 20,000 Zimbabweans with AIDS to access anti-retroviral therapy, treatment for opportunistic infections and other services including home based care.

DFID supports an ongoing Protracted Relief Programme, spending some &#163;10 million per year, which is providing food, seeds, fertilisers and other forms of practical assistance to over one million of the country's poorest and most vulnerable people. This has included giving access to clean drinking water to over 600,000 people in the last year. DFID is currently developing a new initiative to reduce the high mortality rates for mothers and newborn children, through support for reproductive health services including maintaining poor people's access to affordable contraceptives. All of DFID's assistance is delivered through NGOs and UN agencies&#151;none of our funding is channelled through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

 The Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Rashid, and the subsequent High Court judgment in the test cases of A, H and AH were based on a combination of factors particular to individual cases decided before March 2003 where our then policy towards certain categories of Iraqi asylum seekers may not have been correctly applied. We do not believe that a similar combination of factors is likely to exist in a high proportion of Iraqi claims. An accurate estimate of the numbers affected can be obtained only at disproportionate cost. As of the week ending 13 October, around 300 Iraqi cases where the applicant has made representations that they are eligible for ILR on the basis of the Rashid judgment have been decided and of those we have granted ILR in seven cases.</p>

In such cases an assessment of the risks posed to the UK and public by the individual would be made in conjunction with law enforcement and security agencies. Depending on that assessment appropriate measures would be taken to monitor the individual while here.</p>

 As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said on 9 October 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 42, valid international comparisons are difficult because of the variations in a range of factors, including how one measures offences detected and offences reported. Analysis published by the Council of Europe in the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics: Key Findings 2000 concluded that the length of custodial sanctions was the most important factor in the size of the prison population.</p>

 Responsibility for the investigation of incidents, including attempted escapes, lies within the line management structure.

This is available on the internet at http://pso.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/PSO_2700_suicide_and_self_harm_prevention.doc. PSO 2700 is currently being revised to incorporate learning from the Safer Locals Programme (2001-05), learning from death in custody investigation reports, and recent safer custody initiatives, including the introduction of ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody &amp; Teamwork&#151;the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners).

Custodial staff are expected to demonstrate an understanding of SASH policies and practices, that SASH review meetings are programmed and that risks of self-harm are considered during the initial assessment stage following admission and in every subsequent review and planning meeting.
