 There is stringent legislation around drink driving, with a minimum of 12 month ban for drivers found over the prescribed alcohol limit for driving. We have worked closely with the police on enforcement, such as equipping police forces with new digital breathalysers, and in making the links between police campaigns and our drink-drive advertising. This long-term strategy has helped deliver more than a 75 per cent. reduction in drink-drive related deaths and serious injuries since 1980.</p>

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report indicates that, after 2100, sea levels will continue to rise for centuries to come, mainly because of continued thermal expansion of the oceans. However, the magnitude of this rise cannot be predicted precisely because it depends on a number of factors, including the effects of future greenhouse gas emissions on temperature increases and the dynamics of ice sheet melting.</p>

Urgent mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions would reduce projected sea level rise but not prevent it beyond 2100, so adaptation to sea level rise would also be needed.</p>

 Demand for heating oil increases in cold weather. Oil distributors worked hard in challenging conditions, particularly in more remote parts of the country, to supply customers during the worst cold weather experienced for 29 years. DECC officials received representations from the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers (FPS) that heating oil distributors were facing increases in demand-at higher rates than they could make deliveries in large part as a result of the difficulties of access to properties due to ice and snow. DECC officials worked closely with FPS so that the enforcement of drivers' hours rules could be temporarily relaxed to enable deliveries to be made to customers as conditions improved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="100303w0004.htm_para4"><a name="10030367000563">With regard to the question of Ofgem, the Government do not believe that bringing these fuels under regulations having similar scope to the Gas and Electricity Acts would be an appropriate and proportionate form of regulation. These Acts deal with markets where there are natural monopolies which mean that competition cannot be expected on its own to protect consumers from the risk of exploitation. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly in the distribution of heating oil. In the UK there are around 200 different fuel distributors each with a national, regional or local presence, with competition between the companies involved. Overall, the Government support the retention of a competitive market for heating oil, believing this to be in the best interests of all customers. Both general consumer protection legislation, such as the Sale of Goods Act and Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations, and competition law apply to this sector.</p>

 Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome are not routinely included in the clinical risk groups for vaccination for H1N1 swine influenza. These conditions are not known to increase the severity or duration of community acquired infections, such as influenza. Therefore, these conditions are not routinely regarded as causing immunosuppression, which is one of the conditions in the clinical risk categories. However, general practitioners (GPs) should take into account the risk of influenza infection exacerbating any other underlying disease that a patient may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from influenza itself.

<i> [holding answer 1 March 2010]:</i> The Department for International Development (DfID) is leading the UK response to the Haitian earthquake: at DfID's request the Ministry of Defence (MOD) sent a Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ship, RFA Largs Bay, to carry vital relief supplies to Haiti. RFA Largs Bay arrived in Haiti on 18 February, delivered its cargo of aid and is now engaged in further taskings in support of the World Food programme under the direction of DfID. This has been a high priority task and I trust it has been seen as a significant contribution by the Government to the international aid effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="100303w0007.htm_para0"><a name="10030367000756">The MOD deployed an Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team to Haiti via 2 C-130 Hercules flights to advise DfID on the capabilities of RFA Largs Bay and on what military assistance was required. DfID does not currently require any military assistance in the region beyond that already in Haiti. The MOD continues to take an active role in the UK response, and will provide further assistance where possible if required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="100303w0007.htm_para1"><a name="10030367000757">Some 130 military personnel are on board the RFA Largs Bay. Five military personnel remain in Port-au-Prince in support of the ship. Eight members of a Royal Military Police close protection team for the FCO's consular Rapid Deployment Team as well as 11 military personnel and one civilian from the Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team were deployed initially to Haiti following the earthquake but have all since returned to the UK. A small number of UK service personnel on exchanges (with Canada, Bermuda and USA military forces) were also deployed, or were on standby to deploy, to Haiti.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="100303w0007.htm_para2"><a name="10030367000758">Spending by the MOD in support of Operation PANLAKE, the assistance provided by MOD to Haiti on behalf of DfID, will be recovered from DfID. At present, it is not possible to provide a final costing of the operation as the work is still being completed.</p>

 The latest three years for which data are available are 2006 to 2008. These are from the superseded fire data report forms which were in place until March 2009. Under this system, the numbers of people rescued but uninjured were recorded, but for reasons of economy, entry sampling was used such that full details of incidents for only one in five of those incidents that did not involve injuries were input to central databases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="100303w0010.htm_para2"><a name="10030367001044">Examination of the estimates from this data base have shown that fluctuations in the estimates at fire and rescue service level, which occur as a result due the entry sampling, mean that only the following approximate national figure can be derived: the number of people rescued uninjured from fires by the fire and rescue service in each year between 2006 and 2008 is in the region of 1,500 to 2,000.</p>

These units will provide a visible local presence for probation in all communities and ensure that the diverse needs in different parts of Wales are met. Compared to the retention of four separate probation areas in Wales, the single trust will save £1.5 million. This additional saving equates to 46 posts in corporate support and governance arrangements. In reducing management overheads, the all-Wales trust will focus resources on the frontline, improving public protection. These savings will allow 34 full-time equivalent probation officers to be employed across Wales who would otherwise not be funded.</p>

 There are around 87,000 violent incidents involving glassware each year.

The Directorate is also working with public authorities to improve training around the use of communications data to maximise efficiencies as suggested by feedback to the 2009 public consultation 'Protecting the Public in a Changing Communications Environment'.

Failure to comply with an order is an offence. Local authorities have the responsibility for prosecuting parents if they breach a school attendance order and also have the option of seeking an education supervision order. We believe that this achieves a balance between the rights of parents to educate their children outside the school system, many of whom do a good job, and the rights of the child to a full-time education suitable to their needs and abilities.</p>

The consultation will end on 4 March 2010 and plans are for the new duty to come into effect in September 2010.

For Years 10 and 11 the figures were 42 per cent. and 37 per cent. respectively. For primary pupils the figure was 57 per cent. We are working with the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England, and through them with School Sport Partnerships and County Sport Partnerships, to ensure that plans are in place to deliver a five hour offer which is taken up by every young person who wants it. At present we judge this to be the case in 92 per cent. of SSPs. As part of this we believe every young person should have access to regular competitive sport; coaching to improve their skills and enjoyment; a choice of different sports; pathways to club and elite sport; and opportunities to lead and volunteer in sport. We are also developing new ways of communicating the offer so that more young people take it up.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="100303w0022.htm_para2"><a name="10030388003285">The increase in the number of cases over this period reflects a sustained drive, led by the Government, to improve levels of school attendance including by encouraging local authorities to make more use of their powers to proceed against parents who are failing in their legal responsibility to ensure their children receive a full-time education. The outcome has been a significant improvement in school attendance, with on average 71,800 more children attending school each day in 2007/08 than in 2000/01.</p>
