 At a global level, physical supplies of all the main cereals remain secure. 2010 is likely to produce the world's third largest cereals harvest ever. Food stocks, following two years of excellent harvests, remain high, at around 23% of annual consumption.</p>

The international price of wheat has risen steeply since June, reflecting current market concerns about possible shortfalls. Our assessment is that the price should adjust over the autumn as this summer's cereals crop is harvested.</p>

1. These statistics are based on the Households Below Average Income series, sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication "Households Below Average Income" (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) modified equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Number of adults and children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>

However, the 5% sample data is generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5% sample (Some recipients of DLA who transferred from the AA system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time).<br>
4. A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to DLA. Entitlement is dependent on an assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or mobility because of their disability. These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes.<br>
5. In Payment for DLA shows the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. These cases are shown in the not in payment category.<br>

A lack of skills can be a barrier to gaining employment for some unemployed young people. Young people who are NEET are entitled to face to face support from the adult careers service, Next Step, and can expect to be referred to an adviser early on after claiming out-of-work benefits. A range of training options is already available and we are starting to give colleges and other providers more freedom to develop training programmes which reflect the needs of young people in their areas. For those young people who stay NEET and are claiming benefits for six months or more, the Work Programme will provide a tailored package of support to get people into work.</p>

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.

 The estimate provided in the answer of 23 June was based on an assessment of the impact of removing the tax deductibility of interest payments net of taxable interest receipts for non-financial corporations. The majority of non-financial corporations are in a net interest payment position, paying more interest than they receive. Any restriction of the tax deductibility of this amount will raise revenue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="100914w0003.htm_para6"><a name="10091449000033">In contrast, financial corporations tend to be net recipients of interest, and this forms part of their profits.

In 2007, The NHS Information Centre commissioned the National Centre for Social Research to carry out a third adult psychiatric morbidity survey covering adults living in private households in England. The survey assessed alcohol dependence from answers to a different self-completion questionnaire which consisted of 20 questions focusing on the three components of dependence: loss of control, symptomatic behaviour and binge drinking.</p>

As existing consortia structures vary across the country, and until GP commissioning arrangements are fully established, primary care trusts will have an important role in supporting practices to prepare for these new arrangements.</p>

As from 21 July 2010 The Information Centre has published experimental, provisional monthly NHS work force data. As expected with provisional, experimental statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly work force data is not directly comparable with the annual work force census; it only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (i.e. it does not include Bank staff). There are also new methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count). This information is available from September 2009 onwards at the following website:<br>
www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/provisionalmonthlyhchsworkforce<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
Maternity Support staff are: Nursery nurses, Nursing Assistant/auxiliary's, Health Care Assistants and Support Workers in the Maternity Services area of work.<br>

2. The table shows the NIC of drugs classified by Prescription Services as being for the treatment of tuberculosis from the prescription cost analysis database, which covers prescriptions dispensed in the community. Data for the same drugs have been extracted from the Hospital Pharmacy Audit Index, which provides an estimate of the cost of drugs used in hospitals. The cost of drugs for hospital use is not necessarily the actual price paid but is the cost of the drugs issued priced using the price lists that apply to prescribing.<br>

 Local housing authorities are already able to assist people in the statutory priority need groups who have been accepted as unintentionally homeless by providing them with accommodation leased from a private sector landlord for a period less than 10 years. At the end of June there were around 50,000 households being assisted under the homelessness legislation in temporary accommodation, of which around 61% were in accommodation leased from a private sector landlord. Authorities can also arrange for people in the statutory priority need groups who are unintentionally homeless to be offered assured shorthold tenancies in the private rented sector.

 The Government are absolutely committed to protecting the security of tenure and rights of those currently living in social housing. With a record five million people on social housing waiting lists it is right that we should look at ways of improving the system for new tenancies, and consider how best to help the most vulnerable in our society. How we make best use of our social housing should be a matter for open debate and discussion, and we welcome the views of tenant groups as part of this. On 4 August, we announced our plans for a National Affordable Home Swap Scheme, which will allow social tenants to move-such as for family or employment reasons-without losing their footing on the social housing ladder, so increasing the tenure rights and opportunities of those in social housing.</p>
