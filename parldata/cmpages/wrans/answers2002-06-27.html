To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent <i>(a)</i> support and <i>(b)</i> guidance has been given by his Department to the SRA and the rail industry regarding (i) the re-opening of rail stations and (ii) the development of new lines and stations; and if he will make a statement.  [64131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's priorities for the Strategic Rail Authority are as set out in the Secretary of State's Directions and Guidance. The Strategic Rail Authority's priorities for implementation are set out in the Strategic Plan.

<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what changes <i>(a)</i> have taken place and <i>(b)</i> are planned with relation to the penalty regime in the railway industry; and if he will make a statement;  [64146]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> guidance has been given and <i>(b)</i> legislation is in place with regard to the penalty regime of the railways; what plans there are to change them; and if he will make a statement;  [64148]

<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 During the periodic review of Railtrack's access charges by the Rail Regulator in 2000, a thorough review of the incentive regime was carried out. The payment rates were raised to broadly double their previous levels in order to improve incentives to run trains punctually. Similarly, the SRA are incorporating increases in train operator's incentive rates as new franchises are let.
<P>

<a name="20627w01.html_para0">The SRA is currently considering whether a more wide-ranging review of incentive regimes would be appropriate to reinforce the rail industry's drive to improve performance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_wqn5"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many miles of rail track in Scotland are fitted with train protection warning systems; and what percentage this represents of the total rail track in Scotland.  [63918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The fitment programme for the train protection and warning system (TPWS) is based on the number of sites to be fitted not miles of track. Railtrack advises that in Scotland TPWS is to be installed at approximately 1,600 sites by the end of 2003. To date TPWS has been installed at 1,109 sites, of which 955 are now operational and 154 are currently being tested.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) which assets under the PPP of London Underground are defined as grey assets; and if he will make a statement;  [63974]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> London Transport, <i>(b)</i> Transport for London and <i>(c)</i> Ernst and Young, on grey assets under the PPP of the London Underground; and if he will make a statement.  [63973]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Grey assets are defined in the PPP contracts as those assets where a full condition assessment has not been possible, either for access reasons or lack of historical data. They tend to be older heavy civil engineering assets such as retaining walls or brick arch tunnels. The Secretary of State has had no recent discussions on such assets.

<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The completion of the new Scottish centre depends on both air traffic levels and NATS' capital investment plan. Completion is expected to be during 2008 or 2009. NATS is currently engaged with suppliers in evaluating systems.

 The Department for Transport remains committed to ensuring transport fully contributes to sustaining and improving the English countryside. Since the publication of the Rural White Paper in 2000, we have, for instance:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>begun to introduce low noise surfaces on the existing trunk road network. By 2010, 60 per cent. of the network should have a low noise surface, substantially cutting road traffic noise in rural areas;
<P>
<BR>
ensured that the impacts on the environment and countryside of any new road proposals&#151;whether for the trunk road network or proposed by local highway authorities&#151;are clearly identified and appraised using our New Approach to Appraisal; and
<P>
<BR>
continued to work with local highway authorities and the Countryside Agency in order to develop local traffic management measures, which can help preserve the tranquillity of the countryside.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason a question about financial standing has been added to application forms for an operator's licence; and if he will make a statement.  [64795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Holders of licences to operate heavy goods vehicles or passenger service vehicles are required by law to have available sufficient financial resources to maintain their vehicles in a roadworthy condition and to run a viable business. Licence application forms contain questions about financial resources to enable the licensing authority to decide if the applicant meets the criteria for financial standing. These questions are not a new addition to the forms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to require the use of dual controls by learner drivers for a specified period of time.  [65022]




<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2002 : Column 980W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We want to improve novice driver safety&#151;young and newly qualified drivers have a poor safety record compared to older, more experienced drivers. However, we have no evidence to suggest that the learning process is dangerous and no plans to require the compulsory use of dual controls in vehicles driven by learners. We consider that learner drivers should gain more experience before they take the driving test and earlier this year we issued a consultation paper on ways to achieve this. This included an option to introduce a mandatory requirement for a minimum amount of professional tuition.
<P>

<a name="20627w01.html_para2">Research indicates that a mix of professional tuition and plenty of practice with friends or relatives is the best way to learn to drive and our initial view was that the introduction of compulsory professional tuition is not justified. Nevertheless we will be considering carefully all the views we receive on this issue before taking a final decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the mandate of the Committee on the Implementation of Projects Promoting Co-operation and Commercial Relations between the European Union and the Industrialised Countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if she will list the items currently under its consideration; if she will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if she will make a statement.

 EC Council Regulation 382/2001 provides for a programme of measures and actions to complement and bring added value to the efforts undertaken by member states and other European public bodies in the Japanese market, and establishes a Committee to assist the Commission in the implementation of this programme. This Regulation also provides for co-operative activities between the EC on the one hand and North America and Australasia on the other, but the Committee has had no role in these activities. The Committee has met once in the last 12 months. A British Trade International official represents the UK. It is impossible to calculate the cost of its work to public funds without incurring disproportionate cost. The Committee is currently considering the detailed arrangements for the EU trade promotion campaign towards Japan "Gateway to Japan III". Any European Community proposal that goes to the Council of Ministers would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny procedures.

The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February (COM(2001)783 Final).

 Applications to export small arms to Government bodies in any country would normally need to be supported by an end-user undertaking. In certain circumstances a purchase order, or a copy of the relevant pages from a contract might be accepted in lieu of an undertaking.
<P>

<a name="20627w02.html_para6">Special arrangements apply to the transfer of small arms to non-Government end users in EU member states under the provisions of the EC Directive on Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Weapons "the EC Weapons Directive" (91/477/EEC). Exporters are required to obtain prior import consent from the receiving member state and complete certain transfer documentation.
<P>

<a name="20627w02.html_para7">For exports of small arms to non-Government end users in non EU countries, DTI would normally require, in addition to an end-user undertaking, to see a copy of an import permit or some other form of declaration issued by the authorities of the importing state to confirm that they were content for the individual or dealer to possess the weapons in the licence application.
<P>

<a name="20627w02.html_para8">In addition, at the request of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), an export licence for small arms to destinations covered by the moratorium on the Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons will not be issued unless the ECOWAS Secretariat have issued confirmation that ECOWAS Governments have been consulted and are content.

 In its judgment of 18 June in the Koninklijke Philips <i>v.</i> Remington case, the European Court of Justice concluded that the Trade Marks Directive (implemented in the UK by the Trade Marks Act 1994) could not be used to protect product characteristics or technical features.

limit), after which inventions pass into the public domain for anyone to use or develop. This period of 20 years, which accords with international norms, represents a balance between encouraging inventors to develop new products by preventing others from using their inventions for a limited time, and encouraging competition by publishing full details of patented inventions so that they may be widely used when rights expire.
<P>

<a name="20627w05.html_para2">On the other hand, trade marks indicate the trade origin of goods. Allowing trade mark registrations to confer on proprietors an open-ended right to product characteristics or technical features would upset the balance created by the patent law.

 Research has shown that plants can be genetically engineered to produce substances with the potential to induce immune responses to several diseases of animals and people. But the prospect of plant-produced vaccines for the routine prevention of diseases of poverty is still a distant one. At present, an important challenge facing many developing countries is to strengthen their health service delivery systems to achieve and sustain high coverage with existing vaccines, which are safe and inexpensive. DFID contributes to this objective as a partner in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) and through its support for WHO, UNICEF and national Governments.

On-going and intensified Israeli restrictions will exacerbate this situation&#151;restricting movement of people to work and products to markets, prohibiting access to basic services such as health and education, increasing unemployment, substantially reducing the ability of the Palestinian Authority to sustain essential social services, and inhibiting the work of international organisations and aid agencies.

Participants come from a wide range of backgrounds, and have participated in both plenary and workshop discussions of the issues.

 Food distribution in the six countries involves for the most part scaling up existing responses, so it is already taking place. The World Food Programme tell us that they have a total of 100,000 tonnes of food aid in the pipeline for the region, with 25,000 tonnes either already in affected countries and being distributed, or due to arrive by 1 July. There are also NGO programmes which we and others are funding which are continuing earlier food interventions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the farmgate price of milk has fallen over the last few months. The most recent official figures show that for milk delivered in April the average farmgate price of milk in the UK had fallen to 16.10 pence per litre and it is likely that the average figure for May will be even lower. As a result, some dairy farmers will be receiving less for their milk than it costs to produce it. A situation that is clearly unsustainable. However, these low prices have largely been caused by factors that are temporary in nature, most notably, oversupply of raw milk in the UK and the weakness of EU and world markets for dairy products.
<P>

<a name="20627w06.html_para4">For the longer term, it is likely that the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations will further restrict the use of export subsidies and increase the exposure of EU markets to world markets. In addition, enlargement of the EU is likely to lead to pressure on the Community budget, if the CAP is not reformed.
<P>

<a name="20627w06.html_para5">In order to produce a sustainable dairy industry that can compete successfully on the growing world market for dairy products, the industry must be given the opportunity to trade free of artificial constraints imposed by the WTO, as well as by the EU dairy regime. The EU price support system is focused on butter and skimmed milk powder, both in clear surplus, hampering the development of genuine markets, while milk quotas are bureaucratic, constrain production by the most efficient farmers and represent a significant financial burden to most farmers.
<P>

<a name="20627w06.html_para6">The Government therefore favour the orderly phasing out of milk quotas in combination with a reduction in EU support prices to world prices, and direct but digressive aid to help farmers adjust to the new regime. During the forthcoming review of the milk quota system, due to start in June, the UK will be pressing to achieve confirmation that quotas will not continue after they lapse on 31 March 2008. These changes are intended to provider longer-term direction within the framework of the dairy regime, which farmers need in order to plan their businesses effectively.

These figures are a stark warning of the need for action to conserve biodiversity and to protect species and an indication of the size of the challenge. It needs international co-operation to address problems on this scale. We are working within existing international agreements to this end and will be looking to the World Summit on Sustainable Development for a renewed level of commitment.

<a name="20627w07.html_para0">Many mammal species in danger of over-exploitation through trade are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This regulates trade in animals and plants, and products derived from them, to ensure it is carried out in a sustainable way to safeguard the long-term survival of species. Trade in the most endangered species is banned while that in species which may become endangered is carefully regulated and monitored through a system of import and export permits. There are approximately 30,000 species listed on CITES, around 5,000 of which are mammals.

 One year after the creation of DEFRA, it gives me enormous pleasure that what were different Departments are now working well together to develop an integrated approach to the problems of pollution, and especially diffuse pollution from agriculture.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para5">The increased intensification of farm production and the great steps made to reduce point source pollution from factories and sewage works mean that, as the Policy Commission on Food and Farming noted, agriculture is now clearly one of the major contributors to the pollution of water. It is also a significant polluter of air.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para6">Over time we will need to take further steps to reduce pollution from agriculture, but in a cost-effective way. We therefore need to involve farmers very closely in continuing work to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. Many farmers are committed to protecting and enhancing the environment, but much more needs to be done to raise standards across all farms to the standards of the best, and to tackle the specific problem of diffuse pollution.

<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para8">Over 70 per cent. of nitrates and over 40 per cent. of phosphates in English waters originate from agricultural land. Up to a half of England's bathing waters are affected by short-term contamination by agricultural pollution, mainly by microbes from livestock manure being washed off farm land after rain. Excessive loads of fine silt are generated by soil erosion from intensively farmed land. Pesticides are contaminating drinking water sources, requiring expensive additional treatment at water works to remove pesticides before water can be supplied to consumers.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para9">No one farmer is responsible for this, but cumulatively diffuse pollution from farms is having a substantial impact on the quality of English waters. That is why we have begun a strategic review of diffuse water pollution from

Through the review we are considering the full range of policy mechanisms that could play a part in the future in encouraging and assisting farmers to improve their management of manure and nutrients.

We have decided to apply the minimum regulation consistent with our obligations under the directive, to avoid closing off other options for tackling the wider problem of diffuse pollution that might be identified through the current review.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para13">We will designate new nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) covering 47 per cent. of the land area of England, which will take the total designated area in England to 55 per cent. These are areas draining into rivers, ground water and other waters which are affected by nitrate pollution. In consequence, farmers using manufactured nitrogen fertilisers or organic manures will be required to follow an action programme to reduce pollution.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para14">This action will help to prevent and reverse damaging impacts of eutrophication, and improve the quality of drinking water sources. Better control of manure spreading will also cut microbiological inputs to water, helping to maintain and further increase the quality of bathing waters and shellfish waters.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para15">The overall extent of the new designations will be less than was originally estimated in the consultation document, as a result of work to define and quantify the NVZ areas more accurately than was possible at the time the consultation document was issued. Some new areas have been added, as was anticipated in the consultation document; but more areas have been removed.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para16">I am today publishing a revised regulatory impact assessment, which estimates that the compliance costs incurred by farmers will amount to about &#163;20 million per year. Costs will vary considerably from farm to farm, but I acknowledge that some farmers, particularly those who need to construct additional slurry storage facilities, will incur substantial costs. To assist those farmers who are most affected, we will extend the existing farm waste 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1003W</I><P>
grant scheme to the new NVZ areas to help finance improvements to slurry storage facilities required to implement the action programme.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para17">Formal designations setting down the precise boundaries of the new zones will follow as soon as possible, and it will become a legal requirement to follow the action programme from 19 December 2002. By the end of July, DEFRA will make available detailed interactive maps of the new NVZ areas. As soon as these are available, we will write to farmers to explain how to access these maps. We will also send all farmers in affected areas explanatory guidance material, together with sources of further advice on how to comply with the measures and details on the availability of grant under the farm waste grant scheme.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para18">We are also taking action to reduce phosphate and nitrate pollution of waters from other sources, and are announcing, separately, additional designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive that will require water companies to reduce phosphate or nitrate discharges from certain sewage treatment works.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para19">We are also committed to improving air quality. 85 per cent. of the ammonia which enters the atmosphere in the UK comes from fertilisers and manures used in agriculture. We will be publishing a booklet later this summer, which will explain the problems caused by ammonia emissions, to initiate debate on how to tackle this related problem.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para20">This all adds up to a substantial agenda for change. I recognise that we must secure these changes in ways which maximise the beneficial impact on the environment while minimising the regulatory burden on farmers. As we said in "Working Together", we need to explore joined-up ways of working; to develop whole farm approaches; and to identify smarter ways of regulating. For example, several of the measures I have mentioned could affect the ways farmers handle manures and fertilisers, pointing to the benefits of more integrated approaches.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the 2001 review of sensitive areas as required by the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994; and if she will make a statement.  [65669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w07.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Based on recommendations from the Environment Agency I have reviewed the identification of Sensitive Areas in England in accordance with the criteria in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 (which transposes the European Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment).
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para21">This review has resulted in the identification of 33 more water bodies in England as Sensitive Areas. 32 are because the waters have since the last review in 1997 been found to be eutrophic, or that they may in the near future become eutrophic if protective action is not taken. Eutrophic waters are those which are, or may be, adversely (in terms of their ecology and quality) affected by discharges from sewage treatment works serving communities of more than 10,000 inhabitants.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para22">The remaining water body, the River Itchen in the midlands, which supplies drinking water, has been identified on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1004W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para23">Identification of these areas will result in more stringent treatment being provided at 53 qualifying treatment works by water companies. This treatment involves reducing levels of phosphorus and/or nitrogen in discharges to tackle eutrophication and nitrate levels of these waters.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para24">These new requirements on water companies to remove these nutrients from sewage treatment work discharges will complement and add to the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive, and by my Department on diffuse pollution, which I also announced today.
<P>

<a name="20627w07.html_para25">Lists of the new sensitive areas have today been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. Maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (eutrophic) and (nitrate) will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to issue a leaflet on guidelines to local authorities on dealing with high hedge complaints. Until there is a change in the law, local authorities have no powers to intervene in these matters.

 Based on 2001 statistics, Castle Point was not identified as one of the highest users of bed-and-breakfast hotels (B&B). The authority was not, therefore, required to submit a B&B reduction action plan in the first round of applications for funding to reduce numbers of families with children in B&B. However, the latest data from Castle Point indicates that is has 20 homeless households in B&B, of which 16 are families with children. We will be contacting the authority shortly to discuss their proposals to meet the commitment that, by March 2004, no homeless family with children is in B&B except in an emergency and even then for no more than six weeks.

<a name="20627w11.html_para2">Castle Point, like all authorities has been sent a 10-point check list of good practice, outlining the key 'building blocks' which we expect every authority to have in place to deliver reductions in B&B hotel use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government added &#163;6.5/8/8 million to the general grant for 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to meet local authorities' new statutory obligations under the Homelessness Act 2002. General grant is distributed to councils through standard spending assessments (SSA) which take account of various broad social and economic factors such as population. It is not possible to estimate how much of an authority's SSA relates to additional provision for particular responsibilities. It is, of course, for local authorities to decide how to allocate their general grant. Local authorities' responsibilities under the Homelessness Act 2002 are within the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services SSA Block.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 8 May 2002, c. 199W]:</i> I have agreed that the executive agency status of Forensic Science Northern Ireland should be continued until 31 March 2006. In addition, I have agreed with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury that Forensic Science will become a Trading Fund from 1 April 2004. My decisions follow the completion of Stage 1 of a quinquennial review which examined the past performance of Forensic Science and the alternative organisational arrangements available for the delivery of forensic services in Northern Ireland. Generally the agency was found to have performed well and I commend its staff for their dedication through a difficult period. Stage 2 of the review will now be carried out to look at ways of improving the delivery of services by the agency. Copies of the Stage 1 report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available in due course on the NIO and Forensic Science websites.

<sup>(10)</sup> Average salary of full-time teachers in the maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools sector of England and Wales at 31 March of each year 1974 to 2001. Figures cover all grades and include any allowances paid. Figures up to 1993 include sixth form colleges. The 2001 salary figures include those threshold pay increases that were made before March 2001. However, they do not include threshold pay increases relating to people who passed the threshold in September 2000 and had not received their payment by March 2001. This money was backdated after March 2001 and therefore the average salary for March 2001 will be understated. The estimated average salary in March 2001 for primary and secondary schools combined, including all threshold pay increases, is &#163;27,800. Source: DfES Database of Teacher Records.<P>

<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> Average salary of those in full-time employment in the UK with a degree or better qualification, in the spring of years shown. Excludes teachers with such qualifications. Source: Labour Force Survey (as the New Earnings Survey does not include qualifications data). Gross weekly and hourly earnings data are known to be underestimated in the LFS. Earnings data is based on information from about two-fifths of all respondents. Respondents with hourly pay greater than &#163;100 are excluded.<P>

<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> Average salary of those in full-time employment in GB whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence, at April of each year. Figures from 1974 to first row for 1983 are compiled on the basis of men aged 21+ and women aged 18+. Figures for second 1983 row and onwards are compiled on the basis of employees on adult rates.

ONS replied on 20 June saying that, subject to NR's members confirming the board of directors, and further checking of the legal documents, NR would be classified to the private sector in national accounts. The reasoning behind the submissions was to obtain ONS's view on the sector classification of Network Rail, and to make sure that ONS received in good time all the information it needed to make that decision and raise any queries.

Historical annuity rates provided by Annuity Direct; and the rates refer to level annuity for a male aged 65, single life, guaranteed 5 years.

The annuity rates were calculated by taking the average of monthly rates for each year. The annuity rates for 2001 refer to the average of monthly rates from January to October only.
Earnings:

The average earnings series from 1963 to December 2001 is taken from National Statistics publication, 'The Abstract of Statistics for Social Security Benefits and Contributions and Indices of Prices and Earnings, 2001 Edition'.
<P>
<BR>
Two indices have been put together to form a monthly average earnings series, starting from 1963. The Index of Average Earnings from 1963 to 1975 covered employees in all industries and services, except postal services, banking and medical services. The Average Earnings Index (whole economy) from 1976 to present covered all employees.

Prior to 1963 the earnings series was constructed by back calculating using the annual growth in average earnings of full time male manual employees.

 No estimates of the additional cost to a person of caring for a disabled person are available and the state pension does not contain an element in respect of caring responsibility, but carers entitlement to state pension is protected through contribution credits and the home responsibilities protection scheme. In addition, from April this year some 2 million carers are able to build up entitlement to an additional pension through the state second pension.
<P>

<a name="20627w17.html_para0">As part of the substantial package of measures to help carers announced in autumn 2000, the Government have responded positively to representations made by older carers and their organisations by abolishing the age 65 upper age limit for claims to invalid care allowance. This change comes into effect on 28 October 2002. It will enable older carers with little of no retirement pension to receive the allowance, while those with low incomes will benefit by gaining access to the carer premium paid with income-related benefits, and follows the substantial increases to the carer premium and to the earnings limit for entitlement to invalid care allowance made in April 2001. Overall these measures, together with the continued payment of invalid care allowance for up to eight weeks after the death of the severely disabled person being cared for, will provide over &#163;500 million in extra support for carers over three years.

2. "Median income" represents the income of the person or family exactly in the middle of the range of ranked incomes of the age group. For each age group there is a wide range of incomes.<P>

3. The data are from the Family Resources Survey 2000&#150;01 and are rounded to the nearest &#163;1 or 10,000.<P>

4. Estimates are for pensioner units. Pensioner units are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.<P>

5. Pensioner units are allocated to age categories according to the age of the head. The head of a couple is defined as the man.<P>

6. Estimates have not been split by gender for couples as the extent of income sharing within pensioner units is not known.<P>

7. Means tested benefits refer to minimum income guarantee, working families' tax credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit and social fund grants.<P>

8. These results are based on survey respondents' identification of different elements of benefit income, and are therefore subject to misreporting.<P>

The reforms in 2001 met this obligation and went further. The new widowed parents allowance was available to existing widowers from its introduction in April 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on compliance by small and medium enterprises with stakeholder pension notification arrangements.  [64290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Firms with five or more employees are required to designate a stakeholder pension scheme for their staff, unless exempted from doing so because they provide an occupational scheme for their work force or allow their staff access to a personal pension scheme to which the employer makes a contribution of at least 3 per cent. of the employee's basic pay. Part of this designation process involves consulting relevant employees prior to selection of a scheme and then notifying them of the name and address of their designated stakeholder pension scheme. They must also allow representatives of the designated scheme reasonable access to their employees in order to supply them with information about the scheme. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra), which has responsibility for regulating compliance with all aspects of the designation process, has received no specific reports of firms failing to notify employees of their stakeholder arrangements. However it is a matter that they sometimes come across on following up a report alleging non-designation. Reports to Opra tend to be of a general nature rather than alleging a specific breach of one part of the designation requirement. To date Opra has received 361 reports alleging lack of workplace access to a stakeholder pension scheme, of which 327 have been resolved.
<P>

<a name="20627w18.html_para0">Figures on designations of stakeholder pension schemes are not broken down by size of company. However the majority of employers required to designate a stakeholder pension scheme for their work forces are small to medium enterprises. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has reported that around 322,000 of those 350,000 employers estimated as required to do so had designated a stakeholder pension scheme for their staff by the end of March 2002. This represents a compliance rate of around 90 per cent.

 The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries schemes during their working lives can usually

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex concepts, affecting many aspects of people's lives; including their living standards, health, housing and quality of environment. The third annual report, "Opportunity for All&#151;Making Progress" (CM 5260), sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against this strategy. A copy is available in the Library.

 There are 19 specially designated street crime courts in London. Of these nine are Crown courts and 10 are magistrates courts.
<P>

<a name="20627w19.html_para17">The Crown courts are: Blackfriars, Croydon, Harrow, Inner London (designated Youth Crown court for Inner London), Isleworth, Kingston, Middlesex Guildhall, Snaresbrook, and Wood Green.

<a name="20627w19.html_para19">As well as fast tracking street crime cases the designated courts are designed to ensure that victims and witnesses have separate facilities, such as secure waiting areas, to avoid the risk of intimidation from alleged offenders. The Witness Service, provided by victim support also provides support to witnesses before, during and after they give evidence, to lessen the number of cases failing to proceed.

 At present it takes too long to extradite someone from the United Kingdom. Not only is this against the interests of justice and the victims of crime but it is the British taxpayer that foots the bill: paying for the fugitive to be detained and often funding their legal battle.
<P>

<a name="20627w20.html_para0">The previous Home Secretary launched a review of extradition law and the Home Office published proposals for consultation in March last year. Since then the attacks on 11 September have added impetus to European Union (EU) plans for an EU-wide arrest warrant.
<P>

<a name="20627w20.html_para1">The Government has already announced that we intend to legislate to bring this into effect. This will dramatically speed up the extradition process between EU states, but not at the expense of fugitive's rights.

 The majority of prisoners have serious basic skills needs which must be addressed if we are to help them re-settle effectively into the community on release.

 Day to day arrangements for the policing of Nottingham is an operational matter for the Chief Constable.

It is intended that there should be teams of two to three shift working beat managers assigned to a beat over seven days. This should give better coverage than the present arrangements under which beat managers work Monday to Friday; give officers improved ownership of the beat, and more responsibility in policing the area. This should help the team to build better relationships with local communities.

 The new graduate primary care mental health workers and mental health gateway workers announced in the NHS Plan will be employed to help general practitioners manage and treat common mental health problems in the financial year 2003&#150;04. Further information to support their recruitment, and to monitor their establishment, will be available in due course. A special session on new primary care workers and 'Gateway' workers was held at 23 November 2001 conference 'Fast-forwarding Primary Care Mental Health' (www.doh.gov/fastforward).
<P>

<a name="20627w22.html_para1">Pilot projects for new graduate primary care workers have recently started in Northumbria and Birmingham. A mental health primary care team, established in Scarborough in 1998, with the aim of strengthening primary care mental health provision, also achieved NHS Beacon status in April 1999. The service provides one model of how gateway staff might work in other parts in the country.
<P>

An open meeting with industry representatives is being planned for later this year to discuss possible access arrangements. All projects, whether funded from the public or private sector, will need to have ethical approval and will be reviewed by the scientific management committee.

 Following a meeting at the North East London health authority (HA) on the 27 May about the outbreak of winter vomiting disease at Whipps Cross University Hospital national health service trust, all trusts in the local health economy made available any spare capacity they had should it have been necessary. Although unused, the Homerton and Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS trusts offered help as did Barts and the London and Newham trusts, both of which took patients from Whipps Cross. As such the local health economy was able to minimise the disruption of services for patients.

 The NHS Plan set the context for the major modernisation of the national health service in England. It clearly sets out a vision of a health service designed around the patient, and which enables integrated care to be delivered by a range of organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to extend the availability of digital hearing aids in the NHS.  [63063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w24.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We are committed to extending the benefits of digital hearing aids, provided as part of a modernised service. We have invested over &#163;30 million in the modernising hearing aids services project over the past three years. This will bring the number of sites providing a modernised service to 50 by the end of this financial year, with at least 15 more sites having the equipment and training to enable them to start fitting digital aids from April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20627w24.html_para5">Audiology departments were informed, on 11 June 2002, that James Strachan, chief executive at Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the national health service purchasing and supply agency (PASA), working with the Department, have now negotiated an excellent deal on the price of digital hearing aids. All NHS audiology departments are free to purchase from these contracts, whether they are currently part of the project or not, provided they have the necessary infrastructure in place and relevant experience of fitting digital hearing aids.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance he has issued on the availability of tuberculosis medication for HIV patients; and if there are any circumstances in which an HIV patient would be expected to pay for tuberculosis medication.  [63465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w24.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Guidance on the treatment of patients with HIV-related tuberculosis was published in the report "The Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis in the United Kingdom: UK Guidance on the Prevention and Control of Transmission of 1. HIV-related Tuberculosis 2. Drug-resistant, Including Multiple Drug-resistant, Tuberculosis", by the interdepartmental working group on tuberculosis.
<P>

<a name="20627w24.html_para6">If the medication is supplied to a patient and administered at a hospital it is free of charge. If the medication is supplied otherwise than for administration at a hospital normal prescription charging arrangements apply. No charge will be payable if the patient qualifies for free prescriptions on any grounds, such as low income.

<a name="20627w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Arrangements are now in place to ensure that everyone who requires national health service dentistry will be directed to available services simply by phoning NHS Direct. Over the last 18 months we allocated over &#163;210,000 to extend and improve existing

NHS dental facilities in Somerset. In February 2001 the capacity of these services was further increased when a dental access centre was opened in Yeovil.
<P>

<a name="20627w25.html_para0">We are aware of the need for further improvements and during 2001 the chief dental officer led a working group to look at options for change to modernise NHS dentistry. This group has completed its deliberations. The proposals in 'Options for Change' need practical testing and demonstration sites will be set up, working with the NHS Modernisation Agency. We will begin the process of identifying the demonstration sites over the coming months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w25.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The five acute trusts in Essex have assessed the arrangements necessary to implement the scheme to assess multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' eligibility for disease modifying therapies for MS.
<P>

<a name="20627w25.html_para1">All trusts highlighted a need for additional specialist nurse support. Applications have been made to the MS Society for access to their specialist nurse fast-track scheme and these applications are currently being processed. Once approved, recruitment will commence as soon as possible. Identification of potentially eligible new patients has taken place and this information has been passed to primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="20627w25.html_para2">Once the infrastructure is in place within the centres, these patients will be reviewed and if they meet the required Association of British Neurologists criteria, will commence treatment.

<a name="20627w25.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many cases each responsible local authority would be expected to deal with under the formula for transferring funding for residents of care homes and nursing homes on preserved rights from the Department of Work and Pensions to local authorities;  [63157]




<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1086W</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what unit of funding was used in arriving at the formula for the transferred responsibility for residents of care homes and nursing homes with preserved rights to local authorities.  [63153]
<P>
(3) what attempts were made to assess the capacity of the private sector to meet the assessed care needs of individual residents in care homes and nursing homes with reserved rights before arriving at the funding formula for transfer of undertaking to local authorities.  [63154]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w25.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The national budget for the preserved rights grant was determined principally on the basis of the expected number in mid 2002&#150;03 of residents formerly entitled to preserved rights. The allocation for individual local authorities was calculated in proportion to the distribution of residents with preserved rights as at December 2000. The caseloads of people under 65 and over 65 were considered separately. The data for December 2000 were provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. These data were adjusted by information provided by councils on the numbers of preserved rights residents supported outside their area. These adjusted data are available on the Department of Health's website at http:/www.doh.gov.uk/scg/incom-sup.htm.
<P>

<a name="20627w25.html_para3"> Until March this year, responsibility for the regulation and inspection of independent sector residential care homes and nursing homes lay respectively with local councils and the national health service. Part of this function included checking that homes were able to meet the needs of their residents. On 1 April 2002, this responsibility passed to the National Care Standards Commission, for care homes in England. Until the abolition of preserved rights to higher levels of income support there was no requirement on councils to assess the care needs of residents with preserved rights unless the council was topping up their care home fees.

<P>
<a name="20627w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Data collected by the Department in 1999 show that all national health service staff in the hospital sector have access to occupational health services. In 60 per cent. of NHS trusts these services are provided in house, while the other 40 per cent. buy in services from neighbouring NHS organisations. The NHS Plan announced a further &#163;21 million of funding for the extension of occupational health services to general practitioners and their staff.
<P>

<a name="20627w26.html_para0">In order to address this the Department has issued service delivery standards for occupational health as part of the improving working lives standard. The effective management of occupational health and safety services in the NHS was issued in November 2001, and is available in the Library. The Department is currently working with occupational health providers on further standards related to pre-appointment checks.

<P>
<a name="20627w26.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Information on delayed discharges is collected at health authority rather than constituency level. All available information has been placed in the Library. Figures for Quarter 4 of 2001&#150;02 show that the former Isle of Wight, Portsmouth and South East Hampshire health authority area had 97 delayed discharges.
<P>

<a name="20627w26.html_para2">The Government recognise that delayed discharges are a problem across the south-east. Health and local authorities are working together to take action to improve the situation. In October 2001 the Government announced an extra &#163;300 million in the "Cash for Change" initiative to tackle bed blocking in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. Last year Hampshire received over &#163;2 million, this year over &#163;5 million.

 The national health service appointments commission is responsible for non-executive appointments to the boards of primary care trusts (PCTs). PCT boards are themselves now responsible, within certain limits, for determining their complement of non-executive members. As a result, the chief executive of the appointments commission wrote to all PCT chairs on 14 June to establish the planned size of their board for 2002 and the number of new non-executives they would like the commission to recruit to fill the vacancies. Responses have been requested by 30 July.

<P>
<a name="20627w27.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government welcome the contribution made by the Joseph Rowntree report to the discussion about the appropriate level of care home fees. We support any publication that aids councils in setting fair and realistic fee levels. The Government are putting record levels of investment into the system. We increased resources to social services by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, this represents a national real terms increase of 3 per cent. per annum. There is evidence that this extra investment is making a difference. In a recent report by Laing and Buisson, the authors of the Joseph Rowntree report, it is stated that councils have raised care home fees by an average of 3 per cent. in the last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20627w27.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> Primary care trusts and national health service trusts provide continence services as part of their general community based services.
<P>

<a name="20627w27.html_para1">It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.

 Intermediate care has made rapid progress over the last two years&#151;there is very good progress towards the targets set in the NHS Plan and there are many examples of good practice around the country. However, it is still a relatively new service and there is more work to be done to ensure that it becomes firmly established and meets its full potential.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> Local health and social care organisations are responsible for planning and providing services for people with epilepsy. The recently announced budget settlements for the national health service (representing an annual average increase of 7.6 per cent. above inflation over the five years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08) and personal social services (PSS) (representing an annual average increase of 6.0 per cent. above inflation over the three years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06), will provide the investment needed to support services which best meet patients' and users' needs.
<P>

<a name="20627w28.html_para2">The Department has recently welcomed the publication of the Government funded national sentinel audit of epilepsy-related death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families. The Department has given a commitment to consider the recommendations of the audit and develop an action plan by September 2002 to try to improve epilepsy services and reduce the number of preventable deaths from epilepsy.

<P>
<BR>
Asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop a clinical guideline (due in summer 2004) for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy to help address widespread variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. This will be supported by a technology appraisal (due autumn 2003) of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new anti-epileptic drugs in children and adults, to help promote appropriate uptake and equitable access.
<P>
<BR>
Announced that the national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions is expected to develop standards of care for specific neurological conditions, including epilepsy. The NSF is expected to be published in 2004. Implementation is expected to start from 2005.
<P>
<BR>
Developed the expert patients programme, which aims to provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase will include people with epilepsy.
<P>

Provided funding to the national society for epilepsy for its living well project. The project aims to promote independent living by providing locally based short-term courses for people with epilepsy to develop self-help and self-management techniques.
