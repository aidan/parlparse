<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> All crops in the farm-scale evaluations are being grown in compliance with the conditions of the consents issued under Part B or Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC and, in addition, in accordance with the SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) guidelines. The SCIMAC code of practice together with the associated guidelines for growing newly developed herbicide tolerant crops was published by SCIMAC on 21 May 1999 and a copy has been placed in the Library.

<a name="90609w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will make a statement on the Government's national speed policy review;  [86053]
<P>
<UL>(2) when the national speed policy review is to be concluded; when the Government plan to announce the findings of the national speed policy review; and when the Government plan to announce their proposals for changes to speed limits.  [86055]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The speed policy review was launched in October 1998. This is considering how best policy can reflect the aims of the integrated transport policy white paper, whilst continuing to meet our road safety objectives. In its first stage the review is examining existing research and reviewing current practice and legislation. The second stage is now underway involving people and organisations outside government that can offer an informed opinion. The final stage will draw conclusions before a report is prepared for Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90609w01.htm_para0">The review will consider all aspects of speed management, including the role of speed limits. It is expected to be completed by the Autumn, when its findings will be published.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many and what proportion of settlements of less than 3,000 in population have (i) no signed speed restrictions and (ii) a maximum speed limit of <i>(a)</i> 40 mph, <i>(b)</i> 30 mph and <i>(c)</i> 20 mph.  [86114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally as Local Traffic Authorities are responsible for setting speed limits on their roads.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many respondents to the consultation document, "Developing an Integrated Transport Policy: An Invitation to Contribute", recommended lower speed limits.  [86054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Of the 7,300 responses to the consultation document, "Developing an Integrated Transport Policy: An Invitation to Contribute", 827 recommended increased traffic calming measures and lower speed limits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations the Government have received in the course of the national speed policy review on the need to reduce speed limits in country lanes and in villages.  [86056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A wide range of views on this issue have been received, both for and against the need to reduce such speed limits.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make it his policy to change departmental refrigeration and air-conditioning systems to operate on not-in-kind refrigerants.  [86164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is DETR policy, in accordance with the model framework for greening government operations, not to purchase substances that contain CFCs or HCFCs where suitable alternatives exist. The specifications for the build and refurbishment of Eland and Ashdown House Victoria specifically excluded the use of ozone depleting gases.

<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> Our recent White Paper on sustainable development, "A better quality of life", announced that we wish to see sustainable development frameworks prepared in each English region by the end of 2000. We will be issuing guidance on the content and preparation of such frameworks. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are among the subjects which we are considering for inclusion in the frameworks. 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1999 : Column: 322</I><P>
Additionally, as indicated in the consultation paper, "New and Renewable Energy: Prospects for the 21 Century", recently published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, renewable energy is a topic we will be considering in the context of our new proposals for Regional Planning Guidance, on which we have been consulting.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent scientific evidence he has evaluated concerning the use of methyl teritary butyl ether in petrol in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [85870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w01.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Use of Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in petrol can reduce exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide by 25 per cent. and hydrocarbons by 15 per cent. and has contributed to improvements in air quality through reducing the level of these pollutants. In response to concerns about possible contamination of groundwater by MTBE the Environment Agency conducted a pilot study in the Stour catchment to inform the design of future groundwater monitoring. No MTBE was detected in that catchment but MTBE will be included in a major R&D study commissioned by the Agency into the fate, transport and natural attenuation of chemicals in the sub-surface and groundwater environment. The study, which commences this week, will take some two years to complete.

<a name="90609w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what changes to the council tax he intends to make to encourage owners of long-term empty dwellings to bring them back into use.  [86487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 One of the reasons why there is a hard core of unused empty dwellings is that the cost of owning them is relatively low. At present, there is no council tax at all for the owners of dwellings which require or are undergoing major repair works or structural alterations. Long-term empty properties create extra costs for councils because they can encourage vandalism, crime, accumulation of rubbish, vermin and a general nuisance. Exempt from council tax, the owners do not make a contribution towards these costs and they also benefit from other locally provided services like police and fire services.
<P>

<a name="90609w02.htm_para0">The Government do not believe this is justified where a dwelling has been exempt for more than a year. We have, therefore, amended the council tax regulations so that from 1 April 2000, any dwelling in England and Wales requiring or undergoing major repair works or structural alterations which has been exempt for more than a year, will be subject to the standard 50 per cent. council tax attracted by other unoccupied dwellings.

<a name="90609w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced on 22 July 1998 that &#163;15 million would be available for this financial year, and each of the next two financial years. The Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval programme provides support for English local authorities for the capital costs they incur in dealing with contaminated land. The programme also supports, in the form of additional grant-in-aid, the Environment Agency where it is carrying out works to deal with water pollution caused by contaminated land. This funding is in addition to the &#163;50 million over the next three years to help local authorities with their responsibilities under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by section 57 of the Environment Act 1995) and to separate funds made available through Single Regeneration Budget and the Regional Development Agencies for regeneration projects.
<P>

<a name="90609w02.htm_para1">Authorities with on-going contractual commitments for projects funded in previous years have already received notification that support will continue to be available this year. I have agreed the programme for new projects to start this year and my Department has written today to the successful authorities and to the Environment Agency notifying them of the financial allocations which are being made.
<P>

<a name="90609w02.htm_para2">The Department will discuss the other bids with the authorities concerned and expects to make some further allocations. It will also decide new bids when they are received.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> UK Service personnel deployed to the Balkans are paid in accordance with their rank, length of service and, in the case of other ranks, their trade, at rates recommended by the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). Where appropriate, personnel also receive additional pay in recognition of their specialist skills or service, ie flying pay or parachute pay, at rates also recommended by the AFPRB.
<P>

<a name="90609w03.htm_para1">The AFPRB make their recommendations on the basic pay of all members of the Armed Forces on the basis of broad comparability with the pay of civilian occupations of similar job weight and responsibility within the UK. To this basic pay is then added an additional element called the 'X-Factor' (currently 12 per cent. of basic pay) to reflect the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the Armed Forces over a full career and conditions in civilian life, which cannot be taken directly into account in assessing pay comparability. Part of the AFPRB's considerations in determining the X-Factor includes the liability to serve from time to time in difficult and dangerous circumstances. The 'X-Factor' is paid continuously to all Service personnel, apart from the most senior officers, throughout their careers regardless of where they are serving, and it is pensionable.
<P>

<a name="90609w03.htm_para2">This mechanism is so constructed to ensure our continuing ability to recruit and retain personnel of the right calibre and reflects the fact that the UK's Armed Forces have an expectation of world wide deployment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to change the support arrangements for the families of asylum seekers; and if he will make a statement.  [86622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government are determined to deliver an immigration and asylum system which is fairer, faster and firmer. The Immigration and Asylum Bill is key to achieving this goal. The new arrangements contained in the Bill will provide a coherent national support system for asylum seekers, including families with children.
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para2">The Bill has been carefully scrutinised by a Special Standing Committee which took evidence as well as considering it clause by clause. I am very grateful to all the hon. Members who took part in this Committee. In the light of issues raised, I am making the following changes:
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para3">I have today tabled amendments to the Immigration and Asylum Bill to make clear that the Home Secretary will be under a new duty to meet the accommodation and essential living needs of destitute asylum seeker families. The assistance they receive in this way will be comparable to what would otherwise be available under section 17 of the Children Act 1989. All other safeguards for children contained in that Act will continue to apply. Linked with 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1999 : Column: 334</I><P>
the commitment we have already made to provide 24 hour emergency cover for such families, these measures will ensure that the children of asylum seekers receive the same kind of protection as other children enjoy.
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para4">I have also reviewed the balance between cash and vouchers in the resources to be made available to asylum seekers for living expenses, and have concluded that a cash allowance of &#163;10 per person per week is justifiable for both adults and children. This would mean that, at the present illustrative support rates, a family of four would receive &#163;40 per week in cash, and a further &#163;50 of spending power by way of vouchers.
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para5">In the White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer" the Government set a target of delivering, by April 2001, most initial asylum decisions within two months and most appeals in a further four months. In respect of families with children, I have decided to bring forward this target to April 2000. From that date, our aim will be to deliver initial decisions on new asylum applications in such cases in an average of two months. Average waiting times for appeals are already below four months. Our intention is to maintain this for the future for all categories of cases. If we cannot achieve these targets for families with children, we will not bring these applications into the new support arrangements in April 2000. We will only do so when we are satisfied that the targets for these cases can be met. For those people who remain on the support arrangements for more than six months through no fault of their own, we shall be introducing an additional discretionary payment to assist with the cost of any replacement items they may need.
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para6">These changes, together with the other amendments that I am tabling today, will strengthen the Bill and ensure that the Government's objectives are achieved.

 On 28 April 1999, a Home Office circular was issued to Chief Officers of Police advising them, where there has been a death in police custody, to make arrangements for the pre-inquest disclosure of documentary evidence to interested persons.
<P>

<a name="90609w05.htm_para7">The guidance advises Chief Officers that there should be as great a degree of openness as possible, and that disclosure of documentary material to interested persons before the inquest hearing should be normal practice in cases of death in police custody and death arising from fatal road crashes involving the police. The guidance also states that in all cases, Chief Officers will want to consider whether there are compelling reasons why certain documents, or parts of documents, may not be disclosed. But there should always be a presumption in favour of openness. A copy of the circular has been placed in the Library.

 As with the current Widow's Benefit, entitlement to the proposed Bereavement benefits will depend on satisfaction of the contribution conditions by the late spouse. Reduced amounts can be paid if the conditions are not fully met and failure to meet the conditions can mean no benefits are paid. The contributions of married women who die before reaching pension age will count for the first time under our proposals and in the first year some 30,000 widowers will be able to claim benefit of &#163;45 to &#163;50 a week.

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimated annual expenditure figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;5 million. Figures may not sum due to rounding.<P>

2. Income Support/Jobseeker's Allowance estimates will include a number of non-asylum seekers that receive Urgent Case Payments for other reasons.<P>

3. Annual expenditure figures for Income Support/Jobseeker's Allowance have been based on an average of four quarters for the relevant financial year, using number of cases and average weekly amounts.<P>

4. Income Support for the unemployed was replaced by Jobseeker's Allowance in October 1996. Unemployed recipients of Income Support are therefore included in the Income Support estimates for 1995-96 and 1996-97. The 1997-98 figures include Jobseeker's Allowance (income based) recipients (only available for 1997-98).<P>

5. Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit estimates have been calculated using the Housing Benefit Management 1 per cent. sample and Departmental Reports, and exclude asylum seekers receiving Housing Benefit who are not receiving Income Support. Numbers of recipients with Housing Benefit but no Income Support are thought to be negligible.<P>

 The Coal Authority owns a range of records related to coal-mining and the coal resource that are relevant to its activities; in particular, the records of the Coal Commission, which consist of the Coal Holdings Register compiled following the Coal Act 1937 and 26,500 associated claim files; and over one million geological records (principally borehole logs) and 20,000 magnetic tapes of seismic data. It also maintains, and provides public access to circa 100,000 coal-mine abandonment plans owned by the Health and Safety Executive, together with 2,500 boxes of ancillary records (notebooks and calculation ledgers used by surveyors to produce the original plans). The Authority does not hold, other than on an incidental basis, non-coal records.

The Authority will shortly go to consultation on where the originals of the HSE's coal-mine abandonment plans, which are currently kept at the Bretby site, should be housed.

 UK and EU regulation in this area is governed by the WTO Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. This Agreement recognises the right of members to take measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant health. It requires, however, that any trade measures are based on scientific principles and are not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence. In a case where insufficient scientific evidence is currently available, WTO Members are allowed to impose a temporary ban while a thorough risk assessment is carried out. This agreement formed part of the WTO Agreement which concluded the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on 15 December 1993. The WTO Agreement was negotiated by the European Commission in consultation with EC member states under the provisions of the EC Treaties. The Agreement was signed on behalf of the United Kingdom by the former right hon. Member for Hove, the then Minister for Industry, in Marrakesh on

The main WTO Agreement was published as Treaty Series No. 57 of 1996 (Cm 3277), and the Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures as No. 54 of 1996 (Cm 3275).

<P>
<a name="90609w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The reformed EU fruit and vegetable regime offers enormous benefits for UK growers. The progressive reduction in aid for intervention, and diversion of funds to structured operational programmes, has already enabled those growers who trade through producer organisations (POs) to benefit. Payments to POs for constructive works over a period of years enables POs to improve production techniques, quality, preparation for market, marketing and promotional activity, in addition to encouraging the use of environmentally sound practices.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para1">Seventy six operational programmes are currently running in the UK. Funding for work on UK programmes in 1997 totalled &#163;5.7 million. Payment for work in 1998 is expected to be about &#163;7 million with a potential payment of &#163;12 million for 1999. This represents new funding for the UK horticulture industry.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para2">There is no great tradition of grower co-operation in the UK and, although a total of 92 POs in the UK are recognised under the new regime, the percentage of the UK fruit and vegetable sector covered by recognised POs is only 35 per cent. My officials have contacted organisations which have not sought recognition and encouraged them to do so. Independent growers are also encouraged to join existing POs or to form new organisations and seek recognition, so that they can benefit from EU aid.

<a name="90609w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The International Whaling Commission's 51st Annual Meeting was held in Grenada from 24 to 28 May. I attended the meeting, together with officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the British Virgin Islands, as well as representatives of environmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para3">At the meeting I re-affirmed the United Kingdom's opposition to whaling. I am pleased to say that efforts by Japan to secure a quota of 50 minke whales, despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, and to weaken the Southern Ocean Sanctuary were defeated by substantial majorities. There was once again strong criticism of Norway's and Japan's continued whaling activities.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para4">The Chairman of the IWC, the Commissioner for Ireland, announced that discussions with IWC members on the ideas put forward by Ireland in 1997 were continuing, although he had no real progress to report. The Irish proposals would involve a ban on all whaling, including scientific whaling, outside coastal waters, with the possibility that countries might authorise whaling under IWC rules within their own coastal waters for domestic consumption. The proposals also envisage a ban on international trade in whale products.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para5">In the ensuing debate I made it clear that the UK's ultimate aim remained a permanent, worldwide moratorium on all whaling other than aboriginal subsistence whaling. However, we recognised that this was not something that was likely to be achieved overnight, or that could be imposed on members of the IWC against their will. We were, therefore, prepared to 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1999 : Column: 349</I><P>
consider ideas for reaching interim solutions on the way to our ultimate destination. But any arrangements of this kind would have to deliver very real benefits to whale conservation. In this context, we continued to have reservations about some aspects of the Irish proposals, in particular the possibility of renewed coastal whaling. I noted that it seemed, in any case, unlikely that the Irish proposals represented a realistic way forward, given the opposition by Japan to ending scientific whaling. In these circumstances it was important to consider other ways in which the IWC could move forward. In the UK's view these included:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>continued involvement of the IWC in welfare issues, including the encouragement of more efficient and humane killing methods, particularly in aboriginal subsistence whaling.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90609w09.htm_para12">I also reaffirmed that in the UK's view the IWC has an essential role to play as the only international body with worldwide responsibility for the conservation of whales and that we would continue to participate actively, and constructively, in its deliberations.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para13">Australia and New Zealand reported that consultations were continuing on the idea of a South Pacific Sanctuary, but that they were not yet in a position to put forward a formal proposal; the IWC is likely to revert to this topic next year.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para14">The meeting confirmed the central role that environmental concerns now play in the IWC's work. An impressive presentation by the US Commissioner demonstrated the scale of the potential threat posed to cetaceans by climate change and pollution. I emphasised that, in the light of our increasing understanding of these threats there was greater concern than in the past about the ability of whale populations to withstand direct exploitation; in our view this was a cogent reason to adopt a precautionary approach to cetacean conservation and management. The IWC agreed to provide core funding, including &#163;100,000 drawn from its reserves, for two substantial programmes of research on the effects of climate change and pollution on cetaceans; it also urged other interested parties to contribute to these programmes.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para15">The IWC agreed a further 3-year aboriginal subsistence quota permitting inhabitants of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to take two hump back whales a year. During the meeting the IWC considered whether recent takes under this quota contravened IWC rules, which prohibit the killing of whale calves: it was not possible to reach a firm conclusion on this matter, as the rules in question are not entirely clear. However, the agreement to extend the quota amended the rules to remove any uncertainty, and the IWC also agreed a definition of the term calf for the purposes of this quota. In agreeing the quota the IWC also noted commitments by the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to ensure that this hunt is properly regulated, to review and improve hunting and killing 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1999 : Column: 350</I><P>
methods and to provide a more detailed statement of its aboriginal subsistence needs when seeking any further quota. As amended it is now absolutely clear that the taking of a cow and calf is forbidden.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para16">The IWC meeting was preceded by a workshop of scientific and veterinary experts which examined methods used to kill whales with a view to improving their humaneness. The UK delegation to the workshop was led by Professor Sir Colin Spedding, a previous chairman of the Farm Animal Welfare Council and an internationally recognised authority on welfare issues. The workshop produced an 11 point action plan to improve the effectiveness and humaneness of whale killing methods, including those used in aboriginal subsistence hunts. This was endorsed by the Commission in a resolution, which went on to encourage member governments to continue to submit relevant information to the IWC and to future workshops and to take steps, including the provision of appropriate technical assistance, to improve the humaneness of aboriginal subsistence whaling.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para17">The Dall's porpoise hunt off the coast of Japan is the largest directed take of small cetaceans in the world. Recent information suggests that the level of catch may not be sustainable and the IWC adopted a resolution, put forward by the UK, expressing concern about the sustainability of the hunt, directing the IWC's Scientific Committee to carry out a full review of the affected stocks in 2001 and, in the meantime, inviting the government of Japan to reconsider the quota it sets for Dall's porpoises.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para18">A number of other issues were considered. There was a discussion on whalewatching, in which I emphasised the economic benefits of this activity, particularly in the Caribbean, and drew attention to the Guidelines of Whalewatching in the UK issued by the Government. A resolution was adopted drawing attention to the risk posed to consumers of whalemeat (including meat from small cetaceans) by the high levels of contaminants found in some samples, and requesting the IWC's Scientific Committee to monitor contaminant burdens in cetaceans and, where necessary, pass the information on to the World Health Organisation and appropriate national authorities. Other resolutions were agreed requesting the Scientific Committee to develop DNA methods for monitoring the origin of whalemeat as part of a control scheme for any future whaling and drawing attention to the continued threat posed to small populations of highly endangered whales by ship strikes, by-catches, and in a limited number of cases, whaling.
<P>

<a name="90609w09.htm_para19">Overall, this was a successful meeting for the UK. We achieved all our main objectives, and made progress towards our ultimate goals. My presence at the meeting underlined the importance that the Government attach to their policy of opposing whaling and to the role of the IWC.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what progress he has made in respect of supporting the establishment of a regional air service in Wales.  [85163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w11.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Our current study to improve air services for Wales will be taken forward by the National Assembly for Wales in collaboration with the Deputy Prime Minister.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has held recently with Treasury and Department of Trade and Industry Ministers to secure matched funding for objectives 1 and 2 structural funding for east Wales.  [85164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 This Government's success in securing such a significant level of funding for Wales under the new EC Structural Funds programmes has been discussed at ministerial level. I am sure the hon. Member will want to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and Welsh Labour Members of the European Parliament who worked so hard to secure this important opportunity for Wales.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what mechanisms exist for informing the National Assembly of <i>(a)</i> decisions in and <i>(b)</i> representations from Cabinet meetings in respect of matters relating to Wales.  [85165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w11.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Concordats between the Assembly and the UK Government will cover the provision of information to the Assembly, including the passing on of Cabinet decisions. Under the Government of Wales Act 1998, it is the duty of the Secretary of State for Wales to consult the Assembly on the Government's legislative programme. There will also be regular contact at a ministerial level between the Assembly and other Government Departments as there will be between officials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w11.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The provision of home to school transport is a matter for local education authorities. Each LEA must publish a home to school transport policy which sets out arrangements for its area. The School Transport Advisory Group (STAG) has been commissioned to provide advice on school transport. A sub group of STAG is looking specifically at home to school transport arrangements. The Group has been asked to report its findings by the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90609w11.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Whether as Secretary of State for Wales or as First Secretary, my priority will be to serve the people of Wales and to deliver a stronger economy, an improved health service, jobs and opportunity for our young people and better education and training systems in Wales. By occupying both roles during the crucial transition period I will be able to ensure a smooth transfer of powers which keeps these priorities clearly in focus at the Welsh Office and the Assembly.

 The Specialised Health Services Commission for Wales is currently preparing a report on the options for the future provision of paediatric cardiac surgery and paediatric cardiology services in Wales. This will shortly be considered by its Board and will take into account the importance of maintaining services at the University Hospital of Wales and Llandough Hospital NHS Trust. These options will then be the subject of wide discussion within the NHS and with other interested parties.

 My officials have been liaising closely with colleagues at the Home Office who are in the lead on this issue on arrangements which would need to be put in place should we receive refugees from Kosovo in Wales. They are also providing information to all agencies in Wales who have an interest in this matter. My Department is also considering what resources would be required to co-ordinate these arrangements although the Home Office has advised that there are no immediate plans for refugees to come to Wales.
