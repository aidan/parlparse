 Our initial regulatory impact assessment of this draft Directive has been passed to the Scrutiny Committee of both Houses, and a summary has now been published on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51014w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Our assessment concludes that the Commission&#039;s initial proposal would probably have an adverse impact on the continued efficiency and effectiveness of UK ports which would not be adequately balanced by any compensating advantage to the sector or its stakeholders. It is the Government&#039;s view, therefore, that significant improvements are needed in many aspects of the directive if it is to benefit UK ports and a thorough assessment of potential impacts across Europe will be needed before the European Parliament and Council are in a position to adopt a text.

 No standard instrument departure route from any of the three airports crosses directly over Hornsey and Wood Green, although the edge of one noise preferential route lies approximately three kilometres to the west. This is used when aircraft take-off to the east from Heathrow.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51014w01.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 Low flying is governed by the Rules of the Air (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1110). The prohibitions which are relevant to flying above residential areas in North London are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">The 1,000 feet rule: except with the permission in writing of the CAA, an aircraft flying over a congested area of a city, town or settlement shall not fly below a height of 1,000 feet above the highest fixed obstacle within the horizontal radius of 600 metres of the aircraft.</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">The land clear rule: an aircraft flying over a congested area of a city, town or settlement shall not fly below such height as will permit, in the event of a power unit failure, the aircraft to land clear of the congested area.</p>

<a name="stpa_4">The scheme in Northern Ireland which requires new drivers to display an &quot;R&quot; plate and restrict speed to 45mph for their first year of driving has been evaluated.

<p>
<a name="51014w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">The consultation document and decision letter mentioned in my answer of 10 October also considered options for restricting the speed of newly qualified drivers or the power of cars that they may use. The Department concluded that the disadvantages of a lower speed limit for new drivers outweighed the advantages and that it would not be effective to restrict newly qualified drivers to low-powered cars. Even small-engined cars can be driven at speeds well above 70mph and certainly faster than is suitable for many road conditions. The Department considered that the way forward was to focus on improving the educational environment so that learners were better trained and that driver training services were of high quality.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51014w01.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 There is no statutory obligation on the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to assess the effects of the release of information to private car parking enforcement companies. These companies have a right of access to the information under regulations because they are able to demonstrate &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to receive it.
</p>

 The SRA has recently completed a study into the future use of Waterloo International Platforms. This has been placed in the Libraries of the House and is available on the DfT website.

 The city summits currently taking place in England&#039;s core cities are intended to forge a dialogue between central government and localities to realise their full potential and put them in the premier league of cities across Europe. These summits have involved a wide range of stakeholders from the public, private and voluntary sectors. Consultation on the business plans individual cities are being invited to prepare is a matter for the cities themselves and we are not aware that any specific timescale has been set for this. Most business plans are likely to draw on existing plans and programmes at city and city-region level which have already been subject to consultation, so further consultation may not be required.

 Currently, highly trained and experienced control staff spend a considerable proportion of their day on administrative duties rather than taking calls and dealing with incidents. This is an inefficient use of resources. Under the new system, these activities will be handled by administrative staff outside the regional control centres. The activities essential to the running of the control centres are included in a comprehensive document on scope that has already been widely reviewed within the Fire and Rescue Service. A questionnaire on out-of scope activities is currently on circulation to individual fire and rescue services. Analysis of the responses when completed will fully define those activities which are not in the scope of the control centres.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51014w06.html_spnew0"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Over the years, there have been consistent calls for the introduction of a system of applications to higher education based on students&#039; actual achievements rather than predicted grades. These include, in 1997 Sir Ron (now Lord) Dearing&#039;s National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, and Sir Mike Tomlinson in his Inquiry into A Level Standards in 2002. Most recently, in his report on Fair Admissions to Higher Education, Professor Steven Schwartz concluded that the current system, relying on predicted grades, more than half of which are inaccurate, cannot be fair. That is why, in September 2004, the then Secretary of State for Education and Skills asked for work to be carried out to identify ways to resolve the practical issues associated with implementing a new system based on known examination results.

<a name="51014w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_36">On 9 September 2005, after detailed work with key stakeholders, the Department launched a public consultation making a number of proposals for changes to the higher education applications system including a proposition that predicted exam results should play no part in applications and admissions decisions. Analysis confirming the extent to which predicted grades are inaccurate was provided in a report prepared for the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) (&quot;Estimating the Reliability of Predicted Grades&quot;). This analysis confirmed that only 45 per cent. of predicted grades are accurate and that they are most inaccurate for students from lower socio-economic groups.

<a name="stpa_37">The consultation document proposes a number of changes to the existing higher education applications process that could be made by the academic year 2008/09. In the longer term, it also acknowledges that there can be more than one way of achieving the objectives of a post-qualification applications system and sets out two possible approaches on which it is seeking views. One would involve institutions making no formal offers of places until after exam results; the other would see some places offered before results and a proportion of places reserved until afterwards. The consultation also welcomes the idea that new approaches may appear as a result of the discussion it will stimulate. The consultation runs until 5 December, after which there will be a period to analyse the responses and post a summary on the consultation website.

 Some developing countries highly dependant on the revenues from oil exhibit high levels of corruption, conflict, environmental degradation and poverty. But this is not inevitable. Oil can and should make a major contribution to poverty reduction and sustained economic growth, if it is managed wisely and the revenues earned used properly and fairly. For this reason, the UK Government set up and now takes the lead on the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This provides assistance to countries and companies seeking to increase the transparency of payments by oil, gas and mining companies and revenues received by host governments. Progress has already been made, for example, in Azerbaijan, the first audited reports have been published and are being discussed by the Azeri people.

Results from three relatively small parts of this study already published suggest there is no substantial risk of acoustic neuroma in the first 10 years of use although the authors state that an increased risk after longer term use could not be ruled out. The results to date are not entirely consistent but emphasise the need for continued high quality research. We will await the conclusions of the full study due next year.

 In December 2003 a new strategy for the management of security in the national health service was published, entitled &quot;A Professional Approach to Managing Security in the NHS&quot;. The introduction of local security management specialists provides NHS health bodies, for the first time ever, with professional skills and expertise to tackle security-related problems such as violence against NHS staff. This is reinforced by accredited training, advice and guidance from the NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS).

The local security management specialists&#039; work is underpinned by two national frameworks; the first deals with tackling violence against NHS staff, replacing the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; campaign, and the second deals with general security management measures. The first framework introduced a number of measures to proactively and reactively tackle the problem of violence against staff. As a result of this new framework, it is estimated that in 2004&#150;05, 85,000 frontline NHS staff received training in how to prevent and manage violence and the number of criminal sanctions identified involving those who have assaulted NHS staff has risen fifteen-fold; from 51 in 2002&#150;03 to 759 in 2004&#150;05.

<p><a name="st_111"><a name="51014w12.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 From 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005, a total of 974,012 stamp duty land tax (SDLT) returns were processed electronically. Of these, 251,805 resulted in the issue of form SDLT8 (request for further information relating to incomplete or incorrectly completed returns). This represents 25.85 per cent. of the returns processed electronically. Since 26 August 2005 the percentage of cases where SDLT&#039;s are issued has continued to fall to approximately 15 per cent. HMRC will continue to work to reduce the incidents. It has also been possible to file SDLT returns on-line directly into the SDLT automated system. Using this service removes the need to use post, and (because of the in-built checks) has a very high probability of returns being complete and correct first time. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is working with representative bodies to encourage the use of the service.

since 1 December 2003. As soon as HMRC became aware of this problem all interest charges were suspended, as were the reminders for interest outstanding. Any interest already paid is being refunded. HMRC will be contacting each purchaser affected, and their agent, where applicable, as soon as possible to repay the interest paid. Further information is available on the HMRC website at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/sdlt&#095;interest&#095;qa.htm.

The United Kingdom supported the introduction of the &quot;Whistleblowers&#039; Charter&quot; and pressed strongly for these procedures to be included in the revised Staff Regulation, which came into force in May 2004. This charter, and the rules now in force, obliges the staff of the EU institutions to raise any concerns they have with regard to serious wrongdoing with either the Director-General of their institution, the Secretary-General, &quot;persons in equivalent positions&quot;, or the independent European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

1. Laboratory reporting is the mainstay of surveillance of hepatitis A, B and C in Northern Ireland. This is a voluntary process.<br>

2. Laboratory reports of hepatitis A, B and C contain both acute and chronic infections.<br>

3. Hepatitis A infection occurs predominantly in children. It is usually asymptomatic and so will not be tested for.<br>

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51014w15.html_spnew8"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 It is difficult to separate the effects of individual pollutants. Particulate matter is thought to worsen the condition of those who are already ill rather than being an absolute cause of death. Therefore deaths caused by particulate matter alone cannot be solely calculated. The Committee of Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) have however developed a methodology based on a dose response relationship that allows estimates to be made of deaths brought forward affected by particulate matter PM10 and the calculations for Northern Ireland would suggest that deaths brought forward due to particulate matter PM10 were: 177 in 2001, 157 in 2002, 180 in 2003, and 147 in 2004. Calculations carried out by the Government consultants for 2005 have not yet been completed.
