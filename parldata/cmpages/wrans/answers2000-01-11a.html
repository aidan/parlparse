 On 1 December 1998 at the second Coalfields Conference in Peterlee, County Durham, the Deputy Prime Minister announced a 10 year programme to regenerate coalfield communities with an investment package of &#163;354 million over three years. A fuller breakdown of this investment and further steps to

<P>

<a name="00111w02.html_para0">The Deputy Prime Minister published a further report at the third Coalfields Conference in Wigan on 18 October 1999, in less than a year since Peterlee, setting out progress on delivery of the recommendations of the Coalfields Task Force. Copies of both these documents have been placed in the Library of the House.

 Analysis from the interim national evaluation of the first two rounds of the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) has shown that the initiative is delivering a good mix of economic, social, community and environmental benefits in deprived areas. Taking into account the severity of the problems in SRB partnership areas, these benefits are being delivered cost effectively.

 The Planning Inspectorate strives continuously to improve its service to the public. They have dramatically improved handling times for deciding planning appeals and are well on the way to achieving the Public Service Agreement targets which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced in March 1999. Improvements to the procedure for processing planning appeals will be implemented during 2000-01. A consultation paper on proposals to improve the processing of enforcement appeals was published last month. The Inspectorate are converting all of their guidance leaflets into Plain English and have been awarded seven crystal marks by the Plain English Campaign. The Inspectorate will continue to invest in new IT systems and will be relaunching their website shortly.

 We are revising our planning policy guidance on housing (PPG3) to encourage more housing to be provided in town centres and the conversion and reuse of buildings not currently in housing use, and the re-use of premises above shops. We have commissioned research to identify the impediments to mixed-use and housing developments in town centres, the results of which will be published later this year.

 The Government have not received any formal proposals from the airlines about the restructuring of NATS. The NATS PPP will be put in place following a competitive tender process and, should they choose to bid, any proposal from the airlines will be considered as part of that process. The responses to our consultation on the NATS PPP show that there is broad support for the Government' s proposals from the aviation industry.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Sport and Recreation already emphasises the special significance of playing fields and that they should normally be protected. The Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields)(England) Direction 1998 requires referral to the Secretary of State of planning applications for development of local authority-owned playing fields or those currently, or in the previous five years, in educational use, where Sport England has objected but the local planning authority is minded to grant permission. The Secretary of State then has the opportunity to call in the application for his own determination.

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions announced on 18 November 1998 that School Crossing Patrols would be given increased powers so that they can help any child or adult across the road and that the time restrictions on when they can operate will be removed.
<P>

<a name="00111w03.html_para3">The proposal to extend the powers of school crossing patrols was included in our White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone". It is a clear commitment. We will implement this proposal when a suitable legislative opportunity arises.

 Employee costs account for more than half of local authorities' costs, and this year's pay settlements affecting local authorities are in the region of 2 to 3.6 per cent. Local authorities will continue to benefit from the low inflation and stable economy being delivered by the good economic management this Government provides as well as the predictability that the three year settlement has provided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The percentage is small. Only some 25,000 fluorescent tubes have been recycled under the Government-wide call off contract which the Disposal Sales Agency awarded to Biffa Waste Services Limited in June 1998. The potential market was estimated at 800,000 tubes a year. But contracts of this nature take time to bed down. The extra cost of recycling is deterring some premises managers from using the contract. Others are bound by existing contracts and must wait until they expire. The time intervals for replacing tubes can also vary between two and several years depending on circumstances. There are also logistical considerations such as storage space. Efforts continue to encourage managers to use the contract.

 This Department has been represented on several of the policy action teams (PATs) set up in response to the Social Exclusion Unit's report "Bringing Britain together: a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal", including PAT 5 on Housing Management and PAT 8 on Anti-social Behaviour. PAT 5 found that good housing management is crucial in ensuring that tenants in social housing enjoy a high quality of life. The work of both teams will feed into the Social Exclusion Unit's overall strategy on neighbourhood renewal, to be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para0">The quality of life for tenants can be greatly improved by involving tenants more effectively and more thoroughly in the management of their homes, including tenant management if that is what the tenants themselves want. From April this year all councils will be introducing tenant participation compacts. This Department published guidance for local authorities in June last year to help them develop, implement and review their local compacts.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para1">We are also broadening our programme of grants paid under section 16 of the Housing and Planning Act 1986 to promote and develop greater participation. Guidance on the full range of grants available for this purpose will be published in the spring.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para2">Under Best Value, local authorities will need to review their housing services, including those relating to estate management, with a view to securing improvements, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. This Department will shortly be publishing guidance for local housing authorities on the application of Best Value to housing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Tenancy agreements set out both the rights, and responsibilities, of tenants. Local authorities should ensure that their agreements are clear and unambiguous, so that there can be no doubt about the standards expected and the circumstances in which the authority will take action if there are problems. In the event of a breach of a tenancy agreement, local authorities may wish to begin possession proceedings using the grounds set out in Part I of Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1985 (as amended by the Housing Act 1996).
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para3">Local authorities may, alternatively, wish to seek an injunction against the tenant concerned to prevent further breaches of the tenancy agreement. The 1996 Act enables the courts to attach a power of arrest to such an injunction if there is violence, or a threat of violence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what criteria were applied in determining how many and which environment schemes would be deleted from proposals put to him by the Environment Agency and South West Water; under what statutory authority that decision was made; whether the criteria relating to pollution of the water environment are the same in every region; and if he will make a statement.

 Proposals for investment by water companies in schemes to protect and improve the environment in England were put to the Secretary of State by the Environment Agency as part of the Periodic Review of water company price limits. This is a non- statutory process, led by Ofwat, which sets the price framework by reference, among other factors, to foreseen investment needs over the forthcoming pricing period, in this case 2000-05.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para4">The Director General of Ofwat requested guidance from Ministers about the level of investment which companies should be required to make to achieve environmental objectives within this period. We were advised in that task by the Environment Agency, which put forward a list of specific proposals for consideration. A large proportion of these arose from the need to meet statutory water quality standards, many of them arising from European legislation. All these schemes were included in the programme as a matter of course. On other parts of the programme, principally schemes to improve river water quality and those to improve intermittent sewage discharges, it was possible for the Government to exercise a degree of discretion over the timing or the nature of the objectives.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para5">In "Raising the Quality", which was published in September 1998, we indicated a general aim to eliminate at least half the existing shortfall in compliance with river quality objectives by 2005 and to accelerate the rate of improvement for intermittent discharges, so that at least two thirds of remaining unsatisfactory discharges would be improved by 2005. Within these national objectives, however, the Government made clear it would take a view on the pace of investment for particular companies taking account of the need to avoid unacceptable impacts on water prices in different parts of the country, and to reflect local environmental priorities.
<P>

<a name="00111w04.html_para6">In the south west, where customers were already experiencing water bills considerably higher than for any other water company, and which already had the highest rate of compliance with river quality objectives in England, we decided to undertake a lower proportion of investment to meet river quality objectives and improve intermittent discharges than elsewhere. These decisions were based on assessments of the costs and benefits of the investment schemes concerned. However, the south west will still benefit from a substantial environmental programme, which includes further improvements to protect bathing waters and shellfish waters, key priorities for the region.

[104274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department estimates that replacing two 1,200 MW coal fired power stations by two gas fired power stations of the same capacity would save about 75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over a ten year period, assuming the power stations would operate on base load.

In addition, an award of &#163;1.95 million has been made to London Underground to upgrade 58 car parks to award status.

 The Government have made special grants available to local authorities to help meet unavoidable additional costs incurred in accommodating and supporting asylum seekers under the Children Act 1989 and the National Assistance Act 1948 who are not otherwise entitled to social benefit. On a weekly basis, these grants are currently up to &#163;150 for a single adult and &#163;220 for a family. The responsibility for the payment of these grants--except those for unaccompanied asylum seeking children--passed to the Home Office in April 1999. Home Office officials have also provided direct support over the past year to the Local Government Association (LGA) and local authorities to devise and operate arrangements to disperse asylum seekers away from those areas under most pressure.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) on 11 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 707-08W, concerning the survey conducted by the Registrar General which showed that, up to 1969, the mortality of persons who had been employed at Nancekuke was rather less than the average for England and Wales as a whole. This report was published in full in the answer given to the former hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Pardoe) on 2 November 1970, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 294-95W. I also refer my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The document to which my hon. Friend refers was a report of sickness and absenteeism among persons employed at Nancekuke from 1952 to 1969. The review was conducted by the Registrar General and mentioned briefly in an answer to a question from the former hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Pardoe) on 2 November 1970, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 294-95W. The study, which was not classified, was among a number of papers at the Public Record Office which were authorised for early release by the Office for National Statistics in response to a request from a reporter.

<a name="00111w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 One claim for compensation has been received by my Department from a former worker at Nancekuke who was accidentally exposed to Sarin GB. I am not aware of any other representations to my Department. I am, however, aware of the two other claims made through the then Department of Health and Social Security in the early 1970s.

 The report referred to was based on a review of sickness and absenteeism among persons employed at Nancekuke from 1952 to 1969. While the results could be taken to imply greater absence among industrial staff for some illnesses than might have been expected from the national figures available, the data were considered insufficiently robust to be used as firm evidence of increased ill-health among staff and the results were not published formally. Recent re-examination of the results supports the original conclusions concerning the inadequacy of the data.

BAe SYSTEMS have also been appointed as the Prime Contractor for the Type 45 Programme. It is currently planned to place the Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) contract with the Prime Contractor towards the end of 2000, to meet an in-service date for the first-of-class ship of 2007.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The detailed contractual arrangements for the build of the first and subsequent ships of the class remain under consideration with the Prime Contractor and I am therefore unable to be precise about the timing of the contract for the second T45 destroyer or to whom it would be awarded. However, value for money will be the prime factor in any such arrangement and in this regard we are keen to ensure that we retain our ability to conduct effective competition for follow-on Type 45 destroyers. To this end, both Marconi Marine (YSL) Ltd and Vosper Thornycroft will be involved in the PFD contract and, subject to satisfactory progress, also in the subsequent DFM contract with a view to allowing the efficient construction of Type 45s at both yards.</FONT></UL>

<a name="00111w06.html_para1">Attendance of companies at the show was a matter for the organisers, DSEi Ltd., who assured HMG that they would require that all exhibitions and promotional material would comply with UK legislation, including the Landmines Act 1998, and Government policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of human rights concerns in Zimbabwe; and what action Her Majesty's Government are taking to address these.  [104573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Respect for human rights in Zimbabwe has improved since the low point of the Matabeleland atrocities in the 1980s. Zimbabwe has an active civil society and independent press (albeit harassed at times). However, there have been some serious lapses in the last two years which have coincided with the decline in the economic situation. The arrest and torture of the two <i>Standard</i> journalists in January shocked Zimbabweans as well as the international community.
<P>

<a name="00111w07.html_para5">Freedom of assembly is enshrined in the Constitution. The Government have previously used emergency powers to ban strike action, although a Parliamentary Legal Committee subsequently declared the ban to be unconstitutional.

<P>

<a name="00111w07.html_para7">Where there is evidence of human rights abuses, we raise our concerns with the Zimbabwe authorities. In addition, we actively promote freedom of expression by training journalists in the UK. Earlier this year we held a conference on media freedom in Harare. We support a number of NGOs working with the Zimbabwe police to enhance their respect for human rights. We also support good governance projects, and provide equipment and research material to NGOs working to improve people's access to law. We are encouraging the Zimbabweans to accede to the convention against torture.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps have been taken to control the export of television broadcast equipment to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; and if he will make a statement.  [104574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 As of 5 January 2000, we have introduced an amendment to the Export of Goods (Control) Order to control the export to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of television cameras, transmitters, codecs and transposers, satellite earth stations and up-and-down link equipment and transmission link and relay equipment. All applications to export these goods will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="00111w08.html_para0">We have introduced the control because of our concerns that companies based in the UK may consider supplying this equipment to the state-run television company in the FRY. This company is a propaganda tool of the Milosevic regime and has been consistently used by the regime to defend and promote its repressive policies, most recently and noticeably during the Kosovo crisis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The 1999 Assessment of the operation of the Wassenaar Arrangement was concluded at the Arrangement's annual Plenary in Vienna on 1-3 December. The agreed public statement on the Plenary is available on the Arrangement's website (www.wassenaar.org).
<P>

<a name="00111w08.html_para1">We welcome the decision by Participating States to expand the scope of their reporting on their transfers of certain types of conventional arms. As a result, arms pillar reporting requirements in the Wassenaar Arrangement will now for the first time extend beyond those in the UN Registrar of Conventional Arms. We also welcome the Plenary's decisions to structure the information exchange on the basis of global and regional views--as a result of a proposal by the UK--and to mandate the introduction of a secure electronic information system. These steps will greatly increase the value and accessibility of information exchanged by Participating States.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 2000 : Column: 134W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00111w08.html_para2">Despite these positive developments, we regret that proposals to include other types of arms in the reporting requirements, including small arms and light weapons, warships of 150-750 metric tonnes displacement and missiles of less than 25km range, were not agreed due to opposition from a small minority of Participating States. We also regret that the Plenary did not agree that Participating States should provide details of decisions to refuse the transfer of military equipment, or details of end-users in all denial notifications for dual-use goods. We continue to believe that these improvements would significantly enhance the ability of Participating States to identify potentially destabilising transfers or accumulation of conventional arms and dual-use goods.
<P>

<a name="00111w08.html_para3">Throughout the course of the 1999 Assessment, most of which was taken forward in the Arrangement's General Working Group under UK chairmanship, the UK has been at the forefront of efforts to increase the effectiveness of the Wassenaar Arrangement. In particular we co- sponsored and lobbied in support of proposals for a substantive increase in arms pillar transparency. We will continue this year to work for the further expansion of reporting requirements, to include in particular transfers of small arms and light weapons. We will also consider the scope for expanding our existing commitment to volunteer details of our transfers of certain types of conventional arms which are not covered by the mandatory reporting requirements.

<a name="00111w08.html_para6">The Statement of Practice sets out the Government's policy for ensuring fair and consistent treatment of employees' rights where the public sector is the employer or client in a contracting-out or subsequent retendering situation.

The approach adopted in the "Statement of Practice", which has the support of unions, public and private sector

employers and contractors, is to utilise the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)--TUPE--Regulations which give individual employment protection rights to employees affected by the relevant transfer.
<P>

<a name="00111w08.html_para7">Contracting-out and subsequent retendering will all be conducted on the basis that staff will transfer and TUPE should apply, unless there are genuinely exceptional reasons not to do so. Under TUPE, an employee's contract is carried across from the transferring employer along with his or her accrued period of service. Terms and conditions of employment cannot be made less beneficial as part of this process and employees cannot normally be lawfully dismissed where the reason is the transfer. Under this approach, staff of Government Departments should transfer to a contractor with TUPE protections and, where a contract is not renewed (by either the contractor or contracting authority), former staff of Government should transfer with TUPE protections to the new contractor. Similar considerations would also apply to sub-contracting.

 Any treatment involving the use of human embryos outside the body is governed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The Act provides that such treatment cannot take place without a licence issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).
<P>

<a name="00111w09.html_para0">In January 1993 the HFEA issued a public consultation document on the issues raised by sex selection and the ways of achieving it using assisted conception techniques. Following the consultation, the HFEA decided that licensed infertility clinics could carry out sex selection for medical reasons only in cases where a woman risked having a child with a life-threatening, sex-linked disease. Sex selection for social reasons is not permitted.

 We are aware of regional variations in the diagnosis, treatment and survival of cancers, including prostate cancer.

 <i>[holding answer 21 December 1999]:</i> BCG immunisation against tuberculosis at age 10-14 is nationally recommended as routine. We are aware that a small number of health authorities have not been providing routine BCG immunisation for all 10 to 14-year-olds. We do not keep records of which health authorities do not routinely immunise 10 to 14-year-olds.

 <i>[holding answer 21 December 1999]:</i> Discrimination of any kind--whether it is on the basis of age, race or gender--is completely unacceptable in the National Health Service. Treatment should rest entirely on clinical need. We are determined to provide older people with care that meets their needs--fast, efficient and sensitive. Already we have extended the annual immunisation programme for influenza to ensure that everyone aged 75 and over can have the flu vaccine free of charge. Over the next three years we will be expanding cataract services to increase the number of cataract operations from 170,000 a year currently to 250,000 a year--this will benefit thousands of older people. From 1 April this year all people aged 60 and over are entitled to free eye tests, regardless of income or health status. We are also developing a National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People. This, for the first time, will set national standards for the care of older people, driving up the quality and reducing variations in that care. The NSF will be published next year.

 These zones have now been running for 12 to 16 months and the early signs are that they are doing well. The summer 1999 exam results show that the zones are raising standards in these disadvantaged areas. At Key Stage 2, there was a 6 per cent. average improvement in English and 12 per cent. improvement in maths in EAZ schools compared to national increases of 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. There was a 2 per cent. average improvement in the numbers of pupils gaining 1 GCSE A*-G grade in EAZ schools compared to a national increase of 1 per cent.

The Financial Plan must take into account guidance issued by the Secretary of State annually. The Financial Plan must be approved by the Secretary of State and it is subsequently monitored by the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate the additional annual cost of support for students attending higher education institutions in England if the support arrangements applicable in 1979, including grants uprated by inflation, were to be applied to the number of students in the 1998-99 academic year.  [101950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> The student support system for English and Welsh students has changed significantly over the past 20 years and the levels of grant received by higher education students in 1979 are not known precisely. However, assuming that approximately 800,000 eligible English and Welsh students in 1998-99 received the main rates of maintenance grant for the academic year 1978-79 uplifted for inflation over 20 years, we estimate that they would receive slightly less on average in real terms than from the current loans and grant fee package.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 2000 : Column: 148W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00111w12.html_para4">If these 800,000 eligible students had been offered a grant for maintenance and free tuition instead of the current package of a repayable loan for maintenance and private contributions towards the cost of tuition, the additional costs to the Department might have been about &#163;660 million; and we estimate that such a system would cost about &#163;1.6 billion more than full implementation of the new arrangements for fees and income-contingent loans applying for students starting in the current (1999-2000) academic year.
<P>

<a name="00111w12.html_para5">Our student support policies share the costs of higher education more equitably between students who benefit from it and the taxpayer. That has enabled us to halt the decline in investment in higher education and helped provide for a 22 per cent. increase in cash funding by 2001-02.

 <i>[holding answer 9 December 1999]:</i> The Beef Bones (Amendment) (England) Regulations 1999, which came into force on 17 December, permit the retail sale of all bone-in beef and beef bones for human consumption. In accordance with the advice of the Chief Medical Officers that it would not be prudent to lift the controls of manufacturing uses of bone-in beef and beef bones, these continue to apply. No information is available on the relative percentages these represent of the products banned under the original Regulations, but my primary concern is the protection of public health, based on the scientific and medical advice I receive. This significant relaxation of the beef bones controls has been warmly welcomed.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to what extent primary quota stocks have been affected by <i>(a)</i> environmental change, <i>(b)</i> sea water temperature change, <i>(c)</i> fishing effort and <i>(d)</i> seals and other predators, in the last three years.  [103667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00111w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 December 1999]:</i> It is not possible to distinguish the exact changes attributable to environmental change and those due to sea water temperature change alone. Any temperature-related changes will in any case not be the same for all species. Cod stocks, for example, are likely to benefit from colder conditions while sole stocks may suffer severe losses from cold sea water temperatures as happened in the winters of 1962-63 and 1995-96.
<P>

<a name="00111w13.html_para2">The general increase in fishing effort over the past decades is primarily responsible for the low level of commercial stocks. However, the recent poor production of young cod stocks is likely to be attributable to a combination of low adult stock size and unusually warm sea temperatures.
<P>

<a name="00111w13.html_para3">The effects of seals and other predators on fish stocks have been the subject of multispecies research in the North Sea. Here, over four million tonnes of fish are eaten annually by other fish. In comparison, fish consumption by seals is estimated at less than 200,000 tonnes of which a significant amount is young fish and sandeels.

 In September 1999 we invited the NFU and other interested organisations to identify burdens that affected business. We now have reports from the three working groups we set up to look at the three priority areas and will be studying these carefully to see where we can change requirements in the UK and where we need to press for changes in Brussels. Reports on other more specific areas identified for review will become available for similar consideration over the next few weeks.

<a name="00111w14.html_para10">Earlier from this year, the Government's routine monitoring programme for pesticide residues in food showed that some imported pears contained residues of chlormequat substantially above MRL. We immediately contacted the authorities in the importing countries and received assurances that they had put measures in place to ensure that future exports complied with MRL. This included a ban on the use of chlormequat in pears grown in Belgium and severe restrictions on its use in the Netherlands. We are continuing to monitor the situation and will not hesitate to take further action if necessary.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the annual expenditure on veterinary and other health care for animals <i>(a)</i> by pet owners, <i>(b)</i> by farmers and <i>(c)</i> in total.  [104252]<P>

 The cost of veterinary medicines and other health care for animals is not controlled by European or UK law and we have made no estimate of annual expenditure in these areas. However, the National Office of Animal Health Ltd. which represents manufacturers of veterinary medicines has estimated that the UK market for animal health products is approximately &#163;370 million in terms of sales by manufacturers and that approximately half the sales by value are of products for the treatment of farm animals. Decisions on pricing of medicinal products are matters for the companies marketing them, taking account of commercial factors such as development and production costs and anticipated volume sales. Similarly, the cost of veterinary treatment is not governed by any statutory rules but is a matter for negotiation between veterinary surgeon and client.
