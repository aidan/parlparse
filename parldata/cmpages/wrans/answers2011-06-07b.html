There were 61 new applications made to vote by post through this initiative and 40 completed ballots were returned through the dedicated system. No special services were provided for British Forces in Germany because service personnel there receive a direct daily service. In Cyprus, special arrangements were put in place to return ballot papers via RAF flights into Brize Norton and then subsequently as a priority despatch into the Royal Mail.

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has no need nor intention to commission external legal advice on the recruitment of under-18s into the armed forces. The MOD takes advice from its own legal advisers on issues relating to the recruitment of under-18s as the requirement arises. That legal advice is confidential and will not be disclosed. We are satisfied that our policies on under-18s in service are robust and comply with national and international law. In addition to the comprehensive welfare system that is in place for all service personnel, we remain fully committed to meeting our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and have taken steps to introduce special safeguards on young people under the age of 18. An example is our recent announcement that for those under the age of 18, the ability to be discharged will in future be a right up to the age of 18, subject to an appropriate period of consideration or cooling off.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 3 May 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> column 675W. It is not possible to ascertain without incurring disproportionate costs what external legal advice was ever received by the Ministry of Defence or its predecessors.

 The Ministry of Defence will continue to require the maintenance, storage and distribution functions at Defence Munitions Beith in the near to medium term, but is continuing to assess possible options for the depot in the longer term. The future ownership of Beith will depend on the outcome of this work, which is taking into account our strategic requirement, value for money, and the linkage with associated industrial strategies, including the team complex weapons initiative. No decisions have yet been taken. The trade unions will be consulted formally at the appropriate time.</p>

 'Mission accomplished' is not a term employed in mission reports as whether the desired effect of a given sortie has been achieved may not often be immediately apparent—for instance, if the aircraft had attacked a target, further analysis may be necessary to determine the extent of the resulting damage. Aircraft may also fulfil other tasks, for instance reconnaissance or deterrence, and indeed conduct multiple tasks on the same mission, further complicating the assessment of the results of an individual sortie. Therefore there is no common definition of a mission accomplished rate and this information is not held.</p>

 For Royal Navy (RN), Royal Marines (RM) and Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) personnel deployed at sea in the surface and sub-surface fleets, daily messing rates (DMR) are applied. DMRs are the cost of ingredients based upon bespoke ration scales; the rates are adjusted quarterly to reflect food cost inflation. DMRs cover the cost of providing ingredients for three meals a day including beverages, but exclude the cost of logistics or food preparation.</p>

               <a name="11060777000398"> The current minimum DMR for personnel at sea is £2.46. All ranks receive the same rate, but the DMR is adjusted according to the number of personnel in the ship's company, and its role, which can raise the total DMR to a maximum of £3.36 per person per day.</p>

 We believe that the arts in general can play an important part in raising standards, changing attitudes towards education, improving behaviour and the quality of teaching. Decisions about the status of art and design as a national curriculum subject will be made as part of the review of the national curriculum. We have recently completed a call for evidence which attracted a very high number of responses across the range of national curriculum subjects. We will be considering those views, along with other evidence, before announcing our proposals early next year.</p>

It will enable pupils from low income families to receive the support they need to reach their full potential and to help schools reduce educational inequalities. Rising to £2.5 billion a year by 2014-15, the Pupil Premium is additional funding specifically designed to boost the attainment of poorer children.</p>

The Government have introduced new legislation in the Protection of Freedoms Bill, currently going through Parliament, to regulate the use of biometric recognition systems in schools and colleges. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that no children's biometric data are taken, in schools or colleges, without parental permission. The provisions would also give children the right to refuse to use biometric systems and ensure that alternatives are provided for children or their parents who opt out of using biometric technology. Subject to the passage through Parliament, the Department for Education will issue advice to schools making their duties under these provisions clear.</p>

Any unspent capital from 2006-07 will be rolled forward to be used in future years, thereby ensuring that the BSF programme is fully delivered.

 The 2011 secondary school performance tables, to be published in January 2012, will be based on indicators which reflect the Government's priorities as announced in the Schools White Paper “The Importance of Teaching”. We want to discourage schools from focusing on pupils on the C/D borderline to improve the school's standing in league tables. Performance tables will therefore include measures of pupil progress and average point scores which capture the full range of outcomes for all pupils. While we will continue to publish A-C indicators, we will also publish a wider range of information, in a supporting dataset, such as the percentage of pupils achieving A*-G in the English baccalaureate subjects and the percentage of pupils achieving 5+A*-G at GCSE or equivalent. Full details of the content of the 2011 performance tables will be published, later this term, in our annual statement of intent.</p>

Within that, it is for school governing bodies and local authorities, rather than central Government, to determine their own policies on supporting pupils with medical needs. Good schools and local authorities will work with parents and local health services so that the medical needs of children, such as those with myalgic encephalomyelitis, are met while they are at school.</p>

 The Government take air quality issues seriously and have committed to a number of initiatives which will reduce air pollution (targeting transport in the main), including: over £400 million for measures to promote the uptake of ultra-low carbon vehicle technologies; a £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund to provide funding for local authorities to support sustainable travel; and a £45 million Green Bus Fund to encourage the uptake of low-emission buses.</p>

 A licensed injectable badger TB vaccine is already available for use on prescription. Experimental studies have demonstrated that vaccination is safe and effective in reducing the progression and spread of TB in badgers. DEFRA is funding a Badger Vaccine Deployment Project to assess the practicality of vaccination in the field and to train lay vaccinators. However, while we would expect vaccination to result in reduced transmission of bovine TB to cattle, we currently have no hard evidence on this. Therefore, the precise contribution vaccination could make to reducing disease in cattle is unknown.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
 1. The VMD does not record the costs of public transport types (bus, train, etc) separately other than hire cars. Instead it records the “reason for travel”, which is a more useful measure for understanding and controlling travel costs.
Assuming “since May” means from 1 May 2010 to 30 April 2011
2. VLA. Trains and buses are not recorded separately (they are both included in the public transport figure), any ‘private hire vehicles’ would be included in the taxi figure.
All figures are for period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011
3. CEFAS. This expenditure covers the financial period of 2010-11 and includes journeys undertaken in the fulfilment of non-government customer contracts. The travel cost for these non-government contracts is reimbursed by the recipient of these services in the charges made and income received.
4. FERA The analysis is provided by the main travel provider, further travel costs for these areas will have been via expenses through GPC, expenses claims, and other organisations. We do not capture this level of detail within our Ledgers. Period is May2010 to March 2011.
RPA Expenditure is for the period May 2010 to March 2011. The figure for Private Hire vehicles excludes taxis

 Under the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) current methodology, every provider should be reviewed at least every two years. However, in line with the principles of proportionate, risk-based regulation, the CQC carries out site visits based on its judgment of risk and where a site visit is the most effective way of gathering information about compliance. This enables the CQC to target its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low.

Provider compliance assessments are not mandatory. When carrying out a review, the CQC may ask to see any provider compliance assessment that has been undertaken and this information may add to the evidence base upon which the inspectors judgment is founded. However the provider compliance assessment will not form part of the decision to undertake a responsive review.</p>

The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is developing a web-based UK Clinical Trials Gateway. It will present, in accessible form, information about trials conducted in the United Kingdom. By 2012, the Gateway will make it easy for patients, their doctors and carers, friends and families to see what a trial is about, where it is taking place, and who is running it.

 The Department draws on evidence from a range of sources, including academic research, to assess links between lifestyles and rates of cancer; and this is kept under constant review. Evidence of the link between lifestyle behaviours—such as tobacco use (including smoking), alcohol consumption, drug misuse, poor diet and nutrition, being overweight or obese and physically inactive—is well established. This research shows that up to half of all cancers could be prevented by changes in lifestyle behaviours, so it is clear that these behaviours have an effect on cancer rates.</p>

 “Healthy Lives, Healthy People”, the Public Health White Paper, accepted the analysis in the Marmot review on health inequalities (“Fair Society, Healthy Lives”, 2010) that emphasised the importance of social factors—including income inequalities—in shaping inequalities in health and contributing to wider disadvantage. This approach will underpin our efforts to strengthen public health and narrow the health gap by improving the health of the poorest fastest.</p>

Disadvantaged areas will see a greater premium if they make progress, recognising that they face the greatest challenges.</p>

 “Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer”, published on 12 January, sets out a range of actions to improve survival outcomes for all cancers in England, including haematological cancers. These actions include diagnosing symptomatic cancer earlier, helping people to live healthier lives to reduce the incidence of preventable cancers, screening more people, introducing new screening programmes and ensuring that all patients have access to the best possible treatment, care and support. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>

               <a name="11060814000327"> We know that cancer patients greatly value the care and support of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs). The results of the 2010 Cancer Patient Experience Survey show that 81% of haematological cancer patients reported having a CNS. To support the national health service to develop the CNS work force, the strategy sets out our intention to build the evidence base for the benefits and costs savings that CNSs can offer. This follows an independent report we published in December 2010 that showed that, in many scenarios, the costs of additional support roles are likely to be outweighed by the savings that can be achieved.</p>

Through the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative, we are working in partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support to ensure that cancer survivors receive the support they need to live as healthy and as active a lifestyle as possible. This work includes looking at models of support to enable those cancer survivors who want to, to get back to work. Seven vocation rehabilitation pilots were established in 2010 to take this work forward, and these are set to run until July this year. The evaluation report on the pilots is due for publication in September 2011.</p>

 Under the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) current methodology, every provider should be reviewed at least every two years. However, in line with the principles of proportionate, risk-based regulation, the CQC carries out site visits based on its judgment of risk where a site visit is the most effective way of gathering information about compliance. This enables the CQC to target its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low. Site visits will therefore take place wherever necessary to gather information about compliance.</p>

The Government will consider comments regarding the need to establish a duty on all relevant NHS bodies to promote research during the current pause and as the Bill progresses through Parliament.</p>

 The publication ‘UK and Global Bioenergy Resource’ was an independent report by AEA Technology plc, commissioned by DECC, to assess the potential supply of biomass in the UK from 2010-30. In order to do this, AEA used different price points—£4/GJ, £6/GJ and £10/GJ—and different assumptions about how far non-financial constraints to the development of the market are overcome. Figure 3.2 in the report shows the potential contribution that various feedstocks could make to biomass supply in the UK up to 2030, on the basis of different combinations of the assumptions. The £6/GJ price point does not refer to a specific feedstock but is one of the sensitivities set out in the report.</p>

 The Government are not proposing any fines for local authorities in relation to carbon reduction but under the provisions of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme which started in April of this year those local authorities which meet the scheme's criteria will be required to purchase allowances reflecting the carbon content of their fuel use. A number of local authorities have provided views on the treatment of academies as part of the coalition Government's current simplification review of the scheme set up by the previous Administration, These representations are currently being analysed and will contribute to the simplification proposals on which we will formally consult in due course.</p>

Most recently, the International Development Secretary spoke to the Development Committee<sup>(1)</sup> at the Spring Meetings where he stressed that the bank needs to ensure that the Energy Strategy meets the twin goals of sustainable energy production and increasing the access of poor people to energy. The UK continues to support the inclusion in the strategy of a target to increase the percentage of lending for clean energy and a shift away from lending for coal fired power stations toward cleaner energy sources as it is here that we believe the financing challenges to be greatest.</p>

The consultation closed on 28 April. The consultation set out the Government's understanding of the extent to which commercial nuclear insurance would be available to cover the new liabilities, introduced by the revisions to the conventions.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">Environment Agency, monitors air and rain at seven locations around the UK. The analysis and reporting is mainly on a quarterly basis, with some variations and the analytical requirements are given in the table. Under this Euratom programme, analyses for uranium are not carried out at any location. Samples from Aberporth in Wales are analysed for certain isotopes of plutonium in both air and rainwater and the Environment Agency reports these annually. All the results are reported in the annual publication ‘Radioactivity in Food and the Environment’. The latest report (2009) is available on the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) website.</p>

The particular adjustments were to analyse filters that were changed weekly before normal processing, to ensure that short half life radionuclides were analysed appropriately. Results from this Fukushima-related monitoring have been placed on the Health Protection Agency's website.</p>

The Government are also providing up to £60 million for offshore wind manufacturing infrastructure at port sites in assisted areas in England. Attracting major wind manufacturing to the UK will enable us to realise the maximum economic potential this sector offers.

 HMRC has kept a central record of all security incidents reported by staff or members of the public since 2007. This central record was formed in support of the Cabinet Office reporting requirements put in place following the Data Handling Review. HMRC was created in 2005 at which point security incidents were managed locally within the legacy departments. This approach continued until the central recording method began in 2007. This central record includes all security incidents involving the unauthorised disclosure of customer or protectively marked information. These records cover both unauthorised disclosures that were accidental and those that were deliberate.</p>

 The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) has placed 6.6 million tickets for the London 2012 Olympic games on sale to the UK public, including special prices for young people in a ‘Pay Your Age’ scheme for over 200 sessions. Further tickets will go on sale for the Paralympic games in September, with prices for young people starting at £5. As the Paralympic games take place in term-time, LOCOG will particularly encourage school groups to attend by providing group packages.</p>

Through a levy on those purchasing hospitality packages for the London 2012 games, Ticketshare will donate up to 100,000 tickets for children and young people in schools and colleges across the UK. To be eligible, schools and colleges need to apply to join the Get Set Network, part of LOCOG's education progamme. 50,000 of these tickets will go to schools and colleges in London, and 50,000 will go to schools and colleges across the rest of the UK. In addition, the Mayor of London has provided 75,000 additional tickets for London schools and colleges.</p>

The Government’s Tourism Policy, published in March, aims to help the tourism industry achieve its potential for growth through a range of measures.

LOCOG is now accelerating its procurement programme. It is procuring £700 million worth of contracts for goods and services across eight sectors—including performance and events, security, sports and technology. It will require a workforce of around 200,000 people, including 6,000 staff, up to 70,000 volunteers and up to 100,000 contractors. The procurement process for contractors was launched at the end of 2009 and most of the contracts will be awarded by the end of 2011.</p>

We are introducing the school games, a new school sport competition which will provide more opportunities for pupils to compete in sport through a vibrant programme of regular intra and inter-school competitions. Through the Inspire Programme cultural and sporting projects can link their events and projects in an official capacity to London 2012. Get Set, the London 2012 education programme, aims to enhance young people’s learning through sport, culture and education and the Legacy Trust UK will help communities from across the UK build a lasting legacy from the games.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(3)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.
<sup>(4)</sup> Acquitted includes: Discharged and Dismissed at magistrates courts and Acquitted at the Crown Court.
<sup>(5)</sup> Other sentences include: Absolute and conditional discharge, community sentence, suspended sentence and otherwise dealt with.

Multiple cases are where two or more people bring cases, involving one or more jurisdiction(s) usually against a single employer but not necessarily so (for instance in transfer of undertaking cases) and always arising out of the same or very similar circumstances. As a multiple, the cases are processed, and judicially managed, together.</p>

               <a name="11060826001466"> Statistics published annually and quarterly by Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service provide a breakdown of claims received. In recent years this breakdown has included that between single and multiple claims. The following table sets out the claims received by employment tribunals in each of the last five financial years for which data are available, including the proportion of multiples and single claims lodged. However, employment tribunals do not categorise claims as ‘private sector’ or ‘public sector’. Therefore, no statistics are collated centrally on this divide, whether in respect of multiple claims or more widely, and it is not possible to report on this aspect. While a manual search of individual case records might give some indication, such work could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.</p>

 According to data published by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), there have been 83 final judgments since 2006 in which the Court found that the UK breached one or more Convention rights. The following table sets out the name of the cases and the articles of the Convention found to have been violated, as well as any damages or costs award stipulated in the judgment.</p>

This included 20 prisoners who were identified as an “authorised absence”. An authorised absence from prison can be for a number of reasons, such as release to outside hospital or for release on temporary licence to assist with prisoner resettlement. Release on temporary licence requires a prisoner to be absent from prison for at least one night. These prisoners are required to return to prison after their temporary release has concluded and therefore continue to form part of the overall population for which a prison place is required.</p>

 Security breaches are defined as any incident involving visitors or outsiders where the security or control of the establishment has been breached, or there has been an attempt to do so. To provide details of the nature of each security breach would involve locating, examining and summarising each of the 249 incident reports which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 In-cell television is available across the prison estate as a key earnable privilege under local Incentive and Earned Privileges schemes. Eligible prisoners are able to rent televisions from the Prison Service for a weekly rental charge of £1 per set, per week or part week. The revenue raised is spent centrally to purchase new or replacement televisions and to fund the switchover of the prison estate from analogue to digital TV following the decision to end analogue broadcasts in 2012.</p>

For the years 2008-09 and 2009-10, no income was collected as the system did not support the full use of TVs.  8. Receipts for TV in-cells may vary during the periods shown for various reasons including: not all cells having electricity points; additional accommodation cells brought into use; charging mechanisms for double occupancy cells.

Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2 )</sup>Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(3 )</sup>Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.
<sup>(4 )</sup>The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(3)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.
<sup>(4)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.
<sup>(5 )</sup>Average custodial sentence excludes life and indeterminate sentences.

 For those access roads to airports which are the responsibility of the relevant local highway authority, such authorities have a duty under section 41 of the Highways Act 1980 “to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that safe passage along a highway is not endangered by snow or ice”.</p>

These winter service plans, which build on lessons learned from the previous winter season, are shared with key stakeholders and, together with more direct consultation, help to ensure that access to critical national infrastructure such as airports is maintained.</p>

 The Government are deeply concerned that the reported breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with the Shan State Army North has led to renewed conflict in Shan state. We have received reports which allege that the Burmese army has attacked local communities, whom they suspect of assisting the armed groups, and perpetuated human rights abuses. We understand that the fighting is taking place in the north-central area of Shan state, which is difficult to access and as such the information is hard to verify. In a Security Council debate on 10 May, we called upon all armed actors including the Burmese army and ethnic militia to protect the civilian population.

 The Digital Diplomacy department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) encourages the use of social media to deliver the FCO's foreign policy priorities. All senior diplomats are given digital training before heading out to post, including on social media. The digital unit is in constant touch with diplomats at post, working with them to increase their use of social media for use in communications, engagement and in monitoring, in order to gain a wider picture of events. Our social media presence is strong, and growing, allowing us to respond to foreign policy challenges in a new way. FCO missions and staff currently engage through Facebook and Twitter with over 300,000 followers across the two, and with a growing number of local-language social media in key countries (e.g. Sina.com in China). A significant, and growing, number FCO staff also write blogs, often in local languages, many of which are picked up by online publications in their host countries. We also make significant use of social media to get messages to British nationals in consular crisis situations and are working with social media partners to increase the reach of our presence on such platforms.</p>

Against this background, Government analysis indicates that at present the Regime has effective control over about 75 to 80% of Libya's oil production capacity.</p>

 In November 2010 the coalition Government published “Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth” which set out the planned changes to the entitlements to full funding Further Education and Skills for adults in England. Learners aged 19 up to 24 will be entitled to full fee remission for their first qualification at level 3. Outside of this entitlement, there is an expectation that the learner will share the costs with the Government; with co-funding in the 2011/12 and 2012/13 academic years, and the introduction of Government-backed loans from 2013/14.</p>

               <a name="11060831000379"> The Statistical First Release<sup>(1)</sup> provides the latest data on the proportion of starts and completions for learners at Level 3. Based on historical data we estimate that 3,000 learner places at level 3 could become co-funded rather than fully-funded in 2011/12. However, as the further education funding system is demand led it is not possible to predict the number or proportion of adults that will be required to pay a fee for a first level 3 qualification beyond 2011.</p>

 The total funding available for apprenticeships is over £1.4 billion in the 2011-12 financial year. In support of the coalition Government’s principle of greater freedom, “Skills for Sustainable Growth<sup>(1)</sup>” and “Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth” set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It is for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>

 The Merlin Agreement set out the commitment of five major UK banks to increase the capacity of lending available to UK businesses this year. The commitment to make available £190 billion of new lending to businesses is up from £179 billion last year. £76 billion of this will be allocated to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a 15% increase on 2010.</p>

Lending to SMEs in the first quarter was £16.8 billion. This is disappointing and, although lending is not linear, the banks must do more to ensure that they meet their commitment over the next few months.</p>

 The Red Tape Challenge aims to take a comprehensive approach, looking widely at regulation, whether introduced through primary or secondary legislation or other means. It seeks views on where regulations are working well, as well as where they are imposing unnecessary burdens on businesses, members of the public or voluntary organisations or restricting personal freedoms. Ministers will then make decisions about which regulations to remove, improve or keep and they will follow the appropriate legal and parliamentary process. Listing a regulation on the website does not have any impact on its implementation.</p>

 Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, goods (including vehicles) must be fit for their intended purpose. If vehicles are purchased with wheelchair access in mind, they must be fit for that purpose whether that purpose is made known expressly or impliedly. If this requirement is not satisfied, the seller is in breach of contract and the consumer will have a range of remedies. The Government have no plans to change this level of protection.</p>

 Over the course of the spending review, the Department continues to focus on driving long-term, sustainable growth while finding efficiencies and reducing levels of spending to meet the target savings. Around 10% of resource savings will be made by cancelling lower priority activities, for instance through ending Train to Gain and replacing it with small and medium enterprise (SME)-focused training programme, and through abolishing the regional development agencies in 2012. Reforms to further and higher education funding will deliver 60% of the total savings target, and the remainder of savings will largely be delivered through driving efficiencies.</p>

 As part of the spending review tough decisions about departmental budgets have been taken and, like all other areas, further education has made its contribution. This has included reviewing the extent to which automatic fee remission for adult skills is provided, and in this context we have prioritised English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) funding to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for other people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace. Increased freedoms and flexibilities for providers will allow them to respond to the needs to their communities and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>

 It is the responsibility of the owners of any intellectual property (IP) to maintain and exploit the right in the way they believe most appropriate to their needs. It is, however, for the Government to provide a framework suitable for enabling such exploitation, balancing the interests of the IP owner against the public interest. The Government recognise that for many products and services, brands play an important role in facilitating competition and choice. They allow consumers to readily identify and purchase products and services they are seeking which offer the qualities that they associate with a particular brand.</p>

 The functions previously performed by Joint International Unit (JIU) officials reporting to BIS Ministers will now be carried out by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) (with the exception of the European Social Fund which remains entirely within the Department for Work and Pensions—DWP). This is mainly policy and programme activity in the area of international higher and further education. The relevant staff and budgets are being transferred to BIS from DWP. BIS will continue to co-ordinate closely with the Department for Education and DWP where necessary, for example where there is a single education input to a bilateral relationship or in one of the international organisations.</p>

 Not all the functions of the Joint International Unit were moved to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS); only the activities for which BIS Ministers were responsible were transferred across to BIS. The Department for Education's (DfE) international work has moved to DfE and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has retained its own international responsibilities. Budget transfers between the Departments are being made to reflect these changes. The costs of the physical move of nine members of staff from DWP to BIS premises has not been calculated, but is estimated to be less than £1,000.</p>

It is therefore not a straightforward matter to identify companies with specifically oil sands-related equipment and services that have made use of UKTI services.</p>

 From January to April this year, the Amman visa section has seen a significant increase in applications compared to the same period last year. In addition, unforeseen staff shortages and visa process improvements to the section, following the chief inspector's review of the Amman operation in October 2010, have placed further pressure on staff resources. These have resulted in Amman not meeting published customer service standards. The UK Border Agency has provided additional staff in Amman to deal with legacy cases and put in place process improvements. The UK Border Agency is committed to providing an efficient visa service to all its customers, and anticipates that the Amman visa section will meet its customer service standards by the end of July.</p>

 The Association of Chief Police Officers has been clear that the forensics market can cope with the managed wind-down of the Forensic Science Service (FSS).

Each step in the process must be able to withstand these critical reviews. Forensic science laboratories across the UK work to demanding quality standards and are accredited against BS/EN ISO 17025 (general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. This is the core standard adopted by the Forensic Science Regulator for forensic science laboratory functions and is a requirement of police contracts with private laboratories. The Regulator has made it clear that the standards must apply regardless of where and by whom the capture, analysis and interpretation of science evidence takes place.</p>

This equates to approximately 126 million passengers a year on over 2,800 routes, and includes over 90% of non-EU aviation passengers. The Government are committed to ensuring that the number of UK ports undertaking exit checks is increased to ensure a more complete travel history is recorded on passengers: This will enable provision of the information requested to be developed as e-Borders is progressively rolled out.</p>

Complainants will have a right of appeal to the Chief Officer if they feel their concerns have not been adequately addressed at the local level. Police and Crime Commissioners will be given a new power to direct Chief Officers to take action where there is failure to deal with a complaint appropriately and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will retain its power to ‘call in’ any case.</p>

 Decisions about how local agencies co-operate are the responsibility of community safety partnerships at local level. These partnerships consult with their communities in order to formulate crime reduction plans to address priority issues and make the best use of collective local resources. The effectiveness of agency co-operation can be challenged through the overview and scrutiny arrangements provided by local authority crime and disorder committees.</p>

 In line with the Government’s austerity agenda, the Department for Work and Pensions has taken vigorous action to enhance business travel policy. Overall this has produced savings in the region of 45%, measured against last year’s expenditure. The DWP’s business travel policy actively discourages travel, unless the alternatives have been examined and exhausted and where travel is deemed appropriate, encourages the use of the most cost-effective modes of transport. The Department has also implemented a total ban on first-class rail travel.</p>

 In line with the Government's austerity agenda, the Department for Work and Pensions has taken vigorous action to enhance business travel policy. Overall this is projected to produce savings in the region of 40%, measured against last year's expenditure. The DWP's business travel policy actively discourages travel, unless the alternatives have been examined and exhausted and where travel is deemed appropriate, encourages the use of the most cost effective modes of transport.</p>

The assessment is being developed and at this stage, therefore, an assessment is not available of the impact changes could have on existing disability living allowance, or future recipients. We are working with disabled people and organisations that represent them on the detailed design and delivery of personal independence payment and the outcomes from this work will be reflected in updates to the impact assessment for this change.

 As part of the Welfare Reform Bill we have set out our intention to introduce a time limit of one year for those claiming contributory Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and who are placed in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG). The intention is that introduction of the time limit in April 2012 will have an immediate effect on people who are currently claiming contributory ESA as well as new claims after that date. In total the policy is expected to generate annual benefit savings of around £400 million in 2012-13 rising to £1.1 billion by 2014-15.</p>

It shows that all the expected savings in 2012-13 would be eliminated. That is, there would be a cost to the Exchequer of around £420 million in 2012-13. However, there would be no impact on the expected savings from 2013-14 onwards, as subsequent years will remain unchanged since they represent all cases eligible for time limiting, including those that would have become eligible in earlier years.</p>

 The Department holds data covering employment and support allowance (ESA) appeals where the outcome is known and so does not cover appeals that are still ongoing. Detailed information on the reason an ESA appeal was made is not recorded centrally, however it can be inferred that where an appeal outcome is recorded on a claim that was found fit for work at the work capability assessment (WCA), the appeal is against this decision. Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard.</p>

 It is estimated that in steady state, around 25% of all claimants of contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) who are assessed to be in the work related activity group at initial assessment, will leave ESA within one year, so before the proposed time limit is applied. This does not include people who leave ESA before they are assessed using the work capability assessment and are therefore not assigned to the work related activity group or support group.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. Incapacity benefit was introduced in April 1995. The start dates of claims transferred from invalidity benefit are not reliable, therefore breakdowns of longer durations are not available until August 2000.
2. Figures from 5% samples have been uprated using 100% WPLS totals.
3. Figures from 5% samples have been rounded to the nearest 100 and 100% figures to the nearest 10. Some additional disclosure has been applied.
4. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
5. From 6 April 2001, no new claims to severe disablement allowance were accepted. In addition, incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance (ESA) for new claims from 27 October 2008.
6. Data is available on the Department’s tabulation tool at:

<i>Notes</i>:
1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10/
2. To qualify for incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called a personal capability assessment. Under the employment and support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients have begun also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming IB or ESA on the basis of mental and behavioural disorders would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the personal/work capability assessment.
3. Data include people in receipt of benefit and also those who fail the contributions conditions but receive a national insurance credit, i.e. ‘credits only cases’.
4. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment support allowance (ESA) from October 2008.
5. Data by medical condition for ESA is only available from 2010.
6. Data are published on
www.nomisweb.co.uk

 There is insufficient evidence to allow a reliable estimate to be made. HSE carried out a survey into high workplace temperatures in 2009, to which 2,933 responses were submitted. This offered no evidence of significant numbers of illnesses caused or exacerbated by exposure to high temperatures in the course of their employment. At the time of this survey, HSE contacted the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, as they monitor scientific reports and publications about occupational diseases. They reported that no research or evidence on the effect of heat at work on certain occupations has been brought to their attention.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and Family Expenditure Survey (FES). The FRS and FES uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. These statistics are based on incomes Before Housing Costs.
6. Relative poverty is defined as children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.
7. FRS figures are for Great Britain up to 1997/98, and for the United Kingdom from 1998-99, with estimates for Northern Ireland imputed for the years 1998/99 through 2001-02. The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years.
8. FES figures are for the United Kingdom. These are single calendar years for 1979, 1981, and 1987; two combined calendar years from 1988 to 1993 and two financial years combined from 1993-94 to 1994-95.
9. These statistics are publicly available in the Households Below Average Income Report on the DWP website:

 The number of vacancies across the civil service (requiring security clearances or otherwise) is not collected centrally and would be available only at disproportionate cost. The Cabinet Office continues to receive correspondence from MPs and members of the public, and telephone queries, regarding instances of recruitment agencies specifying that an existing security clearance is required to apply for a vacancy.

Since June 2010, 241 vacancy details have been forwarded to the mailbox where individuals felt that the recruiter should not have required an existing national security clearance.

The pledge aims to inspire others to consider how they might be able to support their communities to benefit themselves, as well as their chosen organisations.</p>

 Firstly, we are centralising the procurement of common goods and services. For each category of spend there will be a single supply strategy so we can significantly reduce spend through aggregation, standardisation and rationalisation.</p>

               <a name="11060879000078"> Secondly, since July 2010 I have initiated a series of negotiations with over 50 of its major suppliers. These discussions identified and delivered savings of over £800 million in 2010-11. High level negotiations are being undertaken on a 'once for government' portfolio basis, taking account of other work to achieve savings eg the Major Projects Review, the ICT moratorium, and the curtailment of discretionary spend.</p>

Crown Representatives will be able to challenge suppliers where there is duplication across these contracts and spot opportunities for synergy and cost removal.</p>

We are now engaged on an implementation programme to apply lean' thinking and techniques to a number of new projects in central Government procurement in order to test these findings to achieve time and cost savings for the benefit of both bidders and the public purse. We will roll out the new approach once the route is proven.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Relative survival is the probability of survival (shown here as a percentage) after correction for other causes of death.
<sup>(2)</sup> Because cancer survival varies with age at diagnosis, the summary survival estimates for all ages combined (15-99 years) have been age-standardised, where possible, to control for changes in the age profile of cancer patients over time.
<sup>(3)</sup> Lung cancer is defined by the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes C33 and C34.
<sup>(4)</sup> Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.
<sup>(5)</sup> It is not possible to give an age-standardised figure if there are too few patients in a given age group to provide a reliable survival estimate or if very few patients actually died in one of the intervals of time since diagnosis in which survival was estimated. That may happen because survival is very high (there are very few deaths) or because it is very low (most of the patients died).

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population, standardised to the European Standard Population. Age-standardised rates are used to allow comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages.
<sup>(2)</sup> Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of art estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.
<sup>(3)</sup> Cause of death for lung cancer was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C33-C34.
<sup>(4)</sup> Figures for England exclude deaths of non-residents.
<sup>(5)</sup> Figures are based on deaths registered in each calendar.

<sup>(2)</sup> Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure. Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two figures.

The support programme also aims to stimulate the development of the mutuals concept in key public services areas in order to catalyse take up of the 'right to provide' through a variety of delivery models.</p>
