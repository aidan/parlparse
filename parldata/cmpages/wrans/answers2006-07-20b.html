Most of this goes through the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). DFID has committed &#163;165 million to the ARTF over the next three years (2006-07 to 2008-09). The ARTF is administered by the World Bank. It reimburses the Government of Afghanistan for expenditures that meet strict eligibility criteria in order to reduce the risk of waste and corruption. The World Bank considers both the type of expenditures and the process by which the money was spent. An independent monitoring agent (currently PricewaterhouseCoopers) monitors and reports on this to ensure it is effective.</p>

 The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Department holds regular meetings with representatives of the principal stakeholder groups for our policy areas and with relevant experts. Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the Department&#146;s formal consultations which abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are generally alerted when a formal consultation is taking place. As required by the code, the Department then gives feedback on the responses received and on how the consultation process influenced the policy decision.</p>

The proposals were also made publicly available on the DCLG and GLA websites. In addition the Minister for London hosted two seminars as part of the overall review, attended by a range of stakeholders. DCLG received 337 consultation responses and a summary of responses was published on 13 July 2006 alongside our conclusions on what new powers the GLA should be given.

The tariffs cover the full range of injuries, physical and mental, likely to affect service personnel. The Scheme is administered by the Veterans Agency which applies the same determination process to all conditions whether physical or mental. An evaluation of all aspects of the first year of operation of the Scheme is currently being carried out involving interested parties, one of which is Combat Stress. The evaluation will be in the light of experience and evidence of cases arising so far, including those who have suffered from mental health issues.</p>

through the United Kingdom National Central Bureau for Interpol (UK NCB) based at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). Other channels may include bi-lateral direct liaison between law enforcement authorities: and formal mutual legal assistance channels. Exchanges of DNA information via these channels will almost always be a response to the needs of a specific criminal investigation.</p>

They are also subject to a risk assessment, taking into account the justification for and proportionality of disclosure of the information in line with human rights. If cleared for processing, a one-off speculative search of the Database is made by the Custodian and information fed back to UK NCB.</p>

This information will be available later this year following the introduction of a new data collection system (this will not apply to retrospective data). However, it is estimated that international DNA searches are requested on two to three occasions each week (this includes requests received from abroad and requests made by the UK for searches in other countries).</p>

The data included from STCs and SCHs is mainly based on a definition of self-harm that includes self-harm incidents which represent significant events such that they are reportable under the Children's Homes Regulations. Two STCs and two SCHs, however, use a definition of self-harm similar to the Prison Service. Some STCs and SCHs were unable to provide this data for the earlier period covered by this Question because either the information was not collected, or only the total number of recorded incidents was collected (i.e. not only self-harm incidents; in which case it represented disproportionate cost to examine each incident report). In the future the YJB will provide clear definitions and recording requirements with respect to self-harm.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
 A new form specifically for reporting self-harm (the F213SH) was introduced in Prison Service establishments in December 2002 (i.e. in prisons, YOIs and juvenile prisons). The rise in reported self-harm from 2003 may therefore partly reflect improved reporting rather than an actual increase in self-harm incidents. Prior to December 2002. Self-harm was reported using the general incident reporting form (the F213), which resulted in significant under-reporting. The data from 2003 onwards cannot therefore be directly compared to earlier years.<br>

 There are now more people in work in the United Kingdom (UK) than ever before, up 130,000 in the last quarter and by 272,000 in the year to June 2006. At 28.94 million this is just over 2.5 million higher than 1997. There are fewer people out of work than in the last quarter and economic inactivity has fallen sharply, down by 121,000. There are currently 2,477,000 people between 50 and state retirement age  <br>

who are recorded as economically inactive in the UK. When people over state pension age are included, this figure rises to 12,176,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para7"><a name="06072056000116">Between 1979 and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits in Great Britain (GB) trebled. Growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly, and in November 2005, there were  2.71 million people claiming incapacity benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. Although 46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age, between 2000 and 2005 the number of people in this age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity benefits caseload.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para8"><a name="06072056000117">Like other age groups, people aged 50 and over will be able to benefit from the rollout of the successful &#147;Pathways to Work&#148; service across Great Britain which will be completed by 2008. Pathways offers new incapacity benefits customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct access to a &#147;Choices Package&#148; of employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any incapacity benefits customer will be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para9"><a name="06072056000118">Also like all other customers, eligible people aged 50 and over, including those above state pension age, can benefit from the range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus, including access to jobs and help and support to find work. This can include programmes such as new deal 25 plus (ND25 plus) which is mandatory for younger participants but can be accessed on a voluntary basis by people above state pension age who are in receipt of pension credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para10"><a name="06072056000119">Additional help is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. new deal 50 plus is a voluntary programme for people who have been in receipt of benefits, including pension credit, for at least six months. It provides people in GB with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment. Once in work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &#163;1,500 for training of which up to &#163;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para11"><a name="06072056000120">People aged 50 and over can also be eligible for help from ND 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance (JSA) for 18 months, who have not previously participated on ND 25 plus, are required to attend the gateway stage of the ND 25 plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50 and over. The IAP provides further support and pre-work training to help people return to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="60720w0014.htm_para12"><a name="06072056000121">Since April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the ND 25 plus IAP for people aged 50-59 who have been claiming JSA for 18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group more extensive help back to work. Interim results are positive and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we intend to commence a phased national rollout.</p>

The help provided will vary depending upon particular needs, not the age group of individuals, or the period of unemployment following redundancy. Typically, this involves the provision of information, advice and guidance about jobs and how best to secure alternative employment. In the case of large-scale redundancies that have a significant impact on the labour market, additional help, for example skills training analysis and job focused training can be provided through the rapid response service. This help is not age related but it is time bound to 12 weeks before and 12 weeks following someone being made redundant. In the event that these redundant workers have not found alternative work within this period they then access all the other Jobcentre Plus services stated. The rapid response service is available in England, Scotland and Wales although different processes apply within each country.</p>

 It is too soon to assess the impact of the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme on international student numbers. This scheme was introduced in June 2005 as part of the Fresh Talent Initiative to help to address the ageing and declining population in Scotland. International students are able to stay in the UK following completion of their studies under the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme. This scheme was extended in May to enable all international students, on completion of a postgraduate degree, or an undergraduate degree in a shortage sector, to work in the UK for up to 12 months. The numbers of international students coming to English higher education institutions to study increased by nearly 60 per cent. between 2000/01 and 2004/05, the latest date for which figures are available. The Government recognise the benefits that international students bring to institutions, to the economy and to the country more generally. We also recognise that the international education market has become more competitive. That is why on 18 April this year the Prime Minister announced the second phase of his international education initiative which is designed to secure the UK&#146;s position as a leader in the field of international education.</p>

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England has estimated the total cost of the 2008 research assessment exercise (RAE) as at least &#163;45 million. Although that is not a disproportionate sum in view of the size of the budgets whose allocation the RAE informs, the bulk of those costs relate to the time that university staff spend preparing for the exercise. One of the main objectives of the consultation proposals on the reform of higher education research assessment and funding that my Department published on 13 June is to devise a system to replace the RAE which continues to promote high-quality research but frees researchers from the administrative burdens associated with the RAE, allowing more of their time to be spent on academic work.</p>

 The Student Loans Company does not contact individual borrowers on this basis as it does not know what an individual's income is and consequently whether they should be making repayments or not.

 Sure Start Hollinwood was set up in 1999 and became a children&#146;s centre in 2004. Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) carried out their own evaluations assessing progress against a range of outcomes for children, including educational attainment, as part of their local level monitoring and evaluation. Sure Start Hollinwood&#146;s evaluation of its first three years of operation and its other reports can be obtained directly from the programme or from the National Evaluation of Sure Start website www.ness.bbk.ac.uk. The Three-Year Evaluation showed how the programme had developed regular 10 week family literacy courses for children and their carers; supported four independent community based pre-schools allowing them to improve their curriculum and ran a six week group for children aged between 12 and 18 months providing parents with ideas on how they could help their children&#146;s early communication and allowing them to borrow &#145;chat bags&#146; containing a book, nursery rhyme tape and musical instrument.</p>

It is too early yet to see an impact on educational attainment as the children being tracked through the evaluation are only just three years old. However, this is being assessed and results on this will be available in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="60720w0019.htm_para1"><a name="0607215000689">NESS is also looking at if and how the characteristics of SSLP communities change over time and early analysis shows that achievement at Key Stage 2 in Maths and English and proportion of children achieving five GCSEs A*-C has improved for children in Round 1-4 SSLP areas faster than in England though this cannot be attributed to Sure Start.</p>

 The General Dental Council, which is responsible for the registration of dentists practising in the United Kingdom, is bound by the provisions of European Union (EU) sectoral directive on dentistry, which governs recognition of dental qualifications. As with the directives relating to other professions, the intention is to facilitate the movement of professionals within Europe. Where an EU national and his or her spouse (who is not originally from the EEA) move between member states, the directive provides for an assessment as to whether the spouse&#146;s professional qualifications can be considered equivalent to a European qualification. EU law does not, however, allow such an assessment if they remain in the country in which they normally reside. A non-EEA national can still obtain full registration in the UK through the General Dental Council&#146;s international qualifying examination.</p>

 The Department allocated &#163;3 million revenue (&#163;214,000 each), on a non-recurrent basis in 2005-06, to 14 strategic health authorities (SHAs). Analyses by the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) in 2005 identified these SHAs, as listed as follows, as having the least available dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning capacity. The funding was allocated for the purchase of DXA scans, rather than DXA scanning equipment. Scans were mainly to be purchased from independent sector (IS) providers, but also from national health service providers where this represented better value for money. Expenditure against these allocations has not been monitored centrally, but it will be subject to audit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_492"><a name="60720w0021.htm_para4"><a name="06072111000350">The Department&#146;s statistical note of May 2005, &#147;Elimination of mixed-sex hospital accommodation&#148;, shows that 99 per cent. of mental health trusts and primary care trusts which provide mental health services meet these single-sex accommodation objectives. We are working closely with the remaining trusts to ensure that they achieve the necessary standards as quickly as possible. This is available on the Department&#146;s website at: www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/ll/21/41/04112141.pdf</p>

<p><a name="stpa_493"><a name="60720w0021.htm_para5"><a name="06072111000351">In 2005, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidelines on the management of violence in inpatient settings. Revised guidance on the management of aggression and violence is due to be published in September 2006 by the Care Service Improvement Partnership (CSIP), and this will also address issues of sexual safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="60720w0021.htm_para6"><a name="06072111000352">The Healthcare Commission will include safety and the physical environment in their improvement review on acute inpatient care, commencing in autumn 2006 and reporting in 2007. The Healthcare Commission will also include sexual safety in its review of inpatient mental health services due to be carried out in spring 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="60720w0021.htm_para7"><a name="06072111000353">In addition, the Department will participate in national programmes which will build on existing initiatives of protecting vulnerable patients in mental health services with CSIP, the National Patient Safety Agency, and other agencies to ensure that reporting and appropriate investigation of all such incidents occurs. For example, CSIP together with the current joint Home Office/Department programme on domestic and sexual violence will discuss with mental health trusts what type of guidance is most needed to help support this.</p>

Chemotherapy patients are similarly exempted from the cost of car parking if their stay is longer than four hours.

 The number of domestic violence incidents reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland is given in the following table. There is no official breakdown available by gender but it is known that women are the victims in the majority of reported cases. A strategy for addressing domestic violence in Northern Ireland, &#147;Tackling Violence at Home&#148;, was launched in October 2005. The strategy is aimed at providing protection and support to all victims of domestic violence, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. All victims can seek information and advice through the 24-Hour Free-phone Domestic Violence Helpline which handles over 20,000 calls each year. Any victim of a domestic assault can seek protection  <br>

from the police who will investigate, arrest the alleged abuser if power exists and prosecute where there is evidence of a crime. The police have trained Domestic Violence Officers in each District Command Unit. Alternatively a victim can apply to a court for a civil order (a non-molestation order and/or an occupation order) to prevent further abuse or exclude the abuser from the family home. There are 12 Women&#146;s Aid Refuges in operation across Northern Ireland for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Local Women&#146;s Aid Groups also provide a range of other services for women, including outreach and floating support for women who wish to remain in their own homes.</p>

Northern Ireland Electricity distributes energy efficiency light bulbs (CFLs) through the Energy Saving Trust Advice Centre, Energy Efficiency Levy projects and the Warm Homes Scheme. Eligible households receive four light bulbs. NIE aim to distribute over 97,000 energy efficient light bulbs this year.</p>

These actions promote and encourage the use of energy efficient light bulbs.</p>
