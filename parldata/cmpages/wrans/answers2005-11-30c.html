 Both pneumococcal vaccines used to vaccinate children and older people in clinical risk groups, including adults over 65 years have been shown to provide protection against pneumococcal bacteraemia. In the case of the vaccine that is recommended for children under five years who are in a risk group, the vaccine also provides protection against non-bacteraemic infections such as pneumonia and ear infections.

 There are little data available on this issue. There is good evidence that the 1918 pandemic virus arose from random mutation giving rise to a new human virus. There is also good evidence that the 1957 and 1968 pandemic viruses arose from reassortment between a human virus and an animal virus. At this time, it is impossible to determine how a new human pandemic virus might be created and which influenza strains might be involved in the reassortment.

Apart from the changing patterns of migration, other factors for increasing rates of TB include increased opportunities for international travel; homelessness in inner cities and increasing alcohol and other substance misuse. Also, HIV infection weakens a person&#039;s immunity to TB, although this only accounts for a small proportion, around 3 per cent. of the total.

It can colonise most habitats, expanding rapidly and excluding other plants. It can also damage property (and therefore needs to be cleared from development sites) and cause problems in terms of flood management. Material containing Japanese knotweed is treated as controlled waste under the Environmental Protection Act 1 990 to help prevent its further spread.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51130w05.html_spnew7"><b> Jim Knight  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 November 2005]:</i> The Government have decided against introducing a retirement scheme for farmers as it would not provide value for money compared with the large costs likely to be involved and would offer little public benefit&#151;a view shared by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. In addition, funding a retirement incentive scheme could mean having to close down or shrink other grant schemes, which are providing valuable public benefits such as the agri-environment schemes.

<p>
<a name="51130w05.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_44">Research commissioned by Defra on entry to and exit from farming in the UK concluded that entry and exit decisions are generally rational and driven by strong market forces and personal motivations.

<a name="stpa_46">However Defra is supporting an industry-led initiative called fresh start. Fresh start aims to secure a sustainable future for farming in England through encouraging new entrants into farming. A further element of the fresh start initiative is to stimulate existing farmers to think about how they might respond to the changes brought about by CAP reform, whether this means expanding their business, diversifying into other activities or retiring from the industry. Such choices will serve to create opportunities for new entrants wishing to develop their careers in the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51130w05.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_47">As part of fresh start, Defra has produced a detailed information pack designed to support professional agricultural advisers when discussing retirement and other exit options with their farmer clients. The pack provides an overview of all the issues that need to be considered as part of the process of planning for what may be a radical change, whether that be a transition to retirement or a move to another career.

<sup>(8)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>





Notes:<br>

1. Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

2. The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly&quot; 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

<sup>(29)</sup> The adjusted defence budget was used when the department reported under a cash regime to provide consistent figures for defence spending. For further details please refer to Footnote 6 of table 1.1, UK Defence Statistics 2001.<br>

<sup>(30)</sup> During 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;03 the Department introduced resource accounting and budgeting (RAB) in two stages. To provide roughly comparable figures with pre and post full RAB the net cash requirement to represent the defence budget&quot;. The net cash requirement (NCR) is the actual money that MOD requests from the Government in order to fund its activities. The NCR takes account of movements in working capital levels (debtors, creditors, stock) whilst excluding ail non-cash costs.<br>

<sup>(31)</sup> Following the full introduction of RAB, the Defence Spending&quot; line from UK Defence Statistics Table 1.1a has been employed (UK Defence Statistics 2005, page 14).<br>

 This Government want all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of all primary and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality child care; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer through schools. This will include determining how many primary and secondary schools develop access to the core offer in each year. On 29 September 2005 my Department published its report on the baseline survey of extended services in schools which it commissioned earlier in the year. The survey showed that nationally the

Of the &#163;680 million to be allocated across 2006&#150;08, &#163;250 million will go direct to schools through the School Standards Grant and the formula for calculating each school&#039;s allocation for 2006&#150;07 will be announced in the near future. The remaining &#163;430 million will be distributed to local authorities through the Standards Fund and the General Sure Start Grant. Of this Wakefield will receive &#163;1,203,051 in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;1,453,835 in 2007&#150;08.

Friend with the information requested for sixth form colleges, further education colleges and the revenue information for schools sixth forms since 2002&#150;03.

However, we are not able to provide details of capital spend for schools sixth forms as capital allocations for investment in schools have not separately identified funding for sixth form provision. Decisions on priorities for capital investment in schools have been taken locally in accordance with local asset management plans.

Further funding for schools with sixth forms has been provided to authorities through grants such as the School Standards Grant and the Standards Fund. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the funding through formula or grants has been directed towards sixth forms since it is for the authority to decide how much funding an individual school receives, and a school to direct appropriate resources towards its sixth form. Any apportionment is likely to be inaccurate.

<p>
<a name="51130w14.html_para12">
I should like to follow up some of the related questions put to Chris Banks and me by your colleagues on the Select Committee last week.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_144">We discussed the findings of the Learning and Skills Development Agency&#039;s research into the funding gap for full-time 16&#150;18 year old learners in schools and colleges. The report found that had FE colleges been funded on the same basis as school sixth forms, they would have received an additional 13%.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_145">However, it did not suggest that simply uplifting college funding rates is the way to level the playing field, as the gap in the actual funding rate is only just over 2%. A large part of the difference is caused by technical issues such as special pensions arrangements for teachers in schools, differences in the way that data (particularly learner number information) is collected and used, and the impact of the Government&#039;s &#039;real terms guarantee&#039; which stated that no school that maintained its student numbers would receive less funding in real terms under the LSC funding formula than under the previous LEA arrangements.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_146">Today around one in seven schools still benefits from this guarantee by receiving more than they would under the LSC formula.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_147">As Chris and I said last week, the funding inequity is one of the issues that the LSC&#039;s agenda for change&quot; programme aims to address. When Sir David Normington and I gave evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts in October, Sir David reiterated the Government&#039;s commitment to narrowing the gap, but he noted that any changes must be carefully planned and rolled out so as not to destabilise the school system by simply taking money away from them to give to the colleges. By its very nature this process cannot be a quick one, but with our new funding arrangements we will make progress.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_148">Finally, I should like to touch briefly on your concerns about funding for adult learning. I know that Liz Davis has written to you to explain the funding issues and I understand that Warrington Collegiate has historically taken a very inclusive approach to fee setting in order to ensure that those who are most in need of learning continue to be able to access it. Colleagues at the local LSC, together with the two colleges and Warrington Borough Council&#039;s community services department, met recently to discuss the best way to manage the impact of future changes and developments in adult learning in Warrington.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_149">Although this group&#039;s discussions are at an early stage I have asked Liz to ensure that you are kept informed of progress over the coming weeks.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_150">If you would like to discuss this or any of the matters in this letter in more detail I know that Liz would be pleased to meet with you at your convenience. Liz can be contacted on 01606 320022.</p>

<a name="stpa_176">The internet is regulated by the application of existing law, which applies equally online and offline. It is an offence to sell seventeen offensive weapons, in addition to flick knives and gravity knives to a person of any age; to market a knife in a way which suggests it is suitable for combat; and to sell a knife to a person under 16. We are raising this to 18 in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament.

We are constantly striving to improve the service the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) provides to Members. During October I held a series of three meetings with newly-elected Members and those who write most often on IND-related matters. These meetings were intended as an opportunity for Members to tell me how IND needs to improve its communications with them.

 The realigned contract between EDS and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) consolidates the contractual arrangements with EDS which the Department inherited from the Department of Social Security and Employment Service of the Department for Education and Employment, with a single end date of 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51130w30.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_221">The realigned contract will radically simplify both parties&#039; administration costs and deliver efficiencies and cost savings. On average, over the next five years, the Department will be spending around &#163;520 million a year on services delivered by EDS, compared to more than &#163;700 million a year spent since the DWP was created.

This has led to a methodology for estimating fraud and error significantly different from that used before and it was therefore appropriate to use a new baseline figure for 2005&#150;06, which will be measured using this new methodology.

Notes:<br>

1.Figures are provided using a three-year rolled average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year on year changes. Hence, figures are not consistent with previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. Due to this, the absolute and relative figures in 1996&#150;97 to 1998&#150;99 will not necessarily match. In circumstances such as a change in trend, rolled-averages will show less variation than single year estimates.<br>

2.The estimates use the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#039;Households Below Average Income&#039; (HBAI). Income is net of income tax and council tax, and adjusted for household size and composition.<br>

3.Numbers are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>

<a name="stpa_248">The Northern Ireland Office, in partnership with RoSPA, the Northern Ireland Home Accident Council and statutory bodies such as the Fire and Rescue Service, the Ambulance Service and the PSNI, has supported the promotion of firework safety publicity material for a number of years. The safety campaign for 2005 involved less publicity than previously, in particular there was no intensive advertising campaign. This was because there are effective controls on the sale and use of fireworks in NI and the significantly reduced accident statistics of recent years demonstrate that the message has got across to the public. An intensive advertising campaign was therefore not considered necessary.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the impact of the use in England and Wales of intelligence obtained by torture upon <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom&#039;s international standing and reputation and <i>(b)</i> the effectiveness of British foreign policy.

<p><a name="st_347"><a name="51130w41.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The Government, including the intelligence and security agencies, never uses torture for any purposes, including to obtain information. Nor would we instigate others to do so. Where we are helping other countries to develop their own counter-terrorism capability, we ensure that our training or other assistance promotes human rights compliance. Our rejection of the use of torture is well known by our liaison partners.

 We work closely with other members of the international community regarding the long-running conflict on Northern Uganda. Our dialogue includes discussion of the recent historic step by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue its first arrest warrants for five Lord&#039;s Resistance Army commanders. The UK is a strong supporter of the work

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the impact of the issuing of warrants against leaders of the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army by the International Criminal Court on the policy of amnesty previously advanced by the Ugandan authorities.  [33103]</p>








<p><a name="st_349"><a name="51130w41.html_spnew2"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The recent historic decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue its first arrest warrants for five Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA) commanders is an important step towards ending impunity for the most horrific crimes committed in this brutal conflict. We are pressing governments in the region to take action against those subject to arrest warrants.

<p>
<a name="51130w41.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_281">The Government of Uganda has assured us that their amnesty policy remains in place for all those LRA members not subject to ICC arrest warrants. There are various programmes in northern Uganda actively encouraging these LRA members to take advantage of the amnesty and rehabilitation and reintegration programmes.
