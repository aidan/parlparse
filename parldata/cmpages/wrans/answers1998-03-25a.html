<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will arrange for remand prisoners charged with <i>(a)</i> murder and <i>(b)</i> other serious offences to be held in custody other than at HMP Maze. [35194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Only those prisoners who are connected with paramilitary organisations and who request to be held at HMP Maze are held there. Other remand prisoners--including those charged with non-terrorists murders and other serious offences--are held in HMP Maghaberry. Young Offenders are held on remand at HM Young Offenders Centre. Remand prisoners requiring to be held in segregated conditions will continue to be held in HMP Maze.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the Electronic Systems Division at the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston was set up; what is the purpose of this division; how many series of technical papers or reports are currently being produced by this division; and what are the names of each series.  [35368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Electronic Systems Division existed from the 1950s until 1972. Work on electronic systems currently forms part of the activities of AWE's Systems Engineering Department, which designs and develops electrical and electronic systems for warhead and communications projects. The Department does not produce papers or reports in named series.

<a name="80325w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Ex Gratia Payments</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Grogan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what criteria are used by the Ministry to determine whether ex gratia payments should be made to ex-service personnel who have sustained serious injuries during their service in the armed forces;  [35731]
<P>
<UL>(2) what is the number and total value of ex gratia payments made to ex-service personnel in respect of injuries they sustained during their service in the armed forces in each of the last 10 years.  [35720]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 An ex gratia payment is one made where no legal liability to pay exists. Except for two special categories of claim, relating to injuries sustained by criminal activity overseas and accidental injuries sustained by Service personnel voluntarily involved in research trials, it is my Department's policy to consider claims for compensation from ex-Service personnel only 



<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 1998 : Column: 138</I><P>
on the basis of its legal liability. With the exception of the two schemes mentioned above, no criteria exist for assessing whether ex gratia payments should be made. No ex gratia payments have been made by my Department to ex-Service personnel in respect of injuries sustained during their service in the ten year period ending 31 December 1997.

<a name="80325w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Low Flying</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what percentage of low-flying sorties over Powys were crewed by flight staff from other countries in 1997; and if he will make a statement;  [35918]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of low-flying sorties over Powys were the result of overseas trade deals in 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [35919]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. It remains our policy to distribute military low-flying activity as widely and equitably as practicable. In 1997, sorties flown by non-UK based foreign aircraft and UK-based USAF aircraft made up 5 per cent. of the overall number of low-flying sorties flown in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Sarwar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service personnel were medically discharged from the armed forces <i>(a)</i> between 1980 to 1989 and <i>(b)</i> since 1990.  [35897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The following number of medical discharges for the armed forces have been reported by the services from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 1997 as at 23 March 1998.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Wareing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 9 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>48,</i> on a veterans' unit, if he will make a statement on the discussions he had with the Secretary General of the Royal British Legion.  [36083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I had a very useful meeting with the Secretary General of the Royal British Legion on 11 March to discuss his organisation's current views on how best to improve the handling of ex-Service affairs. My Department will be looking closely at options for approaching the wider question of matters relating to the ex-Service community in the light of these discussions.

<a name="80325w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Nuclear Accident Exercises</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the scenario of a nuclear weapon accident exercise entitled Pantograph which took place in 1988; on what dates and where the exercise took place; and if he will place a copy of the results of this exercise in the Library.  [35367]




<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 1998 : Column: 139</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Exercise PANTOGRAPH took place at RAF Hullavington in May 1988. The exercise tested the procedures in place for responding to the crash of a transport aircraft carrying nuclear weapons. A classified report on the exercise does exist, but for the reasons given by my hon. Friend in answer to the hon. Member on 31 July 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>470,</i> and under Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, I am not prepared to release the report.

<a name="80325w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Precision-guided Weapons</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 9 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>71,</i> on precision guided weapons, which countries have been supplied with multi-spectral smoke by UK companies.  [30244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80325w01.html_para0">The Department of Trade and Industry does not compile records of actual exports to any destination.
<P>

<a name="80325w01.html_para1">The export of military smoke projectors and generators is controlled under entry ML2 of the Export of Goods (Control) Order (this is known as the "rating" of these goods). The export of munitions containing smoke is controlled under entries ML3, ML4 and possibly PL5030. The export of vehicles, vessels or aircraft incorporating smoke projectors or generators is controlled under entries ML6, ML9, and ML10 respectively. The export of specialised devices or generators for military training is controlled under entry ML14.
<P>

<a name="80325w01.html_para2">Many licences have been issued covering goods with these ratings. It would entail disproportionate cost to determine which, if any, covered equipment containing or capable of generating or projecting multispectral smoke.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 1998]:</i> The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated and the results are as follows. At 6 February 1998, decisions had not been taken on 1,469 applications for standard individual licences and 117 applications for open individual licences received since 1 September 1997 to export goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order (the so-called "Military List").

 As part of the OECD's review of the relationship between the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) and environmental regulation, which was requested by the UK, the OECD Secretariat has prepared a draft paper on the relationship between the MAI and MEAs.

 All negotiators agree that the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) must not undermine normal government regulation, including in the fields of labour standards and the environment. The UK and several other countries are pressing for a requirement that labour and environmental regulations should not be waived to attract particular investments.

 New draft text on compensation and expropriation was tabled in negotiations on 17 March in response to fears that an earlier draft was too widely drawn. This makes clear that Parties will not be required to pay compensation for losses arising from normal government activity such as regulation and revenue- raising.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade how long on average it takes to obtain an export licence to export humanitarian products to Iraq; what proportion of that time is taken waiting for a decision from the UN; what was <i>(a)</i> the longest and <i>(b)</i> the shortest time taken to grant an application for such a licence in the last 12 months; what was (i) the longest and (ii) the shortest time taken by the UN in processing an application referred to them by her Department over the same 12 months; and if there is any difference between the time taken to process applications made by recognised charities and commercial concerns.  [35083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Export Control Organisation of the Department does not record the average length of time it takes to process an export licence application, and it would entail disproportionate cost to find the longest and shortest times taken in the last 12 months to process applications to export humanitarian products to Iraq.
<P>

<a name="80325w03.html_para3">Typically, the Department has been notified of the United Nations Sanctions Committee's decisions three to four weeks after submission, but this can vary a great deal from case to case. The Department does not compile records of the time taken between submission to the Committee of an application by the UK Mission to the United Nations and notification of its decision. The Sanctions Committee has recently completed a review designed to streamline its consideration of applications.
<P>

<a name="80325w03.html_para4">In processing applications, the Department makes no distinction between recognised charities and other applicants. However, where a UN aid agency, such as UNICEF or the World Health Organisation, is acting as the consignee, the agency can seek approval from the Sanctions Committee before the exporter applies for an export licence, which is likely to reduce the processing time within the Department of Trade and Industry.

 Water, energy and telecommunications are among the essentials of everyday life. The public expect and have a right to an efficient supply of these services, on fair terms. The Government are determined to ensure that the regulatory framework delivers this.
<P>

<a name="80325w04.html_para0">That is why I announced a review of regulation of the gas, water, electricity and telecommunications utilities on 30 June 1997. I am today publishing the results of this review in a Green Paper, "A Fair Deal for Consumers: Modernising the Framework for Utility Regulation".
<P>

<a name="80325w04.html_para1">Effective regulation should ensure that the consumer comes first. It should do this by providing incentives to innovate and improve efficiency; by driving competition to push service standards up and prices down; by protecting consumers where the discipline of competition is insufficient; and by providing a framework which will ensure that these industries contribute to a better environment and quality of life, capable of being shared by all sectors of society, and by future generations.
<P>

<a name="80325w04.html_para2">The privatised utilities were sold too cheaply, and price controls set by the previous Government on privatisation were too lax. The result was a bad deal for consumers and for taxpayers. The Windfall Tax put right the mistakes of the past. It is time now to learn lessons from the existing regulatory regime--both its strengths and its weaknesses--to ensure that consumers are better served in future. We need to anticipate changes in market structures such as the development of multi-utility companies, the rapid emergence of competition in energy supply, and the impact of liberalisation in telecommunications. We also need to build confidence in the regulatory system by improving the transparency, consistency and accountability of the process.

These estimates do not take account of any consequential changes in earthwork quantities due to the different pavement thicknesses.
<BR>
There are no plans to resurface the concrete section with (HRA) and in any event there may be difficulties in doing so because the thickness of the (HRA) surfacing required would affect the drainage design, the height of the safety barriers and the headroom at bridges; major work could be required to overcome the problems.

If the concrete carriageway were to be overloaded with a thin surfacing such as SMA the estimated cost would be &#163;1.4 million (excluding VAT, any preliminaries, insurances, drainage and maintenance costs).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what process of consultation and policy development will be undertaken by the Public Carriage Office in developing topographical training and testing for licensed private hire vehicle drivers under his Department's proposals to license minicabs in London; which organisations will be formally included in the consultation process; and if testing procedures for private hire vehicles will also apply to licensed taxi drivers.

 It is envisaged that there will be consultation with appropriate organisations on topographical knowledge testing as on other aspects of licensing arrangements. The details are for consideration once the necessary legislation is in place.

 The Department is not at present conducting a programme of pilot schemes examining this topic. With London Transport, it has studied the reductions in the volume of road traffic when roads happened to be closed or their capacity restricted for a variety of purposes. The results were published on 11 March 1998 in a summary report entitled "Traffic Impact of Highway Capacity Reductions", a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. The study did not analyse the relationship between increased journey times and the volume of traffic.

Existing franchise agreements require operators to address expected demand for services and to demonstrate improving levels of customer satisfaction.

 The impacts of bracken control have been studied by my Department, as well as by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the statutory conservation agencies and voluntary sector organisations such as Butterfly Conservation. Although bracken can form important habitat for some flora and fauna such as rare butterflies--notably Fritillaries--it is an invasive weed and needs to be considered in terms of the vegetation and faunal communities which it is replacing. It may also displace livestock on to adjacent heather moorland contributing to overgrazing of this habitat. The studies point to a targeted rather than a blanket approach to bracken control, with judicious decisions on a site by site basis taking into account the value of the area for biodiversity and locally agreed management objectives.

The smallest geographical area for which unemployment rates are produced are travel to work areas which approximate to self-contained labour markets. Official unemployment rates are therefore produced for the Heathrow and Greater London travel to work area but not at borough, ward or Urban Development (UDA) level.<P>

Unemployment rates for the London Docklands UDA have been calculated using the estimated count of unemployment for the UDA (using official unemployment counts) and dividing this by the known or estimated economically active population.<P>

Employment rates are based on residents in employment (including self employed) as a percentage of the economically active population.<P>

In July 1991 there were an estimated 3,533 UDA residents who were unemployed; by December 1997 the count of unemployment was estimated to be 2,883. Over the same time period the population has more than doubled.<P>

 Where water abstractions are damaging sites specially protected under the EC Habitats and Birds Directives, or by designation as SSSIs, the Environment Agency should seek voluntary agreements for reductions with the abstractors wherever possible. Where that is not possible, the Environment Agency should use its existing powers, on a clearly prioritised basis, to vary or revoke the relevant licences, and be prepared to pay compensation where necessary.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A comprehensive review of DLA and Attendance Allowance (AA) claim packs was undertaken by a dedicated project team over a two year period up until November 1997.

As a result, ten pages were removed from the DLA claim pack.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Additionally a child specific claim pack was introduced in April 1997. This was as a direct response to requests from the disability lobby. Liaison was undertaken with some 30 disability groups of and for disabled people.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since the revisions to DLA adult packs and the introduction of the child specific pack the Disability Benefits Directorate has not received any representations regarding the length or complexity of claim packs. In a survey to our customers following the changes to the DLA claim pack it was confirmed that the revised versions were a significant improvement on their predecessors.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are no current plans to review the DLA claim pack given the period of time over which the last review was conducted, the organisations with whom liaison was undertaken and the relatively recent conclusion of such work.

<P>
<a name="80325w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Benefit Integrity Project aims to ensure that those in receipt of Disability Living Allowance are entitled to it. While it is right to check that people are receiving the correct amount of benefit, we are determined that those checks should be undertaken as sensitively as possible--also, that we should ensure all decisions taken as a result of the project are right. We have, therefore, acted to introduce an extra safeguard to improve the quality of, and confidence in, benefit decisions made by the Project.

<P>
<a name="80325w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Swinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what efforts her Department is taking to ensure payment of the winter assistance to pensioners to pensioner households in <i>(a)</i> tenement blocks and <i>(b)</i> blocks of flats;  [35420]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate she has made of the percentage of the total winter assistance payments which <i>(a)</i> have been made and <i>(b)</i> have been made incorrectly to date.  [35421]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for this winter and next, to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners receiving a Retirement Pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80325w08.html_para3">The making of this winter's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around fifteen million computer records, involving fifteen qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million payments will have been made to over seven million pensioner households by the end of March.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of almost ten million winter fuel payments to over seven million pensioner households before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency. Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment of &#163;50 during January.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>computer systems. We expect that every eligible pensioner will have received a payment before the end of March 1998. This has been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In order to determine whether these eligible pensioners were entitled to a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10 it was necessary to undertake an exercise of data correlation of all addresses held in Departmental records. Where only one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;20 was made. Where more than one eligible person was identified as living at an address a payment of &#163;10 was made.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where official records showed that an address contained a number of separate households, for example, numbered flats or bedsits, each separately identifiable unit was treated as a separate address for the purposes of determining the number of eligible pensioners in a household. Therefore, where only one common address was recorded for more than one eligible person, it was not possible to determine which, if any, lived in a household where there was no other eligible person. As a result, some eligible pensioners who live alone or are the only eligible person in a household, but share a common address with other eligible person, will have been sent a payment for &#163;10 when they should have received &#163;20.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The award letter which accompanies the payment clearly explains the entitlement conditions and informs anyone who receives a &#163;10 payment, but satisfies the conditions for a &#163;20 payment, to contact the Benefits Agency Office which deals with their pensions, or to telephone the Winter fuel Helpline, and request the balance. Requests for review of the original decision to pay &#163;10 are being dealt with as a matter of priority, particularly in the case of tenement residents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far, fewer than 10,000 of the &#163;50 payments made during January have been identified as being incorrectly made. I am unable at present to provide you with information which takes into account payments of &#163;20 or &#163;10 made incorrectly. This is due to the fact that those payments are still in the process of being issued. it is anticipated that this information will be available some time after the end of April. I will provide the information requested once it is available.</FONT></UL>

 My Department supports the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity by helping poor people in developing countries to manage and benefit from their biodiversity. Since 1992, we have committed over &#163;185 million in support of a wide range of biodiversity programmes in over 40 developing countries, including management of ecosystems, institution building, research and training and education. We have also committed over &#163;130 million since 1991 to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which is the financial mechanism for the Convention. Since 1991, the GEF has committed over $600 million in support of the Convention, which represents nearly 40% of its total commitments to the global environment.

 Agricultural irrigation has a vital role to play in ensuring future food security, and brings with it direct and indirect benefits, the latter mainly through employment, to poor people. 2.4 billion people living in developing countries depend directly on irrigated agriculture for food. This number will increase. Two thirds of all water extracted from rivers and aquifers is used for irrigation. In developing countries the proportion is even higher. There is increasing awareness of the finite nature of water as a resource, and increasing competition for the use of that water.

 We do not envisage the Freedom of Information Act specifying a fixed sum for what would amount to disproportionate cost or diversion of resources from other priorities. This would depend on the circumstances of the public authority concerned and the nature of the request.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of the Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 24 March; and if he will make a statement.  [36569]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w13.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I chaired the meeting of the Fisheries Council in Brussels on 24 March. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary represented the United Kingdom together with my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office, Lord Sewel.
<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para4">The Council discussed the introduction of a ban on high seas drift nets. Views were divided. The UK, with a majority of other Member States, argued for the phasing out of such nets because of the by-catch problems associated with them, particularly by-catches of dolphins. Several Ministers opposed a ban. However, at the end of the discussion I was able to conclude that there was an expectation that there will be a qualified majority in support of a ban. This helps clear the way for a formal agreement before the end of June. In the meantime, the European Commission will prepare measures such as decommissioning or conversion, to be applied within existing funding provisions, for fishermen affected by the ending of drift netting for tuna, swordfish and other high seas species.




<P>
<P><I>25 Mar 1998 : Column: 185</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para5">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with Belgium voting against, new total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for the North Sea. The six new TACs will help to conserve stocks by extending the quota system to cover anglerfish, megrim, skates and rays, turbot and brill, dab and flounder, lemon sole and witch. The new TACs are precautionary and national quotas are based on historic catches, so confirming large UK shares.
<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para6">Political agreement was reached, with the Netherlands dissenting, on a measure to rationalise by-catch limits for herring in industrial fisheries for other species and to limit industrial fishing for herring to part of the Baltic Sea. No other herring may be used for industrial purposes unless it is first offered for sale for human consumption and fails to find a buyer. Taken together, these measures should help to conserve sensitive herring stocks.
<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para7">The European Commission presented a report reviewing the operation of fisheries monitoring under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and drawing attention to areas where enforcement needs to be strengthened by means of a 3-year action plan. In an orientation debate, the UK supported the introduction of new measures to achieve more effective and more consistent fisheries enforcement. As chairman, I was able to conclude that there was general support for improved enforcement and the Council welcomed the Commission's intention to come forward rapidly with concrete proposals. The Council will return to the subject at its next meeting.
<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para8">The Council unanimously agreed conclusions welcoming pilot regional meetings held during 1997 and calling for the initiative to be developed and extended in 1998. These regional meetings contribute to the UK's objective of increasing the involvement of fishermen in CFP discussions and developing the regional dimension of the CFP.
<P>

<a name="80325w13.html_para9">Finally, the Council unanimously agreed, with Spain abstaining, autonomous tariff quotas for imports of fish products in 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1998]:</i> The Central Science Laboratory (CSL) would seek to retain as many staff as possible if a decision is taken to move the work of the Norwich laboratory to York. CSL would endeavour to avoid compulsory redundancies by seeking to re-deploy non-mobile staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1998]:</i> Capital charging is being introduced across the Government estate from 1 April 1998. Information is therefore only available from that date. The annual cost for Sand Hutton is anticipated to be &#163;7.2 million until the year 2001-02. The Department will bear the full cost of the capital charge as the Agency forms part of the MAFF estate. However, the Central Science Laboratory must recover the full accommodation costs of both sites through charges to customers.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 5 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>728</i>, what reasons underlie the difference between the &#163;133,832,000 cost to his Department of constructing the new Central Science Laboratory at Sand Hutton, York, and its assessed value at 31 March 1997.  [35546]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> The estimate of value as at 31 March 1997 has been prepared for capital charging purposes, on the basis of ongoing operational use, in readiness for the move to resource accounting. The valuation was made on a depreciated replacement cost basis to reflect the building's specialist use, in accordance with HM Treasury's publication "Capital Charging for Property--Accounting Guidance". This requires that, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' Appraisal and Valuation Manual, valuations are based on the estimate of the existing use value of the land and an estimate of the gross replacement cost of the buildings, from which deductions are made to allow for age, condition and functional obsolescence.
<P>

<a name="80325w14.html_para2">There are a number of reasons why a difference can be expected between the estimate of value based on the depreciated replacement cost basis and the realised building cost. The depreciated replacement cost approach assumes that the design is fixed at the beginning of the contract and is built without variation or delay, for example as a result of inclement weather, construction

<P><I>25 Mar 1998 : Column: 188</I><P>
difficulties or design changes in what is a sophisticated and complex building. This impacts on the building costs, the fees and the various overhead items incorporated in the valuation. In accordance with normal practice, VAT has been included with all the cost items but has been reduced in proportion to the extent to which the Central Science Laboratory is able to recover VAT in the services provided to clients. The property valuation also specifically excluded all equipment not of a fixed nature. Off site service provision including electricity, water and drainage is not included in the cost but was reflected indirectly in the land value.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No. Warning statements of this nature are unjustified on any food containing beef, including pork sausages. Labelling rules already require ingredients lists on pork sausages which also contain other meats to declare the presence of each type of meat separately. I consider these rules sufficient to enable consumers to make their own decisions about whether or not they buy particular products.

 The Government believe that the evisceration of New York dressed poultry, whether in the domestic kitchen or in a butcher's shop, could lead to cross contamination of other foods by any foodborne pathogens present, via contamination of the hands of the person carrying out the evisceration and the implements and surfaces used.

 We will continue to test cattle for bovine tuberculosis at intervals of four years, or more frequently where there is perceived to be an increased risk of disease. Regular testing, plus the removal to slaughter of reactor cattle (for which farmers receive compensation) ensure that disease is generally caught at an early stage. Restrictions imposed on the movement of cattle from herds where disease is suspected safeguards against the spread of disease to other herds. We are considering the implementation of the Krebs recommendations which should provide a sound basis for future policy concerning badgers and bovine TB. We will make an announcement when we have considered submissions made during the consultation exercise.

 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> The key principle of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment is that signatories would not generally discriminate on the basis of the ownership of an investment.

 Higher Still is designed to raise standards of achievement in schools and colleges, leading to more passes and better grades. This will be achieved without compromise on standards of assessment.
<P>

<a name="80325w15.html_para2">The benchmark for the new Higher is the existing Higher Grade. I commissioned research on the benchmarking of standards from the Scottish Qualifications Authority.

<P>

<a name="80325w15.html_para4">Quality assurance of both the internal and external elements of Higher Still is a function of the Scottish Qualifications Authority. The Scottish Qualifications Authority will operate a variety of techniques to maintain standards involving, for instance, the benchmarking of external assessment to ensure the maintenance of standards and the moderation of internal assessment in school and colleges. Research carried out by the Scottish Council for Research in Education has shown that the Authority's predecessor (the Scottish Examination Board) was successful in maintaining assessment standards through a period of change in the qualifications structure. I am confident that the Authority will be able to capitalise on this experience and be equally successful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what figure was allowed in <i>(a)</i> percentage and <i>(b)</i> cash terms, for wage rises in GAE, AEF and capping limits to Scottish councils in 1998-99 and in each of the last 10 years; and what the actual increases were in respect of the wage levels for (i) teachers and (ii) other staff. [35843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Pay awards to local authority staff in Scotland are a matter for councils themselves, and no central record of actual pay increases is kept. Whether any allowance was made for wage rises in the local authority settlement by the previous Administration is not a matter for me: actual levels of GAE, AEF and spending for the previous 10 years are given in the table. In setting Government support for council spending and in capping levels for 1998-99, no assumption was made about the level of pay rises in local authorities; the Government's public sector pay policy is that pay increases must be affordable within existing resources.

(21) Budget Estimate<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) does not include expenditure on loan and leasing charges.<P>

2. Prior to 1991 Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) was known as Assessments of Relative Need.<P>

3. Prior to 1991-92 Aggregate External Finance (AEF) was known as Aggregate Exchequer Grant.<P>

4. Aggregate Exchequer Grant consisted of Rate Support Grant and Specific Grants only. The Non-Domestic Rate Income (NDRI) figures have therefore been added to these years for comparison purposes.<P>

5. The above AEF figures are as announced and do not include any subsequent redeterminations.<P>

6. Total net expenditure figures are total non-housing net current expenditure (including loan and leasing charges). For the years 1988-89 to 1995-96 the figures are final outturns, for 1996-97 the figure is a provisional outturn and for 1997-98 it is a budget estimate.<P>

7. No adjustments have been made for changes in local authority responsibility over the period in question.<P>

8. The 1997-98 AEF and expenditure figures include &#163;105.6 million which was paid to local authorities as a special grant (outside AEF) in respect of Strathclyde Passenger Transport. &#163;5.236 million has also been included in the 1998-99 AEF figure for the same purpose.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the countries with which Britain has an extradition treaty.  [35871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w17.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Those countries with which the United Kingdom has extradition arrangements are listed below. The Extradition Act 1989 also enables special extradition arrangements to be made with foreign states with which the United Kingdom has no extradition arrangements. In addition, there are a number of international conventions which allow for the extradition of fugitives between ratifying states for certain serious offences, even in the absence of an extradition arrangement.

 The distribution by income of the take-up of PEPs and TESSAs is not available from Inland Revenue records.

The contributions to the first phase of the review are currently being analysed and a consultation document will be issued later this Spring. A consultation process will follow during 1998. It is too early to speculate on the outcome of the review.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the financial effect on UK charities of the phased withdrawal of tax credits on dividends over a five year period beginning in 1999. [35623]<P>

 What charities might lose will depend on the extent of their UK equity holdings in the years from 1999-2000, the level of dividend payments, and on assumptions about company performance and dividends had my right hon. Friend not undertaken his corporation tax reforms, including significant cuts in companies' tax burdens. Charities will enjoy generous compensation costing up to &#163;1 billion, by reference to their dividend income for 1999-2000 to 2003-2004.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will assess the benefits of bringing the VAT treatment of Church schools into line with that of those run by local education authorities; and if he will make a statement. [35620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80325w20.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The VAT treatment for local education authorities was established to prevent VAT from falling as a burden on local taxation. Church schools are independent bodies and it is therefore not appropriate to extend the same treatment to them.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what figure for the national minimum wage was assumed in the preparation of the Budget.  [35394]<P>

<P>
<a name="80325w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 None.

<a name="80325w20.html_para0">The Government are committed to setting the national minimum wage at a sensible level once they have the advice of the Low Pay Commission, taking into account the effects on employment, inflation and the public finances.
