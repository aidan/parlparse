<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the baseline against which he will measure his target of improving the satisfaction of <i>(a)</i> victims and <i>(b)</i> witnesses with their treatment by the criminal justice system; how that baseline was measured; and how he proposes to measure levels of satisfaction by 31 March 2002.  [125624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The baseline for victim satisfaction is the British Crime Survey 1998.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para0">There is presently no reliable indicator of witness satisfaction. A new cross Criminal Justice System survey on witness satisfaction has accordingly been put in hand. The results will be available in the autumn, enabling a baseline to be set.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para1">Future levels of victims' satisfaction will be measured by the British Crime Survey, and of witness satisfaction by a further survey.

<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_wqn1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has for changes to the 2000-01 Department expenditure limits within his responsibility.  [126025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL), which covers Class IV Vote 1 (Home Office administration, police, probation, immigration and other services, England and Wales) and Vote 2 (Prisons, England and Wales), will be increased by &#163;42,050,000 from &#163;8,068,786,000 to &#163;8,110,836,000.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para2">The changes are the net effect of the following transfers: &#163;1,200,000 to the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Class III Vote 1) in respect of neighbourhood wardens; &#163;20,200,000 from the DEL Reserve for police modernisation; &#163;2,900,000 from the Capital Modernisation Fund for the electronic chipping of goods; and &#163;20,150,000 from the Capital Modernisation Fund for the national strategy for police information systems.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para3">The increases will be offset by a charge on the Reserve and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para4">Changes to the budgeted amount for the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, which includes the costs of dealing with the asylum seekers, have yet to be confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt) of 15 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 53W, on animal experiments, whether the review of section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1966 in the context of freedom of information legislation has been completed; and if he will make a statement.  [125902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 prevents the disclosure of information about the use of animals in scientific procedures that has been provided in confidence. Under the proposals for the Freedom of Information Bill, all statutory bars are being reviewed, including Section 24.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para5">The maintenance of the necessary protection for individual scientists and their research institutions and for the commercial confidentiality of their work is a priority in the review of Section 24.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para6">No decision has yet been taken on whether to repeal or amend Section 24.

[125810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the arrangements are for assessing the suitability of individual retail outlets for receiving vouchers allocated to asylum seekers; what criteria are applied in the assessment; and what monitoring arrangements are in place.  [125119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The retail outlets have been selected to provide a wide range of retail opportunities to asylum seekers. In excess of 19,000 outlets are signed up to the voucher scheme. Sodexho is responsible for the maintenance of this retail network. The National Asylum Support Service monitors the growth of the retail network in terms of overall numbers, geographical spread, and retail mix.

seekers; and what weight is given in that assessment to factors concerning management arrangements and care of the asylum seekers.  [125117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Independent property surveyors were appointed to inspect property proposed by all potential providers prior to contract. An ongoing programme of inspection is in place for all providers to ensure providers maintain acceptable standards.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para8">Potential providers were assessed in terms of their financial standing, nature of accommodation offered, commercial offer and support infrastructure. This process included seeking references from past and present customers and consultation with Local Authority Consortia.
<P>

<a name="00613w01.html_para9">The assessment model for assessing the suitability of contractors includes management arrangements and care of asylum seekers. I am unable to give further details since this information could prejudice negotiations with additional accommodation providers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he has issued to police forces since 1 May 1997 with regard to the implementation and enforcement of firearms legislation; if the guidance suggested a reduction in approval or renewal of firearm licences or shotgun certificates; and if he will place copies in the Library.  [125799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Since 1 May 1997, the Home Office has issued three circulars on firearms licensing matters to all police forces in England and Wales: Home Office Circular (HOC) 32/97 on the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, HOC 68/97 on the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 and HOC 41/98 on the Firearms Rules 1998. In addition, a letter to all chief officers on 19 October 1999 provided guidance on fittedness to possess firearms and a letter to all chief officers of 10 March 2000 provided guidance on the secure storage of firearms.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para0">The Home Office has not suggested to chief officers that the number of firearm and shotgun certificates on issue should be reduced as a matter of policy. Home Office guidance on firearms licensing has always made clear that each case should be dealt with on its own merits. The aim of our controls on firearms is to protect public safety rather than to reduce the overall number of firearms in lawful hands.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para1">Copies of the three Home Office circulars were placed in the Library at the time of their issue. I will arrange for copies of the guidance on security and the guidance on fittedness to be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 When established, the Technical Assistance Centre will be a twenty-four hour facility. Our intention is that it shall be operated by the National Criminal Intelligence Service on behalf of the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies. It will undertake complex processing needed to derive intelligible material from lawfully intercepted computer- to-computer communications and will provide improved facilities for deriving evidence from lawfully seized computer data.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para2">The Technical Assistance Centre will not analyse the intelligible content of any intercepted or seized material. That will remain a function of the agency which applied for the interception warrant or executed the warrant for seizure of the material.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para3">The primary objective of the Technical Assistance Centre will be to sustain law enforcement capabilities in the face of criminal use of new information and communication technologies. Day-to-day operating procedures for the Centre are being developed by a Home Office-led Project Team.

To ask the Solicitor-General how many contested cases were conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service in <i>(a)</i> magistrates courts and <i>(b)</i> Crown courts and <i>(c)</i> in total, in each of the last five years and in the current year to date; and if he will make a statement.  [125312]<P>

<P>
<a name="00613w02.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The following table shows the number of contested hearings recorded by the Crown Prosecution Service in magistrates courts, in the Crown court, and in total, for each of the last five calendar years and for the period January to March 2000.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para7">The table also shows the number of guilty pleas recorded in each period, and the number of magistrates courts cases which were proved in the absence of the defendant. Also shown are the proportion of cases which proceeded to a contested hearing and the proportion dealt with by way of guilty plea and proof in absence.
<P>

<a name="00613w02.html_para8">The overall number of contested hearings dealt with by the Crown Prosecution Service has fallen over the period under review, from 105,707 in 1995 to 82,355 in 1999--a fall of 22.1 per cent. However, the pattern of change in magistrates courts and in the Crown court has been rather different: the proportion of contests in magistrates courts has fallen with each succeeding year, from 9.2 per cent. in 1995 to 6.2 per cent. in 1999; and the proportion of contests in the Crown court has risen over recent years, from 22.8 per cent. in 1997 to 26.9 per cent. in 1999.

<a name="00613w02.html_para9">The reasons for these trends are believed to be as follows:

<a name="00613w02.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has been an increase in the number of magistrates courts cases proved in the absence of the defendant rather than proceeding to a contest, from 92,251 in 1995 to 114,880 in 1999: an increase of 24.5 per cent. Proofs in absence have increased since 1995 largely in response to a simplified procedure for prosecuting minor road traffic offences;

<a name="00613w02.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Plea Before Venue procedure, introduced in November 1997, has led to an increasing number of guilty pleas being entered in magistrates courts rather than in the Crown court. This has had the effect of lowering the proportion of contests in magistrates courts and increasing it in the Crown court.

 I last met the Director General of ATOC on 1 November 1999 when among other topics, we discussed the Transport Bill, railway performance and railway safety. Officials from my Department have met with ATOC to discuss train operator's concerns about station leases, and to explore the extent to which the existing regulatory provision can safeguard against the public interest.

 The Secretary of State has received a number of representations in the context of various reviews of regional planning guidance currently under way and in exercise of his other statutory planning functions. Most recently, I met the leaders of local authorities with strategic planning functions in the South East. I emphasised the Government's commitment to re-use brownfield land and existing buildings before building on greenfields.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of UK incinerators that fail to meet the terms of the EU Waste Incineration Directive.  [125305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> The proposed waste incineration directive, the precise scope of which is yet to be finalised, requires upgrading of incineration plant to the specified standards within five years of its adoption. The consultants Entec UK Ltd. undertook a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed directive to underpin a regulatory and environmental impact assessment, and their report (copies of which are in the House Library) largely identified numbers of incinerators in different sectors, although subsequently we have received information that the report significantly underestimated the number of animal carcase incinerators. The National Farmers Union have suggested there are some 3,000 on-farm small scale animal carcase incinerators.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> Copies of the various drafts of the proposed directive and the cost- benefit analyses DETR commissioned from Entec UK Ltd. were distributed as they arose to the trade representative organisations listed over the period since 1994, as well as to relevant Government Departments and environmental organisations. Trade representative organisations were also invited to meetings with DETR on the following dates: 27 April 1994, 25 September 1997 and 6 October 1998.

<P>
<a name="00613w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> No assessment has been made of the effect of the proposed waste incineration directive on options for disposing of animal carcases in the UK. The Waste Strategy 2000, published on 25 May, indicates that wastes should be managed in accordance with the Best Practicable Environmental Option, and should be disposed of as close to the point of production as possible, consistent with the need for effective environmental controls.

 Our policy is to support road schemes if, after consideration of alternative options and full appraisal, it is concluded they provide sustainable solutions to transport problems and should be accorded priority having regard to available resources. In the case of local roads it is for authorities to justify road schemes as part of their Local Transport Plans.

<a name="00613w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 None. There are strict controls in place to ensure that waste is disposed of without danger to the public or the environment. The responsibility for their enforcement rests with the Environment Agency and, in some circumstances, with local authorities as waste collection authorities and planning authorities.
<P>

<a name="00613w04.html_para0">The Environment Agency is investigating allegations of illegal waste disposal in Worcestershire in co-operation with Worcestershire County Council, Wychavon District Council and, because of the nature of the allegations, the West Mercia Police. The allegations concern activities at Mucknell Farm, Badgers Hill, Crabbe Yard and other locations in central Worcestershire. The purpose of the Environment Agency's investigation is to establish whether the waste management controls of Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 have been contravened and, if there is evidence of contravention, action will be taken in line with the Agency's published Enforcement Policy.

 The Government accept the view put by the then Countryside Commission in section 4 of their publication "Protecting our finest landscapes: advice to Government (1998)", that the landscape qualities of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) are equivalent. Conserving and enhancing the beauty of the landscape are objectives for both types of designation. The Government therefore believe that the protection given to both types of area by the land use planning system should also be equivalent.
<P>

<a name="00613w07.html_para0">The Government's planning policies for AONBs are set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 7: "The Countryside--Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (Revised February 1997)". PPG7 states that:
<P>

<a name="00613w07.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government regards National Park Designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00613w07.html_para2">This reflects the National Park Authorities' primary objective to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the Parks. It does not mean that the landscape beauty of AONBs is in any way inferior to that of National Parks. AONBS should therefore share the highest status of protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty.
<P>

<a name="00613w07.html_para3">In relation to major projects, it is the Government's view that, henceforth, the assessment required in paragraph 4.5 of PPG7 in National Parks should also apply in to proposals for major development in AONBs. Such proposals should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed. Consideration of applications should therefore normally include an assessment of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) the need for the development, in terms of national considerations, and the impact of permitting it or refusing it on the local economy;</FONT></UL>

 I am very pleased to announce today that the Government will shortly bring forward amendments to the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, as part of a series of measures to safeguard the status of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) and provide for their proper protection and management. The amendments will make provision for the creation of Conservation Boards for individual, larger AONBs where this would benefit their cohesive management and where there is local support for such a move. They will also require the adoption of a Management Plan for each AONB.
<P>

<a name="00613w07.html_para5">The Government have already indicated its support for AONBs through increasing the budget available to them, via the Countryside Agency, almost threefold over three years (from &#163;2.1 million in 1998-99 to &#163;5.9 million this year). We will continue to ensure that Government funding is available to work alongside local authorities in managing AONBs in partnership.

 Any compulsory transfer of staff, which occurs as part of the delivery of Best Value, involves local authorities having to consider the question of future pension rights as part of their contract specification and subsequent negotiations. The Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment etc.) Regulations 1999 provide private sector employers, bidding for a contract to deliver local government services, with an option of access to the Local Government Pension Scheme for those staff who transfer under the contract and who remain engaged in the delivery of those services. Alternatively, private sector employers can choose to provide broadly comparable pension arrangements and, within the statutory framework of the Local Government Pension Scheme, can negotiate the fair transfer of the accrued pension rights of the staff involved in the contract who decide not to leave their pension rights in the local authority scheme.
<P>

<a name="00613w07.html_para6">Other transfers which do not come within the prescribed ambit of the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment etc.) Regulations 1999 can be dealt with in a similar way so as to ensure that in all cases transferring staff are treated equitably and fairly.

 The Defence Communication Services Agency (DCSA) was established on 1 April 1998 and is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of communication and information services across Defence. The RAF Signals Engineering Establishment (RAFSEE) was formed in 1982 and became a Defence Agency in November 1994. The DCSA, RAFSEE and a number of non-Agency organisations responsible for aspects of the delivery of communication and information services and supporting activities were brought together to form a single Communication and Information Services and Support (CISS) organisation under the Defence Logistics Organisation on 1 April 2000. In order to strengthen the focus of the overall CISS organisation on service delivery and to reinforce the alignment of the DCSA's responsibility, authority and accountability it has been decided to remove Agency status from the RAFSEE organisation and to expand the DCSA to encompass the entire CISS organisation.

<a name="00613w09.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what precautionary treatment was given to troops deployed to Sierra Leone in respect of malaria before they left the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [125191]




<P>
<P><I>13 Jun 2000 : Column: 562W</I><P>

<P>
<a name="00613w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> For Sierra Leone the most effective anti-malaria drug is considered to be mefloquine and current policy recommends that treatment begins three weeks before personnel are due in the area of risk. This is to allow time for those who cannot tolerate mefloquine to exhibit adverse reactions and be placed on an alternative regimen: the drug itself starts to take preventative effect within 12 hours. Aircrew are not given mefloquine because of the possible side effects which can degrade concentration and coordination. Aircrew, therefore, take chloroquine and proguanil tablets instead, although these do not offer the same degree of protection in Sierra Leone which is a chloroquine resistant area.
<P>

<a name="00613w09.html_para0">Issuing the Spearhead Battalion permanently with mefloquine, as a preventative measure, is not an option since the drug is only licensed for one year's continuous use; long term treatment with mefloquine is not medically advisable. The great majority of personnel deployed to Sierra Leone began taking anti-malaria tablets prior to embarkation although not for the full three weeks because of the short notice to deploy. However, a small number did not begin the preventative course of treatment and arrived in theatre without anti-malaria tablets. The reasons for this are currently being investigated. This omission was quickly remedied by procuring a French anti-malaria drug which was available locally, and this was subsequently replaced by supplies of the preferred British drug.

<P>
<a name="00613w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2000]:</i> All UK forces that deployed to Sierra Leone were advised, in accordance with the Surgeon General's policy, that the preferred anti-malarial drug for ground forces deployed ashore is mefloquine. While most effective, this drug carries a risk of side effects when first taken and, for that reason, personnel carrying out certain operational duties cannot be treated with it. Those forces unable to take mefloquine were advised that the recommended alternative is chloroquine and proguanil. Personnel deployed ashore were also provided with the opportunity to impregnate their uniforms and mosquito nets with mosquito repellent.

 The Department is shortly to enter a competition phase for the selection of a track which might be taken forward into a trials and assessment phase.

<P>

 Compensation arrangements for Service personnel and former Service personnel who suffer illness as a consequence of exposure to asbestos are the same as for those killed or injured or who develop a disease from any other cause attributable to their service. Service personnel were, however, prevented by Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 from suing for compensation until 15 May 1987 when The Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 repealed Section 10. Since then Service personnel have, like any other employee, been entitled to sue the Ministry of Defence for compensation where they have suffered as a result of the Department's negligence. The repeal of Section 10 was not made retrospective. The War Pensions Agency pays compensation to former Service personnel for illness caused before the repeal of Section 10, in the form of a war pension and other allowances.

 We have not received a request from the US regarding the use of any facilities in the UK as part of the proposed US National Missile Defence system. Nor would we expect one until after a US decision to proceed with deployment of the proposed system. We would consider such a request carefully, taking into account a wide range of factors, including a detailed assessment of the proposed nature and duration of any works requested. The question of financial costs associated with proceeding with deployment of the proposed US National Missile Defence system is first and foremost a matter for the US.

 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> The Ministry of Defence collects a wide range of manning and establishment statistics on a regional basis, not all of which are centrally held. Many of these statistics can be analysed on a constituency basis using Geographic Information Systems. It is therefore not possible to give a meaningful list of statistics collected by parliamentary constituency as this would incur disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="00613w11.html_spnew13"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2000]:</i> The average amount of money spent by visitors to the Dome on <i>(a)</i> food and drink and <i>(b)</i> merchandise is just over &#163;3 in both cases. NMEC retains between 20 and 50 per cent., depending on the individual contractual arrangements with suppliers. Where NMEC is the supplier, the percentage depends on its pricing strategy, taking into account value for money and prices in the open market.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if Mr. Yogaratnam of the Meat Hygiene Service had sole responsibility for the Mead Webber plant; to whom in the MHS he reported; what responsibilities he had in respect of other plants at the time he had responsibility for Mead Webber; and how many other plants he had responsibility for.  [122054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that Mr. Yogaratnam was the official veterinary surgeon (OVS) and principal official veterinary surgeon (POVS) for the Mead Webber plant, and as such had sole responsibility for ensuring its full compliance with public health and animal welfare regulations. While contract OVSs were used to provide locum cover during the times that Mr. Yogaratnam carried out his POVS duties, they reported to Mr. Yogaratnam as the responsible OVS and POVS for the Mead Webber abattoir.
<P>

<a name="00613w13.html_para8">Mr. Yogaratnam reported to his line manager, Mr. Ivor Pumfrey, Meat Hygiene Service Regional Director (Wales). Mr. Yogaratnam's technical line manager was Mr. Peter Soul, MHS Director of Operations.
<P>

<a name="00613w13.html_para9">Mr. Yogaratnam was also OVS and POVS at three licensed cutting premises. Mr. Yogaratnam was POVS for 16 other plants in the area. As a POVS he was responsible for contract performance management of Contract OVSs working in 10 other plants in the area.

<a name="00613w13.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason the faxed communication of 24 April from Mr. Webber of Mead Webber to the chief executive of the Meat Hygiene Service asking for an explanation of the changes in the MHS's trimming policy was not <i>(a)</i> acknowledged and <i>(b)</i> answered.  [122068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that as Monday 24 April 2000 was a Bank Holiday, the Meat Hygiene Service offices were closed. Following this, the chief executive of the Meat Hygiene Service was due to be on annual leave until 2 May. However, having been made aware of the situation at the plant operated by Mead Webber Ltd., he returned early and on 28 April 2000 answered Mr. Webber's undated fax which had been sent on 24 April 2000.

<a name="00613w13.html_para10">In his response, the chief executive of the Meat Hygiene Service acknowledged receipt of the fax sent by Mr. Webber and informed him that he had commissioned an investigation into Mr. Webber's concerns and would write again with the conclusions of that investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason the prohibition by Mr. Turner of the Meat Hygiene Service on carcase trimming by the meat inspectors at the Mead Webber plant was reversed on 20 April; and by whom and for what reason the decision was subsequently changed again.  [122057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w13.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) have met with a representative of Mead Webber Ltd. and agreed to an independent inquiry into MHS's actions at Mead Webber and the publication of its findings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 2000]:</i> Statistics collected in the Department are largely by health authority, local authority or National Health Service trust reflecting local lines of responsibility and accountability. The Department publishes a wide range of detail at these levels. Comprehensive information at constituency level could be collected and published only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para0">The Library provides a tailored service for hon. Members; statistics which can often be provided at parliamentary constituency level include economic statistics (employment, unemployment and inactivity), claimant count, employees jobs, average earnings and census data.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para1">Following the publication of the Social Exclusion Unit's report on the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal we are working closely with the Office for National Statistics on improving information across Government at a local level and a consultation report on better information was produced in April 2000. This, along with information which will emerge from the 2001 census will allow a wider range of health data to be available at a local level.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has completed a rapid appraisal on Relenza, which was disseminated to the National Health Service in October 1999. The outcome of NICE's appraisal is therefore already on the public record. A full appraisal is currently being carried out and the revised guidance is expected to be published in October 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate <i>(a)</i> the present and <i>(b)</i> the projected number of sufferers from mental illness in the UK.  [125373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is estimated that about one adult in six in the United Kingdom aged between 16 and 64 suffers from some form of mental illness.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para2">This estimate is based on a survey conducted on adults in Great Britain in 1993. Applying this rate of mental illness to the projected UK population aged 16-64 at mid year 2000 suggests that about six million adults between the ages of 16 to 64 in the UK suffer from some form of mental illness, mainly anxiety and depressive episodes.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para3">It is also estimated that about one child in 10 between the ages of five and 15 suffers from a mental disorder.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para4">The source for the prevalence of mental disorder in children is a survey on the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain in 1999. By applying the survey rate to the mid year UK population aged five to 15, we estimate that about 800,000 children in this age range suffer from some form of mental disorder.
<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para5">There are no equivalent estimates at a national level of the prevalence of mental illness among older people. It is not, therefore, possible to give a reliable figure for the total number who suffer from mental illness in the UK. However research suggests that around 600,000 people aged over 65 in the UK have dementia. Figures for older people with other psychiatric disorders are less precise.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00613w14.html_para6">The Department does not produce projections of the numbers of mental illness sufferers in future years.

 We issued revised guidance in February which makes clear that local authorities can make direct payments for any community care service except permanent residential care, and that they should consider this option for service users from all client groups including those with mental health problems. Officials have been meeting local authority officers to explain how local authorities should plan their direct payment schemes in order to reflect the guidance. The Department is funding the Centre for Mental Health Services Development for a project which will aim to promote independent living by implementing Direct Payments for people experiencing mental distress.

 Mileage and travelling entitlements for National Health Service staff on national contracts are determined by an agreement of the General Whitley Council. A working group of the Council which includes representatives from trades unions and employers is reviewing existing provisions with the aim of recommending new arrangements which are fair to staff, meets service needs and reflects our wider environmental policies. We are aiming to complete these negotiations shortly.

<FONT SIZE=-1><P>

(14) Employment Zones: funding in 1997-98 and 1998-99 was for prototype EZs. The underspends result from the fact that these took longer to set up and develop than anticipated--the first prototype did not start until February 1998. There has been no carry forward of unspent funds within the initiative.<P>

<P>

(15) Sure Start is a cross-departmental programme, which is overseen by a steering group involving Ministers from the Departments of Education and Employment, Health, Social Security, Environment, Transport and the Regions, Culture, Media and Sport and the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Treasury. Spending in the first year was lower than originally planned. The budget for Sure Start is ringfenced and any underspends are automatically carried forward.<P>

<P>

(16) Early Excellence Centres: the programme was established in year in 1997-98, and no money was budgeted, but &#163;0.12 million was spent from savings from the wind up of the Nursery Voucher Scheme and a small contribution from New Deal for Schools. Build up of the programme was phased, resulting in slower draw on allocation than expected. The Manifesto commitment was 25--there are 29 EECs and they are receiving full funding contribution. There has been no carry forward of unspent funds within the initiative.<P>

<P>

(17) New Start: underspends were due to projects taking longer than anticipated to progress. In 1998-99 &#163;0.90 million was carried over to 1999-2000, and is included in the budget figure for that year.<P>

<P>

(18) Millennium Volunteers: although no budget/underspend is shown, &#163;0.4 million was spent and met from the Windfall Tax.<P>

<P>

(19) Community Champions: underspend due to the development and launch of the initiative in year which meant it was not fully under way until January 1999.<P>





(20) Adult and Community Learning Fund: the budget/outturn figures given for 1998-99 do not include the &#163;3.27 million spent on the Laptop Programme for Adult and Community Learning Tutors, which was not part of the original budget. Programme underspend is due to the fact that the initial application process took longer than expected and projects therefore started later in the year. Money for the Adult and Community Learning Fund has been re-profiled over the lifetime of the initiative so that the &#163;20 million originally announced for the fund remains available.<P>

<P>

(21) New Deal for Schools: underspends denote slippage in claiming funds by LEAs. All NDS funds have been allocated to schools. The budget for NDS is ringfenced and any underspends are automatically carried forward.<P>

<a name="00613w16.html_para2">The variation in marking standards between the team leaders and the markers who report to them is measured. This is known as the absolute mark difference (AMD) criterion. This measurement is taken at more than one stage during the marking process--twice for all markers and three times for some markers. The values for each marker are compared with pre-determined bands of marking acceptability and a judgment is made about any corrective action which may be required or, in some cases, the requirement to stop a marker from carrying out any further marking. (In cases where markers are stopped, all scripts from the marker's allocation are re-marked by an approved marker.)
<P>

<a name="00613w16.html_para3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, who are responsible for the development and administration of the National Curriculum on behalf of the Secretary of State, collect the AMD data from all external marking agencies to enable the monitoring of marking variation year-on- year and to establish whether or not the pre-determined bands of marking acceptability require adjustment in future years.

 The Government welcome the contribution which teachers from Australia and New Zealand have made, particularly since the 1980s, and continue to make in English schools. However, they do not seek to replace teachers from particular countries who leave. Rather, we have introduced a range of measures to attract people into teaching, and to encourage those with Qualified Teacher Status who have spent time away from the profession to return. Since we announced &#163;6,000 training salaries and &#163;4,000 new-style "golden hellos" on 30 March, 1,119 more people have applied for postgraduate teacher training than in the same period last year. We are also introducing additional funding to help schools take people onto the Graduate Teacher

 Part II of the Companies Act 1985 provides a mechanism by which a company may alter its status by way of re-registration. There is no similar provision in the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill.
<P>

<a name="00613w17.html_para2">If, therefore, the members of a limited company decide that they wish to cease to trade through their current vehicle--the limited company--and to commence trading through a limited liability partnership, they will have to go through a three stage process. First, they will have to set up the limited liability partnership complying with the conditions set out in the LLP Bill and regulations. Second, they will have to transfer the assets and liabilities of the company to the LLP. This may give rise to transaction and taxation charges; the LLP Bill and regulations do not provide any tax exemptions for such a transfer, nor do they facilitate the transfer in any other way, e.g. by providing for an automatic transfer of assets. Finally, the members of the company would either have to keep the company in being in parallel to the LLP, and so continue to comply with the regulatory requirements set out in the Companies Act 1985, or they would need to seek to wind up the company by a members' voluntary winding up.

1. Numbers are based on a five per cent. sample and are therefore subject to sampling error.<P>

2. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred and expressed to the nearest thousand therefore totals may not sum.<P>

3. Lone parents are defined as single people with dependants not in receipt of a pensioner or disability premium.<P>

4. Numbers do not include lone parents who choose to sign unemployed and are in receipt of Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.<P>

5. In some cases, when claims are first entered on the Income Support Computer System (ISCS), the date of claim was incorrectly input as the date of conversion of the ISCS system. This means that for some cases (which we are unable to identify) the length of claim is inaccurate for claims made before the end of 1992 when the conversion period ended.<P>

6. Lone parents on Income Support with a youngest child aged at least five years 3 months receive NDLP invitation letters. From May 22 lone parents whose youngest child is aged three or four have also started to receive invitation letters.<P>

1. Figures in above table are for Phase 3 of the programme (from 26 October 1998). Information is not available in this format for phases 1 and 2 because results were kept clerically and it is not possible to accurately break them down on a monthly basis.<P>

2. Figures for the most recent months may subsequently rise slightly. This is due to the backdating of jobs gained by leavers to unknown destinations which we subsequently discover have found employment. <P>

 From 2003 we intend to move from the traditional paper-based methods of benefit payment to a more secure and efficient method of paying benefits through Automated Credit Transfer (ACT). All benefit recipients will still be able to collect their cash from the post office after 2003 if they wish, and we anticipate that a number will wish to take advantage of this option.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00613w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department has a policy statement on smoking at work. Its objective is to provide a smoke- free environment at all workplaces and most other areas within its offices not covered by a mandatory ban on smoking.
<P>

<a name="00613w20.html_para3">In practice, the needs of smokers are taken into account, when necessary, by the provision of properly vented smoking rooms isolated from staff working areas when they can be accommodated within the structure of the building; otherwise staff must smoke outside the building.
<P>

<a name="00613w20.html_para4">This policy effectively means that no member of staff is put in a position whereby they are exposed to passive smoking while carrying out their duties on DSS occupied premises.
<P>

<a name="00613w20.html_para5">The proportion of the Department's offices which do not allow smoking anywhere in the building is not known. The decision not to allow smoking will have been taken only after a staff consultation exercise has taken place in each building and either, staff have decided in favour of a total ban, or, suitable accommodation cannot be found in the building to adapt as a smoking room. It is estimated that the number of buildings with a total ban on smoking is low.

 Eligibility for Disability Living Allowance is based on a person's needs, and not on recognition of their specific medical condition. However, guidance available to decision makers includes agoraphobia as a potentially disabling condition, and the eligibility criteria for the lower rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, need for guidance or supervision on unfamiliar routes, may be of particular relevance for people suffering from agoraphobia.

<P>
<a name="00613w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class V, Vote 1, the Lord Chancellor's Department's Departmental Expenditure Limit for 2000-01 will be increased by &#163;10,000,000 from &#163;2,515,609,000 to &#163;2,525,609,000. The increase is in respect of an award from the Capital Modernisation Fund for the "Crown Court Programme".
<P>

<a name="00613w22.html_para0">The increase will be offset by a transfer from the Capital Modernisation Fund and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.
