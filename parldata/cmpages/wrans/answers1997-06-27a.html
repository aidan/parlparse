 Appointment to the Privy Council is an exercise of the prerogative. Appointments are made by Her Majesty The Queen on the advice of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. A range of factors are taken into account. Those appointed mostly comprise Ministers, other Parliamentarians and members of the judiciary.

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many people aged 17 to 25 years are claiming the Jobseeker's Allowance in Portsmouth and what this figure is as a percentage of all those in the age group.
<BR>
The numbers of claimants are collated by two age groupings: 17 to 24 and 25 to 29 year olds. The table below show the number of claimants at the April 1997 count.
<BR>
In the Parliamentary Constituency of Portsmouth South, the numbers were:

Unfortunately, a percentage of 17-24 year unemployed claimants as a proportion of the entire workforce in that age group cannot be given, due to the age criteria used to compile the Population Census survey. However, I give below figures of all young people by available age group:

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the documentation issued to Employment Service staff relating to the measures they should take to encourage the long term unemployed to opt for government training programmes. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
Guidance on all aspects of dealing with jobseekers following the introduction of the Jobseeker's Allowance was issued to Employment Service staff in October 1997 and amendments issued when appropriate. Copies of the guides are held in the Library.

It may be helpful if I explain that, in addition to regular fortnightly reviews, Employment Service advisers interview all jobseekers at six monthly intervals to review their situation, their work goals and the steps they have been taking to find work. As part of this they assess each jobseeker's needs, identify any barriers to employment and consider what options are available to help them back into work. Advice is tailored to meet an individual's needs and could include information about jobs; employment programmes such as Jobclub; and training opportunities, such as Training for Work.
<BR>
In addition to the advice and information provided during advisory interviews and at fortnightly reviews, information about a range of opportunities is available in the "Just the Job" leaflet which is held in all Jobcentres.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<P>
<a name="70627w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales when he intends to announce the outcome of the recent review of the Transport Grant arrangements; and if he will make a statement. [6278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70627w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I have considered the advice contained in the joint Welsh Office/Welsh Local Government Association working party report into the Transport Grant arrangements and I have introduced two changes for the 1998-99 settlement, for which bids have been invited today:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
support will be reduced, from a rate of 100 per cent., to 80 per cent. for cost increases incurred once a scheme has been accepted for a start of works;
<BR>
integrated transport package schemes costing over &#163;1 million, will be eligible for support.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70627w02.html_para0">I believe it is essential to obtain the best value from the Transport Grant resources made available. While I accept it is difficult to predict the costs of major construction projects with complete accuracy, I am concerned by the rate at which local authority Transport Grant schemes have increased in cost in recent years compared with our own Trunk Road projects. The generous grant arrangements do not help in this respect. My proposals will provide a strong incentive for authorities to control costs, ensuring both the best possible use of available resources and cost-effective solutions to transport problems. This in turn will help release resources to help tackle the growing number of local authority projects awaiting support.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para1">Transport Grant will continue to be available at a rate of 100 per cent. (50 per cent. grant and 50 per cent. supplementary credit approvals) up to the estimated project cost accepted at start of works. Therefore, schemes whose costs do not increase during construction will continue to receive full support, as will projects which have previously been accepted for a start of works, which are not subject to the new arrangements. I recognise that it is sometimes necessary or sensible to modify a scheme once construction has started. I do not intend to penalise authorities in these instances and, provided such changes are agreed with the Welsh Office in advance, any cost implications will also be exempt from the reduced rate of support.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para2">In reaching this decision, I have been mindful of the strong local authority opposition to earlier proposals to reduce the overall rate of Transport Grant support to 90 per cent. I accept their views that this would impose too great a burden on them and lead to the demise of many worthwhile schemes. I am sure that my proposals offer a reasonable compromise that will achieve my overall aim.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para3">My decision to introduce package funding in Wales reflects the Government's policy to achieve a balanced and integrated transport system in Wales. We have too long relied on the private car and while this still has a 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 1997 : Column: 653</I><P>
very important role to play, we need to invest in less environmentally damaging solutions. Extending Transport Grant support in this way provides a mechanism for local authorities to look at combinations of public transport and other alternative measures to alleviate transport problems in specific areas. As well as public transport, I will expect authorities to explore the possibilities of traffic management proposals and provision for cyclists and pedestrians. These arrangements will subsume the existing Bus Priority scheme.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para4">The existing &#163;5 million qualifying threshold for major road schemes will remain. I will also consider bids for major (over &#163;5 million) public transport projects under Section 56 of the Transport Act 1968.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para5">The working party also reported on a possible reduction in the duration of Transport Grant support. I accept their views that any move in this direction would discourage early scheme development work and encourage early settlement of contractors' and land compensation claims without necessarily obtaining the best value for money. I have not therefore made any changes to these arrangements.

<P>
<a name="70627w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Rhodri Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many heart transplants were carried out in United Kingdom NHS hospitals on United Kingdom residents in the latest year for which figures are available; how many hospitals are approved for carrying out heart transplant operations; and when and by what means the last new heart transplant centre was approved. [5839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70627w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 278 heart-only transplants (out of a total of 437 cardiothoracic transplants, including heart, lung and heart/lung operations) were carried out, on United Kingdom residents in United Kingdom National Health Service hospitals, during 1996.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para6">Eight hospitals in England are designated, by the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group, to carry out cardiothoracic transplant operations:

<a name="70627w02.html_para7">Under the arrangements which apply in Scotland, Glasgow Royal Infirmary is approved to undertake heart transplants.
<P>

<a name="70627w02.html_para8">The last new heart transplant unit to be designated was the University Hospital, Birmingham, NHS Trust, with effect from April 1992. A bid from the unit was considered by the Supra Regional Services Advisory Group. After due consideration, the Advisory Group recommended to the then Secretary of State that the Unit should be included in the designation arrangements for cardiothoracic transplantation. In reaching this decision, availability of organs, geographical spread of transplant units and availability of suitable clinical expertise would have been taken into account.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70627w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for the past five years as a whole, the regions in which the heart transplant patients operated on in each of the United Kingdom approved NHS heart transplant centres resided. [5838]<P>

 The information available is provided in the attached table. The table, taken from information in the Supra Regional Services Advisory Group Annual Reports, shows the number of finished consultant episodes for assessment and transplantation and therefore add up to a number significantly greater than the number of transplants carried out in the period.

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer's "Getting Europe to Work" initiative (announced in Treasury Press release 60/97) is about promoting job creation and social cohesion in Europe. It focuses on the need for a skilled, trained and adaptable labour force and a flexible labour market, underpinned by minimum standards of fairness and decency including a national minimum wage. The Government is committed to introduce programmes to help young people and the long-term unemployed move from welfare and into work.

They therefore mark a break from past cycles of unemployment followed by places on dead-end schemes and brief periods of unskilled temporary work which did nothing to enhance people's long term employment prospects or reduce their dependence on welfare.

<a name="70627w05.html_para1">The estimate for 1997-98 for capital costs represents 1 per cent. of the 1997-98 defence budget. No consolidated estimate of Polaris and Trident running costs for 1997-98 is yet available. The costs of the WE177 free-fall nuclear bomb which will go out of service by 31 March 1998 and the Lance nuclear artillery system which was withdrawn from service in 1992-93 are not recorded separately. However, records show that there has been no major capital expenditure on WE177 in the last four years.

 The Health and Safety Commission's Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification (ACGM) is currently considering, in consultation with interested bodies, the matter of direct discharge of those untreated liquid wastes which are judged, on the basis of thorough risk assessment, not to pose a risk of harm to the environment. This matter is covered by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992, as amended in 1996. The Health and Safety Executive enforces these Regulations and will consider ACGM's advice before agreeing with the relevant Departments (so far as matters relate to the environment) the best way to proceed.

 We announced the award of almost &#163;2.2 million in freight facilities grant on 23 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70627w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Franchising Director specifies minimum levels of service through the Passenger Service Requirement (PSR) which is incorporated in franchise agreements with train operating companies. Services operated over and above those required in the passenger service requirement are a commercial matter for the franchisee. There are no plans to review the PSRs relating to train services to Penzance.

Great Western has introduced a number of new services on Sundays between Paddington and Penzance. There have been some operational problems in recent months which have affected service performance.

<a name="70627w07.html_para6">The Franchising Director closely monitors service performance and operators are penalised for cancellations and delays. Passengers are entitled to compensation for services which are below specified standards under the terms of franchise operators' Passenger's Charters.
