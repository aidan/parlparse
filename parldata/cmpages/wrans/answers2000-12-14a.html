 Twenty registered social landlords (RSLs) owned stock in Greenwich in both 1998 and March 2000. The percentage increase in average rent in March 2000 compared with March 1998 was higher than the rate of inflation over that period for eight of these RSLs. They were:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reasons have been given by rent officers in the London Borough of Greenwich for approving rent increases for tenants of registered social landlords above the level of inflation.  [141652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Rent officers are required to determine rents for properties with a registered fair rent in accordance with the rules set out in the Rent Act 1977. This requires them to take into account a number of criteria including age of dwelling, its state of repair, character and locality but to disregard any premium resulting from a scarcity of similar accommodation in the area.
<P>

<a name="01214w01.html_para11">In addition, on 1 February 1999, the Government introduced the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 which had the effect of limiting most fair rent increases to RPI plus 7.5 per cent. or RPI plus 5 per cent. The Order was quashed in a judgment of the Court of Appeal in January but was declared lawful in a judgment by the House of Lords on 7 December. The effect of the judgment is that the Order has been in force continuously since 1 February 1999 and all applications for registered fair rents since then must comply with it.

[141654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Registered social landlords (RSLs) only apply to rent officers for approval in "fair rent" cases. Figures on applications by individual RSLs for registered fair rents are not held centrally.

<a name="01214w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2411/98 of 3 November 1998 provides for the recognition of specified distinguishing signs on number plates as an alternative to the requirements set out in Annex 3 to the Vienna Convention of 1968. The Regulation defines the distinguishing sign as a set of one to three letters indicating the member state in which the vehicle is registered. The use of such signs on number plates for vehicles registered in the United Kingdom will be voluntary.

 This is one of the issues that will be addressed by the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive in taking forward the recommendations following from the Commission's recent Gas Safety Review. In particular, the Commission will develop with industry a strategic research plan that will cover the contribution of technological developments, including safety devices, to the safe use of gas in residential premises. The Commission and the Executive will review the safety case for the fitting of excess flow valves, whether as a legal obligation or as recommended good practice, when the results of this further research are available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his most recent estimate of the amount of carbon saved each year by 2010 as a result of the introduction of the climate change levy.  [142423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> Our most recent estimates of the levels of carbon saved were published in the UK's climate change programme on 17 November 2000. The programme shows that the climate change levy is estimated to save 2 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MtC) each year by 2010. The climate change agreements which are being negotiated with energy intensive sectors are estimated to save a further 2.5 MtC by 2010. Additional energy efficiency measures using levy receipts and the establishment of the Carbon Trust are estimated to save a further 0.5 MtC. This means that the climate change levy package as a whole is estimated to save 5 MtC per annum by 2010.

 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> The target is a 20 per cent. improvement on the 1990-91 levels by the end of 1999-2000. By March 1997, overall progress was 16.0 per cent.; by March 1999, it had risen to 18.9 per cent. Results for FY 1999-2000 should be available in 2001.
<P>

<a name="01214w01.html_para12">I am placing in the Libraries of both Houses a revised set of tables of Government estate energy efficiency results. These supersede the tables deposited in the House on 13 November. However, the headline figure of 18.9 per cent. overall progress to the 20 per cent. target is unaffected.

<a name="01214w02.html_para0">Yesterday my Department issued a general consent to enable local authorities to waive the requirement to repay grant, or to demand a lesser amount, in a wide range of circumstances.

<a name="01214w02.html_para5">In making these allocations, we have accepted, or provisionally accepted 67 new major schemes (those with a gross cost of over &#163;5 million). These include 28 public transport and integrated transport schemes, including bus priority measures and guided bus schemes, to make journeys faster and more reliable with major new interchanges, and 39 road schemes, such as local bypasses and relief roads.

These include improvements to public transport, such as priority bus routes, improved integration, better access to bus, rail, and light rail stations, more park and ride schemes, and improved waiting facilities at interchanges. They also include schemes to make local roads safer and less congested, and measures to encourage cycling and walking.

<a name="01214w03.html_para0">The &#163;2.6 billion package of housing capital resources for 2001-02 is well over twice the amount allocated in 1997-98, and represents an increase of 24 per cent. in the resources compared to the current year.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2000]:</i> The National Health Service provides a variety of types of care for women during pregnancy and childbirth including care in midwife-led units. We would expect to see this variety continue, offering individual choice whenever possible.

The Council adopted conclusions on innovation.

<a name="01214w04.html_para7">The Commission presented its latest report on the world shipbuilding market, which highlighted that the situation in the world shipbuilding market remained very difficult. The Commission stated that it was unfortunate that the bilateral consultations with South Korea had so far not reached agreement on an effective remedy on unfair South Korean pricing.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para8">The Commission recommended that while the EU should continue to pursue a solution bilaterally, it should also investigate the Industry complaint under the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR) with a view to possible action in the WTO. The Commission also indicated that it would propose a defensive temporary support mechanism for vessels subject to Korean unfair competition if no progress had been made with South Korea by May 2001. At the same time it confirmed its opposition to any extension of operating aid after the end of this year. The UK supported this approach.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para9">The Council adopted conclusions stressing concern at South Korean unfair competition, urging South Korea to agree an effective remedy as a matter of urgency and calling on the Commission to complete its investigation of the Industry TBR complaint as soon as possible. The Council further instructed the Commission to report back by 1 May 2001, with a view to proposing action against South Korea in the WTO if no bilateral remedy had been agreed with South Korea by then. It also took note of the Commission approach for a temporary support mechanism, but added the safeguard that any such proposal should be under the supervision of the Commission and should not distort competition in the EU.

<a name="01214w04.html_para11">There was a brief discussion on the proposals to allow ECSC assets to transfer to the Community when the Treaty expires on 2002. The Commission also presented its latest report on the monitoring of the Article 95 ECSC Steel Aid Cases.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para12">As part of the Commission's work on modernising competition policy, there was a short discussion on the Commission's proposals to reform the way in which Article 81 on restrictive agreements is applied. This work will continue under the Swedish Presidency.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para13">The centre-piece of the Energy Council was the proposal for a directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (the "Renewables Directive") where Ministers reached political agreement on a draft text which will now be subject to the co-decision process with the European Parliament. The draft directive sets out indicative targets for the amount of electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2010. The target for the UK is 10 per cent., which is in line with our domestic target. Discussion at the Council focused mostly on the targets proposed for some other member states and the need to recognise that the achievement of targets will depend on an appropriate state aid regime. Article 175(1) was accepted as the legal base. I regard the political agreement reached at the Council as an important first step which will encourage member states to promote domestic renewables schemes actively and will contribute towards meeting the EU's Kyoto targets.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para14">The Council also discussed the Commission's oil supply communication where there was general agreement on the need for greater market transparency and for dialogue between consumer and producer countries. There was support for the International Energy Agency to carry this work forward for the consumer countries. The UK rejected the notion of market management as a solution to price volatility and called for more gas to gas competition and for a break in the link between gas and oil prices.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para15">The Commission gave a report on its plans to bring forward new proposals for the Stockholm Council to accelerate opening of the internal markets for electricity and gas. These will focus on three areas: full market opening with the target of giving all consumers freedom to choose their supplier; transparent and non- discriminatory access to networks for all suppliers; and the full separation of gas and electricity distribution from the supply side. The Commission also outlined proposals to put the work of the Florence and Madrid processes on a more regularised basis with proper political direction. The UK urged the Commission to press on with proposals to accelerate market opening as quickly as possible, including the development of cross-border charging arrangements, and supported the plans to exert more political control over the Florence and Madrid processes.
<P>

<a name="01214w04.html_para16">In addition the Commission presented its Green Paper on Security of Supply, emphasising that it was meant to be the first stage on a journey towards a new policy framework for energy. At this stage the Council simply took note. The Council also noted reports on Euro-Med cooperation, the energy charter treaty, COP6 and synergy. Conclusions on the energy efficiency action plan were agreed without discussion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what projects his Department supports to promote anti-corruption awareness among United Kingdom companies.  [142218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2000]:</i> Since the UK's ratification of the OECD Bribery Convention in 1998, focusing on the bribery of foreign public officials to obtain or retain business, my Department has been determined to ensure that UK companies understand their rights and responsibilities, and recognise that this Government are not prepared to continue to treat corruption as a necessary part of doing business.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para0">Details of the Convention itself can be found on the DTI's website www.dti.gov.uk/worldtrade/bribery.htm. The Convention will also feature in a DTI publication on "OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises" (which the Government have endorsed) due to be published in the new year. DTI has consulted business and the private sector themselves are keen to adopt a more ethical business policy including a strong anti-corruption message, which we strongly encourage.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para1">Overseas, officials engaged in promoting the specific interests to British companies will always give frank advice on the commercial and legal and regulatory frameworks obtaining in those markets. But we are looking to produce more explicit advice to exporters, working in partnership with the Department for International Development.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para2">The Export Credit Guarantee Department has also taken steps to reduce corruption by ensuring that applicants for ECGD cover should be asked in future to warrant to ECGD that an export contract has not been secured by corrupt means and divulge whether they have ever been convicted of corruption. ECGD will have the right to deny any insurance cover that it might have given, and recover any loss following the date of conviction.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para3">Of course corruption is part of a much bigger agenda on Corporate Social Responsibility to which the Government are committed. Last March, my hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs was appointed Minister for Corporate Social Responsibility; this was the first such appointment in any Government in the world and will reinforce private sector efforts to defined responsible business conduct.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w05.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 To date, mobile operators' networks cover an area in which 99 per cent. of the UK population live. To the best of my knowledge these networks currently use between them 9,000 transmitter masts, of which 2,000 are poles similar in size to a lamppost and 1,700 carry equipment from more than one operator. It is not possible for me to conjecture how many additional transmitter

 Entitlement to a State Pension is never removed on hospitalisation, although the rates paid are lowered, by 40 per cent., or 20 per cent. if a person has dependants, after six weeks and to the pocket money rate after 52 weeks. The pocket money rate cannot go lower than 20 per cent. of the basic State Pension.

Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than constituency level data, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Blackpool, South since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para9">We are spending an additional &#163;7 billion a year on support for families and children. This includes significant increases in child benefit, which is now worth &#163;15 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10 a week for other children: nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Blackpool, South 12,394 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para10">We have launched the New Deals to help lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since August 1998 the number of people receiving Jobseekers' Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,205,800 to 972,700; in Blackpool, South, the number has reduced from 2,100 to 2,000. The number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased over the same period from 955,000 to 910,100 nationally and in Blackpool, South the number has remained the same at 2,300.
<P>

<a name="01214w05.html_para11">Next year we will be spending &#163;4.5 billion a year extra in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. Winter Fuel Payments have continued to tackle fuel poverty. So far this winter, around 11 million people, of whom around 21,200 live in Blackpool, South, have benefited from the payment. The scheme has been extended to include eligible people from age 60 so that even more older people will benefit. For this winter only, households that qualify will receive an increased payment of &#163;200. The Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) targets the poorest 1.6 million pensioner families, of whom 5,000 live in Blackpool, South. These pensioners will benefit from our alignment of all MIG rates from April 2001, giving single pensioners at least &#163;92.15 each week--a real increase of &#163;12.45 for the poorest pensioners.

 The research programme into BSE and related diseases is co-ordinated by the head of the TSE Research and Surveillance Unit who reports to the head of the Animal Health and Environment Directorate. The unit was formed in December 1999 to bring together the management of TSE research and strategic aspects of TSE surveillance. The main research aim of the unit has been to implement the recommendations of a SEAC sub-group on research and surveillance on TSEs in sheep. The unit has commissioned new and updated animal accommodation to house this research. An Open Competition (the TSE Research Requirement's document)

was held to advertise for new research projects. As a result of this, contracts have been issued for four new projects and a further 27 are under negotiation for funding. A list of the TSE research projects currently funded by MAFF is given on the Research section of the MAFF website (www.maff.gov.uk/research).

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the scientific tests used by other EU countries to test for BSE in slaughtered bovines.  [141716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w06.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> The European Commission has undertaken an evaluation of a number of rapid BSE tests. Three tests were found to perform well in the evaluation exercise in 1999 and have been adopted by other EU countries to test for BSE in slaughtered bovines. These are tests developed by Prionics, Enfer Scientific and CEA. These are in addition to the more traditional, less rapid tests of histopathology, immunocytochemistry and, electronmicroscopy for scrapie associated fibrils.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w06.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the dates the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee considered each of the post mortem tests being used in other EU countries to detect BSE in bovines; and if he will place the reports of the their findings in the Library.  [141718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w06.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> SEAC has not formally considered any of the post mortem tests used in the EU. However the EC has conducted independent validation of a number of tests submitted. Three tests are now recognised by member states and a further six are currently undergoing validation.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the current tests available to detect the presence of BSE in <i>(a)</i> living and <i>(b)</i> carcases of, bovine subjects; and if he will make a statement on their unit costs and reliability and practicality for mass screening programmes.  [141553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w06.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> There is no validated test available to detect the presence of BSE in living cattle. However, this is an active research area.
<P>

<a name="01214w06.html_para12">A number of post mortem tests are in use. These include histopathology, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy and scrapie-associated fibrils, ELISA tests and immunoblotting.
<P>

<a name="01214w06.html_para13">The European Commission has undertaken an evaluation of a number of the more rapid BSE tests. Three of these tests were found to provide good results in terms of sensitivity and specificity in comparison with histopathology. These three tests may now be used by member states in mass screening programmes.
<P>

<a name="01214w06.html_para14">Test kits are available for unit costs of between approximately &#163;20 and &#163;50 but the costs of collection of samples, identification, handling, transport and examination have to be added to the unit costs. The unit costs may well fall as the tests become more widely used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the extent to which the application procedures for the cattle passport scheme need to be simplified.  [142253]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The operation of the cattle passport scheme is closely monitored and kept under constant review. The BCMS have set up an Industry Forum at which all stakeholders meet to identify how services may be improved. We have responded to the Forum's request to provide for electronic data transfer and from early in the new year it will be possible for farmers to choose to register an animal simply by visiting the BCMS website. They will continue to have the options of completing a paper application form or sending an e-mail, if they prefer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what guidance is made available to farmers regarding the cattle passport scheme.  [142254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) has published nine information leaflets offering advice and guidance on the cattle passport scheme. A copy of each of these leaflets has been sent to every cattle keeper in the country. Welsh language versions have also been produced for Welsh speaking farmers.
<P>

<a name="01214w07.html_para0">The BCMS has also produced two explanatory video tapes, which have been circulated to farmer organisations to be shown at any of their regular discussion group meetings. If requested, BCMS can provide speakers for such meetings. BCMS staff also attend the principal agricultural shows throughout the country to meet with farmers directly.
<P>

<a name="01214w07.html_para1">The Cattle Tracing website--part of the MAFF website www.maff.gov.uk--gives detailed information (including a question and answer section) on the scheme. The BCMS telephone helpline also provides help and advice.

<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what implications the EU animal by-products regulations will have on the composting of domestic kitchen waste.  [142250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The EU Animal By-products Regulation, as currently drafted, does not propose controls on the composting of kitchen waste, although it would control the composting of animal by-products. The UK will be requesting clarification of the scope of the Regulation during the negotiations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what guidance he offers regarding the application of the animal by-products regulations to the disposal of kitchen waste, with special reference to meat, in waste dumps.  [142252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Animal By-Products Order 1999 does not control the disposal of kitchen waste in landfill sites. However, it does require that ruminants, pigs and poultry are not fed, or allowed access to, unprocessed kitchen waste containing meat, meat products or products of animal origin wherever they are disposed of. Guidance on the disposal of animal by-products and catering waste is to be issued shortly and will reiterate this point.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what the procedures are for a resubmission of an application for placement on the National Seed List; and what restriction there is on the time period before that resubmission can be tabled for acceptance.  [142099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> Under the current regulations for National Seed Listing, the procedures for resubmission of an application for National Listing of a variety are the same as those that apply for any new application for National Listing of a variety. There is no restriction on the time period before an application for National Listing of a variety may be resubmitted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> No. My Department acted properly in accordance with its knowledge at the time when considering the application to place Chardon LL on the National List of plant varieties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will publish the evidence that his Department planned to submit to the inquiry regarding the application to place Chardon LL on the National Seed List.  [142098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> The purpose of the Chardon LL hearing, now adjourned, is to take submissions and oral evidence from persons affected by the proposal to add Chardon LL to the National List of plant varieties. No decision to add Chardon LL to the National List can be taken until the evidence from the hearing and other written representations are considered. There is no provision in the Regulations for my Department to submit evidence to the hearing and there are no plans to do so. Chardon LL will only be added to the UK National List if all the legal requirements have been met in full.

<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's preference is for meat exports. However, the European Court of Justice has made it clear that a ban on the trade in live animals for slaughter is not an option.

<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if an independent expert will be able to analyse the data from medical assessment programme consultations involving Porton Down volunteers to assess whether patterns of ill-health are associated with particular exposures;  [142417]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the ways in which the Ministry of Defence will publicise the offer of a thorough medical assessment to the service personnel who have taken part in trials at Porton Down.  [142416]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Data about specific individuals referral to the Medical Assessment Programme will be medically confidential. However, it is planned to aggregate and anonymise the data to form a case series for analysis. Such data could, with volunteers' consent, be made available to independent researchers, as has been the case with equivalent data relating to Gulf Veterans.
<P>

<a name="01214w07.html_para2">I announced on 21 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 101-02W, a number of measures, including the offer of a thorough medical assessment for Porton Down Volunteers. The announcement was accompanied by a Ministry of Defence Press Release which is available on my Department's website. The announcement generated some interest in the national media. Wiltshire police have kindly sent out on our behalf details of the Medical Assessment Programme with approximately 400 of their letters to volunteers. All letters sent by Porton Down in response to former volunteers' inquiries and by MOD on this subject mention the medical assessment programme where appropriate. Callers to our Helplines will also be made aware of the Medical Assessment Programme. We have also invited the Volunteers' legal representative to publicise details. My Department will set up a website specifically for Porton Down volunteers early in the New Year which will also contain details. We plan to revise and re-issue the MOD leaflet intended for Porton Down Volunteers which was first produced in February 1998. The Porton Down Veterans Support Group also has been sent details, as too has the Royal British Legion. The Department of Health has taken steps to alert the NHS and GPs to the programme.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will place in the Public Record Office a copy of the document "possible long-term sequelae of exposure to nerve agents-a retrospective survey" (CDE Technical Note 1010, August 1989);  [142384]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reasons the Chemical Defence Establishment Porton Down initiated the survey of the health of service volunteers exposed to nerve agents which was reported in the document "possible long-term sequelae of exposure to nerve agents-a retrospective survey" (CDE Technical Note 1010) in August 1989.  [142383]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I have today arranged for a copy of the document to which the hon. Member refers to be placed in the Library of the House. Consideration as to whether or not the document should be placed in the Public Records Office will be given under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 and 1967.
<P>

<a name="01214w07.html_para3">The work which led to CDE Technical Note 1010 was a small scale study initiated by staff at Porton Down. This was intended to identify any long-term health effect of exposure to nerve agents during the volunteer programme. The work did not reveal any increased incidence of ill health among the volunteers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his estimate is of the number of individuals who have been exposed to nerve agents at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down.  [142411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w07.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 My Department estimates that 3,400 volunteers may have taken part in nerve agent studies at Porton Down, although it is probable that not all of these volunteers were exposed to nerve agents as some would have worn protective equipment or been involved as part of control groups. We plan to research the records to establish the definitive numbers, which will be published in due course.

 The UK Government have received a number of representations, both verbal and by correspondence, about Plan Colombia. These have been from MPs, NGOs and members of the public, but we also have a substantial and on-going dialogue with other Governments.
<P>

<a name="01214w09.html_para0">Plan Colombia sets out the Colombian Government's proposals for tackling the violence, social and economic inequalities, abuse of human rights, and drugs cultivation and trafficking. We have encouraged the Colombian Government to consult NGOs and civil society about the implementation of Plan Colombia. There are some welcome signs that this is happening. Economic Development Minister Ramirez Ocampo has held a series of meetings with NGOs and civil society groups about Plan Colombia and the peace process more widely, and we were pleased that the Colombian Government participated in the NGO sponsored Costa Rica meeting on 17 October. We hope this dialogue continues to strengthen.

 There is no UK Government financial involvement in Plan Colombia either bilaterally or through the EU. Assistance through the EU of 105 million euro will support human rights, long-term economic and social development, and an end to violence.

 In 2000 the Department adapted its previous policy of advertising in UK national media. It now additionally advertises in leading publications in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In the light of advice from the Fair Employment Commission at the Northern Ireland Office, all jobs in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (except those at clerical grade A1, which are advertised in London only) are advertised in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>. Care is taken to ensure that advertisements appeal to a wide cross-section of the UK population.
<P>

<a name="01214w09.html_para1">In line with its diversity policy, the Department does not require applicants to provide information on religious affiliation during (or after) the recruitment process. Nor does it have information that would enable it to say how many staff are from Northern Ireland or any other part of the United Kingdom. The Department is therefore unable to provide information on the percentage of staff employed in any capacity from either community in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="01214w09.html_para2">Northern Ireland is included in the Department's recruitment initiatives. For example, in November 2000 the Department visited Queen's University Belfast and the University of Ulster to discuss careers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Europe with young people from eleven schools, encompassing both Catholic and Protestant students. The Department does not retain records of university visits and other recruitment initiatives for more than the current year.

The Department does not have specific targets for the employment of Catholics from Northern Ireland or from any other part of the UK. The Department's objective is that 10 per cent. of recruits to the Diplomatic Service each year should be of minority ethnic origin,

 The Government believe that a long term peaceful and political solution in Tibet can be found only through dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Tibetans, in particular the Dalai Lama. During the last round of the UK/China human rights dialogue, held in London between 16-18 October, the Chinese side briefed us on recent talks that had taken place between the Chinese authorities and Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's brother, in Beijing. We welcomed these preliminary discussions, and expressed the hope that both sides would work promptly towards high level talks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate his Department has made of the number of new teachers that will have to qualify each year for the next five years to fill projected teaching vacancies; and what targets his Department has set for recruitment of new teachers for each of the next five years.  [141947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The firm and indicative targets are announced for rolling three-year periods. On 8 December, I announced that 29,820 places would be available on initial teacher training courses in England in 2001-02, and that the indicative intake targets for 2002-03 and 2003-04 were 29,535 and 29,095 respectively. Those figures will be reviewed at the appropriate time. The targets that I announced do not take account of the 1,680 employment-based training places that will be available in each of the next three years and for which funding had already been announced. These mean that there is provision for 31,570 people to enter initial teacher training in 2001-02 and that, on current estimates, we plan to make 31,215 places available in 2002-03 and 30,775 in 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="01214w10.html_para0">We expect these targets, together with the new &#163;6,000 training salaries that we are now offering graduate trainee teachers, to allow good progress to be made towards recruiting the number of entrants to initial teacher training that we estimate will be needed to ensure an adequate supply of newly-qualified teachers. We have already, this year, secured the first rise in recruitment to initial teacher training since 1992-93, with more than 2,000 more people currently in training than at this time last year.

<a name="01214w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Department issued further guidance in early November 2000 to all local education authorities and Higher Education institutions on the provisions for students who are temporarily absent from their course due to illness or caring responsibilities. Similar information was also made available to students in Higher Education.
<P>

<a name="01214w10.html_para1">Under the Education (Student Support) Regulations, full-time students in England and Wales who are absent from their course because of illness are entitled to continue to receive student support for the first 60 days of absence. Before academic year 1998-99 this was only 28 days. Local education authorities also have the discretion to determine whether student support should be continued when a student is absent for reasons other than illness or caring duties.
<P>

<a name="01214w10.html_para2">Full-time students who have suspended their studies because of illness or caring responsibilities, and who are required to wait until they are permitted to rejoin their course, can now claim Jobseeker's Allowance and Housing/Council Tax Benefit from when they recover from illness or their caring duties end.
<P>

<a name="01214w10.html_para3">The revised guidance encourages local education authorities to use the discretionary powers available to them to continue paying student support when a student is temporarily absent from their course.

Measures include new standards, a national test and curriculum, new learning materials and programmes and action to target specific groups of adults with basic skills needs. Spending on this programme will rise from &#163;241 million in 2000-01 to &#163;313 million in 2001-02, &#163;366 million in 2002-03 and &#163;403 million in 2003-04. Raising standards through training and qualifications for new and existing teachers will be a key part of the strategy. The national strategy, to be launched early next year, will be evaluated through pathfinder projects and regular monitoring of progress at national level against the target of reducing the number of adults with weak literacy and numeracy skills by 750,000, by 2004.

over four times greater than in 1997-98. Additionally, Opportunity Bursaries for young disadvantaged students will also be available from 2001. This carefully targeted extra support is a key part of our widening access policies, which are designed to ensure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have the confidence to enter higher education and the help they need to complete their studies. We have made available &#163;2.7 million of the total amount of &#163;4.4 million provided for specific administrative funding in 2000-01. We believe that higher education institutions should also use their own funds to ensure these essential services are properly resourced and effectively delivered.
<P>

<a name="01214w11.html_para2">Of course we welcome initiatives such as the Ogden Bursary scheme, and the recent one announced by Edinburgh University with the Royal Bank of Scotland, which are excellent examples of private/public sector partnerships providing further opportunities for more of our disadvantaged young people to benefit from higher education. We have responded to these initiatives by increasing the income students can receive through bursaries without it affecting the level of student support they receive from the taxpayer.

<P>

 The Lord Chancellor's Department prepared at all levels for the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998; for example, ensuring that all judges and magistrates and the Department's staff were trained; that judges have speedy access to ECHR case law, and that the High Court has sufficient judges, if needed, to deal with any additional workload. Guidance was issued to clarify best practice in certain areas and necessary changes to procedure were made.

<a name="01214w13.html_para0">It is too early to make an assessment of the impact of the Act on court workload but so far there has been no turbulence in the courts.

 Following this Government's policy of exposing their legislation to maximum expert scrutiny at the earliest convenient stage, the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill was published in draft in August this year and the consultation period ended on 20 October. The great majority of responses were encouraging and many contained helpful advice and comment on points of detail. Taking advantage of this expert input to the legislative process, the Government continue to develop their proposals in light of the consultees' comments. We hope to introduce a Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effect on the Blackpool South constituency of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [142224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w13.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The policies developed by this Department generally relate to England and Wales as a whole and it is therefore not possible to say what the specific impact is on the Blackpool, South constituency. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Dec 2000 : Column: 241W</I><P>
However, the Blackpool Community Legal Service Partnership (CLSP), which covers Blackpool, South constituency, is one of 145 CLSPs throughout England and Wales. The Commission's total expenditure in the Blackpool Community Legal Service Partnership area, including both new legal help matters and contingent liability, is &#163;935,933.79. The Community Legal Service Partnership covers the whole borough of Blackpool. It does not include any of the surrounding areas, which are part of the North West Lancashire Community Legal Service Partnership.
<P>

<a name="01214w13.html_para1">In the Blackpool, South constituency, 18 agencies have been awarded contracts with the LSC. This includes 17 law firms and one CAB. The total value of the contracts awarded amounts to &#163;626,920. The 18 agencies are all holders of the CLS Quality Mark. In addition there are a further 12 organisations in the constituency who provide General Help or General Help with Casework who have committed themselves to applying for the CLS Quality Mark by October 2001.
<P>

<a name="01214w13.html_para2">Additionally a contract has been let with Wyre CAB at Cleveleys to give Debt advice and some of this work is carried out in Blackpool. A contract with Preston and Western Lancashire Race Equality Council in Preston includes delivery of part of their service in Blackpool.
<P>

<a name="01214w13.html_para3">In addition I have set out details of claims issued at Blackpool county court in the 12 months period either side of the Civil Justice Reforms in April 1999. This allows for a comparison to be made of any changes in the levels of claims made as a result of the Civil Justice Reforms, and is a more useful indicator than just providing all the claims issued since May 1997.

 Over the past three and a half years, we have taken the tough decisions necessary to secure a platform of stability to help us attain our central objective of high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the election employment has risen by over one million and unemployment has been cut by over 500,000.

 The Government's tax and benefit reforms mean that by 2001 families with children will be on average &#163;850 a year better off, and the direct tax burden on a family on average earnings with two children will be at the lowest level since 1972. The Children's Tax Credit, due to be introduced in April 2001, will reduce the tax burden by up to &#163;442 a year for five million working families with children.

 Economic stability is the only sound base for competitive enterprise and industry in a global economy. To this end, the Government have cut public borrowing, ensured low and stable inflation and achieved the lowest long-term interest rates for over 30 years. This sound policy platform has encouraged small and medium-sized businesses to invest for the long-term in the skills and infrastructure they require to compete and succeed. To strengthen further the competitiveness of small and medium-sized companies, we have also introduced major reforms to ease compliance with regulation, boost the level of finance available and to improve the level of skills. By focusing on these areas the Government aim to make the UK the most competitive environment for business in the world.

 Improving the employment prospects of lone parents is a key priority for the Government. The lone parent employment rate has risen from 44 per cent. in 1997 to 50 per cent. in spring 2000--the highest rate for 20 years. Many more lone parents say that they would like to work and so the Government have set a new objective: that 70 per cent. of lone parents are in employment by the end of the decade. Policies such as the New Deal for lone parents, the Working Families Tax Credit and the National Childcare Strategy are already helping the Government to achieve this aim.

 The Government have developed the climate change levy in an open and consultative way. The levy was developed on the basis of the work of Lord Marshall's Task Force which examined "Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy". This was followed by an extensive consultation exercise following the announcement of the levy in Budget 1999. More recently, the Government have consulted on the draft legislation underpinning the levy, on support for energy efficiency measures and on "good quality" Combined Heat and Power.

<a name="01214w15.html_para2">During this process, the Government have received many representations from business and other interested parties and these views have helped to refine the design of the levy.

 In response to a request to host countries by the United Nations Authorities in Kosovo (UNMIK) to cease enforcing the return of Kosovans to Kosovo during the severe Balkan winter, we have given this careful consideration and decided that a wholesale suspension of enforced returns back to Kosovo would not be justified. We do not accept that single people or couples who have put forward manifestly unfounded applications and who may, for example, have arrived in the United Kingdom in recent months and long after peace was secured in Kosovo and who have families and homes there, could not return to them. But we have agreed to temporarily suspend the enforced return of families with children or vulnerable dependants or other vulnerable cases in recognition of the difficulties that larger family groups and vulnerable people may present to UNMIK in terms of providing support and accommodation during the winter period.

 Coroners are required solely to investigate relevant deaths reported to them. There are no powers to require them to exceed their statutory responsibilities in the way proposed. Details of the numbers of deaths arising from all types of CJD are already published monthly by the Department of Health.

 Home Office Circulars 99/1982 and 33/1987, issued to police forces on 3 November 1982 and 15 June 1997 respectively, provide guidance on the nationality qualifications for applicants to the police service in England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police. To be eligible for appointment as a constable a candidate must be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> a British citizen; or</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> a Commonwealth citizen (other than a British citizen) or a citizen of the Irish Republic, in which case he or she must satisfy one of the following conditions:</FONT></UL>

If not qualified under <i>(i)</i> or <i>(ii)</i> he/she must satisfy the chief officer of police that he/she is so closely connected with a country or territory within the Commonwealth either by ancestry, upbringing or residence, or by reason of national service, that an exception may properly be made in his/her favour.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="01214w17.html_para4">There is no statutory requirement for an applicant for appointment as a police officer to have resided in the UK prior to application which is a matter to be determined on a local basis by chief police officers. No record is held centrally of which forces have a residency requirement as part of their recruitment process.

<a name="01214w17.html_para5">Cabinet Office guidance, on which police forces base their policy for carrying out security clearances of applicants, recommends that the normal residency requirement for security clearance is that the applicant has been resident in the United Kingdom for the previous three years. However, if the applicant has spent the previous three years in another country, discretion may be given to undertake overseas security checks where this is possible.
<P>

<a name="01214w17.html_para6">Consultation with the police service in 1998 identified no consensus for change to the present nationality requirements. We are giving further consideration to whether it would be appropriate to propose any changes.

 There is little I can usefully add at this stage to my reply to my hon. Friend's question on 29 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 681W. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) and the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) have concluded, separately, that the available data do not support calls to increase the controls on GHB. But both organisations have decided to see if additional data can be obtained to better inform their decisions. I look forward to receiving their further advice in due course.

<a name="01214w18.html_para0">I have seen the report of the World Health Organisation recommending that GHB should be scheduled under Schedule IV of the United Nations (UN) Convention of Psychotropic Substances 1971. I understand that all parties will be voting on this recommendation at the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum removals there were in the first half of 2000-01; how many he estimates there will be in the second half of 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [142773]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The number of asylum removals between 1 April and 30 September 2000 was 4,870.
<P>

<a name="01214w18.html_para3">The Government are determined to increase substantially the number of such removals. We have set a target of 12,000 removals of failed asylum seekers in this financial year increasing to 30,000 in 2001-02, 33,000 in 2002-03 and 37,000 in 2003-04. To achieve this, we are pursuing a number of measures, including recruiting an extra 400 immigration officers for enforcement work, expanding the detention estate and setting up a network of reporting centres.

 Between 1 April and 30 September 2000, 2,440 immigration offenders who had not made an asylum application at any stage were removed from the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="01214w18.html_para4">It is likely that non-asylum removals in the whole of the financial year will exceed our original target of 3,500.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many non-asylum after-entry decisions were made in the first six months of 2000-01; how many he estimates there will be in the second half of 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [142775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There were 140,000 non-asylum after-entry decisions made in the period April to September 2000, excluding those in respect of European Economic Area cases but including cases dealt with by the Public Caller Unit which did not involve a decision. It is expected that the number of such decisions for the whole of the financial year 2000-01 will exceed the annual target of 205,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In total, 57,655 initial asylum decisions were made in the period April to September 2000. We remain on course to achieve our target of 130,000 to 150,000 decisions for the whole year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the extent to which the introduction of the vouchers system of asylum support has deterred the making of asylum applications by economic migrants; and if he will make a statement.  [142789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The introduction of the new asylum support arrangements, including the voucher system, is part of the Government's wider strategy to deliver a fairer, faster and firmer immigration and asylum system. The number of asylum applications from Central European countries, where the vast majority of applications prove to be unfounded, have dropped since April this year.

 There is a total of 72 Immigration and Nationality Directorate staff currently employed at Oakington with grades ranging from Assistant Director to Administrative Assistant.

 Refugee Action raised several points that are currently being pursued. A key point was that Refugee Action could not deal with the number of inquiries from asylum seekers claiming their vouchers were late in arriving. National Asylum Support Service has now addressed this problem by expanding the Voucher Inquiry team and the provision of additional telephone numbers for inquiries.

 The statutory powers available to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) are contained in sections 20 and 21 of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, which came into force on 1 January 2000. These provisions allow information on suspected immigration, and other, offenders to be exchanged for specified purposes between IND and the police, the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. They also contain order-making powers which will enable further purposes to be specified, and additional statutory gateways to be established with other agencies. In addition there is already excellent co-operation between IND and a number of other governmental and non- governmental bodies.

 The Home Office publishes a long-term projection of the custodial population annually in February of each year. Projections are provided according to various alternative scenarios. For the February 2000 projection the middle variant projection assumes growth in the use of custody by courts but no change in the average sentence length. The higher variant projection assumes that custody rates and sentence lengths increase. Both variants include an assumption of an increase in the juvenile estate due to the introduction of the Detention and Training Order in April 2000.

 The Youth Justice Board's commissioning strategy has identified three areas--London, Wales and the North-west, where there are currently overall shortages of secure accommodation for both male and female juvenile offenders.
<P>

<a name="01214w20.html_para2">The Board's current commissioning plans, which are subject to negotiations with the Prison Service and planning applications and approval for potential new sites seek to redress the shortages in Wales by late 2003-04. Options for London are under consideration which will release some of the pressure by March 2002, with further sites addressing the shortfall by March 2005. Some inroads into the North-west shortfall are expected in 2001-02 but the necessary new accommodation is not expected to be available until 2004-05.

 I have written on two occasions to the hon.

My first letter preceded the presentation of the petition to Parliament and the second was sent in response to the hon. Member's further letter of 7 September.

<a name="01214w20.html_para4">I can only confirm that the present use of the hostel for asylum seekers is not a matter for which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has any responsibility and he has no powers to prevent that use. The National Asylum Support Service has not designated Thorrington as a cluster area for the dispersal of destitute asylum seekers and their families and has not sought to accommodate asylum seekers there.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01214w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Our policy is to reduce misuse of the asylum system by people who are not refugees. The changes we have made to that system are designed to minimise its attractions to unfounded applicants while ensuring that those with genuine claims are not left destitute.
<P>

<a name="01214w20.html_para5">At the same time there is a developing debate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere flowing from an analysis of the potential economic and social benefits of migration. The Immigration Rules already set out circumstances in which people may come here for work and other purposes. The United Kingdom is quite rightly an attractive destination for legitimate migrants, who make a strong contribution to our economy and our society. But this is a wholly separate issue from our unwavering determination to restore the integrity of the asylum system.
