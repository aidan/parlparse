school attendance and school transport. We believe that parents must
take responsibility for their children&#146;s attendance at school.
Where children do not attend school regularly, a prosecution or a
penalty notice under section 444 may be needed if parents are not doing
their best to ensure that their child attends
school.</p><p><a name="0607039000145">The Department

their child attends school. The Bill also extends the right to free

important part of the way languages are taught and studied in England.
Intercultural understanding is promoted at each key stage. For example,
at Key Stage 2 intercultural understanding is one of the five key
strands of the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages. At Key Stage 3 the
programme of study, produced by the Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority (QCA), states that pupils should make progress in developing
cultural awareness, and in QCA's Key Stage 4

students&#146; understanding and appreciation of different countries,
cultures and communities, making students aware that they are citizens
of the world as well as of the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="0607039000340">Citizenship teaching is
compulsory at Key Stages 3 and 4. Pupils are taught about the world as
a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and
social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the
Commonwealth and the United Nations and about the United Kingdom's
relations in Europe, including the European Union, and relations with
the Commonwealth and the United Nations. Through the citizenship
curriculum, pupils are also taught to think about political and
cultural issues which could include a discussion about cultural
identity. It is also possible for European cultural identity to be
taught through the non-statutory framework for PSHE, which covers
teaching about and developing a sense of their own
identity.</p><p><a name="0607039000341">Following on
from the recommendations of the Adrian Smith report on mathematics,
published in 2004, and our 14-19 White Paper, we have appointed a chief
adviser for mathematics to be the champion of mathematics and lead in
developing the mathematics strategy. We are establishing a National
Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics that will support
the professional development of teachers of mathematics at every stage
of their career. We are adopting a range of measures at GCSE and A
level to promote a positive attitude amongst pupils, teachers and
employers to mathematics. For example, we will be targeting our support
to ensure that the teaching of &#145;functional mathematics&#146;
is available to all; from this September, attainment of at least a
&#145;C' grade in both Maths (and English) will be a key component of
our understanding of the 5 good GCSEs benchmark; in the longer term,
the curriculum and qualifications in mathematics for 14 to 19-year-olds
will be revised as part of the wider reform programme; and finally,
improvements planned for A level as part of our 14-19 reforms will
benefit all those embarking on A level programmes.</p><p><a name="0607039000342">Our national languages strategy
&#145;Languages for All; Languages for Life&#151;a strategy for

stresses the importance for society and the global economy for learners
of all ages to acquire &#147;the ability to understand and
communicate in other languages&#148;. Our commitment to language
learning is backed by considerable investment, and by the end of the
financial year 2007-08 we will have invested&#163;137
million in the promotion of, and support given to, language learning
programmes at all stages of
education.</p><p><a name="0607039000343">English is a
core subject and statutory from Key Stages 1-4. The national curriculum
programmes of study for English set out the importance of English.
English is a vital way of communicating in schools, in public life and
internationally. In studying English, pupils develop skills in
speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literature in English is rich
and influential, reflecting the experience of people from many
countries and times. It enables them to express themselves creatively
and imaginatively and to 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 675W</b><br>communicate with others effectively. Pupils learn to become enthusiastic
and critical readers of stories, poetry and drama as well as
non-fiction and media texts. The study of English helps pupils
understand how language works by looking at its patterns, structures
and origins. Using this knowledge, pupils can choose and adapt what
they say and write in different situations.</p><p><a name="0607039000344">In addition, both primary and
secondary national strategies, through their work with schools and
local authorities, provide strong and varied support to teachers. This
support enables teachers to provide effective and tailored teaching
that engages all pupils across the range of subjects and enables them
to fulfil their potential. The national strategies provide a range of
materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure
that their schools both provide high quality teaching and learning, and
promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for
reading and writing and helps them achieve their potential. Reading for
pleasure is essential as it increases children's chances of success and
the Department is taking action on several fronts to encourage children
and young people to read more. Both strategies have a specific remit
for raising attainment in mathematics and English. The secondary
strategy extends this remit to modern foreign languages.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607039000020">Examination

in 2006-07 and &#163;4.9 billion in 2007-08, a 3 per cent. increase
in funding compared to 2005/06 baselines. These figures cover both
16-18 and adults but do not include work based learning, Personal
Community and Development Learning (PCDL) or additional funds for the
roll out of Train to Gain, of which we expect colleges to receive a

adults gain basic and Level 2 skills for employability. The allocations
for 2006-07 are based on the principles that we outlined in Priorities
for Success. The LSC have published a number of documents detailing how
these principles would be applied in practice and the funding formula
used to determine allocations is set out in the LSC's document

Where a teacher has more than one post A level qualification in the
same subject, the qualification level is determined by the highest
level reading from left (Degree) to right (Other Qual.). For example,
teachers shown under PGCE have a PGCE but not a degree or BEd in the
subject, while those with a PGCE and a degree are shown only under
Degree.<br><sup>(2)</sup> Teachers are
counted once against each subject which they are
teaching.<br><sup>(3)</sup> Includes higher
degrees but excludes BEds.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Teachers qualified in combined/general science are treated as qualified
to teach biology, chemistry, or physics. Teachers qualified in biology,
chemistry or physics are treated as qualified to teach combined/general
science.<br><sup>(5)</sup> Teachers
qualified in other/combined technology are treated as qualified to
teach design and technology or information and communication
technology. Teachers qualified in design and technology or information
and communication technology are treated as qualified to teach

include: whether the case is strong and in the best interests of
educational provision in the area; the overall effect of the closure on
the local community; the transport implications and whether the

the proposal will be decided by the appropriate decision maker. Once

five to 16-year-olds who take part in at least two hours high quality
PE and school sport each week, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and on
to85 per cent. by 2008. The long term aim, by 2010, is for all
children to be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This
will comprise at least two hours high quality PE and sport at school
and the opportunity for at least a further two to three hours beyond
the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club
providers.</p><p><a name="0607039001102">The annual
National School Sport Survey is our prime tool for measuring progress
towards these targets. The results of the 2004/05 survey showed that
schools in school sport partnerships provided, on average, 15 different
sports for their pupils. These ranged from football, which was provided
by 97 per cent. of schools, to less traditional sports like rowing,
bowls and squash. The results of the survey were published in September
2005 and copies were placed in the Libraries of both

monitor the human rights situation closely, and many of those detained

European Commission, is the largest donoron water and
sanitation in Africa, spending over&#163;1.4 billion in the
sector in 2003-04. The EU Water Initiative was set up to co-ordinate
these efforts, identify gaps and ensure that the money we spend is used
more effectively to deliver services to the poor. The UK attaches great
importance to more and better aid for water and sanitation,
particularly in Sub Saharan Africa where the MDG targets for access to
these basic services are so off
track.</p><p><a name="06070318000024">There has,
however, been concern that political commitment to the EU Water
Initiative has declined and that it is not delivering its objectives. A
further problem is that with very limited monitoring and reporting
mechanisms it has not been sufficiently accountable to its
stakeholders. We have therefore raised these issues in the EU Water
Initiative Steering Group and are now working with a number of other
member states to reinvigorate the initiative, including developing
proper indicators for monitoring and improving the focus of work in
partner countries. We hope this will lead to renewed political
commitment and better implementation on the
ground.</p><p><a name="06070318000025">The EU
Consensus on Development, agreed during the UK Presidency, referred to
the EU Water Initiative and the importance of increased aid more
broadly. In addition, the EU-Africa Strategy also included a reference
to access to water supply and sanitation. In raising the political
profile of water and sanitation through these policy documents, we hope
that other member states will be encouraged to increase their support
to the sector, particularly as their levels of development funding
increase.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070318000007">Health Worker

Benn:</b> International health worker migration is a complex
issue and one that the UK takes seriously. Some low-income countries,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have less than one health worker
per 1,000 population. The proportion of African doctors who leave is
very significant. Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Zambia lose
between a third to a half of the doctors they train to international
migration. This rapid increase in health worker migration has been
partly due to staff leaving their country for greener pastures: As a
result the UK has been criticised for employing workers from developing
countries. However, poor working conditions, poor salaries and a lack
of training and opportunity for advancement have meant that many staff
in developing 
<br><notus-date day="3" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>3 July 2006 : Column 695W</b><br>countries leave the public health service. In addition to this, loss of
staff through AIDS has depleted many health
services.</p><p><a name="06070318000028">The UK NHS
has responded by putting in place policies to prevent active
international recruitment of health care professionals. The UK is the
only developed country to have a code of practice preventing its
national health service from targeting health care professionals from
developing countries. While the code on its own cannot address all the
root causes of migration, it plays an important role in ensuring that
recruitment is undertaken in an ethical, managed way. In addition to
this, DFID supports efforts to strengthen health services in many
countries, including to increase human resources. For example, DFID is
providing &#163;100 million over six years to support the Government
of Malawi's health sector programme, which includes doubling the number
of nurses and tripling the number of doctors over the next six
years.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070318000008">Iraq</h3><p><a name="06070318000029"><b><a name="06070318000147">Mr.

Watson:</b> Due to the increased numbers of those leaving the
RAF in April as a result of the recent redundancy exercise, coupled
with the rollout of JPA at the same time, it was not possible to
process all terminal grant payments, Special capital payments and
pension payments within the normal five days target. During April and
May some 1,830 awards were processed for those leaving the RAF, of
which 1,395 were paid outside of the five-day target from being
discharged. However, in all but six cases payments were made within 30
days, with the remainder paid shortly thereafter. There are now no
outstanding payments.</p><p><a name="06070330000576">The first JPA payroll in April
successfully delivered pay, including allowances and charges to the
vast majority of RAF personnel (42,104 out of 48,743). The 6,639 pay
inaccuracies (over and underpayments) were caused by several factors:
some were due to existing data errors transferred over from the legacy
systems, some were input errors, and some were discrepancies in flying
pay. The majority of flying pay was correctly paid by 2 May; a small
number of RAF personnel were paid their April entitlement in their May
payments. The second (May) payroll has been much more successful with
only some 1,175 personnel still affected by pay
inaccuracies.</p><p><a name="06070330000577">Some
salary payments were late as a result of the simultaneous introduction
of a new system of overseas bank payments. Overseas payments were
achieved within a few days of the due date and alternative local cash
payments were arranged. There have also been some difficulties with the
automated payment of expenses for official journeys. In April these
affected nearly 4,000 personnel and in May approximately
600.</p><p><a name="06070330000578">The total number
of personnel JPA will pay once it is fully rolled out is approximately
280,000. The Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has received
some 14 pieces of ministerial correspondence on behalf of constituents.
As at 21 June 2006 there have been no formal grievances from individual
users about JPA.</p><p><a name="06070330000579">Full

It also includes specific policies to protect playing fields from

are included in the typology of open spaces to which the policies in

are protected via section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925 which requires
that local authorities seek the Secretary of State's consent for
disposal or appropriation to another use. Consent cannot be given
unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that certain criteria are
met. Clarified criteria were issued to local authorities in February

the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000. The status
of &#145;qualified person&#146; under those regulations relates to
whether or not a person has a right to reside in the United Kingdom
under European Union law, for example as a worker. The Court of Appeal
found that the applicants were subject to immigration control as they
did not have a right to reside. This would have meant the applicants
were eligible for homelessness assistance under the housing rules which
then applied to persons subject to immigration control, in a way that
was not intended.</p><p><a name="0607041000622">To
close this loophole, the Government have made regulations to narrow the
classes of eligibility for social housing and homelessness assistance

ensure that nationals from the European Economic Area (EEA) who are
economically inactive and do not have a right to reside in the UK are
not eligible for social housing and homelessness assistance in England

as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one
healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the
number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care
within the year. 3. Main operation The main operation is the
first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data
set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed
during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when
looking at admission details, for example time waited, but the figures
for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more
complete count of episodes with an operation. 4. Secondary
procedure As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11

secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the
episode of care. 5. Ungrossed data Figures have not been

former public servants. Public service pension scheme members can also

[80433]</p><p><a name="06070415000345"><b><a name="06070415001475">Dr.
Howells:</b> Opium is a major source of credit for many
households in Afghanistan. It is used to lease land, purchase
agricultural inputs and to meet the cost of education and health
services. Household dependence on opium cultivation for accessing
services, and the problem of opium debt which results from using opium
as credit, is a growing problem in Afghanistan. Micro-finance can make
an important contribution to addressing this problem and helping to
promote alternative livelihoods to opium in Afghanistan. In 2005 the
Department for International Development provided &#163;5 million to
Afghanistan's Micro-Finance and Investment Support Facility (MISFA) to
introduce a special funding window to promote and enable the expansion
of micro-finance in poppy-growing provinces. This financial support is
helping Micro-Finance Institutions develop financial products that
better meet the financing needs for alternative livelihoods and the
problem of indebtedness. Moreover, the MISFA programme is providing a
source of legal credit to the poor and people on low incomes to access
services, thus reducing the demand for credit from opium and therefore
reducing the risk of Afghan households losing assets or land due to
opium
indebtedness.</p><p><a name="06070415000346"><b><a name="06070415001476">Richard

Howells:</b> At present some 80 per cent. of the population of
Helmand are engaged in farming and a significant number are engaged in
opium cultivation. The main contributing factors to opium production in
Helmand result from the devastating impact of three decades of war. The
conflict led to increasing poverty; a severe decline in investment in
essential infrastructure such as roads and the Helmand irrigation
system; insecurity and the lack of the rule of law; and the absence of
a credible government providing basic services. As a result, the people
of Helmand have become increasingly dependent on illegal opium
cultivation for income to meet basic
needs.</p><p><a name="06070415000348">The Afghan
Government is looking to improve the situation for farmers in Helmand,
but progress has been hampered by problems delivering government
development programmes there. To help address this problem, the
Department for International Development will be spending &#163;30
million over the next three years in Helmand through the Helmand
Agriculture and Rural Development Programme. This programme will
deliver assistance through the Afghan Government's National Programmes
in the province. These aim to extend the Afghan Government's authority
and demonstrate that it can be a credible provider of public services,
such as the provision of safe drinking water, credit for investment in
agricultural business and essential investment in much needed
infrastructure, particularly irrigation. These are all essential
elements for increasing the number of legal

the automotive industry in recent years has been Regional Selective
Assistance (RSA), which in England was supplanted by Selective Finance
for Investment in England (SFIE) in 2004. Since 2000, around
&#163;150 million has been paid in grants to a wide range of vehicle
manufacturers and component suppliers, nearly &#163;100 million of
which was paid to vehicle makers. Grants are only available to
companies in assisted areas, but the scheme does not discriminate as to
nationality of the parent company.</p><p><a name="06070415001121">In 1998, Peugeot was offered a
&#163;2 million RSA grant towards the cost of investment to add a
third shift at a time of strong demand for their 206 model. This
project created 900 jobs, and the grant has been paid in full. In
November 2004, the company was offered a &#163;14.4 million grant in
support of 207 manufacture, but the project did not proceed.</p><p><a name="06070415001122">LTI have not been in receipt of
RSA or SFI finance.
</p><p><a name="06070415001123">The Government also
offers various forms of technology grant from which companies in the
automotive sector have benefited. At various times, both Peugeot
Citroen and LTI have participated in consortia which have received

subsequently spun out as a stand-alone project. The independent company
Modec now runs this project, and production commences in Coventry later
this year's.</p><p><a name="06070415001124">The
principle source of specific automotive industry-related funding is the
Automotive Innovation and Growth Team (AIGT) suite of initiatives,
including Supply Chain Groups, Automotive Academy and Centres of
Excellence, against which a total commitment of &#163;45 million has
been made. Again, these do not discriminate as to nationality of

issues being tackled will assist the development of offshore wind
beyond 2010. The higher cost of developing offshore wind remains an
issue and the costs of connection to the electricity grid is a part of
that. Grid connections are likely to form 10-15 per cent. of capital
costs for the Round 2 wind farms given the considerable cable lengths
involved.</p><p><a name="06070415001227">Certainty

a number of clear advantages for offshore
projects.</p><p><a name="06070415001229">First,
extending the regulated price control approach offshore will ensure
consistency with the regulatory arrangements onshore. Second, it will
provide a financial benefit to offshore developers&#151;by spreading
the costs they face to connect to the onshore electricity system over a
number of years. Finally it will also mean that the responsibility for
developing the offshore transmission network will be shared by the
system operator and the transmission asset owners who can bring their
existing expertise to
bear.</p><p><a name="06070415001230">The DTI and

Government have provided capital grants of &#163;107 million to
stimulate early development of a significant number of offshore wind
farms under the Round 1 offshore wind programme. This will have a
significant benefit in the development of offshore wind post 2010 by
underpinning the development of the industry and equipment supply
chains and build skills, providing a learning experience which can
improve confidence and help reduce future costs and enable future
projects to proceed without the need for grant
support.</p><p><a name="06070415001232">The DTI
established the Research Advisory Group (RAG) to facilitate a
co-ordinated approach among the regulatory and funding bodies to
address the key impact issues of Round 2 wind farm proposals. The DTI
has allocated an initial programme budget of up to &#163;2.5 million

accompanied by an environmental impact assessment which includes
details of the likely impact on all parts of the environment, including
birds. Application for smaller scale windfarms are submitted to the
relevant planning authority to determine under the Town and Country
Planning Act 1990 and it would be for that authority to say whether an
EIA was required.</p><p><a name="06070415001333">When considering an
application, consultation will take place with a range of stakeholders,
including statutory advisers on nature conservation and protection of
the environment, as well as others who express an interest in the
proposal. This ensures that decisions on whether to give approval for a
wind farm are considered in the light of the best available information
about its likely impacts.</p><p><a name="06070415001334">In addition, should it be
considered that there could be an impact on protected species or their
habitats then an appropriate assessment must be undertaken pursuant to
the Conservation (Natural Habitats,&amp;c.) Regulations 1994,
irrespective of who the decision taker may be. In such circumstances
the decision taker must consult the appropriate nature conservation
body (English Nature, Countryside Council for Wales or Scottish Natural
Heritage) and take its views into account before taking any decision on
whether to approve the application.</p><p><a name="06070415001335">Furthermore, DTI has
established a Research Advisory Group to fund research into the impact
of wind farms on the environment. This includes a joint study with wind
farm developers and DEFRA to collect data on the distribution of sea
birds in the three strategic offshore wind farm areas, the results of
which will inform decisions on the grant of consent for wind farm

introduced comprehensive legislation to criminalise trafficking in
human beings. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force in
May 2004, introduces new, wide-ranging offences covering trafficking
into, within, and out of the UK for any form of sexual exploitation. A
new offence of “trafficking people for exploitation”
covering forced labour, removal of organs and the trafficking of
vulnerable people, including children, is included in the Asylum and
Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Act 2004 and came into force
in December 2004. Prior to 2003, the Immigration Act 1971 was adopted
for trafficking offences. There was one conviction in 2003 under that
piece of legislation. In that case the defendant received a sentence of
10 years. This sentence was increased on appeal in 2004 to 23 years by
the court of appeal on application by the Attorney-General as it was
deemed unduly
lenient.</p><p><a name="06070447000164">In 2004
sentences for trafficking offences ranged from six to 18 years. In 2005
sentences for trafficking offences ranged from four to 21 years. In

seven years.</p><p><a name="06070447000165">To date
