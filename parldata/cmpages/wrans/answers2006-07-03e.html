 We received advice from QCA on A-level stretch and challenge last year and in January.

<i> [holding answer 22 June 2006]:</i> The Building Schools for the Future programme adopts an area approach to transforming secondary provision. For each phase of the programme, local authorities are required to develop an educational vision in line with our guidance, which takes into account a range of policy areas, including PE and sport facilities, and community use. Our Building Schools for the Future guidance to local authorities covers the preparation of educational visions, joining up all potential sources of funding and the design of school buildings and facilities. All of our guidance documents make clear that schools and local authorities should consider the extent to which any proposed new or refurbished facilities will enable all pupils to take part in at least two hours each week of high quality PE and sport, and  <br>

 40 per cent. of apprentices are female but we recognise there are some major imbalances in different occupations. One of the ways we are addressing this is working with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and sector bodies to improve information, broaden choice and explore more flexible Apprenticeship learning opportunities. These include new entry arrangements into Apprenticeships to help young people develop skills before they find an employer. We are also trialling Apprenticeships for more mature workers.</p>

 These sections of the Education Act 1996 deal with school attendance and school transport. We believe that parents must take responsibility for their children&#146;s attendance at school. Where children do not attend school regularly, a prosecution or a penalty notice under section 444 may be needed if parents are not doing their best to ensure that their child attends school.</p>

 Promoting cultural identity is an integral and important part of the way languages are taught and studied in England. Intercultural understanding is promoted at each key stage. For example, at Key Stage 2 intercultural understanding is one of the five key strands of the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages. At Key Stage 3 the programme of study, produced by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), states that pupils should make progress in developing cultural awareness, and in QCA's Key Stage 4  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="60703w0003.htm_para4"><a name="0607039000340">Citizenship teaching is compulsory at Key Stages 3 and 4. Pupils are taught about the world as a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations and about the United Kingdom's relations in Europe, including the European Union, and relations with the Commonwealth and the United Nations. Through the citizenship curriculum, pupils are also taught to think about political and cultural issues which could include a discussion about cultural identity. It is also possible for European cultural identity to be taught through the non-statutory framework for PSHE, which covers teaching about and developing a sense of their own identity.</p>

We are establishing a National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics that will support the professional development of teachers of mathematics at every stage of their career. We are adopting a range of measures at GCSE and A-level to promote a positive attitude amongst pupils, teachers and employers to mathematics. For example, we will be targeting our support to ensure that the teaching of &#145;functional mathematics&#146; is available to all; from this September, attainment of at least a &#145;C' grade in both Maths and English will be a key component of our understanding of the 5 good GCSEs benchmark; in the longer term, the curriculum and qualifications in mathematics for 14 to 19-year-olds will be revised as part of the wider reform programme; and finally, improvements planned for A-level as part of our 14-19 reforms will benefit all those embarking on A-level programmes.</p>

Our commitment to language learning is backed by considerable investment, and by the end of the financial year 2007-08 we will have invested &#163;137 million in the promotion of, and support given to, language learning programmes at all stages of education.</p>

The national curriculum programmes of study for English set out the importance of English. English is a vital way of communicating in schools, in public life and internationally. In studying English, pupils develop skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literature in English is rich and influential, reflecting the experience of people from many countries and times. It enables pupils to express themselves creatively and imaginatively and to  <br>

communicate with others effectively. Pupils learn to become enthusiastic and critical readers of stories, poetry and drama as well as non-fiction and media texts. The study of English helps pupils understand how language works by looking at its patterns, structures and origins. Using this knowledge, pupils can choose and adapt what they say and write in different situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="60703w0003.htm_para8"><a name="0607039000344">In addition, both primary and secondary national strategies, through their work with schools and local authorities, provide strong and varied support to teachers. This support enables teachers to provide effective and tailored teaching that engages all pupils across the range of subjects and enables them to fulfil their potential. The national strategies provide a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure that their schools both provide high quality teaching and learning, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading and writing and helps them achieve their potential. Reading for pleasure is essential as it increases children's chances of success and the Department is taking action on several fronts to encourage children and young people to read more. Both strategies have a specific remit for raising attainment in mathematics and English. The secondary strategy extends this remit to modern foreign languages.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 June 2006]:</i> The Department provides substantial support to schools and those who work with them in delivering an inclusive education that meets the needs of all children, through the funding it provides for schools and local authorities, the funds it provides for the Training and Development Agency for Schools and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the guidance it issues. The extent of the Government's commitment to supporting children in schools is illustrated by the fact that since 1997-98, total funding in England has increased nationally, by &#163;1,170 per pupil from &#163;2,940 in 1997-98 to &#163;4,110 per pupil in 2005-06.

 The European Union's proposed action programme in the field of lifelong learning seeks to contribute to the development of the Community as an advanced knowledge society by fostering interchange cooperation and mobility between education and training systems. Intercultural dialogue and exchange are key elements of the programme, and so membership is rightly not limited to the EU member states, but also includes the EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. In addition, Switzerland and the countries of the Western Balkans will be able to participate once bilateral agreements are concluded.

<sup>(1)</sup> Where a teacher has more than one post A-level qualification in the same subject, the qualification level is determined by the highest level reading from left (Degree) to right (Other Qual.). For example, teachers shown under PGCE have a PGCE but not a degree or BEd in the subject, while those with a PGCE and a degree are shown only under Degree.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Teachers are counted once against each subject which they are teaching.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Includes higher degrees but excludes BEds.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Teachers qualified in combined/general science are treated as qualified to teach biology, chemistry, or physics. Teachers qualified in biology, chemistry or physics are treated as qualified to teach combined/general science.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Teachers qualified in other/combined technology are treated as qualified to teach design and technology or information and communication technology. Teachers qualified in design and technology or information and communication technology are treated as qualified to teach other/combined technology.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Information and Communication Technology is abbreviated as ICT and Personal Social and Health Education is abbreviated as PSHE.<br>

 Ofsted, as the inspectorate for children and learners in England, routinely evaluates and reports to the Department on the work carried out by schools in eliminating unlawful racial discrimination. Ofsted inspection reports have found schools&#146; compliance with the specific duties has improved since the introduction of the statutory duty which came into force for schools in 2002. In 2005 Ofsted published a thematic inspection report Race Equality in Education identifying good practice in schools and Local Authorities. The report found areas of strength in promoting racial harmony and raising ethnic minority achievement in schools but weakness in effectively handling racist incidents.</p>

 Changes to local school organisation, including school closures, are decided under local decision-making arrangements. Ministers have no role in the process. Individual proposals are determined by the local authority if they published the proposals and there are no objections. In all other cases the proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or the schools adjudicator, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision.</p>

The guidance includes a presumption against the closure of rural schools and sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals. For rural school closures the factors include: whether the case is strong and in the best interests of educational provision in the area; the overall effect of the closure on the local community; the transport implications and whether the possibilities of federated or extended schools to increase viability have been considered.</p>

Following publication and a six- week representation period the proposal will be decided by the appropriate decision maker.

 Head teachers are responsible for curriculum planning and it is for them to decide how much time they devote to physical education and sport in the national curriculum. The Department for Education and Skills shares an ambitious PSA target with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds who take part in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and on to 85 per cent. by 2008. The long term aim, by 2010, is for all children to be offered at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours high quality PE and sport at school and the opportunity for at least a further two to three hours beyond the school day, delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="60703w0007.htm_para4"><a name="0607039001102">The annual National School Sport Survey is our prime tool for measuring progress towards these targets. The results of the 2004/05 survey showed that schools in school sport partnerships provided, on average, 15 different sports for their pupils. These ranged from football, which was provided by 97 per cent. of schools, to less traditional sports like rowing, bowls and squash. The results of the survey were published in September 2005 and copies were placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

The ASC's aim is to challenge the tendency to adopt a silo approach by encouraging greater cross-profession and cross-organisation working.

 We withdrew our direct budget support because the Government of Ethiopia breached one of the three commitments underlying our aid partnership&#151;respect for human rights.

 The EU, that is the 25 member states and the European Commission, is the largest donor on water and sanitation in Africa, spending over &#163;1.4 billion in the sector in 2003-04. The EU Water Initiative was set up to co-ordinate these efforts, identify gaps and ensure that the money we spend is used more effectively to deliver services to the poor. The UK attaches great importance to more and better aid for water and sanitation, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa where the MDG targets for access to these basic services are so off track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="60703w0007.htm_para13"><a name="06070318000024">There has, however, been concern that political commitment to the EU Water Initiative has declined and that it is not delivering its objectives. A further problem is that with very limited monitoring and reporting mechanisms it has not been sufficiently accountable to its stakeholders. We have therefore raised these issues in the EU Water Initiative Steering Group and are now working with a number of other member states to reinvigorate the initiative, including developing proper indicators for monitoring and improving the focus of work in partner countries. We hope this will lead to renewed political commitment and better implementation on the ground.</p>

In addition, the EU-Africa Strategy also included a reference to access to water supply and sanitation. In raising the political profile of water and sanitation through these policy documents, we hope that other member states will be encouraged to increase their support to the sector, particularly as their levels of development funding increase.</p>

 International health worker migration is a complex issue and one that the UK takes seriously. Some low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have less than one health worker per 1,000 population. The proportion of African doctors who leave is very significant. Ghana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Zambia lose between a third and a half of the doctors they train to international migration. This rapid increase in health worker migration has been partly due to staff leaving their country for greener pastures. As a result the UK has been criticised for employing workers from developing countries. However, poor working conditions, poor salaries and a lack of training and opportunity for advancement have meant that many staff in developing  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="60703w0007.htm_para15"><a name="06070318000028">The UK NHS has responded by putting in place policies to prevent active international recruitment of health care professionals. The UK is the only developed country to have a code of practice preventing its national health service from targeting health care professionals from developing countries. While the code on its own cannot address all the root causes of migration, it plays an important role in ensuring that recruitment is undertaken in an ethical, managed way. In addition to this, DFID supports efforts to strengthen health services in many countries, including to increase human resources. For example, DFID is providing &#163;100 million over six years to support the Government of Malawi's health sector programme, which includes doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors over the next six years.</p>

 Due to the increased numbers of those leaving the RAF in April as a result of the recent redundancy exercise, coupled with the roll-out of JPA at the same time, it was not possible to process all terminal grant payments, special capital payments and pension payments within the normal five days target. During April and May some 1,830 awards were processed for those leaving the RAF, of which 1,395 were paid outside of the five-day target from being discharged. However, in all but six cases payments were made within 30 days, with the remainder paid shortly thereafter. There are now no outstanding payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="60703w0011.htm_para1"><a name="06070330000576">The first JPA payroll in April successfully delivered pay, including allowances and charges to the vast majority of RAF personnel (42,104 out of 48,743). The 6,639 pay inaccuracies (over and underpayments) were caused by several factors: some were due to existing data errors transferred over from the legacy systems, some were input errors, and some were discrepancies in flying pay. The majority of flying pay was correctly paid by 2 May; a small number of RAF personnel were paid their April entitlement in their May payments. The second (May) payroll has been much more successful with only some 1,175 personnel still affected by pay inaccuracies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="60703w0011.htm_para2"><a name="06070330000577">Some salary payments were late as a result of the simultaneous introduction of a new system of overseas bank payments. Overseas payments were achieved within a few days of the due date and alternative local cash payments were arranged. There have also been some difficulties with the automated payment of expenses for official journeys. In April these affected nearly 4,000 personnel and in May approximately 600.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="60703w0011.htm_para3"><a name="06070330000578">The total number of personnel JPA will pay once it is fully rolled out is approximately 280,000. The Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has received some 14 pieces of ministerial correspondence on behalf of constituents.

Services include silver surfer sessions, help with charges such as reservations and fines, services to the housebound and homes for the elderly and provision of materials in accessible formats.</p>

 The following figures are calculated against a claimant population for the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS) of 120,000 claims and are, consequently, likely to overstate the true position as the total number of claimants who will receive a payment will be somewhat lower.

 Current planning policy guidance on allotments and open space is set out in PPG17: Open Space, Sport and Recreation, published in 2002. This provides enhanced protection from development for all types of open space. In particular, PPG17 indicates that open space should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken that has clearly shown that the open space is surplus to requirements. It also includes specific policies to protect playing fields from development. These policies are supported by the Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields) (England) Direction 1998 which gives the Secretary of State for Communities and local government the power to call in planning applications affecting playing fields where local authorities have not resolved Sport England's objections.</p>

Consent cannot be given unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that certain criteria are met. Clarified criteria were issued to local authorities in February 2001.</p>

The status of &#147;qualified person&#148; under those regulations relates to whether or not a person has a right to reside in the United Kingdom under European Union law, for example as a worker. The Court of Appeal found that the applicants were subject to immigration control as they did not have a right to reside.

It is anticipated that there will be mixed tenure on each site in order to ensure mixed communities, with some homes being available for affordable rent, some under shared equity and some for private sale. Around 50 per cent. of the homes will be affordable social renting or shared equity homes. For example, shared equity in two-bedroom homes on the first sites will be sold for between &#163;55,000 and &#163;70,000.

In a ministerial statement on 8 June I announced the results of a survey by my Department that showed a large percentage of authorities preparing new-style local development frameworks were including such policies in their plans. It is essential that all planning authorities adopt the positive approach to renewables set out in PPS22 at the earliest opportunity in their plan making.

This estimate was based on data from the Survey of English Housing for the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and from the 1996 English House Condition Survey.

For example, in the recent East of England Examination In Public, Anglian Water and Thames Water both made representations to the independent panel outlining their views on the impact on water supply as a result of house building. However, such representations by water companies can be made at different stages of the planning process, both formally and informally.

 All public service pension schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under public private partnerships/public finance initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service pension scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the public sector transfer club. The club is a network of public and private-sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

 Opium is a major source of credit for many households in Afghanistan. It is used to lease land, purchase agricultural inputs and meet the cost of education and health services. Household dependence on opium cultivation for accessing services, and the opium debt which results from using opium as credit, are a growing problem in Afghanistan. Micro-finance can make an important contribution to addressing this problem and helping to promote alternative livelihoods to opium in Afghanistan. In 2005 the Department for International Development provided &#163;5 million to Afghanistan's Micro-Finance and Investment Support Facility (MISFA) to introduce a special funding window to promote and enable the expansion of micro-finance in poppy-growing provinces. This financial support is helping Micro-Finance Institutions develop financial products that better meet the financing needs for alternative livelihoods and the problem of indebtedness. Moreover, the MISFA programme is providing a source of legal credit to the poor and people on low incomes to access services, thus reducing the demand for credit from opium and therefore reducing the risk of Afghan households losing assets or land due to opium indebtedness.</p>

 At present some 80 per cent. of the population of Helmand are engaged in farming and a significant number are engaged in opium cultivation. The main contributing factors to opium production in Helmand result from the devastating impact of three decades of war. The conflict led to increasing poverty; a severe decline in investment in essential infrastructure such as roads and the Helmand irrigation system; insecurity and the lack of the rule of law; and the absence of a credible Government providing basic services. As a result, the people of Helmand have become increasingly dependent on illegal opium cultivation for income to meet basic needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="60703w0036.htm_para2"><a name="06070415000348">The Afghan Government are looking to improve the situation for farmers in Helmand, but progress has been hampered by problems delivering Government development programmes there. To help address this problem, the Department for International Development will be spending &#163;30 million over the next three years in Helmand through the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme. This programme will deliver assistance through the Afghan Government's National Programmes in the province. These aim to extend the Afghan Government's authority and demonstrate that they can be a credible provider of public services, such as the provision of safe drinking water, credit for investment in agricultural business and essential investment in much needed infrastructure, particularly irrigation. These are all essential elements for increasing the number of legal employment opportunities available to households and reducing the dependence on opium cultivation.</p>

The international community, including regional states, should focus on promoting dialogue among the Somalia parties in support of the agreement reached between the Transitional Federal Government and the Islamic Courts in Khartoum on 22 June 2006.</p>

 Although Mr. Ching Cheong holds a British National Overseas (BN(O)) passport he did not use this passport to enter China and he is deemed by the Chinese authorities to be a Chinese national. We have made representations, through our embassy in Beijing and our consulate in Guangzhou, to the Chinese authorities in respect of Mr. Ching&#146;s case and we will continue to do so at every appropriate opportunity. We have serious and long-standing concerns over the use of arbitrary detention in China, inadequate fair trial guarantees and the treatment of prisoners, and we make these concerns known to the Chinese authorities. However, as Mr. Ching has been charged with espionage, while he will have legal representation, his trial will take place in a closed session in accordance with current Chinese law.</p>

 Government policy ensures that all wind farm applications made under Section 36 of the Electricity Act are accompanied by an environmental impact assessment which includes details of the likely impact on all parts of the environment, including birds. Application for smaller-scale windfarms are submitted to the relevant planning authority to determine under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and it would be for that authority to say whether an EIA was required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="60703w0044.htm_para4"><a name="06070415001333">When an application is considered, consultation will take place with a range of stakeholders, including statutory advisers on nature conservation and protection of the environment, as well as others who express an interest in the proposal. This ensures that decisions on whether to give approval for a wind farm are considered in the light of the best available information about its likely impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="60703w0044.htm_para5"><a name="06070415001334">In addition, should it be considered that there could be an impact on protected species or their habitats then an appropriate assessment must be undertaken pursuant to the Conservation (Natural Habitats,&amp;c.) Regulations 1994, irrespective of who the decision taker may be. In such circumstances the decision taker must consult the appropriate nature conservation body (English Nature, the Countryside Council for Wales or Scottish Natural Heritage) and take its views into account before making any decision on whether to approve the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="60703w0044.htm_para6"><a name="06070415001335">Furthermore, the DTI has established a Research Advisory Group to fund research into the impact of wind farms on the environment. This includes a joint study with wind farm developers and DEFRA to collect data on the distribution of sea birds in the three strategic offshore wind farm areas, the results of which will inform decisions on the grant of consent for wind farm projects in those areas.</p>

 Overcrowding, and its subsequent effects in terms of prisoners&#146; distance from home, prisoner transfers and the time prisoners spend out of their cells, may be one factor in heightening the distress linked to suicide.

<i> [holding answer 21 March 2006]:</i> I took on ministerial responsibility for the SIA on 4 May. My predecessor Paul Goggins met with the SIA on a number of occasions to discuss the impact of the implementation date of 20 March 2006. The SIA put in place a system 14 months before the 20 March 2006 to manage the transition to licensing. This date was agreed after consultation with the industry, who had undertaken to submit their applications in good time. While some did submit their applications in good time, other parts of the industry failed to do so. The SIA wants all of the security industry to be compliant with the law as soon as possible and has taken additional steps to speed up the processing of licence applications. These include temporarily doubling the capacity of the SIA's licensing system and working closely with companies to reduce applicant error rates. Enforcement action is a matter for the SIA and the police. ACPO and the SIA have issued joint Enforcement Guidelines in which they stated they intend to take a measured and proportionate approach to enforcement.</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_42"><a name="06070447000929">(4) for what reason the Criminal Records Bureau requires a minimum of 100 disclosure applications to be made by a body for that body to qualify as a registered body. [76158]</p>

<p><a name="st_539"><a name="06070447000930"><a name="60703w0048.htm_spnew8"><a name="06070447001480"><b>Joan Ryan:</b>
 Following a public consultation exercise last year, a full regulatory impact assessment was completed, and placed in the Library along with the regulations. This included a small firms impact test which acknowledged that small organisations would probably not be able to satisfy the minimum threshold and would need to approach other organisations in order to obtain checks on their employees and incur the associated costs. However, in some cases it was concluded that the costs of using such an organisation would be lower than the administrative costs of running and maintaining a small volume registered body. No race related issues were identified during the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="60703w0048.htm_para3"><a name="06070447000931">The changes arose from a key recommendation of the 2002 independent review of the CRB and were supported by the recent Bichard inquiry that recommended reducing the number of registered bodies from over 14,000 that existed at the time. It also follows the CRB&#146;s own research that revealed that up to a third of registered bodies were not fully complying with the guidance and the code of practice and explanatory guide issued by the CRB which is a condition of registration. One of the areas of weakness was in completing the requisite identity checks on applicants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_489"><a name="60703w0048.htm_para4"><a name="06070447000932">The intention is to make the registered body network more professional and more experienced in the disclosure process which will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is proficient in the security and policies of the CRB. Setting an annual threshold is a key part of the CRB&#146;s strategy to enhance the effectiveness of, and improve standards within the registered body network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_490"><a name="60703w0048.htm_para5"><a name="06070447000933">The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations on the options available to access the disclosure service before their registration is cancelled due to low volume.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"><a name="60703w0048.htm_para6"><a name="06070447000934">The CRB has written to some 2,800 organisations to inform them that they are to become deregistered. These organisations have submitted 10 or fewer applications in the last 12 months.</p>

 Physical embarkation controls were withdrawn at seaports in 1994 and reconfigured at major airports in 1998. The five year immigration strategy for asylum and immigration, published in February 2005, contains details of our plans, through the e-Borders programme, to strengthen and modernise our border control including providing an electronic record of all those entering and leaving the UK. This is scheduled to commence in 2008.</p>
