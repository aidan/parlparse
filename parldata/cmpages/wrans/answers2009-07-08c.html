 The latest available figures for the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) relate to financial year 2007-08. This period has therefore been used for the figures given for the average monthly payments made under both schemes:</p>

These averages are not comparable because of different lengths of service, different rank structure between the Brigade of Gurkhas and the wider Army and, chiefly, because Gurkhas begin drawing on their pensions much earlier than British soldiers with equivalent service. For example, a Gurkha Rifleman or Corporal with 15 years service (approximately 85 per cent. of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension after 15 years service (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60.</p>

For other ranks, the middle of the pay range is used. It is also assumed that the retiring officer will elect to commute the maximum amount of pension allowable in order to receive a lump sum payment on retirement, as the majority of retiring officers do elect to receive a lump sum. This would mean the officer&#146;s first-year pension payment would be 50 per cent. of his or her final salary. Given that the factors for calculating the commutation of a lump sum payment are based on the age of each officer, it is not possible to estimate an average amount for a lump sum payment.</p>

 Since 2001 the Government have committed over &#163;41 million to the development of solar PV in the UK through grant programmes and field trials. Currently solar PV has benefited significantly under the Low Carbon Buildings (LCBP) programme with an original budget of &#163;86 million. The Government have committed a further &#163;45 million to the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in the recent Budget. This now brings support for the programme to over &#163;130 million.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not discussed the proposed Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP) with the Competition Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="90708w0008.htm_para0"><a name="09070885001912">In its inquiry into the groceries market the Commission found that one of the features that adversely affected competition in the market was the exercise of buyer power by certain grocery retailers with respect to their suppliers of groceries, through the adoption of supply chain practices that transfer excessive risks and unexpected costs to those suppliers. The GSCOP is being introduced by the Competition Commission, which is an independent public body, in response to this finding.</p>

Non-custodial sentences include discharges, fines, community sentences, and a number of other sentences that do not involve incarceration. Acquitted includes proceeding discontinued, discharged, withdrawn and dismissed.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures. For this reason proportionate figures have been provided in the table.<br>

 No evaluation or assessment has been made of the Stoke-on-Trent Local Involvement Network (LINk) executive board, or the adequacy of resources available. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 put a duty on local authorities with social services responsibilities to establish LINks in their area from 1 April 2008. LINks are independent and have the power to develop their own priorities, agendas and governance arrangements. The Stoke-on-Trent LINk management board is elected by the members of the LINk. The Department has issued a range of guidance to support LINks, their hosts, and local authorities in this new role and provides the funding for LINks (currently &#163;84 million for 2008-09 to 2010-11), the vast majority of which goes directly to local authorities. The level of the local authority contribution to the LINk is a matter for individual councils. As part of its annual reporting to the Secretary of State, an individual LINk is asked to declare the amount of funding made available to it in order that it might carry out its duties. The Department has not yet received the annual report from Stoke-on-Trent LINk.</p>

 The inclusion of all children and young people in England is a legal requirement of ContactPoint and its purpose could never be achieved through a consent-based or opt-out system. Including all children avoids the potential stigma that a targeted directory could have. The information on ContactPoint is very limited and it is proportionate to hold this information for all children rather than having to continuously make and review threshold decisions as vulnerable children's circumstances change over time. It is also important and appropriate to cover every child in England because any child or young person could require the support of additional services at any time. It is not possible to predict accurately in advance which children will have additional needs&#151;estimates show that 3-4 million children and young people will need additional targeted and specialist services at any one point in time and 5-6 million will have such needs at some point throughout their childhood. We need a universal approach because we do not know, or cannot readily predict, who they may be, or when their needs may arise.</p>

 Only certain aspects of sex and relationships education, mainly the biological ones, are compulsory for all children in certain age groups. These are taught as part of the National Science Curriculum. Primary school children in Key Stages 1 and 2 are taught about reproduction, puberty and how a baby is born. In addition we expect schools to have a programme on sex and relationship education (SRE) that is delivered through well planned and non-statutory Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE). We make it clear in our Sex and Relationship Education Guidance (July 2000) to schools that any programme of study must be tailored to the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the children. In early primary schools, SRE should focus on relationships such as friendship, bullying and the building of self-esteem.</p>

 Following increased funding nationally from the Department, the Homes and Communities Agency has already allocated &#163;8.6 million of grant funding to Torbay over the period 2008-11. This will deliver 185 new homes for rent and 39 shared ownership homes. Torbay could also benefit from the new funding streams (totalling &#163;1.5 billion) in the Housing Pledge announced as part of &#147;Building Britain&#146;s Future&#148; on 29 June.</p>
