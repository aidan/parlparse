It is possible that this is because there is an obstruction in the area and this is under investigation. SFPA report that fishing in this area will generally be Nephrops (Norway lobster or &#145;scampi&#146;) trawling by Scottish vessels. There is also some Danish industrial fishing of pout and sand eel, and some pelagic UK, Danish and Swedish vessels targeting mackerel and herring. The SFF indicate that data show that there has been only one day of pelagic fishing in the past three years in the statistical square that the area lies in and that there is a significant number of days by vessels targeting whitefish using single boat demersal gear and demersal pair trawl.

There are also some UK beam trawls and UK vessels using static fishing gear. There may be an occasional UK trawler operating in the area. While the area was popular with Grimsby based trawlers many years ago, the decline in that sector has meant that there has been little recorded activity by them in recent times.

However some of these vessels will venture further off shore. Wells based potting vessels in North Norfolk are more likely to operate further offshore and in the proposed SAC area. The offshore potters based in Grimsby, Bridlington and Scarborough are active throughout the general area. Some five UK long-liners can work the area, principally for cod, skate and dogfish, though the numbers have declined in recent years, with some of the vessels now concentrating on survey and guardship duties. Data from the Marine Fisheries Agency's Fishery Activity Database (FAD) show that the value of landings of fish caught within the boundary of the proposed site, in England by UK vessels, is &#163;841,000 from beam trawls and &#163;68,000 from other demersal towed gear.</p>

The site tends to be a seasonal fishery because of weather and as such provides a good fishing area for larger boats during summer months. The effort is nearly all demersal trawling. The main species targeted are Nephrops (Norway lobster or &#145;scampi&#146;), haddock, hake and monkfish as well as various other species. The West of Scotland Fish Producers Organisation note that their vessels target nephrops and take by-catches of monk, megrim whiting, haddock and hake suing bottom trawls. In addition there is seasonal pelagic boat activity and significant crab fishing. Irish vessels (using both pelagic and demersal gear) also operate in this area; indeed part of the proposed site lies in Irish grey zone where UK-and Irish-claimed fishing limits overlap and there is an agreed system for enforcement.

 The prohibition on the import of wild birds into the EU was extended in July 2007 and with this prohibition likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future, the situation in the commercial trade of wild birds has changed. My Department therefore revised the criteria for the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) assessment of species to be listed on schedule 4. The list of species provided by the JNCC was considered in terms of the proportionality of the burden that registration of these species would place on keepers, balancing any conservation benefit that may arise from registration against the regulatory burden imposed by registration.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 May 2008]:</i> UK Trade &amp; Investment measures its performance in terms of the value it adds for its customers and for the economy. In the case of its trade services, results for FY 2007-08 show that UKTI helped 15,900 UK companies to exploit overseas business opportunities. The total estimated additional bottom line profit for these businesses, generated by UKTI services, was &#163;3 billion. In the case of inward investment, we expect the outturn result for the year to be close to the 525 target for foreign direct investment projects which UKTI has successfully facilitated, and significantly to have exceeded the target for 125 of those projects to be of high value.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 April 2008]:</i> The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) currently operates a network of 425 driving test centres throughout Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80519w0005.htm_para16"><a name="08051944000109">To facilitate the introduction of new European requirements for practical tests, alongside its existing estate DSA is developing a new national network of driving test centres. These centres, which are based on an updated design, are fully compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act and also support the Government's wider sustainability agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80519w0005.htm_para17"><a name="08051944000110">In order to exploit the value of the investment in these new centres DSA have decided that, wherever possible, they will be multi-purpose test centres (MPTCs). The new centres will have appropriate facilities to conduct practical tests for learner car drivers and motorcyclists. In some cases, there will also be provision for lorry driver tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80519w0005.htm_para18"><a name="08051944000111">As an organisation which relies on test fee income for the provision of its services DSA needs to ensure that it can deliver a cost-effective service which avoids unnecessary expenditure. The provision of MPTCs is expected to cost in the region of &#163;71 million. That cost will largely be recovered through increased fees paid by test candidates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80519w0005.htm_para19"><a name="08051944000112">In order to keep those fee increases to the minimum, DSA must closely examine how it delivers its services and seek more efficiencies in the way it conducts its business. This includes reviewing existing driving test centre provision to ensure that, while the service standard is maintained, there is no wasteful over-provision of facilities. Regrettably this does mean that some existing driving test centres have to close.</p>

This was achieved by using a combination of well-rehearsed internal contingency measures (such as employing existing technology to &#145;pair&#146; rescue co-ordination centres, where necessary), redeploying experienced managers, establishing a national strategic support centre and co-ordinating closely with other search and rescue operators.

 Responsibility for issuing the concessionary travel passes rests with travel concession authorities, as it has done since 2000. When we made the decision last September to require the new concessionary travel passes to be in smartcard form we recognised this was a challenging requirement in the time available. This is why we put in place contingency arrangements, including allowing existing local passes to remain valid in the local area until 30 September, and providing authorities with temporary passes for people who wished to travel outside their local area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80519w0007.htm_para2"><a name="08051944000479">In fact, most local authorities and their suppliers were able to produce passes in time for the start of the concession. By 1 April, 95 per cent. of the anticipated passes had been produced. Unfortunately, while they had managed to produce the passes on time, we are aware that some suppliers experienced last minute problems in dispatching those passes to eligible people. Despite this, we estimate that around 4.8 million passes were dispatched by 1 April.</p>

 The initial identification of issues reflecting comments by these Agencies is summarised for each location in the recently published consultation document&#151;&#147;Eco-towns&#151;Living a greener future&#148;. This summarises the issues facing each shortlisted location and assesses both the benefits of the schemes and the challenges, as communicated to Communities and Local Government by all those agencies with an interest, including those related to transport and the environment. Copies of the consultation document are available in the House Library. Assessment of the issues and challenges for each location by the Agencies and other partners is continuing and will be set out in more detail in a draft Sustainability Appraisal on the locations and a draft policy statement, which we expect to publish for further consultation in July.</p>

 The recent review of the fire safety aspects of the building regulations looked at the case for sprinklers in warehouses. We undertook supporting research on the issue and a full public consultation. Following consultation, it was decided that a limit for the maximum unsprinklered compartment size for single storey warehouses should be set at 20,000m<sup>(2)</sup> and/or a height of 18m where previously no such limit existed. This new maximum compartment size was included in the 2006 edition of Approved Document B which came into effect in April 2007.</p>

Others are targeting specific estates, locations or local authority areas. We estimate that the pilot scheme which ran from April 2006 to March 2008 and resulted in 207 sales was offered across 5 per cent. of social stock.<br>

 As set out in the consultation document &#147;Eco-towns&#151;Living a greener future&#148; we expect eco-towns to contribute significantly to help to meet those revised targets for additional housing and we want to assure local authorities, which include an eco-town in their future housing plans that it will, of course, count towards those future housing targets, which in most places are likely to be more stretching. The Housing Green Paper made clear that the housing numbers in existing and in some cases emerging plans were not high enough to address the pressing problem of long-term housing need and affordability. We are therefore aiming to complete a further set of Regional Spatial Strategy partial reviews by 2011 that will include revised housing numbers for local planning authorities that are consistent with our national aim to deliver 240,000 homes per year by 2016.</p>

The practice direction can be found at:</p>

 The Ministry of Justice was created in May 2007 and has since produced a sustainable development action plan setting out how the estate intends to reach carbon neutral status by 2012. This involves reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency through sustainable building construction and operation. In addition, both HM prison service and HM courts service have developed BREEAM assessments that enables the procurement of sustainable and energy efficient new builds and major refurbishments.</p>

 The present system of household registration enables any occupant of a household to complete the prescribed annual canvass form. However, the person completing the form is required to certify that the information they supply is true and accurate to the best of their knowledge by providing a signature and by printing their name. Also electors who complete a rolling registration form on an individual basis are required to sign that form.</p>

In addition, any individual may also make an objection to the ERO about another person&#146;s registration details at any time. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 also made it an offence to supply false information on an electoral registration form, which is punishable by a prison sentence of up to six months or a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000.</p>

 The use of computerised personal information in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998. The Information Commissioner administers and enforces the Act independently of the Government. His office produces advice for individuals about their rights and guidance for organisations on how to comply with the Act when using personal information and websites. For example, in January 2007 the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office published a Personal Information Toolkit for the general public; in June 2007 it produced guidance to data controllers about collecting personal information on the internet and in November 2007 it launched a new website to provide tips and advice on safe social networking and to help young people protect their personal information.</p>

 A request was received in November 2005 before the exhumation and reburial of the remains of Mr. Kelly. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Custodial Property Estates Section agreed to meet the reasonable costs.</p>

These were settled the same month by final payment made to the solicitors who had requested the exhumation and reburial. There were two remaining claims for costs in respect of which requests for interim payments were made. The first claim related to the role of a person asked by the same solicitors to make the arrangements for the exhumation and reburial. However, no breakdown of the costs was supplied with the claim and as, despite several requests, such a breakdown was not provided no interim payment could be made. The information was eventually provided and the amount payable agreed and paid. The second claim related to the services of a psychologist. Following a meeting in August 2006 an offer to settle the claim was made that month but there was a delay in a formal response. NOMS is endeavouring to seek to settle this account appropriately.</p>

The claim for costs for the role of the person asked by the same solicitors to arrange the exhumation and reburial was agreed with the solicitors and paid in January 2008.

We have, as chair of the UN Security Council, called for action by Burma to work with the UN and international donors and expedite access. We are pressing regional powers such as Thailand, China, India and Indonesia at senior political and official level to use their influence on Burma to accept unfettered international assistance. We have said that we would use whatever delivery mechanism they are able to negotiate with the Burmese and channel our relief effort through them. My noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown, is visiting key Asian capitals to mobilise support for a significant increase in the amount of assistance reaching Burma and the delta region in particular.</p>

For listed companies, the accounting treatment for measurement and disclosure of losses in companies' annual reports, including any in relation to exposure to sub-prime, is governed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the EU. Most UK banks have 31 December year-ends and will have included in their annual reports for 2007 their losses as at 31 December 2007. Under IFRS, there is no specific obligation for companies to disclose separately any losses from exposure to the sub-prime market, though many banks did provide such additional disclosures in their 2007 annual reports, reflecting the materiality of the disclosures.</p>

 The Government are committed to combating tax evasion and avoidance and is working closely with EU and OECD partners to tackle the problem. Tax havens are characterised by banking secrecy and a lack of cooperation for tax compliance purposes. A key objective therefore is to increase transparency and exchange of information. The EU savings directive and the associated agreements with non-EU countries and territories play an important part in this. The current review of the directive is an opportunity to pursue our objective. Within the OECD there is a renewed determination to push forward the process of negotiating tax information exchange agreements with offshore jurisdictions. We urge all countries, including tax havens, to meet OECD transparency standards.</p>

 UKBA recently piloted the use of a short-term holding facility at small south coast sea ports, primarily Poole.

A version of this vehicle, informed by the earlier pilot but with a different specification is currently being developed to meet the needs of our enforcement teams. UKBA is on track to pilot the new vehicle during autumn 2008 in the Northampton area. Funding for this trial will be from within existing resources and is commercial in confidence.</p>

 The working holidaymaker scheme (WHS) will be abolished later this year when the new Youth Mobility Scheme under the Points-Based System (PBS) is launched.

Since under the PBS it will not be possible to switch from Tier 5: youth mobility into Tier 1: highly skilled migrants, we announced, in anticipation of that, there would be no switching from the WHS into Tier 1 in our Statement of Intent, published on 5 December 2007. Working holidaymakers who wish to work in the UK as highly skilled migrants therefore need to return to their home country to apply for the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) before it is closes at the end of the summer, or for Tier 1 (General) once HSMP has been closed. There are no figures available for how many working holidaymaker have returned home to apply for HSMP entry clearances.</p>

 We recently carried out a major review of WORKSTEP, Access to Work, Work Preparation, the Job Introduction Scheme and the Disability Employment Advisor role. We listened to the views of many disabled people, employers, external delivery partners and Jobcentre Plus staff, as well as taking into account the recommendations from the National Audit Office and the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report &#145;Improving Life Chances of Disabled People&#146;. The public consultation, which closed on 10 March, set out proposals to improve these services to help more disabled people. We will publish a response to the consultation during the summer.</p>

As well as the normal methods of publicity, for example leaflets and the Jobcentre Plus and Directgov websites, Disability Employment Advisers work hard to engage with customer representative organisations and other partners in the community. This is particularly important in increasing access to services for people with learning difficulties. In Edinburgh, for example, the Disability Employment Advisers work closely with organisations that support customers with learning disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="80519w0028.htm_para10"><a name="0805202002979">Jobcentre Plus is often invited to contribute to literature produced by various disability organisations including for example RADAR'S Doing Work Differently, which includes information on Disability Employment Advisers and the specialised support available to disabled people.

The Training and Development Agency for Schools is developing a range of units for training providers to help trainees meet the standards for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

 The Government are committed to improving the quality of PE and sport in all schools, using Building Schools for the Future (BSF) as a vehicle. In their BSF Strategy for Change submission, all local authorities must establish a PE and Sport stakeholder group. This group should have representation from Sport England, County Sports Partnerships, and school sports partnerships to raise the profile of sport within the programme and develop facilities within their area. In addition, Partnerships for Schools, Sport England and the Youth Sports Trust fund &#147;Sports Advisers&#148; to help develop community-use facilities. These Sports Advisers work with the local authority sports stakeholder groups to develop a vision, and support the stakeholder groups to work with schools to achieve it. These advisers also work with Sport England to ensure sports governing  bodies can contribute to the developing BSF strategy. The Department also publishes a guide titled &#147;Inspirational Design for PE and Sport Spaces&#148; for all local authorities, to assist in developing their BSF Strategy for Change.</p>

 The main body of the legislation regulating the education of children with special educational needs (SEN) is contained within Part IV of the Education Act 1996 and associated Regulations. That Act consolidated the Education Act 1993 which legislated in this area and which, in turn, followed the original SEN legislation contained in the Education Act 1981. The SEN Code of Practice gives statutory guidance to schools, local authorities and others in carrying out their duties for children with SEN.</p>

The changes the 2001 Act made to Part IV of the Education Act 1996 in summary were: it strengthened the right of children with SEN to be educated in mainstream schools where that is what their parents want and the interests of other children can be protected; it required local education authorities to provide the parents of children with SEN advice and information and a means of resolving disputes; it required local education authorities to comply with SEN and disability tribunal orders within prescribed periods; and it required schools to inform parents where they are making special educational provision and allowed schools to request a statutory assessment of a pupil's SEN.</p>

Figures were adjusted to reflect actual teacher numbers up to 2007-8. Teacher numbers for 2008-9 onwards have been assumed to be constant at 2007-8 levels. 3 Figures for 2008-9 onwards are based on recommendations in 17th STRB report for headline award and London Enhancements.  4 Real terms figures calculated in 2006-7 prices using 28 March 2008 GDP Deflators. From 2006-07 onwards, pay settlements are awarded on an academic year basis.
