To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport whether she plans to change her policy on the self-help scheme to provide assistance for rural residents outside the reach of analogue television signals.  [135268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w01.html_spnew0"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We recognise the benefit of existing analogue self help schemes in extending terrestrial television to rural communities not reached by the broadcasters' television transmitters. These schemes continue to be licensed by my Department. We will be considering the potential of self help schemes to enable communities to receive digital television services in the context of on-going work under the Digital Television Action Plan.

<a name="31104w01.html_spnew1"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that terrestrial analogue broadcasting signals are maintained until: everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form (BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4/S4C and Five) can receive them on digital systems; switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people; and as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers have access to digital equipment. A Digital Television Action Plan is already in place, designed to deliver these pre-conditions for switching off analogue terrestrial transmissions. A copy of the Action Plan is available at www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the total demand for air travel in the UK in 2060, expressed as a multiple of the present number of passengers using Heathrow, on the basis of the forecast rates of growth used to calculate the economic benefits of various runway options in the consultation on the Future of Air Transport.  [135187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The forecasts presented in the consultation document, "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East", 2002, extended to 2030. No forecast has been made of the total demand for air travel in the UK in 2060. However, for the purposes of the analysis of economic benefits of runway options, the forecasts were projected forward to 2060, assuming a 50 per cent. increase in demand from 2030 to 2060.

<P>
<a name="31104w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 11 September 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 373W, on air travel, what estimate has been made of the percentage change in the cost of air travel from 2000 to 2030, if no new runways were to be built in the UK.  [135218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The mid point forecasts in the consultation document: The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom-South East, assumed an underlying trend reduction in air fares of 1 per cent. per annum. In addition to this, if no new runways were built in the South East, passengers at Heathrow would pay a fare premium of &#163;67.50 on a single journey in 2030. This fare premium would be higher if airport capacity outside the South East was also constrained, but no estimate has been made of this. The combined effect of these two factors would be an 18 per cent. increase in the cost of air travel in this case.

 The question of Government support for any new airport infrastructure is being considered in the context of decisions about future development. In our consultation, we invited views on the use of public money to support airport development and surface transport links, and we are analysing the responses. We will set out our policy in the air transport White Paper.

 To date, the Government have contributed approximately &#163;400,000 to the WHO research project. We expect our total contribution to be in excess of &#163;1.1 million. Epidemiological studies are being carried out in the Netherlands: two at the Leiden University Medical Centre and one at the Amsterdam Medical Centre. Clinical and physiopathological studies are being carried out in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31104w02.html_para0">At the Leiden centre, work is well advanced on the cohort study among business travellers, following a successful pilot study of the employees of an international company in Switzerland. The proposed methodology for the case-control study among frequent travellers was also piloted. However, for technical reasons an alternative methodology has been proposed, which I understand the Scientific Executive Committee responsible for the research protocols has approved in principle. At the Amsterdam centre, following extensive planning and preparation, the first test of the travel and non-travel immobility study will start shortly. This will comprise an eight-hour flight before, during and after which blood samples from volunteer passengers will be drawn for examination. Further tests will be carried out

 Further to the answer I gave to the hon. Gentleman of 17 July: at Table 1 is a list of the Strategic Rail Authority's Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) schemes that include station improvements and which 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2003 : Column 544W</I><P>
have been approved for RPP funding. Table 2 lists a further 68 stations that are being considered by the Authority under its Modern Facilities at Stations Scheme (MFAS). The SRA and Network Rail are currently developing a schedule of work for the stations included in the programme. The timetable has yet to be finalised. Table 3 is a list of schemes in Scotland. Some of these are funded through RPP and some through the Incremental Outputs Statements scheme (IOS). In other cases new stations are also being provided as part of a wider project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Stansted is a designated airport subject to price cap regulation under the 1986 Airports Act. As such, the issue of cross-subsidy in favour of Stansted was considered by the CAA as part of its price cap review and decisions on BAA's London airports, published in February 2003.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The European Commission is responsible for selecting candidates for vacancies within its services. Most such vacancies are filled through internal procedures by permanent Commission employees who have been recruited through open competition. For a small number of temporary appointments the Commission inform member states of vacancies and invite them to submit names of potential candidates. A Commission Selection Committee decides on such appointments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Opening Basra airport to commercial aviation would have a positive effect on trade and reconstruction. We intend that the airport should be

<P>
<a name="31104w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 There have been frequent and regular meetings between the Government and members of the United States State Department before, during and after the conflict, at which all aspects of policy in Iraq have been discussed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Government considers universalisation of the Ottawa Convention to be the best means of combating the production, use, stockpiling or transfer of anti-personnel land mines. The United Kingdom was among the first states to ratify the Convention and continues to play a leading role in follow-up work, including encouraging the widest possible adherence to the treaty. Through our diplomatic missions overseas we have recently lobbied states not party to the Convention, urging their ratification or accession at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The British Government is committed to promoting tolerance and mutual respect between religions. Although the majority of people in Egypt are Muslim, there is a large Christian minority who are free to practice their own religion. The Egyptian State upholds Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Egyptian citizens are therefore free to convert to Christianity. The lack of an administrative provision for

 The 3 bridges destroyed at Novi Sad during the 1999 NATO intervention have been replaced. However, one of these is a temporary pontoon structure, which will be removed on completion of a Euro40 million European-Union funded reconstruction of the 'Sloboda' bridge, due in May 2005. The EU also contributed Euro22 million to the successful clearance of bris and unexploded ordnance from the riverbed, which was completed in June 2003.

 The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe was established in 1999. It has helped the region address a wide range of issues in support of stabilisation, development and reform. The Stability Pact's activity is divided into three Working Tables: Human Rights and Democratisation (Working Table I); Economic Reconstruction, Development and Cooperation (Working Table II); and Security Issues (Working Table III). The Pact's umbrella currently covers 26 different initiatives. The Pact has six priorities for 2003: Local Democracy and Cross Border Cooperation; Media (both Working Table I): Regional Infrastructure/ Energy; Trade and Investment (both Working Table II); Organised Crime; and Managing and Stabilising Population Movements (both Working Table III).

<a name="31104w04.html_para0">The Pact has no budget (except for its own Secretariat) with which to fund or implement projects. Its principal function is to act as a conduit for project implementers and donors. It is therefore difficult to provide information on the status of projects profiled under the auspices of the Pact, as these remain owned by the donor(s).

Boundary Committee for England costs associated with consultations carried out as part of the current Local Government Reviews are also included; however, there is an offsetting Appropriation in Aid from the budget of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to meet these costs.<P>

3. The Boundary Committee for England was established as part of The Electoral Commission on 1 April 2002.

<a name="31104w06.html_para7">The Government are improving value for money through the aggregation of public sector demand for broadband connectivity. In the coming month, nine new Regional Aggregation Bodies (RABs) will be set up, one in each of the English regions to join up individual public sector requirements and present them to the market in larger units. They will deliver better value deals and drive up availability by making it more attractive to telecommunications companies to make the capital investment necessary to provide broadband in new areas. Their work will also improve broadband availability for non-public sector users in those areas by encouraging service providers to use the infrastructure to provide broadband services to the public and small businesses.

 The Government's policy remains the same as that announced in 2001 after a public consultation on the patentability of software. The Government's conclusion from that consultation was to reaffirm the principle that patents are for technological innovations. Software should not be patentable where there is no technological innovation, and technological innovations should not cease to be patentable merely because the innovation lies in software. However, the consultation also concluded that business methods should remain unpatentable.
<P>

<a name="31104w07.html_para0">Subsequently, we have supported the introduction by the European Commission of a draft Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, in order to clarify the legal position across the European Union. Discussions on this Directive are on-going and I await the outcome of further discussions between the EU institutions on its progress.

 By maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, together with measures such as reforming capital gains tax, making permanent enhanced capital allowances for small and medium-sized firms, and introducing the Research and Development Tax Credit, we are providing a climate conducive to investment for the long-term in UK manufacturing.

 The Oil and Gas Industry Liaison Team, in an open letter to the my right hon.

A number of organisations with UK oil and gas interests have also made representations to Ministers. Under the Treaty establishing the European Community, there is already Union activity in energy matters and we believe there is a strong case for making the legal base for policy in this area more transparent.

 The following tables show the available information. The notification requirements apply only where an employer proposes to make redundant 20 or more employees at one establishment. Such notifications should be made 30 days in advance. If an employer proposes to make 100 or more employees redundant at one establishment, the notifications should be 90 days in advance. In addition, there is no information about how many of the proposed redundancies actually take place. The purpose of the advance notifications is to alert trade unions and employment and other support services to likely future job losses. They do not purport to represent a measure of the numbers of redundancies occurring in the economy.

Table 2 shows these numbers as a percentage of the total number of employee jobs in England, Scotland and Wales, respectively.

 The regulation of medicines given to chickens, and all other animals, is governed by European legislation. Directive 2001/82/EC requires all veterinary medicines, including therapeutic antimicrobials, to be assessed against statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy before they are authorised for use. Safety in this context includes the health and welfare of the treated animal, the operator, the environment and the safety of consumers of any food products from the treated animals. All therapeutic antimicrobials are classified as Prescription Only

<a name="31104w08.html_para2">The authorisation and use of non-therapeutic products administered to farm animals in their feed is subject to controls set down by the European Union (Council Directive 70/524/EC as amended). Under these rules, such products cannot be authorised for use unless they satisfy statutory criteria designed to ensure that, at the level permitted in feedstuffs, they will not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. Additionally, they may only be used in accordance with the terms set out in an annex to the Directive, which specifies the species in which they may be used, authorised dosage rates and the withdrawal periods that must be applied before animals can be slaughtered for human consumption. Non-therapeutic products administered to farm animals in their feed are authorised centrally in the EU.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 November 2003]:</i> The Department has not commissioned research into the biochemical implications of introducing genes coding for enzymes under the control of host regulatory elements because it is not relevant to the risk assessment of current GM crop releases. However, there has been a large volume of research commissioned elsewhere, which would inform decision making if this issue became relevant to proposed releases in the future.
<P>

<a name="31104w08.html_para9">The biochemical implications of using regulatory elements will vary in each specific case, and where relevant, would be taken into account by our expert advisers alongside other factors. In general, the use of regulatory elements native to plants will result in lower levels of transgene expression than those derived from bacteria and viruses as used in current GM crops (e.g. 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter).
<P>

<a name="31104w08.html_para10">There is a possibility that introducing copies of regulatory elements that are already present in the host plant could result in partial or complete silencing of native genes under the control of these elements.

 The Irish Box, part of Western Waters, was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 685/95. It comprises the area to the west of Great Britain south of latitude 56 30o North, east of longitude 12 West and north of latitude 50 30o North and includes some some sixty to sixty five thousand square miles of water in parts of ICES Sub Areas VI and VII. Effort ceilings for Community vessels over 18 metres operating in specified fisheries within Western Waters, including the constituent parts of the Irish Box, were subsequently set by Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/95. Under new measures agreed by the Council of Ministers on 13 October 2003, to take effect no later than 1 August 2004, separate effort ceilings will no longer operate for the Irish Box other than for a smaller management area off the south west coast of Ireland designed to protect juvenile hake stocks. Future fishing effort by vessels over 15 metres in the Irish Box will fall to be contained within new effort ceilings to be established for the totality of Areas VI and VII on the basis of actual fishing effort in those areas between 1998 and 2002. In addition a statement added to the minutes of the 13 October Council states that in this and other areas where vessels have previously been excluded the Commission and Member States concerned shall carefully monitor fishing activities in order to ensure that such activities are consistent with the measures already in place for the conservation of fisheries resources.

<a name="31104w09.html_para3">Some of the work has been very specific, for example for the cirl bunting there have been special management options made available to farmers. For some of the other species, in addition to some specific measures, general changes to agri-environment schemes to benefit farmland birds have been put in place.
<P>

<a name="31104w09.html_para4">The yellowhammer is a new addition to the birds of conservation concern red-list and as such does not have a formal Species Action Plan. It is, however, one of the core 20 farmland bird species that are included in the government's Farmland Bird Indicator and as such will benefit from actions being taken to improve general farmland habitat management. Defra has recently piloted a new Entry Level agri-environment scheme in England which relies on much simpler management options to benefit widespread farmland habitats&#151;the advantage with this, if it is implemented, will be that it could cover a much greater area of farmland than under current schemes and so ultimately have much greater benefits for farmland birds.

To ask the Solicitor-General pursuant to her answer of 9 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 574W, on sickness absence, what assessment she has made of the reasons for the rise in the level of long-term sick leave from the Crown Prosecution Service since 1998.  [128545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w10.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer above. The Crown Prosecution Service has not carried out any detailed analysis of the reasons for the rise in the level of long-term sick absence since 1998. However, there continues to be a programme to reduce the overall level of sick absence in line with Government targets for the Civil Service as a whole. The Crown Prosecution Service is actively managing sick absence in line with the Cabinet office's initiative and the figures given in my answer above indicate a reduction in long-term sick absence from 2001 to 2002. The present figures for sick absence in the Crown Prosecution Service are broadly similar to Civil Service figures. The latest Cabinet Office figures show 9.7 per cent. of Civil Service staff had periods of absences lasting 21 days or more.

 We are still awaiting receipt of information from the Federal Government of Nigeria, requested a year ago that will permit me to make a fully informed decision on transmission of the requested evidence to them.

We are awaiting confirmation from the Federal Government of Nigeria that those court orders have been lifted or overturned on appeal by them. The Federal Government of Nigeria has confirmed through their solicitors in the United Kingdom that although they contest the validity of those judgments, they would comply with them so long as they remained in force.

<a name="31104w12.html_para9">In the light of a previous judicial review, it has been made clear that to attempt to transmit the evidence when such court orders were apparently outstanding would leave my discretionary decision liable to being overturned on judicial review. Equally, it would serve no purpose to transmit evidence to Federal Government of Nigeria that they may not be able to use in their criminal proceedings. We prefer to await the outcome of those proceedings before transmitting the requested evidence. We are also not in a position to repatriate any funds that may be in the United Kingdom until the outstanding matters have been addressed by them.

 Some aspects of financial literacy are covered within the new Citizenship curriculum, which is already compulsory in secondary schools.

 This Department supports the provision of free and paid for milk in maintained schools and encourages schools and local education authorities to offer it to pupils. In addition, our guidance on school lunches includes a strong recommendation that drinking milk is made available to all pupils as an option every day. Following a 20 per cent. reduction in the EU subsidy on school milk from January 2001, this Department agreed jointly with the Department of Health and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to top up the annual &#163;1.5 million shortfall. This assistance helps prevent increases in the cost of providing school milk.

<a name="31104w15.html_para2">For 2001&#150;02 (the latest figures available), figures provided by councils suggest that the average gross weekly expenditure on supporting older people in council-run care homes in England was &#163;446 and the corresponding expenditure on places in care homes in the independent sector was &#163;286. Caution is needed in interpreting the difference between these figures. This is covered in "Personal Social Services Expenditure and unit costs: England 2001&#150;2002", a copy of which is available in the Library. For example, the difference may in part reflect differences in the dependency of people cared for. Where council-run services are more expensive than those provided by the independent sector, councils need to demonstrate through best value reviews that those higher costs are justified.

There is a balance to be drawn between ensuring that a patient has understood and properly consented to a disclosure of information and needlessly obstructing an investigation.

<a name="31104w17.html_para0">The samples chosen for analysis were either teeth, removed for orthodontic purposes, or 24 hour urine samples. Teeth, mostly intact first pre-molars, were collected by district health authorities, batched into samples of 50 teeth, then analysed for plutonium-239 + 240 by alpha-spectrometry. Additional single teeth were analysed for their total alpha-activity by alpha-track counting with Tastrak 'R' and additional batches were analysed for radiostrontium. The results showed that the average concentrations of total alpha-emitters and radiostrontium were approximately three orders of magnitude greater than the equivalent concentrations of plutonium isotopes. Analysis indicated that the concentrations of plutonium, but not strontium-90 or total alpha-emitters decreased with increasing distance from the west Cumbrian coast and its Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant&#151;suggesting that this plant is a source of plutonium contamination in the wider population of the British Isles. Nevertheless, the measured average absolute concentrations of plutonium-239 + 240 were so low that they are considered to present an insignificant radiological hazard. Moreover, additional analyses showed that the concentrations of other "high toxicity", natural alpha-emitting radionuclides (radium, thorium and uranium) were much higher than the levels of plutonium.

 We have no estimate of the numbers of people with diabetes who are known to be unable to use genetically modified (human) insulin. Decisions on the most suitable type of insulin should be made by people with diabetes in consultation with their healthcare providers. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has kept the safety of human insulins under close review. The CSM concluded that, although some patients have experienced problems on transferring to human insulin and are better suited to animal derived insulins, there is no evidence of a safety concern specific to human insulin. The CSM Sub-Committee on Pharmacovigilance reviewed the issue again in September 2000, following the publication of a systematic review of the literature. 52 randomised controlled trials were identified, in addition to 56 studies of other designs and case reports. The Sub-Committee considered the paper and agreed with the conclusions of the authors that there is no evidence of a safety problem specific to human insulin. In 2002, the Cochrane Library published a review of human insulin versus animal insulin in people with diabetes mellitus. This review included randomised controlled trials of at least one

 In autumn 2002, the national health service undertook a national capacity planning process lead by local NHS commissioners. This identified a range of capacity gaps that needed to be met for the NHS to meet the waiting time target set for 2005. Where the NHS was not able to demonstrate plans to meet this demand the residual activity was market tested in December 2002 through an Official Journal of the European Communities (OJEC) advert. In light of the preliminary response, the chains were configured to link capacity gaps of similar activity and organised in a way that the market could provide a rapid response.

 Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates' courts and the Crown Court. Debt collected includes not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out only fines from the total so the figures provided in the table include all the elements above. Data are collected centrally at a MCC level, rather than at court level.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not formally check material issued by parties other than the local authority.

The UK has already made a commitment to provide 100 per cent. relief on debts for all eligible HIPC countries when they reach Completion point. Furthermore, the Chancellor has announced that any payments from countries yet to reach Decision Point will be held in trust for the day they can be returned to fund poverty reduction. The HIPC Initiative has an important role to play in maximising the resources available for poverty reduction in developing countries. However, all HIPC countries would still need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals, even if all of their debt from the World bank and IMF were forgiven. That is why the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important. It can provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources that debt relief alone would not achieve and that could be disbursed by way of grants and additional debt relief.

 DFID has no long-term or current bilateral programme in Mongolia. The British embassy does provide some direct assistance in the form of a Small Grants Scheme (SGS) allocation (currently &#163;200,000 per annum) to support small-scale poverty and human development focused activities. The focus of the SGS in Mongolia is on children, especially with respect to education, social care and protection from exploitation and violence. Key projects will direct funds towards assisting the integration of vulnerable children into pre and primary school education, while also helping to tackle problems that face Mongolia's street children by defining clear standards of care for shelters and increasing the number of children united with their families. The SGS is largely managed by the Save the Children on behalf of the FCO. The Save the Children Fund reports annually on the SGS to the FCO.

WFP conducts rigorous training of its implementing partners on these aid delivery protocols which stress the apolitical nature of food aid. WFP has also disseminated these guidelines to local government officials to remind them remind of their obligations to ensure food aid is distributed on the basis of need rather than political affiliation.
<P>

<a name="31104w22.html_para2">DFID and other donors are providing additional support to WFP to strengthen their capacity to monitor food aid including registration and distribution processes. Particular focus is on the monitoring of political incidents. WFP and NGOs have a zero tolerance policy with regard to politicisation of food aid. Although there have been a few local incidents of political interference these have been dealt with swiftly at a local level through prompt action by NGOs and WFP.

<a name="31104w22.html_para3">In addition, DFID holds regular meetings with its NGO partners (many of whom are also WFP implementing partners), to discuss and improve food aid mechanisms. Many DFID partners are also individually negotiating memoranda of understanding at district level to ensure all stakeholders are aware of apolitical registration and distribution processes.

<P>

<a name="31104w24.html_para4">Policy for naming ships of the Royal Navy is informed by a number of guiding principles. For example, many ship names have a long and illustrious heritage, and a name with a tradition of Royal Navy use is preferred. Other factors in making a selection include the number of battle honours associated with a name, and whether a name is already classically associated with a particular type of vessel. Alternatively, a ship's name might commemorate historically strong links between the Royal Navy and a particular town or district.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what discussions he has had with the <i>(a)</i> London Stock Exchange and <i>(b)</i> Financial Services Authority on the alternative investment market becoming an unregulated market;  [136078]

 The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is a Recognised Investment Exchange (RIE) under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and has to operate all its markets, including the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), in compliance with the recognition requirements for RIEs. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) supervises its compliance with these obligations.
<P>

<a name="31104w24.html_para5">AIM is also a 'regulated market' under the EU's Investment Services Directive (ISO). This means that it complies with the standards for regulated markets set out in the directive and can do business in other member states on the basis of mutual recognition of its regulatory status in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31104w24.html_para6">The LSE has indicated that it is planning to consult about removing AIM from the list of EU regulated markets. If this happens, AIM would not become an unregulated market. The LSE would still be required by the FSA to meet its existing UK regulatory obligations under FSMA with respect to the way it operates AIM. But there would be no mutual recognition of AIM'S regulatory status in the UK by other member states under the ISO. Treasury officials have discussed this issue with the LSE and the FSA.

<a name="31104w26.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>National Insurance</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn0"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much money he estimates the National Insurance Fund would receive in 2003&#150;04 if those people who are retired but remain in paid employment continued to pay national insurance contributions.  [133490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The National Insurance Fund in 2003&#150;04 would increase by an estimated &#163;225 million if employees over state retirement pension age were required to pay primary Class 1 contributions.
<P>

<a name="31104w26.html_para0">This estimate is based on April 2003 Budget forecasts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proportion of those who did not receive national insurance contributions deficiency notices have received letters notifying them of the contributions needed to secure full entitlement.  [136154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue started the exercise to notify working age people about shortfalls in their contributions for the tax years 1996&#150;97 to 2000&#150;01 at the end of October and it is anticipated that all letters will be sent out by September next year. Everyone will have as much time to make voluntary payments, if they want to, as they would have had if the letters had been issued at the normal time, and payment will be at the original rate.

<a name="31104w26.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Private Health Insurance</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn2"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will restore tax incentives for pensioners taking out private health insurance; and if he will make a statement.  [136228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to restore the tax relief that used to be available on private medical insurance premiums. We remain convinced that the best way to use the resources available to provide health care is by funding the NHS directly for the benefit of all British residents.

<a name="31104w26.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Public Borrowing</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Howard: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he will measure the surplus or deficit on the current budget between <i>(a)</i> the month in which the present cycle is judged to have started and the month in 



<P>
<P><I>4 Nov 2003 : Column 630W</I><P>
which the present cycle is judged to have finished, <i>(b)</i> the quarter in which the present cycle is judged to have started and the quarter in which the present cycle is judged to have finished and <i>(c)</i> the fiscal year in which the present cycle is judged to have started and the fiscal year in which the present cycle is judged to have finished, for the purpose of assessing whether he has satisfied his golden rule at the end of the present economic cycle.  [135777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Progress against the golden rule is measured by the average surplus on the current budget over the period from the financial year in which the economic cycle starts up to and including the financial year in which it ends.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Howard: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he plans to measure the total surplus or deficit on the current budget <i>(a)</i> in cash terms since the start of the cycle and <i>(b)</i> as a share of GDP in each period covered by the cycle and take the average of these, for the purpose of assessing performance against his golden rule, over the present economic cycle.  [135778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Progress against the golden rule is measured by the average surplus on the current budget expressed as a ratio to GDP over the economic cycle.

<a name="31104w26.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Small Business Investment Companies</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the timetable for the launch of small business investment companies.  [135568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government issued a consultation document alongside Budget 2003 called 'Bridging the Finance Gap: a consultation on improving access to growth capital for small businesses'. One of the issues raised by the consultation was the possibility of introducing in the UK a variant of the US Small Business Investment Company programme. The Government are currently considering the responses that they have received from the consultation and will respond to them in due course.

<a name="31104w26.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Stamp Duty Land Tax</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether licences granted to <i>(a)</i> individuals and <i>(b)</i> businesses requiring an interest in land will be exempt from stamp duty land tax.  [135603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The acquisition of a licence to use or occupy land is not in itself a chargeable transaction. However, the acquisition of such licences is often part of a larger transaction, other elements of which may be chargeable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what alternative suggestions he has received to the proposal of charging stamp duty land tax on leases other than basing the charge on the net present value of the lease.  [135606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 A number of alternative suggestions were received, some based on net present value, some based on average annual rent and some based on a combination of the two.

<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether assured shorthold tenancies will be chargeable to stamp duty land tax after 1 December.  [135623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The grant of a lease, including an assured shorthold tenancy, is within the scope of stamp duty land tax. Whether there is a charge will depend on a number of factors such as the initial term and the rent payable.

<a name="31104w26.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether mineral rights royalties are to be chargeable for stamp duty land tax after 1 December.  [135624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31104w26.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The grant of a lease, including a lease giving the right to extract minerals, is within the scope of stamp duty land tax. Whether there is a charge will depend on a number of factors such as the initial term and the rent payable.
