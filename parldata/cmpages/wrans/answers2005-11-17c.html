 I have regular discussions with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on sustainable energy issues, both as part of the Climate Change Programme review process, and our involvement in the Sustainable Energy Policy Network. This includes the development of renewable generating capacity including offshore wind.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There has been a lot of research into the benefits of biodiesel. We announced last week that 5 per cent. of all UK road transport fuel will have to come from a renewable source by 2010. The benefits of biodiesel in power generation are less obvious because it is more efficient to use biomass.

 Energy use is closely monitored and site-specific benchmarks are set for all but the smallest sites. Energy audits and remedial action are triggered for sites above benchmark.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will ban the <i>(a)</i> sale, <i>(b)</i> manufacture and <i>(c)</i> use of animal snares; and if she will make a statement.  [27651]</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew5"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Government considers that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical. In these circumstances snares restrain rather than kill and may prove to be more humane than other methods. If snares were to be banned entirely it may encourage the use of more dangerous and illegal alternatives such as poisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Government is also committed to working to improve the legal use of snares. Following an informal consultation on snares and traps and their use carried out in 2003 Defra convened an independent snares working group chaired by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare. The working group was given a remit of producing a good practice guide and advising Defra on next steps on improving the use of snares. On 18 October we published the working group&#039;s report together with the Defra Snares Action Plan and the Defra Code of Good Practice on the use of Snares in Fox and Rabbit Control in England. These documents can be found at: http://www.Defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/snares/index.htm

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent estimate she has made of the annual value of the bee keeping industry to the <i>(a)</i> agricultural and <i>(b)</i> horticultural industries.  [26965]</p>








<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51117w01.html_spnew7"><b> Jim Knight  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 November 2005]:</i> The most recent assessment of the economic value of beekeeping in England was undertaken by ADAS Consulting Ltd in 2001. The report can be found on the bee health pages of the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/hort/bees/econ-eval.htm. It estimated the value of pollination by bees of commercial crops at around &#163;118 million p.a., with agricultural crops (oilseed rape) accounting for &#163;11 million and horticulture (beans, top and soft fruit) for &#163;107 million of this total respectively. The researchers excluded protected cropping, such as glasshouse-grown tomatoes, as honey bees are rarely used for pollination of these crops.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on cattle passport fraud.  [25308]</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51117w02.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The evidence we have on the incidence of serious offences committed under the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 (as amended) concerning cattle passports is that it is low.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_4">In order to ensure a high level of compliance with the Regulations, 10 per cent. of cattle farms are inspected annually by the Rural Payments Agency. In England, around 6,000 farms and around 960,000 animals are examined for their compliance with tagging, passport, database registration and record-keeping rules. The results show a continuing improvement in compliance with the rules-there were 4 per cent. fewer errors made in 2004&#150;05 than in the previous year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_5">Local Authorities also undertake enforcement activities covering cattle, including unannounced inspections on farms, at livestock markets and during transport (by undertaking spot roadside stops). At slaughterhouses, the Meat Hygiene Service undertake checks on identification of cattle to ensure that only properly identified and traceable cattle enter the human food chain.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1377W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para3">
Inspections are carried out on the basis of risk, with higher risk activities being inspected most. When non-compliance with the cattle identification rules is found, appropriate enforcement action is taken. This can range from advice, warning letters and restrictions on movements through to full prosecution resulting in prison sentences or fines. So far in 2005, 19 convictions have been obtained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_6">Education is as important as enforcement, and this year the Rural Payments Agency has sent two statements to all registered cattle keepers of their Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database records to encourage them to keep their records accurate and up-to-date. In April 2005, they issued clear and comprehensive guidance to all keepers in their Cattle Keeper&#039;s Handbook&quot;. The response to the CTS statements has been encouragingly high, all the more so for being voluntary, and taken together with the improvements shown in inspections, indicates to us that the cattle industry is keen overall to ensure that their animals are fully traceable and that compliance is good.

 Ministers and Rural Payments Agency (RPA) officials are in regular contact with all stakeholder groups, farmers and agents. Ministers and the RPA chief executive have also received several hundred written representations on issues affecting the administration of the single payment scheme (SPS). RPA announced in January 2005 that payments under the SPS in England would begin in February 2006. The regulatory payment window for the 2005 scheme laid down by the European Union runs from 1 December 2005 to 30 June 2006.

<i>[holding answer 8 November 2005]:</i> Since September 2004 the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has received over 100,000 requests to digitise land parcels or to amend their boundaries, representing a substantial increase on the previous level of requests. The majority of these requests have now been processed, and RPA has recently outsourced 85 per cent. of the outstanding mapping requests to a trusted third party. This has significantly increased resources, enabling RPA to remain on course to commence payment under the Single Payment Scheme in February 2006, in line with announcements made at the start of the year.

 The term wildfowl&quot; relates to all species of ducks and geese, and also swans (three species in England in winter). Only certain ducks and geese may be hunted. There are no specific regulations governing the release of native wildfowl into the wild. Only Mallard are released for the purposes of wildfowling. Mallard are native to England and they would not be covered by the provisions of section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which prohibits releases of species of birds not ordinarily resident in or a visitor to the European territory of any member state.

On behalf of the Government of Indonesia, other agencies and non-government organisations (NGO)s, the WFP launched an unprecedented non-food logistical operation to deliver 600,000 metric tonnes of reconstruction supplies to Aceh and Nias, being funded from the multi-donor trust fund for Aceh and North Sumatra.

 Tour ticket costs during the summer are designed to cover costs and not to make a surplus. This year, due to the impact of the works on the Chamber Screen and in Westminster Hall, they were held to 2004 levels and as a result a small deficit of around &#163;39,000 was expected. However following the 7 July terrorist attacks in London, visitor numbers slumped from an anticipated 103,000 to a final total of 77,873. This, together with the increased cost of security resulting from the attacks, produced a deficit of &#163;320,000.

 The Government believe that the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on schools, hospitals, and similar venues will be positive. The organisers of private performances at such venues do not require licences under the present licensing framework, and will not do so under the new regime introduced by the 2003 Act. Public entertainment licences are required in respect of performances for which the general public may buy tickets, under both the old and new regimes.

 Three requests for information (RFI) from different applicants have been made relating to HMS Sheffield under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. One RFI was made in January, and the other two in February. Full replies have been deferred pending the outcome of the departmental review that I commissioned in April 2005 to consider what information can be made available publicly concerning the investigation into the loss of HMS Sheffield during the Falklands conflict. My letter of 7 April (D/MSU/2/5/1) refers, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

 According to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol 1, Article 43), the only uniformed personnel to whom the term non-combatant&quot; applies are medics and chaplains. Therefore, if a serving member of the armed forces who is subject to illness or injury is medically downgraded, enabling them to continue in service while being unfit for operational deployment, this does not mean that they become a non-combatant (unless of course they are discharged from the armed forces or they subsequently transfer to one of the non-combatant branches).

 As at 30 June (the latest date for which figures are available), there were approximately 50 veterans in receipt of a war disablement pension whose service included operations in the Gulf Conflict with addresses in Northern Ireland. Others with a lower level of disablement may have received a gratuity award, but we do not have available figures for these. Not all the injuries or medical conditions claimed relate to service in the Gulf but our statistics do not enable us to distinguish the origin of the disablement. Veterans may also qualify for financial assistance through armed forces occupational pension schemes in addition to the

Approximately 25 per cent. of the 53,462 veterans who deployed to the Gulf in 1990&#150;91 are still serving and their medical care is the responsibility of the Defence Medical Services. The Department may under the provisions of the War Pension Scheme defray expenses in respect of medical treatment that is not provided free of charge under other United Kingdom legislation.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for UK regular forces, both trained and untrained, located in the UK. They therefore exclude Ghurkhas, full-time reserve service personnel, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists.<br>

2. Figures show the UK regular forces posted location. Posted location is where an individual is permanently based.<br>

3. Naval service personnel on sea service are included against the region containing the home port of their ship.<br>

4. Naval service personnel serving in flights at sea are included against the region containing the base airfield of their flight.<br>

5. The detailed figures in this publication have been compiled from unit statistics related to unit postcodes. For some units postcode information is either unavailable or inappropriate.<br>

6. Location statistics are not available for FTRS, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists.<br>

7. Due to the rounding methods used, figures may not always equal the sum of the parts. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in five have been rounded to the nearest 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

8. Comparisons should not be made between data before July 2002 and data after July 2004 due to the different methodologies used to collate the data.<br>

 In August 2005, the Learning and Skills Council took responsibility in three development regions (the North West, North East and South West) for planning and funding an integrated learning and skills service for offenders in custody and the community, linking it much more explicitly with mainstream provision for post-16 learners. The remaining six regions in England will follow in August 2006.

<a name="stpa_145">The key features of the new service are described in The Offenders Learning Journey (http://www.dfes.gov.uk/offenderlearning/uploads/docs/adultpercent20OLJpercent20V0.5.doc) which specifies an early, intense focus on assessing learning needs followed by seamless arrangements for delivering those requirements to offenders across prisons and probation and on into mainstream learning and skills provision.

 Prisoner suicide prevention operates by embedding suicide prevention through every area of prison life-including detoxification, decency, health care, staff training, and the built environment. The key intervention currently being introduced across public and private prisons is the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners: ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork). ACCT aims to improve the quality of care by introducing flexible care understanding at-risk prisoners.

We envisage that by the second half of 2006 all the components of the statutory home information pack will be available. This will provide the opportunity for systems, processes and procedures to be fully tested and fine-tuned during the period leading up to implementation. This will involve a continuous process of testing and feedback across the whole industry. Feedback from industry and consumers will be monitored and assessed continually and will inform the making of any necessary changes to the process at the earliest opportunity.

Notes:<br>

Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>

A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Patient Counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>





Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in date, that is the data are ungrossed.<br>

These centres will work in partnership with the public education sector to deliver high quality and responsive learning to young people and adults.

<a name="stpa_185">We recently announced (31 October) the first four sectors that will move forward to the business planning phase of the National Skills Academy programme. The sectors are Construction, Manufacturing, Food and Drink and Financial Services. We expect robust business plans to be developed by April 2006. Once the plans have been agreed with the Learning and Skills Council, more detailed information on each of the proposed National Skills Academies will be available.

 Every adult in England can access a free, integrated information and advice service comprising the national learndirect&quot; telephone and on-line advice service and local nextstep&quot; information and advice services, with no limit on the number of inquiries or advice sessions. Within the universal offer provided by learndirect&quot; and nextstep&quot;, priority has been given since August 2004 to those adults who do not have a qualification at level 2, since they are more likely to lack the skills foundation for employability and lifelong learning, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. Graduates may additionally receive continued career support from their former institutions or from other higher education institutions in their area, although the decision to offer this service, with or without charge, is a matter for individual institutions.

<a name="stpa_188">The White Paper Skills: getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; set out a long-term ambition: that everyone should be able to get help if and when they want it to take stock of where they are in their lives and their careers; to review where they would like to get to; and assess what steps they can take to get there. To help determine how best to achieve this goal we are jointly conducting a review with the Department for Work and Pensions, the DTI, the LSC, Ufi learndirect&quot;, Jobcentre Plus, and the Sector Skills Development Agency which will be concluded by the end of 2006. The review will be informed by extending the learndirect&quot; telephone service on a trial basis from January 2006 to provide more intensive personal guidance. Adults throughout England seeking to progress in their careers; wanting to gain the skills for jobs typically requiring a Level 3 qualification; and returning to work from career breaks, will benefit from the new service.

Improved meter reading systems are also being implemented to provide up to date information to facilitate better energy management.

<a name="stpa_226">The introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection in 1978, together with women&#039;s increased labour market activity, mean that women are building up better pension records. In 2005, 30 per cent. of women reaching state pension age are entitled to a full basic state pension. Without any policy changes, this will rise to 50 per cent. by 2010 and over 80 per cent. by 2025. By 2025, women and men will have similar basic state pension entitlements. The average entitlement will be over 90 per cent. of a full basic state pension for both men and women.

 Funding for the Instrument for Nuclear Assistance will need to be agreed as part of the overall funding package agreed for the EU&#039;s next financial perspective. The UK, along with five other member states (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden), believes that the Union&#039;s priorities can be funded by a budget stabilised at one per cent. of EU Gross National Income (GNI). The instrument will be funded out of the external actions &quot; heading of the EC budget. We would prefer to see no growth under this heading. We will want funding for the instrument for nuclear assistance to be consistent with this, but also to provide sufficient resources to allow the commission to make a significant contribution towards achieving the EU&#039;s nuclear non-proliferation objectives, including those related to the Global Partnership.

<p><a name="st_315"><a name="51117w38.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 The draft Budget provides that, by 2008, total Government spending in NI will exceed &#163;16 billion, a jump of more than 50 per cent. since 1997. Public expenditure in NI is by far the highest figure for any region of the UK and is 29 per cent. higher than the UK average.

<a name="stpa_264">Notwithstanding this, there are many pressures on the Northern Ireland Budget and the roads&#039; programme must compete for funding along with other spending programmes, The draft Priorities and Budget 2006&#150;08 is presently out for consultation. It allocated additional resources for Health and for Education and this inevitably had some implications for other programmes including roads maintenance. It is expected that the revised Budget will be announced in December 2005.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51117w38.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_266">I should explain that Roads Service&#039;s maintenance budgets are not allocated at the outset of the financial year on a district council basis. Therefore, it is not possible to give an initial budget for structural maintenance in each district council area as requested. A breakdown of structural maintenance expenditure by district council is set out as follows for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05. It should be noted that these figures are based on the expenditure in the previous two financial years and that they include the contribution made by the Roads Service in-house contractor.

<p>
<a name="51117w38.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_267">The structural maintenance budget for the 2005&#150;06 year is currently &#163;60.5 million, however a breakdown of this amount at the district council level cannot be provided at this stage.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_140">To address your first question, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) carries out its functions under the provision of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Penalties are provided under section 4, that can be imposed by a Magistrates&#039; Court in the event of failure to comply with our legal request. This response relates to summons and convictions relating to surveys conducted by ONS under the 1947 Act, and excludes any other government departments.

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1515W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_141">The attached table shows the figures for the period requested. I have provided the information on the basis of the number in receipt of a summons and those that then go on to be convicted. The difference is those that have been withdrawn due to their willingness to comply. Only those who remain unwilling to comply will be heard in the Magistrates&#039; Court and ultimately convicted.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_142">To address your second question; again, I must make it clear that the policy only relates to ONS&#039; operation of the 1947 Act. ONS has signed up to an &#039;enforcement concordat&#039; which is regulated by the Cabinet Office. Under this agreement ONS have given an undertaking to &#039;carry out our duties in a fair, equitable and consistent manner&#039;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_143">We recognise that most businesses want to comply with the law. We will, therefore take care to help businesses and others meet their legal obligations without unnecessary expense, while taking firm action, including prosecution where appropriate, against those who flout the law.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_144">All businesses are provided with information regarding their statutory obligation to complete ONS questionnaires and they are advised on the consequences of non-compliance. We believe in, prevention being better than the cure and our role in enforcing compliance actively involves working with businesses, especially small and medium sized businesses, to advise on, and assist with compliance. We will discuss general issues, specific compliance failures or problems, with anyone experiencing difficulties, and continue to offer assistance after the receipt of the summons in order to gain compliance and prevent prosecution.</p>

 The two roof programme is a ground breaking change programme to rationalise its central London estate and transform the way we use our workspace. This core element of the DTI&#039;s Efficiency Programme offers a new and radical approach to workspace utilisation and will allow the Department to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Nov 2005 : Column 1516W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reduce its accommodation by approximately 30 per cent. Starting in 1 Victoria Street, the accommodation is being remodelled as part of a wider change programme to support team based desking in a flexible, open plan working environment on the basis of providing on average eight desks for every 10 people to be accommodated. This has enabled us to increase the capacity of our main HQ building from 1,680 under the original, traditional approach to approximately 2,400 now and to release other buildings on the estate for reuse or disposal. This change programme will now be applied to the rest of our London accommodation.
