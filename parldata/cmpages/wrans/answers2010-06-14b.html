 The Department does not provide specific guidelines about provision of these types of meals.

In meeting such standards, it requires providers who comply with the regulations<sup>(2)</sup> to provide choices of food and drink for people to meet their diverse needs, making sure it is nutritionally balanced and supports their health. In particular, patients should have a choice for each meal that takes account of their individual preferences and needs, including religious and cultural requirements.</p>

The fact that they stayed the same in April 2010 was due to negative price inflation. Under this legislation, when prices continue growing as normal, state second pension and additional elements of the state pension must be increased by that growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100614w0010.htm_para2"><a name="10061411000126">UK manufactured cars make up a relatively small proportion (around 16%) of the current GCS fleet, most of which is comprised of low carbon emission hybrid vehicles manufactured abroad. Changed rules for allocation of cars and the need to reduce the cost of operating the Government Car Service mean that vehicle replacement is likely to be restricted in the immediate future, necessarily limiting the options for reconfiguring the fleet without incurring additional cost. For reasons of efficient and economic fleet management, it is not practical for Ministers to specify a particular vehicle or type of vehicle for a journey in a pool service car.</p>

 Neither the Government nor the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) have formally reviewed the effectiveness of the KPCS in preventing the trade in diamonds funding violence. However, compliance with KPCS requirements is monitored and evaluated through a 'Peer Review' system. Teams of experts representing KPCS governments, civil society groups and industry visit selected KPCS states every year to review implementation of the KPCS and if necessary investigate reports of diamonds contributing to violence. Review reports are discussed by KPCS members at the annual Plenary and Intersessional meetings. Action can be taken against states shown to be persistently failing to implement the KPCS, including suspension. The June 2010 KPCS intersessional in Tel Aviv will include looking at ways the KPCS can be more effective. The UK is attending as part of the EU delegation.</p>
