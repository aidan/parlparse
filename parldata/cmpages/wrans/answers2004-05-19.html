<sup>(1)</sup>In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result since 2002 the statistical data is not comparable to that of previous years.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup>&nbsp;Includes restrictions imposed for other reasons, such as a TB test being overdue.<br>

This is provisional data, which is subject to change, as more data becomes available. The TB strategy is under review. We issued a consultation document &#039;Preparing for a new GB strategy on bovine TB&#039; in February 2004. This constitutes the first stage in the development of a long-term strategy for TB, which applies the principles in the overarching Animal and Welfare Strategy.

<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The annual June Agricultural and Horticultural Census is an important survey. We continue to develop it with a view to reducing the burden on both respondents and the taxpayer. Following a review with our statistical advisers, we have concluded the sample sizes can be reduced in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2009 when we do not need to run such large surveys for EU purposes. The sample size for 2004 is being reduced from 75,000 holdings to about 50,000. While this will reduces the precision at the local levels, this will be minimised by the use of available administrative sources. Increasing numbers of farmers and growers are now completing survey forms electronically and we will be developing our electronic data collection as part of the Whole Farm Approach initiative.

<a name="40519w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h3>





<p><a name="40519w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what target was most recently set by the Government for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020.  [171522]</p>








<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The Government have set a domestic goal to move towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 20&nbsp;per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, and is putting itself on a path to cut the UK&#039;s carbon dioxide emissions by some 60&nbsp;per cent. by about 2050, with real progress by 2020.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w01.html_para4">
A target for 2020 has not been set, however, the 2003 Energy White Paper said that by 2020, on the basis of existing policies including the full effect of our climate change programme, we would expect UK carbon dioxide emissions of some 135&nbsp;millions tonnes of carbon (MtC) in 2020. To be consistent with demonstrating leadership in the international process, we expect to aim for cuts in carbon of 15&#150;25 MtC below that by 2020.


</p>







<p><a name="40519w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Government expects to achieve a 60&nbsp;per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.  [171523]</p>








<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 In the 2003 Energy White Paper we accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#039;s recommendation, in their June 2000 report &quot;Energy&#151;The Changing Climate&quot;, that the Government should adopt a strategy to put the UK on a path to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by some 60&nbsp;per cent. from current levels by about 2050.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 May 2004 : Column 975W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w01.html_para5">
As the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#039;s recommendation implies, absolute precision five decades before 2050 is not possible. However, the Energy White Paper uses around 65&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon (MtC) to describe the level of carbon emissions which a 60&nbsp;per cent. cut would deliver by 2050.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w01.html_para6">
Analysis for the Energy White Paper showed that on the basis of existing policies, including the full effect of our climate change programme, we would expect UK carbon dioxide emissions of some 135 MtC in 2020. We expect to aim for additional cuts in carbon of 15&#150;25 MtC below that by 2020 to put us on course to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by some 60&nbsp;per cent. by about 2050.


</p>







<p><a name="40519w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mrs. May: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Government first used the term some 60&nbsp;per cent. by 2050 to define the target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  [171524]</p>








<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended in their June 2000 report, &quot;Energy&#151;The Changing Climate&quot;, that the Government should adopt a strategy to put the UK on a path to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by some 60&nbsp;per cent. from current levels by about 2050.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w01.html_para7">
Following analysis and public consultation, the Government accepted this recommendation and first defined it as a goal in the Energy White Paper, which was published on 24&nbsp;February 2003.
</p>






<a name="40519w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Dairy Farming</h3>





<p><a name="40519w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of decoupling on co-operative dairy farmers; and if she will make a statement.  [173690]</p>








<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Decoupling will provide the basis for all farmers to improve the market orientation of their business and will free them from many of the bureaucratic rules associated with production linked subsidies. Decoupling has the potential to bring considerable benefits to agriculture as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w01.html_para8">
The scope for dairy farmers to realise these benefits as members of co-operatives is not inherently different from those that supply milk direct to processors.
</p>






<a name="40519w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Departmental Conferences</h3>





<p><a name="40519w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mrs. Spelman: </b>

[160776]</p>








<p><a name="40519w01.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b>

<p><a name="40519w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research she is undertaking into the implications of the use of the milk quota and other quota arrangements as a means of access to the single farm payment.  [169648]</p>








<p><a name="40519w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The use of milk quota to generate &quot;historic&quot; entitlements would tend to favour larger, more intensive, producers compared to the flat rate area based entitlements that are being adopted in England over an eight year transition period. It also increases the value of milk quota prior to decoupling. The issue was considered in the report by David Colman and David Harvey on &quot;The Future of UK Dairy Farming&quot;, which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 May 2004 : Column 977W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
was commissioned by the Dairy Supply Chain Forum and we are not undertaking any further research on the matter.

<a name="40519w02.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Farm Medicine</h3>





<p><a name="40519w02.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on proposals to examine the rules in relation to prescription-only farm medicines and the cost of administering them.  [173878]</p>








<p><a name="40519w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The rules in relation to prescription-only farm medicines have been the subject of three reviews. In the UK, the Independent Review of Dispensing by Veterinary Surgeons of Prescription Only Medicines (the Marsh Report) in 2001 and the 2003 Competition Commission Inquiry into the Cost of Prescription only Medicines both recognised the benefits of retaining the UK&#039;s distribution system for veterinary medicinal products while recommending changes to its detailed operation. This was, therefore the Government&#039;s aim during negotiations on the Review of European medicines legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w02.html_para0">
The Review of European medicines legislation has been completed and an amending Directive 2004/28/EC was published in the Official Journal on 30&nbsp;April 2004. We are now able to implement the changes agreed in the three reviews. In taking forward the provisions for veterinary POMs we expect to establish a system that will retain the key elements of the current distribution arrangements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w02.html_para1">
We will consult widely on these proposals and on their cost. Officials from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate are already carrying out informal discussions with interested organisations. We intend to carry out a formal consultation exercise, when our proposals are developed further, at the beginning of next year so as to meet the deadline for implementation of the changes to the legislation of 30&nbsp;October 2005.

<p><a name="40519w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Yearly information on glaciers is not available as very few of them are monitored in detail. However, it is possible to infer how glacier volume is changing from measurements of sea level rise. By using values given in the &quot;Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&quot;, and estimates of sea level rise of 0.4 mm per year during the 1990s, it is estimated that glacier volume decreased by approximately 0.2&nbsp;per cent. per year during the 1990s.

<p><a name="40519w02.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Dairy Supply Chain Forum, which is chaired by my noble Friend, the Lord Whitty, provides a framework in which all links in the dairy supply chain can come together to discuss the challenges facing the sector and develop collaborative solutions to improve the efficiency and promote the sustainable development of the sector. It does not discuss price negotiations, which are a private commercial matter between farmers and purchasers. However, the work of the Forum and its various subgroups should help address some of the underlying causes of low farmgate prices. In the last year the main Forum met on 7&nbsp;July, 20&nbsp;October and 28&nbsp;January. In addition, its sub-groups meet frequently to take forward individual work streams.

The date of receipt of the responses (other than those by e-mail) is not recorded. It is not possible therefore to give the figures with the degree of accuracy that you seek. I have, however, had the responses reviewed and recounted. Respondents replied to a consultation document that asked a series of questions. The questions were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;(a) Should swill feeding of catering waste containing animal by-products be banned?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(b)</i> If yes, should (i) fish and poultry animal by-products fed on-farm be included in the ban, and (ii) non-meat containing catering waste be included in the ban?

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(d)</i> any other comments, including on whether or not it would be practicable to place obligations on the producers of catering waste e.g. restaurants to ensure that it is not fed to animals; and [comments] on the enclosed draft Order.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para5">
Some respondents tailored their responses to five options set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment. Those were:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;(a) Do nothing, i.e. permit the feeding of swill under current controls.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(b)</i> Tighten up current controls.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(c)</i> Ban the feeding of catering waste (waste from kitchens, restaurants and some food factories) and processed poultry and fish waste as swill.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(d)</i> Ban the feeding of catering waste and poultry as swill.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(e)</i> Ban the feeding of swill and all catering waste (including that which does not contain meat or meat products e.g. biscuits, yoghurts, brewers grain, vegetable waste, etc).&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para6">
In view of the detailed questions asked by the consultation document it is not surprising that the replies were often equally diverse and detailed. But the responses have been re-read as objectively as possible to place them in the categories you seek.

<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para9">
Those that were in favour of a ban on swill feeding of catering waste that contains meat or meat products totalled 105 (35&nbsp;per cent.). There was an additional 35 (12 per cent) that favoured a complete ban on swill feeding of all catering waste including non-meat waste. The combined figures of these respondents total 140 (46&nbsp;per cent.) in favour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para10">
There were 31 (10 per cent) respondents where no particular preference was stated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para11">
An additional 55 (18&nbsp;per cent.) respondents were against a ban being extended to non-meat waste foods, e.g. from millers, vegetable producers, brewers, etc.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para12">
Between 27&nbsp;April and 1&nbsp;May there were three additional responses (one against, one in favour of a ban on swill feeding meat waste, and one no preference). One further response was received after 1&nbsp;May which was against a ban.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para13">
There were also an additional 23 undated responses. 11 were against a ban, three favoured a ban on all catering waste (i.e. including non-meat waste), eight favoured a ban on swill feeding meat waste and one was against an extended ban to non-meat waste.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para14">
In total therefore, of all responses received, 208 (63&nbsp;per cent.) respondees supported a ban on swill feeding of catering waste containing meat. There were 90 (27 per cent) against a ban and 32 (10 per cent) where no preference was expressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w03.html_para15">
I believe the House can be reassured therefore that not only was there a numerical majority in favour of a ban but also that it was widely supported when account is taken of the support expressed from associations that represented large memberships (including the NFU, Tenant Farmers Association, the British Pig Association, the Royal Association of British Dairy

<p><a name="40519w05.html_spnew6"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The UK fully supports the cancellation of debt of the world&#039;s poorest countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. We were instrumental in securing international agreement to enhance the original Initiative in 1999, to ensure that as much debt relief as possible is granted to as many countries as possible. The UK continues to be a champion of the HIPC Initiative. We have provided commitments of &#163;2.3 billion of debt relief to eligible countries and have pledged a total of US$474&nbsp;million through multilateral institutions to support the Initiative further. The UK goes even further than is required under the Initiative, and is committed to providing 100&nbsp;per cent. debt relief to eligible HIPC countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w05.html_para4">
The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. It is providing over $70 billion of debt relief to the 27 counties that have reached Decision Point. We are committed to maintaining the momentum of the HIPC Initiative and continue to ensure that it is fully implemented. Ethiopia and Niger&#039;s exits from the Initiative in April mean that five countries have now reached Completion Point since September 2003 (Ethiopia, Guyana, Nicaragua, Niger and Senegal), bringing the total number to 13.
</p>


<p>

The HIPC Initiative is also helping increase annual social expenditures in countries receiving debt relief. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&#151;equivalent to 2.7&nbsp;per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65&nbsp;per cent. of the use of HIPC debt relief.

We have no plans to change the present arrangements for concessionary travel for older people. The current statutory minimum requirement for concessionary travel in England introduced in 2001 ensures half fares for older and disabled people on local buses, with no charge for the pass. From April 2003, we have extended concessionary travel schemes to men aged 60&#150;64, bringing them into line with women of the same age. Local authorities may make more generous provision, including free travel, at their discretion.

 Progress towards the four bus service targets agreed between the Department and the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) in 2002 is monitored regularly through surveys.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w07.html_para3">
With regard to reliability, the results for the quarter year October to December 2003 showed that 98.5&nbsp;per cent. of scheduled local bus mileage was operated in England, using seasonally adjusted data. The figure for London was 97.5&nbsp;per cent. and that for the rest of England 98.8&nbsp;per cent. In the baseline year, 2000&#150;01, 98.2&nbsp;per cent. of scheduled local bus mileage was operated. The target is for operators to run 99.5&nbsp;per cent. of all scheduled mileage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w07.html_para4">
On bus fleet age, the most recent results from CPT for the age of their members&#039; full size bus fleet showed an average age of 7.5 years at 1&nbsp;July 2002. The target is to maintain an average fleet age of no more than eight years. Data for 1&nbsp;July 2003 should be available shortly. Separate figures for London as compared to the rest of the country are not available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w07.html_para5">
On accessibility, results from the Department&#039;s annual survey of bus operators showed that, at 31&nbsp;March 2003, 29.3&nbsp;per cent. of full size buses in Great Britain were of low floor design, allowing wheelchair access. This has increased from 22.0&nbsp;per cent. at 31&nbsp;March 2001. The target is for half of all full size buses to be wheelchair accessible by 2010. A separate survey undertaken by Transport for London showed that 82&nbsp;per cent. of the capital&#039;s full sized bus fleet is fully accessible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w07.html_para6">
Survey results for the quarter year October to December 2003 showed that bus passenger satisfaction with information at bus stops was rated at 66 out of 100, for England, using seasonally adjusted data. This is up from 61 in 2000&#150;01 and 63 in 2002&#150;03. The figure for London was 73 out of 100 as against 60 out of 100 for the rest of England. The target is to improve the rating year on year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w07.html_para7">
The Government and the CPT remain committed to achieving these targets, underlining the good working relationship that we have with the bus industry, as well as demonstrating the industry&#039;s continuing commitment to delivering improved services.

<p><a name="40519w10.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how much money the Government intends to invest to promote gamete donation;  [173379]

</p>



<p>(2) what protocols are in place to ensure that no coercive practices are involved in the targeting of gamete donation.  [173380]</p>








<p><a name="40519w10.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 We announced in January that we are to support the transition to identifiable gamete donors, subject to Parliament&#039;s approval of the regulations, by increasing public awareness of the importance of such donors. The investment that we are making in the promotion of gamete donation involves time and effort as well as the provision of funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w10.html_para2">
We are working with a range of organisations including the Donor Conception Network, the National Gamete Donation Trust and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) on collaborative arrangements to encourage the recruitment of identifiable donors. We will be supporting the National Gamete Donation Trust (NGDT) to make contact with fertility clinics about current recruitment arrangements and the dissemination of good practice. The NGDT will also run an improved helpline for people interested in being gamete donors on 0845 226 9193. To date we have decided to provide the NGDT with some &#163;100,000 for this work and are currently in discussion with them about further funding for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w10.html_para3">
Raising awareness of the value and importance of identifiable gamete donors will also take place in other ways. The HFEA will, for instance, include it as part of their inspections of clinics. We will also be promoting public awareness of gamete donation with other organisations and with the media in preparation for the introduction of identifiable donors from April 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w10.html_para4">
The donation of sperm, eggs or embryos is entirely voluntary. The code of practice issued by the HFEA makes clear that gamete donors must be paid no more than &#163;15 for each donation plus reasonable expenses. It 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 May 2004 : Column 1012W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
also makes clear that where a person is undergoing a treatment cycle, there must be no pressure or undue influence on a patient to donate supernumerary gametes or embryos.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department has taken to act on the findings and recommendations of the Audit Commission report &quot;A Focus on General Practice in England&quot;.  [172734]</p>








<p><a name="40519w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 &quot;A Focus on General Practice in England&quot; did not make recommendations. The findings of this baseline study of general practice undertaken during the negotiations between the NHS Confederation and the general practitioners committee of the British Medical Association for a new contract for general medical services did, however, inform those negotiations. The new contract that came into effect on 1&nbsp;April will make sure that the money going into general practice matches the needs of patients, enable general practitioners to control their work load while incentivising high quality care; and the new quality and outcomes framework will ensure that all patients can benefit from the same high quality care.

A major part of the infrastructure programme is the implementation of the NHS national broadband network. This will provide the NHS with world class networking services, including secure broadband connectivity, for the future. The substantially enhanced bandwidth, intelligent network services and new network technologies will meet increasing demand and offer a range of new opportunities. It will enhance services and allow for the further development of remote centres, with increased access to specialist support.

The broadband network will provide access to the patient record in the various care locations, support on-site procedures and allow consistent access to knowledge for all clinicians. Care will be provided using telemedicine and telecare techniques in a wide range of locations, for example, minor injuries units, enhanced general practices and diagnostic and treatment centres. This will relieve acute trusts and accident and emergency departments by taking on investigations, treatment for minor injuries and procedures such as some day-case surgeries.

on the money available to North Bristol NHS Trust would be if the payment by results policy was implemented immediately; and if he will make a statement on his plans for transition to the new arrangements.  [169013]</p>








<p><a name="40519w14.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> The Department annually collects retrospective cost and activity data from all English national health service trusts, including collections of elective in-patient, non-elective in-patient, and day case activity. The national tariff for 2004&#150;05 includes some 550 or so healthcare resource groups (HRGs) covering activity in these categories. HRGs are groups of procedures and treatments that are clinically similar and involve similar use of resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w14.html_para1">
Though the tariff is based on national average reported costs (Reference Costs), it is not meaningful to make direct comparisons between the two because of the prospective nature of the tariff. For example, the latest reference costs refer to 2002&#150;03, and the tariff to 2005&#150;06. However a realistic guide to the relative cost efficiency of a NHS Trust is given by the National Reference Cost Index (RCI). The RCI gives a single figure for each NHS trust which compares the actual cost of its activity with the same activity at national average cost. The 2002&#150;03 RCI score for North Bristol NHS Trust indicates that across the board its activity costs are 26&nbsp;per cent. above the national average. This reflects the significant extra unplanned expenditure incurred by the trust in that year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w14.html_para2">
Payment by results began in a small way in 2003&#150;04, is extended in 2004&#150;05, and becomes fully operational in 2005&#150;06. There will be a further three-year transition period to full impact of the new system until 2008, during which the effect of the tariff will be phased to allow trusts to adjust local costs so as to be able to live within the tariff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w14.html_para3">
We anticipate there may be some NHS trusts that will not be able to reduce costs to the extent necessary. The numbers in this position are likely to be very few as new and better costing and HRG definitions are introduced, and when the system has been fine-tuned to take account of exceptionally expensive patients not well covered by the tariff. We also recognise that where organisations are recovering an accumulated deficit, recovery plans will need to be revisited in the light of transition.

The costs are recovered from insurers, not the injured person. The charges are calculated using a tariff, which is currently set at &#163;473 for treatment without admission, a daily rate fee of &#163;582 for treatment with admission and there is a ceiling of charges which is set at &#163;34,800.

Provisions contained in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 allow the current system of recovery of NHS costs to be expanded so that NHS hospital treatment costs and NHS ambulance service costs will be recoverable in all cases where personal injury compensation is paid. This will in the main include employer and public liability claims, in addition to road traffic accident claims. The new scheme is due to commence on 1&nbsp;April 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of whether <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;convicted and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;suspected terrorists in the United Kingdom are using (i) multiple and (ii) false identities.  [170344]</p>








<p><a name="40519w17.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 We are aware that the use of false and multiple identities is a well established practice used by those who wish to disguise and facilitate involvement in serious crime, including terrorism. We know that at least 35&nbsp;per cent. of terrorists use false or multiple identities.

<p><a name="40519w17.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) will accept a Disclosure application from any individual who is resident, or is seeking a post, in England and Wales, meets the eligibility criteria and makes an application in the prescribed form which includes providing the documentation required to authenticate the applicant. But Part 5 of the Police Act 1997, under which the CRB operates, does not empower the CRB to search data sources outside the United Kingdom for conviction and other information shown on its Disclosures. The value of a CRB Disclosure may therefore be limited if the applicant has been resident in the UK for no more than a short time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w17.html_para2">
Some other countries, including most in the EU, have arrangements in place which allow their citizens to obtain certificates of good conduct or extracts from the criminal record to show to prospective employers. The CRB has developed an Overseas Information Service for the benefit of employers. This supplies advice and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 May 2004 : Column 1039W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
information about arrangements and contact points in a number of other countries in order that the employer can make inquiries or ask the employee to do so. At present, this covers 16 countries, including nine in Europe, and work is in hand to extend the service to a further 15 countries, including 14 in Europe. The CRB advises that Disclosures should complement and not replace other checks and inquiries under good recruitment practice. It is for employers (or regulatory bodies) to determine the arrangements that are to apply.

<p><a name="40519w19.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Recorded crime figures, which are used to measure trends in crime, include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on property crimes, such as burglary, do not record whether the latter are related to an offender&#039;s drug habits. There are therefore no figures currently available for the proportion of crime in Greater London, by borough, which was connected to drug addiction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w19.html_para1">
The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, provides an insight into the proportion of crimes that are drug related. However, this survey does not provide sub-national data and is also not nationally representative.

A comparison of the survey&#039;s findings from eight sites across the country (including custody suites in Bethnal Green and Hammersmith) visited in 1999 and 2002, indicate that there was no change in the proportion of arrestees testing positive for one or more of six illicit drugs.

<i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The Licensing Act 2003 strengthens the law on selling to under-18s, and increases the penalties for doing so.

<p><a name="40519w19.html_spnew8"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s advice to local planning authorities is contained in Circular 22/91, &#039;Travelling Showpeople&#039;. This recognises the need for showpeople&#039;s winter quarters and describes the particular character of showpeople&#039;s sites. It puts emphasis on early discussion between local planning authorities and showpeople whenever local development plans are being prepared in order to help ensure suitable sites are available for purchase. It also advises early discussion between local planning authorities and showpeople before land is purchased for the setting up of winter quarters. Where plans do not contain a policy relating to the provision of showpeople&#039;s quarters, applications should be determined on their merits.

The Government have a number of policy initiatives designed to increase the supply of accessible housing including the provision of suitable housing to families with a disabled child. All newly built homes are required to comply with &quot;Part M&quot; of the building regulations. These provisions are expected to enable occupants to cope better with reduced mobility. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced earlier this year that we will carry out a further review of Part M, with the aim of incorporating Lifetime Home standards for accessibility into the Building Regulations.

Furthermore, in relation to new social housing, the Government requires that all schemes funded through the Housing Corporation comply not only with the Building Regulations, but also with additional criteria for accessibility and internal environments set out in the Corporation&#039;s scheme development standards.

This year, over 33,000 homes will be adapted to meet the needs of disabled people through the programme&#151;a 50&nbsp;per cent. increase on 1997&#150;98.

 The current role of the Community Housing Task Force (CHTF) is to lead the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s work on options appraisal.

The resources used to make overhanging debt payments are part of the Office&#039;s Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) and are outside the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL).

 National planning guidance for Open Space, Sport and Recreation (PPG17), published in July 2002, already provides the framework for raising participation. It includes an objective for the planning process to promote healthy living and prevent illness. The guidance requires local authorities to assess the future as well as the existing needs of their communities for sports and recreational facilities. Authorities are expected to keep these assessments up-to-date and to use them to set standards for inclusion in their plans.

Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector.

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 Outturn Statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 History is a statutory subject in the National Curriculum for all primary age pupils, which requires that pupils are taught knowledge, skills and understanding through various areas of study. At Key Stage 2 these include studies of local, British, European and world history. Within that framework, schools have considerable flexibility over the detailed content of their history courses as long as the statutory requirements are met.

It is for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for children in need in its area, including those who are the victims of trafficking. When a child enters the country alone and claims asylum or there are concerns that he or she may have been trafficked, the immigration service should immediately refer the child to the relevant local authority&#039;s social services department. The social services department will undertake a needs assessment and will provide services in the light of the outcome of that assessment. These services should be tailored to the individual needs of the child, just as they should be for any child in need.

<p><a name="40519w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Department continues to explore ways to increase investment in our sports facilities working with partners in the voluntary, public and private sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w25.html_para2">
One of the key routes for DCMS to invest in the delivery of local authority leisure facilities is through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). This is one of a range of Government policies designed to increase private sector involvement in the provision of public services. DCMS is currently supporting 21 local authority PFI projects nationwide, 12 of which include the provision of new or refurbished sports and leisure facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w25.html_para3">
DCMS has participated in various cross-government initiatives aimed at informing both the public and private sector about the PFI process. However, DCMS does not directly enter into discussions with the private sector on individual PFI projects since it is a matter for local authorities to negotiate the specific terms by which they might contribute to the provision of their leisure facilities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what her Department&#039;s assessment is of the impact of trusts on provision of local authority leisure facilities; and if she will make a statement.  [174058]</p>








<p><a name="40519w25.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has not made a formal assessment of the impact of trusts on the provision of local authority leisure facilities. The Department is, however, aware that there are a significant number of trusts operating sports and leisure facilities in partnership with local authorities and will monitor their development.


</p>







<p><a name="40519w25.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Reed: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what her Department&#039;s policy is on ensuring that operators of public sector leisure facilities which have been contracted out invest in the long-term future of the facility.  [174059]</p>








<p><a name="40519w25.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Whilst the provision of public leisure facilities is not a statutory duty, local authorities do have a duty to ensure that public services are responsive to the needs of their citizens, efficient and of high quality. Under the Local Government Acts (1999 and 2000) all services purchased or provided by local authorities are subject to the duty of best value which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 May 2004 : Column 1069W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
requires them to improve services year on year. Depending on the length of the contract, this would include long-term investments.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what standards the Government set for the acceptable standard of sports and leisure facilities offered by a local authority.  [174060]</p>








<p><a name="40519w25.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The provision of sports and leisure facilities is not a statutory duty for local authorities and therefore there are no mandatory standards. However, my Department and its non-departmental public bodies offer extensive and detailed advice on standards; for instance, Sport England offers guidance notes, technical advice and standards for the design and development of sports facilities and Quest, a national quality accreditation scheme for sports facilities and sports development. By December 2003, 430 sports and leisure facilities had achieved a pass or higher in the Quest facility management scheme. The Department is also working with Sport England and other partners to develop &quot;Towards an Excellent Service&quot;, a performance management framework for sport.

<p><a name="40519w25.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The most comprehensive picture of the condition of the existing stock of public sector sports facilities available to the Department is Sport England&#039;s report &quot;Condition and Refurbishment of Public Sector Sports Facilities&quot;, published January 2003. The report estimates that it would cost &#163;550&nbsp;million over five years to bring sports centres owned by local authorities in England up to a safe and acceptable standard. The capital cost of maintaining the stock thereafter is estimated at between &#163;144&nbsp;million and &#163;151&nbsp;million per annum. These costs are at mid-2002 prices and exclude VAT.

As to HMS Royal Oak, every opportunity has been taken during the wreck remediation work on this vessel to further our understanding of the technical and environmental issues associated with the management of such wrecks.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) what assessment his Department has made of the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Co-ordinators&#039; comments on 10&nbsp;May 2004 concerning the humanitarian situation in Colombia; and if he will make a statement;  [173368]

<p><a name="40519w28.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID notes that the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan Egeland, indicated that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), together with the Government of Colombia and Non-Governmental Organisations, intend to launch a new humanitarian plan of action next month focused on the internally displaced. DFID will consider it carefully and discuss the details with OCHA once it is launched.

<p>
<a name="40519w28.html_para0">
DFID stands ready to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance in response to humanitarian crises wherever they occur and seeks to respond as quickly as possible against an assessment of priority needs. The extent and nature of any UK response is determined by the magnitude of need and as part of a coordinated international response.

<p>
<a name="40519w28.html_para1">
The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has already committed &#8364;8&nbsp;million of humanitarian assistance for 2004, of which the United Kingdom&#039;s share is some &#8364;1.44&nbsp;million.

 No universally accepted figures of displaced Colombians exist. In his statement of 10&nbsp;May 2004, the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Jan Egeland, stated that 2&nbsp;million people had become displaced in Colombia in the past 15 years. According to CODHES, a Colombian NGO, about 3,090,000 people were internally displaced from 1984&#150;2003, of which 1,247,000 were over the period 2000&#150;03. The Colombian Government figures estimates a figure of 1,148,000 over the latter period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40519w28.html_para2">
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are 2,430 Colombian &#039;persons of concern&#039; in Panama and around 8,860 in Venezuela. However, these figures are generally considered to represent only a proportion of displaced people to these countries, particularly in Venezuela given the effect the Venezuelan Government&#039;s concern about the influx of displaced Colombians is having on Colombians&#039; desire to register.

 Extensive measures are taken to protect all DFID staff and contractors. All DFID staff and consultants employed individually are provided with body armour, safety and communications equipment, security training, briefing and armed protection. Contractors are responsible for the security arrangements of their staff but the costs are covered by the UK Government. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in receipt of DFID support are also responsible for their own security. DFID maintains a regular dialogue with them on security issues and will fund their security needs where appropriate. All of these security arrangements are kept under constant review.

At the European Commission&#039;s international donors&#039; conference for Cyprus on 15&nbsp;April 2004, the international community and the international financial institutions signalled their strong support for the UN Secretary-General&#039;s plan. The IMF explained that much of its advice on fiscal and other economic matters had been reflected in the plan, which it would help the parties implement with technical assistance, and&#151;if necessary&#151;balance of payments support. The IMF&#039;s considered view was that the Annan Plan was &quot;economically and financially viable&quot;, and would deliver a higher rate of growth for the United Cyprus Republic than was likely to be achieved under the status quo. The World Bank also signalled its intention to support implementation of the plan, including to help address income disparities. The EIB and the Council of Europe Development Bank supported this analysis.

the High Court brought by the families of 13 Iraqi civilians. The Government&#039;s position in those cases is that ECHR rights have no application in Iraq. The citizens of Cyprus, prior to invasion by Turkey, were the beneficiaries of rights under the ECHR, by virtue of Cyprus&#039; membership of the Council of Europe. The decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Loizidou was to the effect that they did not lose those rights when Turkey assumed sole effective control of part of the territory of Cyprus. The position in Iraq, of course, is critically different. The citizens of Iraq had no rights at all under the ECHR prior to military action by the coalition forces; furthermore, the UK does not exercise the same degree of control over Iraq as existed in relation to the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.

TSO recoups these costs through sales and uses its commercial judgment as to the number of copies printed. TSO printed 550 copies of the report for their own use.
