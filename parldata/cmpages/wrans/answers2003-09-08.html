To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many children suffered adverse effects last year from prescribed drugs that required hospital treatment.  [126718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Data from Hospital Episode Statistics indicates that there were 2,778 admissions to hospital of children under 16 years due to adverse effects from drugs, medicines and biological substances in therapeutic use in national health service hospitals in England in 2001&#150;02. These data include adverse effects from all medicines, whether prescribed or taken without prescription. It is important to note that these figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have been admitted to hospital more than once in the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions his Department has had with strategic health authorities and primary care trusts to ensure cancer is treated as a primary care priority in line with his Department's national guidance; and what steps his Department is taking to ensure cancer is treated as a primary care priority in line with his Department's national guidance.

 The NHS Cancedr Plan made clear the crucial role that family doctors and community nurses have to play at all stages along the cancer patient

pathway. One of the actions in the NHS Cancer Plan was the establishment of a new partnership between the National Health Service and Macmillan Cancer Relief to provide around &#163;3 million a year for three years to support a lead clinician in cancer within every primary care trust (PCT). These leads have a key role to play by providing strategic leadership within the PCT, contributing to the development of cancer networks, improving communication between sectors, raising standards of cancer care through the PCTs and ensuring services are responsive to the needs of people affected by cancer.
<P>

<a name="30908w01.html_para8">A recent workshop to develop a vision for primary care cancer services examined the role of community-based services in all aspects of cancer care including patients at risk of cancer, patients with symptoms suggesting a possible diagnosis of cancer and the care of patients with known cancer. The workshop was attended by a number of stakeholders including representatives from PCTs. It also provided an opportunity to consider the cancer elements of the proposed general medical services contract quality and outcomes framework. This includes some cancer and palliative care specific indicators as well as other generic organisational indicators that are of particular relevance to cancer patients wuch as sharing information out of hours.
<P>

<a name="30908w01.html_para9">Responsibility for commissioning of cancer services now rests with PCTs and it is for PCTs in parnership with strategic health authorities (SHAs) and other local stakeholders to determine how best to meet national priorities, including the targets set for cancer, in "Improvement, Expansion and Reform: the next three years&#151;Priorities and Planning Framework 2003 to 2006".
<P>

<a name="30908w01.html_para10">PCTs and SHAs were required to produce local delivery plans (LDPs) for the three years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 setting out how the would deliver the national targets set out in the Priorities and Planning Framework and supporting guidance was provided to assist with this. It is the SHA who are responsible for delivering the targets or outcomes in their LDP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the latest average waiting time is from referral to <i>(a)</i> imaging treatment, <i>(b)</i> endoscopy treatment and <i>(c)</i> radiotherapy treatment for NHS cancer patients.  [126990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w01.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Data are not collected centrally on waiting times for scans, endoscopy or radiotherapy treatment. The length of time that a patient may have to wait is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be treated.
<P>

<a name="30908w01.html_para11">Where these procedures form part of the pathway for cancer patients the NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first definitive cancer treatment. From 2001, there was a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month wait from urgent referral to first treatment for

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are being taken to ensure that cosmetic surgery clinics check the qualifications and expertise of the surgeons they employ.  [126829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Under the Care Standards Act 2000, from 1 April 2002 all independent health care providers have been regulated by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC). The NCSC has a health directorate devoted to the inspection and regulation of independent health care providers, who are required to meet national minimum standards. These require that cosmetic surgeons are registered with the General Medical Council and that pre and post employment checks are carried out, including validation of qualifications, and that employment references are sought.
<P>

<a name="30908w02.html_para0">If the NCSC discovers that an independent hospital is not complying with these standards, it has the power to take appropriate regulatory action to ensure they are met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Training is long established for health care workers to respond to routine outbreaks of infectious diseases. Since 11 September 2001, training to spot outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by the deliberate release of biological agents has increased. This has included educational articles in national and international medical journals, authoritative and up-to-date advice on the Department of Health and Health Protection Agency's web-sites and seminars/conferences for specific groups of healthcare workers. These seminars follow the principle of "Training the Trainer" and will be cascaded to other health care professionals. More are planned this year. Training for a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incident is now the responsibility of the Health Protection Agency [HPA].
<P>

<a name="30908w02.html_para1">For general practitioners, a conference was organised by the Department of Health and the Royal College of General Practitioners in early July.

<P>

<a name="30908w02.html_para6">There is no intention to require all hospitals to have laundries on site. The management and control of hospital linen is administered at local level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what mechanisms the NHS has for offering homebirth and natural birthing opportunities to expectant mothers.  [126998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The national health service provides a variety of types of care for women during pregnancy and childbirth, including home birth and natural birthing opportunities. The Department of Health advocates local decision making in designing appropriate, effective services that fit in with the ethos of woman-centred care. It is inevitable that the requirements of women will vary in different parts of the country and this is why it is so important that decisions about service provision are made at a local level.
<P>

<a name="30908w02.html_para9">The Department of Health is currently developing the children's national service framework (NSF) which includes a maternity module. The NSF will focus on extending maternity choices, so that women in all parts of the country have a greater choice in the place and type of birth.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received on the numbers of consultant obstetricians in labour units in the NHS; what guidelines he has issued on the <i>(a)</i> optimum and <i>(b)</i> minimum coverage of labour units by consultant obstetricians; and what the average number of consultant obstetricians in labour units in (i) England and (ii) each strategic health authority is.  [124224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Department of Health officials have received a number of representations on numbers of consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology on labour units, in particular, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology.
<P>

<a name="30908w02.html_para10">These include contributions to the report to the children task force from the maternity and neonatal workforce group, annual speciality review meetings and the maternity module of the children's national service framework.

 The number of senior house officers (SHOs) within neurology, in each national health service region, in 1997, 1998 and 2001 is shown in table 1.
<P>

<a name="30908w03.html_para25">In 1998, the Department validated data returns against information held by the Royal Colleges which resulted in the reclassification of some specialities. Therefore, the decrease shown in SHO neurology numbers in 1998 is largely an issue of reclassification rather than a reduction.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are now the lead organisation responsible for planning health care services that better meet local needs. PCTs have the key role, through local delivery plans (LDPs), in representing the national health service in broader local planning arrangements around health improvement and partnerships with key local agencies. PCTs have the freedom to determine locally how they best address issues such as rough sleeping through their LDPs. As it is a matter for local decision making, the Department would not prescribe or monitor centrally how PCTs have locally addressed this particular issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions his Department has had with companies involved in the bidding process for contracts to supply <i>(a)</i> smallpox vaccines and <i>(b)</i> TB vaccines; and whether Dr. Paul Drayson was referred to.  [109092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department awarded a contract for the supply of smallpox vaccine on 11 April 2002. Prior to this, officials from the Department met with Powderject on 22 January 2002 as part of confidential discussions held with the five major pharmaceutical companies known to have smallpox vaccine manufacturing capability.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para0">The meeting was to inform the companies of our requirements for smallpox vaccine and to find out whether the company was in a position to meet our requirements and if so, to invite them to submit their written proposals for vaccine supply. Since the award of the contract to Powderject, there were regular ad hoc meetings between officials from the Department and the Ministry of Defence with Powderject to resolve matters of detail concerning labelling and packaging and delivery of the vaccine. As all discussions with the company were confidential, the names of those present can not be revealed in accordance with normal policy.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para1">The Department will shortly be completing a second tranche of smallpox procurement. On 10 January 2003, officials from the Department met with representatives of all companies who had expressed an interest in bidding for the contract. An adjudication meeting was held on 12 May 2003 with representatives of two companies whose bids met the criteria for supply. On 30 July, the Government announced its intention to award the contract to Aventis Pasteur MSD. It is regarded as best practice, for reasons of commercial confidentiality, that the names of those unsuccessful companies who submitted bids are not revealed.

<a name="30908w04.html_para2">The Department has had no discussions with companies involved in the bidding process for BCG and Tuberculin PPD. These contract negotiations are dealt with by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency on behalf of the Department.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office whether his additional duties as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster encompass the Government's UK online agenda responsibilities.  [127080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster I am responsible to the Sovereign for the administration of the Duchy.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para3">Among other wider Cabinet Office responsibilities, I am responsible for leading and supporting the e-transformation in government of which UK online is part. This falls to me in my role as Minister for the Cabinet Office with oversight of the Office of the e-Envoy and not in my role as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what action he is taking to make more on-line Government services available to people over 65.  [128200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Ensuring high levels of take-up of online services by all users is an essential part of the e-government strategy. The Government is acting upon the recommendations of the National Audit Office report, "Progress in making e-services accessible to all&#151;access and use by older people" to ensure that people over 65 are encouraged to take advantage of online services.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para4">This report highlights that older people are more likely to use online services when they can access them in places they would normally visit, such as libraries and community centres. The Government has established over 6,000 UK online centres in these locations where people can access the internet for free or at low cost with support to help them do so.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para5">The report also mentions that one factor preventing older people from using the internet, especially among those who have never used computers, is the feeling that it is of no relevance to them. One of the challenges for government is to demonstrate the benefits of the internet to older people. This we have done during the "Get Started" campaign which ran throughout May and June. The retirement pension is just one of the government services regularly used by older people that we are prioritising as part of our e-government programme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what assessment he has made of the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the February report on offering Government services electronically to older people.  [128195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The National Audit Office report provided a valuable means of focusing attention on 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 15W</I><P>
what needs to be done to increase the numbers of older people in the UK accessing and benefiting from the internet and electronic services. My officials in the Office of the e-Envoy are working closely with colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills to look at implementing the report's recommendations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make a statement on progress made in ensuring that all Government services are available on-line by 2005.  [128197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring that central government services are made available electronically by 2005 and that key services achieve high levels of use. The latest Electronic Service Delivery survey shows that 63 per cent. of services were e-enabled at the end of 2002 and departments have forecast that they are on track for the 2005 target.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what assessment he has made of the number of users in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> other countries who access Government services through the internet.  [128198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics publishes survey results on a quarterly basis of e-government use within the UK. The Office of the e-Envoy published an analysis of international comparisons of e-government use in the 2002 benchmarking study The World's Most Effective Policies for the e-Economy, a copy of which is held in the House Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what action he is taking to encourage more people to access Government services through the internet.  [128199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government's target of getting all e-Government services online by 2005 has been enhanced to include the commitment "with key services achieving high levels of use". In order to achieve this, the Office of the e-Envoy is currently developing a methodology, definitions and targets for each of the key services. In order to encourage further take-up, the Office of the e-Envoy is working with Departments to develop strategies for ensuring maximum use of key services.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para6">Levels of internet access continue to rise, with 54 per cent. of adults now regular internet users. 47 per cent. of adults using internet in the last 12 months had accessed a government or public authority website (ONS, July 2003). In May we launched the "Get Started" campaign to promote the benefits of the internet to key groups such as the elderly, those with disabilities and the unemployed.
<P>

<a name="30908w04.html_para7">It is vital that government websites are as accessible and as easy to use as possible. A report, the "Quality Framework for UK Government Website Design", was published on 24 July; it sets out clear guidance for government web managers to ensure they incorporate users' needs in their web design process. The report is available on the Office of the e-Envoy's website (http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/Resources/WebGuidelines/fs/en).

 No representations have been received recently from the Scottish Executive on non-coterminous constituency boundaries. However, the Executive's response in March 2002 to the Scotland Office's consultation on the size of the Scottish Parliament included its views on the possible difficulties that might arise from having different constituency boundaries between Westminster and Holyrood. These are recorded in the summary of the consultation responses which was placed in the Library of the House on 18 December 2002.

 No. People with autism spectrum disorders are entitled to disability living allowance and attendance allowance on the same basis as anyone else with a severe disability.

 On applying for pension credit from age 65, pensioners are asked about any changes they expect to their pension income over the next 12 months. If additional income will become available within the next 12 months, but the amount is not yet known, their award will be fixed for reassessment at that date. If a change is expected in more than 12 months, their assessment will be fixed for the full five-year period allowed, during which any increases in pension income will be ignored.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received no representations from the Scottish Executive specifically on the operation of Awards for All in Scotland. However, there was correspondence in June 2003, before we published the National Lottery Funding Decision Document. That document proposes to increase the upper grant limit of Awards for All in England. We believe that given the local community focus of Awards for All, any changes to the programme in other parts of the United Kingdom should be considered separately within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<a name="30908w07.html_para5">The total balance as at the end of June 2003 was the lowest month end balance since August 1997. All of this money has been committed to projects by distributors.
<P>

<a name="30908w07.html_para6">This Department recently published the National Lottery Funding Decision Document, which sets out a number of proposals aimed at reducing further the balances held by distributors. These include issuing guidance on balance management to distributors and revising the Financial Directions distributors operate under in order to speed up the funding of smaller, low risk projects. There are also a number of other proposals which would require legislation. I have placed copies of the document in the Libraries of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to review the system whereby projects can only be supported by the National Lottery for a set period of time.  [127998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w07.html_spnew8"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 There are no plans at present to review the period of support for projects by the lottery. Funding is generally time-limited and usually for a maximum of three years. Following extensive consultations last year, however, the Heritage Lottery Fund extended the length of the maximum period of support for their revenue projects from three to five years. There is an opportunity for grants to be renewed to allow projects to continue in operation but such follow-on funding is unlikely to be repeated indefinitely.

<a name="30908w07.html_spnew9"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government recognise that the simplest way of establishing the necessary link between buying a Lottery ticket and funding a Lottery project is to use the same brand for both. The Lottery Distributors are currently working with Camelot to develop an appropriate design. It is expected that, from autumn 2004, this will be offered on a voluntary basis to projects which have received Lottery funding. The display of the logo will then become mandatory for most future Lottery awards. Over a longer timescale, other ways of using the crossed fingers logo throughout the whole distribution process will be explored.

 The Department announced that we were considering setting up a Young People's Fund, and the Decision Document published earlier this month confirmed that this will be fully established within a year, with an initial budget of &#163;200 million. It is envisaged that the Fund will initially be managed by the New Opportunities Fund, but we have not yet reached the stage where staff have been allocated specifically to run the scheme.

<a name="30908w07.html_spnew11"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The available information is contained in an independent report on expenditure on the National Lottery (undertaken by Kerry Sproston) which was commissioned by the National Lottery Commission and published earlier this year. The report indicated that 17 per cent. of those aged 16&#150;24 participated in the National Lottery, which was the lowest rate of participation for any age range. It also indicated that those on the lowest incomes (below &#163;9,499 per annum) spent significantly less per week than those on incomes above this.

 The Department's Decision Document on Lottery funding, published earlier this month, confirmed our intention to create a new community distributor, which will take on the functions of both the Community Fund and New Opportunities Fund. We believe there is significant overlap between the work of the two distributors, particularly in supporting local communities and the voluntary sector. The new distributor is intended to take advantage of these synergies to transform the lives of local people and communities across the UK.

 The Government's proposal for a National Lottery Day is designed to provide an annual focus on the Lottery and its achievements, to let the public see what their lottery money goes to fund. It will be an opportunity for Lottery funded projects throughout the UK wherever possible to open their doors or otherwise celebrate the Lottery's contribution. The exact form the day will take is still to be finalised, but it will have a strong regional and local focus and major prizes will be available to players.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w07.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the options being considered for giving the devolved Administrations more influence over how National Lottery funding is allocated.  [128008]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w07.html_spnew14"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Our provisional view is that we should retain a UK structure for distribution but that the devolved Administrations should have more influence in setting specific priorities and strategies, taking account of the needs and wishes of local communities and service providers there. We will consider how this should be done, consulting with devolved Administrations before coming to a final decision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much money she has given to Supporters Direct to promote more democratic participation in the management of football clubs; and what related discussions she has had with the Football Association on the conversion of football clubs to mutual organisations.  [127828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government launched Supporters Direct in 2000 to assist and advise supporters' trust groups to get involved in the responsible running of clubs. Most Premier and Football League clubs now have club trusts, and majority shareholdings are now held by supporters' representatives at three clubs. Supporters Direct received &#163;250,000 a year in public funding for 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03, and will receive core funding of &#163;325,000 for 2003&#150;04. These amounts were, and will be, "top-sliced" from the Football Foundation's income from the Reduction in Pool Betting Duty.
<P>

<a name="30908w08.html_para3">Supporters Direct has recently become an Industrial and Provident Society organised along mutual lines, and has suggested that professional football clubs could also benefit from the adoption of that status. I intend to discuss the issue with the football authorities once they have considered that suggestion in detail.

 The Government are encouraging competitiveness in the tourism industry by concentrating on measures that will encourage improvements to the quality of the product offered by individual tourism businesses through improvement in the skills base across the sector and encouraging effective investment in quality.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w09.html_wqn3"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement on the implications for the insurance industry of legal costs in relation to no win, no fee cases.  [127804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Conditional Fee Agreements (CFAs), the most common type of 'no win no fee' agreements, were first introduced in 1995. In April 2000 success fees and after the event insurance premiums were made recoverable from the losing party to help redress the problem of the legal system being open only to people who were legally aided or who had adequate private means. The intention was to make it easier and more affordable for a wider range of people to enforce their rights. The reforms also provided defendants and their insurers with a fairer system by which to recover costs in successfully defended cases, whereas under Legal Aid, defendants were rarely entitled to recover costs from their legally aided opponent. The reforms provided increased deterrents to the bringing or defending of weak claims and stronger incentives for parties to settle cases early and cheaply because of the increased potential liability in costs.
<P>

<a name="30908w09.html_para1">It is not possible to say yet whether legal costs to insurers have increased directly as a result of the introduction of CFAs, recoverable success fees and ATE insurance premiums. Recent research by Fenn, Gray and Rickman (January 2003) for the Civil Justice Council on the cost of road traffic accident cases up to &#163;15,000 in value found that data on costs and damages from around April 2002 onwards showed large fluctuations in the volume and duration of settled claims and could not be relied upon. However, the research did indicate that there seemed to be little difference between 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 32W</I><P>
CFA and non-CFA claims with respect to agreed base costs and disbursements, and that success fees and ATE premiums remain a relatively small part of overall costs recovered from insurers.
<P>

<a name="30908w09.html_para2">The OFT commented in its recent fact finding study of the liability insurance market that it seemed unlikely the cost of individual claims has risen substantially as a result of the reforms and it was unclear whether they have had a significant impact on the frequency of claims. The OFT also said that while it had frequently been suggested the number of claims has risen because the reforms have made the claiming process easier and associated publicity has drawn more attention to the availability of compensation, the evidence for this was in fact largely anecdotal.

<i>[holding answer 3 July 2003]:</i> There are some 160 United Kingdom Royal Military Police and Military Police operating in Iraq at present, assisting in maintaining law and order in southern Iraq. The Coalition Provisional Authority reports that there are some 31,000 Iraqi police now at work across Iraq. We do not centrally record the number of violent incidents in Iraq. But 17 UK Service personnel have died since 23 April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Royal Military Policemen are deployed in Iraq; what their role is; and if he will make a statement on what protection is afforded to them whilst carrying out their tasks.  [123838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As of 28 August 2003, there were approximately 180 Royal Military Police (RMP) in theatre serving on Operation Telic. Their duties include Force Protection, liaison with host nations, Prisoner-of-War handling, Close Protection and general police duties at military establishments. The Special Investigations Branch, which investigates incidents and allegations involving members of the UK armed forces, is also part of the RMP. Members of the RMP are afforded force protection measures appropriate to the duties they are carrying out.

 The intelligence sources referred to in the Ministry of Defence's Iraq First Reflections Report are all the intelligence sources available to support the planning and conduct of the military operation including defence intelligence, intelligence from national agencies and intelligence from allies. However, the report's focus is on the intelligence on Iraqi military intentions in the period immediately before and during the conflict. The Government's Assessment of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction described the role of intelligence in Part 1, Chapter 1 which lists the principal sources as the United Kingdom's intelligence and analysis agencies and intelligence from close allies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans there are for the installation of air conditioning at Ministry of Defence troop bases in Iraq.  [127128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 At present, approximately half of all United Kingdom Service personnel deployed in Iraq have access to air-conditioned accommodation. Work is continuing to provide further air conditioning in accommodation areas throughout the area of operations. The majority of personnel should be provided with air-conditioned accommodation by the end of September 2003.

<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_wqn16"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the Government's reply to the 56th Report from the Public Accounts Committee, Session 2001&#150;02, what measures were taken, prior to the war in Iraq, to <i>(a)</i> invest in equipment, <i>(b)</i> raise awareness throughout the land forces and <i>(c)</i> refine tactics, techniques and procedures to improve Combat Identification in the land environment.  [127307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Combat Identification is fundamental to combat effectiveness and enables us to minimise the risk of fratricide. We therefore have a continuing programme to support our armed forces' Combat Identification capability through investment in equipment, training and continuous review of tactics, techniques and procedures. Prior to war-fighting operations in Iraq we worked to ensure, as we do before any military operation, that robust Combat Identification arrangements were in place and that the best Combat Identification equipment available for this operation was provided.
<P>

<a name="30908w12.html_para9">We worked very closely with the United States in the planning phase on a coalition concept of operations for Combat Identification. This related principally to specific marking systems for ground forces. We acquired a range of new equipment to ensure that UK 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 46W</I><P>
land forces capabilities either complied with or exceeded the mandated standard. We also acquired sufficient sets of the US's recently developed satellite-based Blue Force Tracking tool to help our units operate with US forces. GPS navigation aids and the short-range Personal Role Radio, a part of the Bowman programme brought into service early, were widely available.
<P>

<a name="30908w12.html_para10">UK and US forces also set up liaison arrangements to maintain dialogue on tactics, techniques and procedures for the operation and took steps to familiarise themselves with each other's forces.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many civil servants are in Iraq searching for weapons of mass destruction; and when they were sent.  [128309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 On 1 September 2003 there were 19 civil servants in Iraq working for the Iraq Survey Group employed in its task of searching for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. They arrived in theatre from 13 June 2003. This number will continue to change as new staff join and others complete their periods of duty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proportion of British forces in Iraq are engaged in making safe unexploded ordnance; how many devices have been disarmed; and what other agencies are assisting in this work.  [114516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 May 2003]:</i> The United Kingdom currently has 10 Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams in Iraq consisting of 99 personnel.
<P>

<a name="30908w12.html_para11">As at 4 September some 116,000 individual items of unexploded ordnance had been cleared. We estimate that over 220,000 rounds of small arms ammunition have also been cleared. The vast majority of unexploded ordnance is of Iraqi origin.
<P>

<a name="30908w12.html_para12">A number of Non-Governmental Organisations have been conducting EOD clearance under the supervision of the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Team, including Minetech and Intersos.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what British resources have been devoted to investigating deaths by friendly fire during the Iraq conflict, broken down by number of people investigating and their Service.  [115792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]:</i> All incidents where friendly fire is suspected are investigated fully. In the case of incidents arising from Operation Telic, most are being investigated by personnel from the Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch. Eight personnel are currently employed on these tasks. Where appropriate, the incidents will also be the subject of individual Service Boards of Inquiry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w12.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Government continue to believe that those who have been responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Iraq should be brought to justice. Where it is suspected

<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 47W</I><P>
that a mass grave site has been found, details of the site are passed to Coalition Joint Task Force 7 (CJTF7) Crime Investigation Division. Where possible, UK Forces will provide protection to such sites, but this requirement has to be balanced against other demands for their services.

<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_wqn0"><B> Patrick Mercer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how often audits are made of maintenance programmes <i>(a)</i> involving Ministry of Defence agencies and <i>(b)</i> with outside contractors.  [121250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Internal audits within the Ministry of Defence are conducted primarily by Defence Internal Audit (DIA) but there are also audit-style reviews by functional and business unit compliance teams as well as specific quality inspections against formal standards. The periodicity of internal audit review is now governed by an assessment of the risks inherent within any particular system or process and agreed by the Defence Audit Committee. As such, there are no longer routine or cyclical audits per se. It is not therefore possible to state how often audits of maintenance programmes may occur. Judgments regarding risk are made by senior managers responsible for the delivery of defence objectives rather than by auditors.
<P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para0">There remains, however, flexibility within the internal audit process to undertake ad hoc reviews as well as consultancy and business development assignments and in recent years DIA has undertaken individual audits examining repair processes, prime contracting and estates maintenance at the request of management.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what role the Royal Military Police Training School has played in supporting civilian services in emergencies in West Sussex in the last six years; and if he will list the occasions when they did so.  [127247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There have been two occasions in the past six years when the Royal Military Police Training School has provided assistance in emergency situations. These were in November 2001 when there was flooding in the area and the School provided accommodation, catering equipment and personnel to assist in relief operations and damage prevention. From October 2002 to June 2003, during the recent firefighters dispute, the school provided accommodation, catering and equipment to military fire-fighters and civil police escorts.

 Complaints were not recorded before 1990. Between 1990 and 1994, complaints were divided into three broad geographical areas the first covering the immediate locality, the second North Essex and the third Kent. Since 1995, complaints have been recorded for the areas listed. The numbers of complaints from 1990 about noise from the range arising from demolitions, explosions and gunfire are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many kilometres on average an armoured brigade moves in 24 hours; and what the equivalent figures will be after the introduction of the Oshkosh transporters;  [127111]
<P>
<UL>(2) what change in capability there will be arising from the change from 120 Heavy Equipment Transporters for Square Brigade to 92 Oshkosh Tank Transporters.  [127110]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide a meaningful assessment of the distance an armoured brigade can travel in 24 hours because the rate of progress is governed by a wide range of variable factors, such as the type of terrain, climatic conditions, and the nature of any hostilities.
<P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para1"><P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para2">The introduction of the new Oshkosh transporters will, however, introduce a significant increase in capability. Even though there will be 28 fewer transporters than we currently hold, the old vehicles have become increasingly difficult to maintain and the availability levels are therefore low. The new Oshkosh Tank Transporter fleet will be operated under a public private partnership

initiative and payment is based on performance. Availability levels will be guaranteed, using vehicles leased from civilian hauliers if necessary.
<P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para3">Additionally, the Oshkosh has a number of features that vastly improve its capability. These include a Central Tyre Inflation System (CTIS) giving the fleet an increased off road capability. It also has a dual winch system and can double load Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicles unlike the Scammell Commander which was restricted to carrying only single Warriors. This double loading capability frees up considerable trailer space for the movement of Challenger 2 Tanks vital in the deployment of an Armoured Brigade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Since closure in April 1995, the cost of clearing ordnance from RAF Chilmark, including the preparation of Land Quality Assessments and remediation, has been approximately &#163;1.8 million.
<P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para4">Parts of the site have already been sold. It is Ministry of Defence policy to 'sell with knowledge'. Following completion of explosive ordnance clearance, the Land Quality Assessment and details of any remediation work will be made available to prospective purchasers, and will be taken fully into account in agreeing the terms of sale including price. Remediation of contamination prior to transfer will generally be confined to the removal of ordnance and other defence specific contaminants, such as chemical agents or radioactive and micro-biological material that a civilian contractor might not have the relevant experience to deal with.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the projected cost and commissioning date of auxiliary oilers <i>(a)</i> Wave Knight and <i>(b)</i> Wave Ruler were when the contract was let; what the date of commissioning and the final cost are; and if he will make a statement.  [127277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 At the time the contact was let, in March 1997, the projected construction cost for Wave Knight and Wave Ruler was some &#163;200 million. The contract cost for both vessels has still to be finalised but is expected to be between &#163;210&#150;&#163;215 million. The increase reflects an addition to the contract for the procurement of spares and minor configuration changes to the ships' design over the period of the contract.
<P>

<a name="30908w13.html_para5">The planned In Service Dates for Wave Knight and Wave Ruler when the contract was let were February 2001 and March 2002, respectively. Wave Knight was accepted into service in March 2003 and Wave Ruler in April 2003. The programme slippage arose as a result of shipyard loading and technical difficulties.

 University Royal Naval Units (URNUs) produce a steady flow of recruits to the Royal Navy, but the numbers are not held as a unique statistic and the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. URNUs are not primarily intended to be used as a recruiting tool but to develop in undergraduates an awareness of the need for, and role of, the Royal Navy, with the aim of fostering an understanding of the Service within society at large.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The ability of deployed personnel to maintain contact with their families is a key part of the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) which was introduced in 2001 to replace the ad hoc welfare provision which had previously varied between operations, The OWP followed a comprehensive review of operational welfare, completed in December 1999, which took into account the views of hundreds of Service personnel across a wide range of operational theatres, as well as drawing on lessons from our allies. The OWP communications package includes free use of Forces Aerogrammes ('Blueys') and electronic-Blueys, 20 minutes of publicly funded telephone calls per week and access to internet and email facilities. The Ministry of Defence recognises the need to continually keep under review its Welfare Support Policy. In light of the experience's gained on various operational deployments during the last two years the Department is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the policy. It is too early to say what the outcome will be of this review.

As part of its strategy to achieve a more flexible approach to Initial Training, ATRA is examining alternative entry routes into the Army, with relevant training to meet the Army's future needs. A number of options are under consideration at the present time, but no decision on the way forward is likely before about April of next year. Whatever the outcome, no changes to the role of Sir John Moore Barracks are envisaged for the foreseeable future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which ships his Department has used for target practice during the past five years.  [127116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has a continuous requirement to trial and evaluate, under live conditions, the operational effectiveness of its weapon systems&#151;in particular to prove their effectiveness against predicted results from modelling. As part of this requirement, the RN periodically conducts High Seas Firings (HSF) against targets, and uses the results to aid the continued tactical development of its weapons systems whilst also supporting research on survivability of current and future United Kingdom warship design and protection of personnel.
<P>

<a name="30908w14.html_para0">During the past five years, the Department has arranged one HSF using ex-HMS Sirius as the target vessel. This was conducted between 28&#150;29 September 1998. The RN also participated in two HSF exercises arranged by and at the invitation of the US Navy using ex USS Ashtabula and ex USS Wainwright on 14 October 2000 and 11 June 2002 respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his Answer of 11th July, Official Report, column 1033W, on trained personnel, what research his Department has carried out into the numbers of Royal Naval personnel who have gone absent without leave since 1995; and if he will make a statement.  [127069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 No research has been carried out since 1995 into the numbers of Royal Naval personnel who have gone absent without leave , although the reasons for absence are routinely collected and reviewed. The increase in the number of Naval Service absences since 2000 shown in my answer, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1033W of 11 July 2003 was due to a change in the arrangements for reporting absence. Until then, no warrant for arrest was issued until the eighth day of an absence, and absentees who returned before then were not formally recorded. Since 2000 a warrant has been raised and absence has been formally recorded as soon as the absence has been established. This has had the effect of increasing the number of absences formally recorded, but is not indicative of an underlying increase in unauthorised absences.

 The United Kingdom signed this Optional Protocol in September 2000 and intends to ratify it at the earliest opportunity. To be able to ratify, we need to introduce a range of new offences to ensure that we are fully compliant with the instrument. Several of these, relating to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and the sexual exploitation of children for gain, are included in the Sexual Offences Bill currently before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30908w17.html_para9">The Optional Protocol also requires the criminalisation of behaviour which does not fall within the scope of the Sexual Offences Bill, such as trafficking people with the aim of: exploiting their labour; organ transfer and illegal adoptions. These measures are being pursued separately and will also require primary legislation. It is not therefore possible to say precisely when we will be able to ratify the instrument.

 Officials in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and London have had extensive and regular contacts with large numbers of Somali civil society organisations with an interest in human rights. Without any effective central government in Somalia, and given the number of disparate armed groups, citizens' rights are routinely abused, especially in southern areas in conflict, However, the situation in Somaliland, which has a democratic government and functioning institutions, is better, with no reports of gross human rights violations.

 There are no reliable data on numbers of Somalis in refugee camps wishing to join relatives with leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Our diplomatic mission in Addis Ababa routinely receives and processes applications from Somalis wishing to settle in Britain. Nairobi suspended its processing operation for Somali settlement visas in November 2002 due to security concerns arising from the Mombasa bombing. Following a recent review, it plans to resume this service on a limited basis in the next few months.

 The Department manages a &#163;32.5 million per annum programme of financial and technical assistance to Russia and other Former Soviet Union countries to address nuclear legacy issues. It includes a number of projects to help Russia deal with Spent Nuclear Fuel from decommissioned nuclear submarines as well as contributing to their dismantlement as part of the initiative launched by G8 leaders at the Kananaskis summit in 2002. Our initial portfolio of projects was announced during President Putin's state visit to the UK in June 2003. These include the dismantlement of two nuclear submarines, the construction of a new storage facilities for Spent Nuclear Fuel, and a series of projects to assist in the eventual safe removal of Spent Nuclear Fuel from Andreeva Bay&#151;a former Russian Navy storage site for Spent Fuel from navy vessels and ice breakers. During this visit the Foreign Secretary signed a bilateral Agreement with the Russian Foreign Minister, which provides the legal cover for these projects to proceed. During the visit the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) also signed the Arctic Military Cooperation Agreement (AMEC) that will allow a number of environmental nuclear clean up projects associated with submarine dismantlement to proceed. The AMEC assistance projects will be managed and provided with financial support under the DTI managed FSU Programme. In undertaking all these projects , the Department is working closely with both the MOD and FCO together with our Moscow embassy. We plan to publish by the end of the year a detailed report setting out the achievements in establishing this programme over the past two years.

 The deal agreed by the Agriculture Council on 26 June represents a real shift in agricultural policy which will benefit developing countries as well as European farmers and taxpayers. The most important change is the de-linking of support from production, but there have also been significant changes to some commodity regimes. The reforms should connect European farmers more closely to the market and begin to reduce excessive production which results in dumping and harms developing countries, The deal will also pave the way for reforms to other EU commodity regimes and most importantly should give new momentum to the current round of WTO agriculture negotiations.

To help address these needs, we have committed &#163;4.7 million to support the humanitarian work of the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross and NGOs.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what assessment he has made of progress on the New Partnership for Africa's Development plan in southern African countries.  [128192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w24.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The New Partnership of for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is a continent-wide plan with ambitious aims of tackling poverty in the whole of Africa through increased investment, better governance and a partnership with donors based on mutual accountability. The UK fully supports the aims of NEPAD and recognises that it is a long-term plan.
<P>

<a name="30908w24.html_para0">NEPAD has made substantial progress since it was founded in 2001. 16 countries have signed up to the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a voluntary initiative to improve political, economic and corporate governance in Africa. The first reviews are due to take place later this year. NEPAD has also made progress in drawing up plans for an African Peace Keeping Capacity, and plans on priority areas including infrastructure, agriculture and environment. This progress will lead to long-term improvements in governance, peace keeping and investment in southern Africa as well as other African regions.
<P>

<a name="30908w24.html_para1">Of the southern African countries, both Mozambique and South Africa have signed up to the APRM. Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique are particularly keen supporters of NEPAD and both Presidents are on the Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee of NEPAD. NEPAD is reflected in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Regional Indicative Strategic Paper. The Government of South Africa has a NEPAD outreach programme and a NEPAD coordinating point in its Department of Foreign Affairs- it is also seeking to establish NEPAD focal points in all Ministries. NEPAD is a long-term programme, it will take time to deliver, but it is gaining increasing support across the continent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w24.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Routine immunization coverage in Nigeria reaches about 27 per cent. of children with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). Due to the poor state of routine immunization services, the Federal Government of Nigeria established in 1997 the National Programme on Immunization (NPI). The NPI has focussed on providing supplementary, door-to-door coverage with OPV using National and Sub-national Immunization Days (NIDs and SNIDs). Around 40 million doses are administered through NIDs and SNIDs every year.
<P>

<a name="30908w24.html_para3">Interruption of the transmission of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) had been achieved in 29 out of 37 states by 2001, but unfortunately the situation has again worsened, with confirmed cases in 15 states in the first half of 2003. All these states are in the north, and the south remains polio-free. Adverse propaganda by religious leaders is alienating some sections of the population from the immunization workers.
<P>

<a name="30908w24.html_para4">My Department is working with the Nigerian Government and with other international partners to meet the challenge of polio eradication in Nigeria.

In addition, we fund various technical cooperation projects, including health programmes in Lebanon.

 The UK does not have a development programme in Sao Tome and Principe. The main bilateral donors are Portugal, France, Spain and Taiwan and the principal multilateral donors are the World Bank, European Community and the African Development Bank. Most development projects focus on infrastructure, agriculture, health and education. The recent coup brought the country to a standstill for a few days.

 Exact numbers of child soldiers within the regular Ugandan Army have yet to be confirmed. We believe that the Government of Uganda is taking serious steps to address this issue. In May 2002 it ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It has reinforced army recruitment systems in an attempt to screen out underage recruits. The issue remains a problem for the auxiliary forces, although the numbers are believed to be relatively small. UNICEF, diplomatic missions (including the UK) and the Uganda Human Rights Commission have brought specific cases to the Army's attention. With UNICEF's co-operation, we understand that these children are in the process of being demobilised. We will continue to monitor this issue closely.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para2">UNICEF Uganda also estimates that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group operating in Northern Uganda, has abducted 20,400 children since 1990.

 Zimbabwe's maize crop was harvested in May. A joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission to Zimbabwe (19 June 2003) indicated that although national cereal production was considerably up on last year, a significant food gap remains.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para3">The Report estimated that cereal production for consumption in 2003&#150;04 will be 980,000 tonnes.

Production of maize, the main staple, is forecast at 803,000 tonnes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w25.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The food crisis in Zimbabwe is part of a wider crisis of economic collapse and failure of governance. There is no definitive account of the overall effect on the region. However, it is clear that the dramatic shift in Zimbabwe's fortunes from a significant exporter of food to a massive importer&#151;with the majority of its population needing food aid last year and perhaps half this year&#151;has affected food security throughout the region. Food security in other countries in the region has improved significantly following the May harvests. While this short-term progress is welcome, long-term efforts to reduce the likelihood of further food crises in Southern Africa will be unlikely to succeed without significant policy reform and economic recovery in Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para5">Long-term efforts to increase investment and build economies in Southern Africa will also be hampered so long as present Zimbabwean policies continue. There has been a significant fall in trade with Zimbabwe; increased debt arrears to its neighbours primarily by Zimbabwean state-owned enterprises; and a negative regional image to investors, which has affected levels of foreign direct investment. The poor control of foot and mouth disease now widespread in Zimbabwe has also affected Botswana and threatens South Africa. The increase in illegal trade avoiding government controls between Zimbabwe and its neighbours is an additional negative impact.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para6">The crisis is also leading to higher vulnerability to HIV infection through greater movement of people and higher levels of unsafe prostitution, and has prevented more positive measures to control this pandemic in Zimbabwe, which will impact on the region in years to come. Large-scale migration has also occurred, especially to Botswana and South Africa. This has had a negative impact in terms of the numbers, and sparsely populated Botswana's capacity to absorb such large numbers makes it especially affected. However given the relatively high levels of education of Zimbabweans, it will also have a positive impact on their economies at great cost to Zimbabwe.

 Zimbabwe's maize crop was harvested in April/May, but some parts of the country are already in need of food aid. Although the maize crop is 41 per cent. higher than last year's, this is still less than half of the 2001 crop. The Government of Zimbabwe has prepared its appeal for humanitarian assistance, but has committed few resources of its own due to the dire state of the economy. The amount of food requested from the international community is therefore greater than last year.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para7">The UN and Non-Governmental Organisations are starting to scale up feeding operations. The World Food Programme fed just over one million people in July and this has increased to 1.5 million in August. Approximately another one million are being fed by other international organisations. The UN predicts that 5.5 million people in Zimbabwe (46 per cent. of the population) will require humanitarian assistance by the end of the year. The UK government has just approved support for another &#163;8 million for food aid through organisations such as CAFOD, Save the Children and Christian Aid. This includes food aid for vulnerable groups such as farm workers, children and the chronically ill. The European Commission has also contributed euro 25 million (of which the UK share is about euro 5 million) to this year's WFP emergency appeal.
<P>

<a name="30908w25.html_para8">The UK Government, along with other development partners, is concerned that a new Government of Zimbabwe policy on NGOs could undermine the independence of NGO controlled feeding programme. The UN has already informed Zimbabwe Government that this policy is undermining contributions to this year's emergency appeal. We will be monitoring the situation on the ground carefully and will be prepared to suspend feeding programmes if there are reports of political interference in food distribution.

<a name="30908w26.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Data for revenue collected under the aggregates levy come from levy returns submitted by aggregates businesses and so do not include information on different types of aggregate exploited. These data are recorded for the UK as a whole and are not separately available for Northern Ireland. Revenue forecasts for the aggregates levy are also made for the UK as a whole, and not by region. Revenue raised by the aggregates levy in 2002&#150;03 is published in Table 2.1D of Financial Statistics, June 2003, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. Revenue forecasts for 2003&#150;04 are given in Table C8 of this year's Financial Statement and Budge Report (HC 500).
<P>

The findings will help to inform policy relating to the levy in Northern Ireland.

While it is important to maintain a level of deterrence at all locations&#151;both at high-traffic, high-risk ports or airports, and at smaller, lower-risk locations&#151;Customs cannot provide an effective detection capability nor any meaningful deterrence with small numbers of staff on regular and predictable rotas. Flexible, mobile teams can be deployed in larger numbers and with greater impact.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what value he attributed in pence per litre to <i>(a)</i> carbon dioxide saving, <i>(b)</i> improved local air quality, <i>(c)</i> diversity of supply and <i>(d)</i> economic development benefits in calculating duty rebates for (i) LPG and (ii) biodiesel and bioethanol.  [127190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w28.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government offers lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits of the fuel in question, but they also take account of other factors, such as costs of production and supply, and wider social and economic benefits, including fuel security and the potential to encourage the recycling of waste products. In the light of all these factors, we have set a duty incentive of 20 pence per litre in the case of biodiesel and bioethanol. For road fuel gases the incentives, when converted from pence per kilogram to the equivalent pence per litre, are 39.72 pence per litre for natural gases and 40.42 pence per litre for liquefied petroleum gas.
<P>

<a name="30908w28.html_para0">It would not, however, be appropriate to compare the duty incentive for biofuels with those for road fuel gases. The latter are directed predominantly at improvement in local air quality rather than as a carbon saving measure. They also face significant market barriers: they require a dedicated and separate re-fuelling infrastructure and vehicles have to be converted or be specifically designed to use gaseous fuels. In contrast, incentives for biofuels are focused on climate change issues and greenhouse gas reductions. Biofuel blends can be supplied through the existing re-fuelling infrastructure and used in existing vehicles.

 The Education Act 1996 places a duty on all local education authorities in England to provide, on request, free school meals to eligible pupils. A similar duty is transferred to the governing body of all maintained schools in England that have a budgetary element for school meals delegated to them. Children whose parents receive the following support payments are entitled to receive free school meals: income support; income based jobseekers allowance; support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; child tax credit, provided they do not receive working tax credit and have an annual income, as assessed by the Inland Revenue, that does not exceed &#163;13,230.

<P>
<a name="30908w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Regulations introduced in April 2001, set minimum nutritional standards for school lunches in maintained schools in England. The standards are based on the four main food groups pictorially represented in the Government's 'Balance of Good Health' diagram, which suggests the types and proportions of foods that make up a balanced diet. Food from the four groups: fruit and vegetables; meat, fish and non-dairy sources of proteins; starchy food; and milk and dairy, are required to be available in schools at lunchtime and allow pupils to choose healthy and enjoyable school lunches. It is the responsibility of local education authorities or, where a budgetary element for school meals is delegated to them, a school's governing body to ensure that the standards are met. School governing bodies and LEAs (as the employer) have a general responsibility for protecting the health and safety of staff and pupils. This responsibility would extend to the quality of school meals.

 Local authority youth services receive funding through the Education Formula Spending (EFS). This fund has a value of &#163;513 million in 2003&#150;04 and is an increase of 5.9 per cent. over 2002&#150;03 budgets. In addition to EFS funds, the Government has made &#163;10 million available to local authority youth services in each of the three years 2003&#150;06 through the Transforming Youth Work Development Fund (TYWDF). With this resource, we want to see Local Authorities making good quality youth work provision available to all young people in the 13&#150;19 age range. Many schools and Local Education Authorities (LEAs) offer learning activities after school as part of their study support provision. Funding for study support of &#163;75 million is available this year through Standards Fund grant 206. National Voluntary Youth Organisations (NVYOs) receive funding to promote personal and social education. The NVYO Grant Scheme is a three year cycle of funding. There are 88 NVYOs running 98 projects which receive grants in the current cycle (2002&#150;05) within a total budget of &#163;18 million (&#163;6 million a year). The grants cover up to 50 per cent. of the cost of the projects.

<a name="30908w30.html_para6">Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) aims to provide developmental and diversionary activities for 8&#150;19 year olds from 2003 to 2006. It is supported by Departments and Agencies across Government providing funding allocations into a single pot. The total funding available for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;25 million. Funding for years two and three will be confirmed within the next two months.

 Provisional statistics on teacher and support staff numbers and teacher vacancies at January 2003 were published in April in "Statistical First Release 10/2003". Statistics due to be released on 9 September will provide regional and LEA level breakdowns of these figures; provisional national figures for January 2004 are due to be published next April. In May this year, in response to concerns about the difficulties some schools are facing as a result of changes to the funding arrangements, my Department liaised with local education authorities (LEAs) to make a broad assessment of the extent to which schools were making changes in their teaching staff complements. This included whether teachers were being made compulsorily redundant, and the possible reasons for changes in staffing, including falling rolls. LEAs' assessments were based on the best information available to them at that time; many told us that definitive information was not available and that the situation was changing rapidly as schools finalised their budgets and their staffing. In addition they advised that a significant number of the redundancy notices were "protective" and were likely to be withdrawn as the situation within schools and the LEA became clearer. My Department will continue to work closely with our national partners, including representatives of teachers, and have regular contact with LEAs.

 My Department makes available an annual grant which funds UFI's infrastructure and operating costs such as product development. In 2003&#150;04 UFI has set aside &#163;23.636 million to cover administration costs and &#163;1.818 million to cover buildings costs. UFI does not allocate separate local funds for either administration or buildings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures will be taken to provide broadband access to schools in areas where there is no broadband provision.  [127090]<P>
<P>

<a name="30908w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Broadband is currently being rolled out through 10 Regional Broadband Consortia (RBCs). Each RBC is developing appropriate connectivity solutions for their area to ensure the Prime Minister's target of having all schools connected to broadband by 2006 is achieved.
<P>

<a name="30908w31.html_para12">Where cabling infrastructure is not available, RBCs are successfully deploying a range of other technologies to ensure schools have access to reliable, high bandwidth connectivity. In a number of rural areas for example, wireless technologies such as Satellite and radio are being used effectively to connect schools.
<P>

<a name="30908w31.html_para13">The DfES is also supporting the Government's Broadband Aggregation Project announced in July. From next April, nine Regional Aggregation Bodies will aggregate demand and procure broadband across the public sector. This will ensure best value and stimulate supply in areas where very little broadband is currently available.

The figures on children's day care facilities up to and including 2001 were derived from local authority estimates returned to DfES by local authority social service departments.
<P>

<a name="30908w32.html_para2">The period from September 2001 to March 2003 was designated as a transitional period where Ofsted, as a by-product of its inspections, validated the actual number of individuals and organisations that were providing child care. At the end of the transitional period, Ofsted conducted appropriate quality checks on its administrative database and released the number of provider and places in June, with further publications planned on a quarterly basis. The number of child care providers and places are not directly comparable with the previous data made available by the DfES because they were collected differently.

 By the end of the 2003&#150;04 academic year there will be 12 Academies open. These will cater for an estimated total of 10,710 pupils.

 Of the 12 Academies currently open or opening this September the mean average expenditure across the projects is &#163;23.10 million; &#163;21.31 million from the public sector and &#163;1.79 million from private sector investors.

 In January 2003 there were more than 225,000 full-time equivalent support staff in schools in England including 122,000 teaching assistants, compared to 217,000 (including 106,000 teaching assistants) in January 2002. Statistics due to be released on 9 September will provide regional and LEA level breakdowns of these figures. It is for individual schools to decide on staffing levels in the light of their needs and priorities and the overall resources available to them. It is estimated that funding being made available to schools should enable them to recruit at least 50,000 additional full-time equivalent support staff over the lifetime of the current Parliament.

 Meetings of the Socrates committee are attended by delegates drawn from the 30 participating states of the 15 European Union countries, the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, the 10 acceding countries, Romania and Bulgaria. Usually two officials of the Department for Education and Skills attend the committee.

<a name="30908w33.html_para19">The role of the Socrates committee is to oversee the powers delegated to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers to implement the Socrates programme. The committee's business is largely concerned with the technical details of the programme operation, such as project selection for programme support, publicity, information and budget allocation. In common with other Comitology committees its decisions are not routinely deposited for scrutiny under established scrutiny procedures, unless they are politically significant.
<P>

<a name="30908w33.html_para20">Together with member states, the Commission has been conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of Comitology committees into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to "simplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission".

 This Department supports the provision of free and paid for milk in maintained schools and encourages schools and local education authorities to offer it to pupils. Guidance produced to assist schools to implement regulations, which set nutritional standards for school lunches includes a strong recommendation from the Secretary of State that drinking milk is available to all pupils as an option every day. Following a 20 per cent. reduction in the EU subsidy on school milk from January 2001, this Department agreed jointly with the Department of Health and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to top up the annual &#163;1.5 million shortfall. This assistance helps prevent possible increased costs of providing school milk.

 There has been very considerable growth in allocations to further education colleges. In the 2003&#150;04 academic year, a total of &#163;2,072 million was allocated for 16&#150;18 year olds, &#163;1,828 million for adult learning (including adult basic skills) and &#163;321 million for Additional Learning Support. This represents increases of &#163;284 million (16 per cent.), &#163;181 million (11 per cent.), and &#163;37 million (13 per cent.) respectively above the comparable allocations for 2002&#150;03.

<a name="30908w34.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The measures set out in Success for All will reward those colleges which meet their targets for student success and provide clear incentives for colleges to improve their performance in this respect. Floor targets have set clear expectations about minimum acceptable performance levels and these will drive up performance in colleges and providers whose learners currently have the lowest chance of securing the qualifications for which they are aiming. Through their agreed three year development plans, colleges and providers will set out their plans for improving student services and teaching standards. These approaches will benefit all learners, helping ensure more learners receive a high quality learning experience. In particular, they will benefit learners enrolled with colleges and providers whose performance is least good and this will enhance equality of opportunity for learners.

<a name="30908w34.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The additional cost in employers' national insurance contributions in 2003&#150;04 for all further education institutions in England is estimated to be &#163;25 million. Further education institutions receive funding for staff costs from a variety of sources, both public and private, so the element of the increase to be covered from public sources will be only a proportion of this. In 2003&#150;04 assumed total funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council will increase by 6 per cent. in real terms compared with 2002&#150;03. This places further education colleges in a good position to meet cost increases and invest in improving services for learners and employers.
<P>

<a name="30908w34.html_para4">The likely cost of the increase in national insurance contributions in future years depends on a number of variables including the number of staff employed and the level of their pay.

 In 2002&#150;03 Further Education colleges were allocated &#163;142 million pounds for the Teaching Pay Initiative, and &#163;53 million for the staff development component of the Standards Fund. These funds were consolidated into participation funding for the academic year 2003&#150;04 and the funding rate was increased by 3.5 per cent. to reflect this. Colleges will receive &#163;138 million from the 3.5% increase. A further &#163;50 million will be allocated to some colleges to meet the costs of implementing increased funding for colleges with high area costs and disadvantage factors, and to fund additional participation through pilots such as those in adult skills and partnerships for progression in 2003&#150;4.

The real terms increase in the participation unit of funding, together with the consolidation of previously targeted funds and three year funding agreement, are what colleges were calling for. They give colleges more control over the funds allocated to them and a longer term planning horizon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what average increase expressed in real terms he estimates further education colleges will receive in 2003&#150;04 for <i>(a)</i> growth in participation and <i>(b)</i> other funding increases (i) in total funding and (ii) after discounting actual Teacher Pay Initiative and staff development allocations for 2002&#150;03, the additional costs of employers contributions to the Teachers Pension Scheme from April 2003 and the additional costs arising from the increase in employers national insurance contributions from April 2003; and if he will make a statement.

 The real terms increase in assumed total funding for further education allocated to the Learning and Skills Council for 2003&#150;04 is 6 per cent. compared with 2002&#150;03. This increase excludes the additional funding of &#163;80 million made available to compensate colleges for an increase in the employer contribution rate arising from technical changes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme. It includes funding for additional student numbers.
<P>

<a name="30908w34.html_para10">We estimate that funding available for participation will increase by around 7 per cent. in real terms. This includes funding for additional student numbers. We estimate that funding available for non-participation budgets for purposes such as investment to raise standards and improve the capital infrastructure will

increase by 3 per cent. in real terms. These figures exclude the impact of the transfer in 2003&#150;04 of funding in respect of the Teaching Pay Initiative and staff development from the non-participation baseline into the participation baseline.
<P>

<a name="30908w34.html_para11">We estimate that the costs of the increase in employers' national insurance contributions and of the additional increase in employers' contributions to the Teachers Pension Scheme as a result of the latest actuarial revaluation, represents around 0.7 per cent. of the value of total funding, or around 0.8 per cent. of the value of funding for participation.
<P>

<a name="30908w34.html_para12">The real terms increases in funding for colleges in 2003&#150;04 place them in a good position to meet cost increases and invest in improving services for learners and employers.

 Between 1990 and 2002, 107 Jean Monnet Chairs in UK universities were approved. Chairs are co-financed, with the European Commission providing up to 80 per cent. of the eligible costs and remaining costs paid for by the host universities. Up to 1999, the maximum level of European Commission financing for a Jean Monnet Chair was euro 60,000 for a 3-year period. Between 2000&#150;02 it was euro 30,000.

 We have achieved the best ever primary school test results in mathematics. In the 2003 Key Stage 2 tests 73 per cent. of 11 year olds achieved the expected level in mathematics, a 14 percentage point increase since 1998.

 The Secretary of State's statement of 17 July on school funding said that the Standards Fund would be maintained and inflation-proofed at 2003&#150;04 levels. The level of Standards Fund allocations will therefore be guaranteed separately. The guaranteed minimum per pupil increase will refer to school budget shares, excluding the part funded through the Learning and Skills Council, for which separate arrangements will be in place as outlined in the statement. The Department is working with local education authorities on the methodology for the guarantee, and aim to issue draft regulations and guidance during the autumn.

<P>

<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The aim of elected assemblies is to ensure that regional functions are carried out effectively and better reflect the needs of the region. Assemblies will also play an important role in supporting delivery of the Department's skills agenda, including ensuring coherence between national, regional and local level. Central to this will be its role in appointing two members to each of the Boards of the local Learning and Skills Councils in its region. It will also be consulted on other appointments; and on the LSC's guidance and plans for learning and skills development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Teachers employed on contracts of a month or more are defined as regular teachers. Teachers employed on contracts of less than a month are defined as occasional teachers. Information has been collected on this basis since the 1960s on the Annual Survey of Teachers in Service and Teacher Vacancies (Form 618G).
<P>

<a name="30908w36.html_para0">The Department has used regular teachers as its standard definition for the number of teachers in the maintained sector for most purposes since 2000. This provides a stable measure of teacher numbers that is not affected by the relatively large year-on-year fluctuations in the demand for occasional teachers. The number of occasional teachers rose markedly between January 1999 and January 2001 and then fell in both 2002 and 2003. Both regular and occasional teacher numbers continue to be provided in official publications.

<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Section 50(7) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 provides that the governors of a school do not incur any personal liability in managing a delegated budget, provided they act in good faith. It does not appear to the Government that ordinarily the decision of a governing body to set a deficit budget is an act of bad faith such that individual governors would lose the protection of corporate status, and potentially be personally liable. However, such issues clearly turn on their own particular circumstances; and relevant matters would include whether members had conscientiously considered the relevant facts and circumstances, and had not knowingly misled the local education authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 This government aims to improve school laboratories in line with the recommendations of Sir Gareth Roberts report in 2002 on the supply of scientists, so that there are no unsatisfactory laboratories by the end of this spending review period in 2005&#150;06, and all school laboratories are good or excellent by 2010. Capital funding available for investment in school buildings, including in laboratories, is 3.8 billion this year, and it will rise to over &#163;5 billion by 2005&#150;06. Most of this funding is allocated by formula to schools and to local education authorities so that they can invest in their school buildings in line with priorities determined locally through a rigorous, transparent and consultative asset management planning process, which reflects local needs and government aims. Guidance to schools and local education authorities on capital funding reflects its aim to improve school laboratories.

 The Department seeks to keep abreast of all research and evaluation of standards and practice in literacy and numeracy. On standards in England, the most comprehensive studies have been the evaluations of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies by Ofsted and by the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, which found that the Strategies have had a significant impact on the standards attained and on the quality of teaching in primary schools. On international comparisons, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study found that children in England are among the most able readers in the world at the age of 10. England was ranked third of the 35 countries involved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in what exceptional circumstances local authorities will be free to passport less than the full increase in schools formula spending share to schools.  [127927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew13"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's statement of 17 July on school funding made clear the Government's expectation that "barring wholly exceptional circumstances, each and every LEA should 'passport' the full increase in its Schools Formula Spending Share (SPSS) into a matching increase in the Schools Budget". In considering whether or not to use his reserve power to set a minimum schools budget for the following financial year for any LEA proposing not to passport, the Secretary of State will consider all relevant circumstances including the reasons put forward by the LEA. He has made no pre-judgment on what would be considered exceptional. The current expectation is that every authority will passport and the Government will ensure that every local authority receives sufficient central Government grant to "passport" in full the increase in SPSS into its Schools Budget.

<P>
<a name="30908w36.html_spnew14"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State said in his statement on school funding of 17 July stated that local education authorities and schools will work together through their Schools Forums to agree the funding baseline to which the guaranteed per pupil increase will be applied. We aim to issue guidance and draft regulations on this during the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w37.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 There are no plans to reassess the provision for field work within science GCSE or A-level. The existing science National Curriculum at Key Stages 1&#150;4, together with current GCSE and A-level syllabuses, encourages field work; there is also a pilot at A-level which places particular emphasis on it. Additionally, all primary and secondary schools are required to make provision for fieldwork for all pupils as part of the Geography curriculum. The Department does not collect information centrally about the provision of science or biology field work opportunities for pupils.
<P>

<a name="30908w37.html_para0">No assessment has been made of the implications for environmental awareness of access to field work as part of the biology curriculum. "Growing Schools" encourages schools to use the 'outdoor classroom' as a resource in all subjects including science.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is his policy that increases in schools formula spending share made in 2003&#150;04 to reflect the removal of standards funds will be reversed to reflect the restoration of standards funds in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.  [127925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w37.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The restoration of the standards funds in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 are a separate issue from the transfer of funding to schools formula spending share in 2003&#150;04. Therefore the restoration of standards fund in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 will have no effect on the level of the schools formula spending share for those years.

We also plan rigorous new excellence criteria for progression, and to cash-limit resources to a level that will find progression at about a third of those eligible in September 2004. We have asked the STRB to make recommendations in November so that schools can better plan their budgets for 2004&#150;05.

Statistics due to be released on 9 September will provide regional and LEA level breakdowns of these figures; provisional national figures for January 2004 are due to be published next April. In May this year, in response to concerns about the difficulties some schools are facing as a result of changes to the funding arrangements, my Department liaised with local education authorities (LEAs) to make a broad assessment of the extent to which schools were making changes in their teaching staff complements. This included whether teachers were being made compulsorily redundant, and the possible reasons for changes in staffing, including falling rolls. LEAs' assessments were based on the best information available to them at that time; many told us that definitive information was not available and that the situation was changing rapidly as schools finalised their budgets and their staffing. In addition they advised that a significant number of the redundancy notices were 'protective' and were likely to be withdrawn as the situation within schools and the LEA became clearer. My Department will continue to work closely with our national partners, including representatives of teachers, and have regular contact with LEAs.

their age by the end of Key Stage 2, plus targeted local support to schools and LEAs on addressing under-performance. Further measures being introduced this September, such as the Primary Leadership Programme, are also designed to tackle lower attainment. Evidence of the impact of our programmes is reflected in the Key Stage 2 results. The 2003 results show that 75 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the expected level for their age in English and 73 per cent. in maths. This represents a 10 percentage point increase in English and a 14 percentage point increase in maths since 1998.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para0">We are using a similar model to address under-performance for pupils aged 11&#150;14 through the Key Stage 3 Strategy. There are tailored support programmes in each of the three years at Key Stage 3 to help lower-attaining pupils reach the expected level at age 14. We are also targeting schools and LEAs that we believe would benefit from additional support. After only the first full year of the Strategy, the Key Stage 3 tests results stand at their best ever, Maths is up by three percentage points to 70 per cent. achieving level 5 (the expected level) and science and English are both up by one percentage point to 68 per cent.. There have also been improvements in level 6 attainment of four and seven percentage points in maths and science respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w38.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Unions have a key role in promoting learning and skills in the workplace, and to help them achieve this, the Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1998. The Union Learning Fund is now in its sixth year and has supported over 400 projects from over 50 different unions, working in almost 3,000 workplaces. Many Union Learning Fund projects are specifically aimed at widening participation in learning: basic skills, social inclusion and equal opportunities and improving access to learning. Evaluation up to 2002, together with performance management data for July 2003, has shown that over 36,000 people have completed learning courses, over 6,500 Union Learning Representatives have been trained and around 180 new learning centres have been opened. Unions have been very successful in engaging non-traditional learners including older males and shift workers.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para2">One of the Union Learning Fund's greatest strengths is the success of Union Learning Representatives, a new type of lay union representative whose main function is to advise union members about their training and development needs. Union Learning Representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly the lowest skilled and 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 151W</I><P>
those with literacy and numeracy problems. They share a level of trust with union members who would be embarrassed about admitting their learning needs to their employer.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para3">Following a consultation exercise in 2001, we introduced legislation to give Union Learning Representatives the same rights to paid time off for training and for carrying out their duties as those enjoyed by shop stewards and other union representatives at workplaces where a union is recognised for collective bargaining purposes. The legislation on Union Learning Representatives came into effect on 27 April along with the revised ACAS Code of Practice.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para4">Additional funding for Union Learning for the next two financial years, announced in the last budget, will help us continue to build on the positive contribution made by Union Learning Representatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on measures to ensure that qualifications offered at apprenticeship, skilled craft and technician level are sufficient to meet the needs of business.  [128207]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government published its national Skills Strategy on 9 July in 21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential. It is a cross-Government strategy that sets out our approach to meeting skill needs, including making sure that qualifications are appropriate to the needs of businesses. There were frequent discussions between the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry during its development, and was a co-signatory to the White Paper published in July. This close involvement will continue in the implementation stage.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para5">At the heart of the strategy is a shared aim that learning programmes and the qualifications that accredit them will respond fully to the skill needs of employers. DTI are closely involved in the joint remit for improving vocational qualifications which is being taken forward by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Learning and Skills Council and Sector Skills Development Agency. The high profile, business-led Modern Apprenticeship Task Force is taking a key role in promoting Modern Apprenticeships to employers, improving their quality and increasing take-up. Sir Robin Young, DTI Permanent Secretary, is a member of the Task Force. A close working relationship is also being established with DTI in promoting the development of foundation degrees to meet the growing demand for skills at the higher technical and associate professional level. The White Paper also set out the intention for the DTI to be joint sponsors of the Sector Skills Development Agency. All of this action

<P>
<P>

 While we compare well at higher education level, our percentage of the workforce qualified to intermediate skill levels (based upon qualifications gained at apprenticeship, skilled craft and technician level) is low: 28 per cent. in the UK compared to 51 per cent. in France and 65 per cent. in Germany. An EU wide comparison is not available.

<a name="30908w38.html_para6">However, using a different measure the OECD estimates the proportion of adults (aged 25&#150;64) who are qualified to upper secondary level (intermediate level education and based upon the highest level of education completed) in the UK is 63 per cent.. This is similar to France (64 per cent.) and the Netherlands (61 per cent.) but much lower than Germany (83 per cent.), Denmark (80 per cent.) or Sweden (81 per cent.).

<P>
<a name="30908w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that the work based learning route, and the qualifications and programmes within it (notably Modern Apprenticeships) will continue to deliver high quality, innovative provision, derived from and appropriate to the needs of the UK's industry and economy. The Government have detailed their vision for achievement in the recently published White Papers covering the development of 14&#150;19 year olds and the Skills Strategy for 21st Century. These reveal the importance the Government are giving to vocational development from school to the workplace and the need for cohesion between education and the world of work to achieve the challenging target outlined in the reports. The Government launched a Modern Apprenticeship (MA) Task Force, chaired by Sir Roy Gardner, in February 2003 to oversee and steer the promotion and integration of modern apprenticeships, including vocational qualifications, into the workplace. This Task Force will report regularly to Government on progress widening the choice for young people to take up modern apprenticeship opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30908w38.html_para7">Connexions, the Government's front line support service for young people in England aged 13&#150;19, offers teenagers integrated impartial advice and guidance on career paths and access to personal development opportunities based on the needs and aspirations of young people. This service enables young people to consider a full range of career options and make informed choices which include work-based provision.

 The Royal College of Physicians published their report 'Allergy the unmet need, A Blueprint for better patient care' on 25 June 2003. Their report refers to the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and British Allergy Foundation (BAF) respectively, who compiled a list of national health service allergy clinics which were NHS consultant-led and based at NHS hospitals in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30908w40.html_para5">The subsequent BSACI handbook "National NHS Allergy Clinics" (2001) lists 86 NHS consultant led clinics in the UK. There were an additional 15 clinics run by NHS consultants identified by the British Allergy Foundation (BAF) in the handbook.

 The National Health Service vacancy survey collects information on the number of posts which trusts are actively trying to fill which have been vacant for three months or more. As at 31 March 2003, there was one three month consultant vacancy in allergy in England.

 The information requested is not centrally collected. Waiting list data are collected according to the type of specialist the patient is due to see and therefore the number of allergy sufferers waiting for treatment are not separately identifiable as they may be included in a range of specialist waiting lists. However, all patients for consultant led hospital treatment, including those with allergies, are benefiting from shorter maximum waiting times.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w42.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Many people with autism also have a learning disability and may make use of learning disability day care services. Where people on the autistic spectrum have mental health problems, they may find mental health day care services helpful. Adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may ask statutory services for an assessment of their social functioning and communications skills in order to establish their level of need.

<a name="30908w42.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Learning Disability White Paper, "Valuing People" (Cm 5086), published in March 2001, details training and qualification requirements for staff working with adults and children who have both autism and learning disability. It states that, from April 2002, all new entrants to learning disability care services should be registered for qualification on the learning disability awards framework (LDAF) and that by 2005, 50 per cent. of front-line staff should have achieved at least National Vocational Qualification Level 2.
<P>

<a name="30908w42.html_para0">The LDAF contains two vocational qualifications&#151;a level 2 certificate and a level 3 certificate in working with people with learning disabilities. Both these certificates include a module about autism. The LDAF modules can be used as part of the induction and foundation training that new care staff should undertake.
<P>

<a name="30908w42.html_para1">Parent carers of autistic children receive help from local authorities (under section 17 of The Children Act) and the National Health Service on how best they can support their child. This could include skills training, both on an individual basis and in groups. Much of this support is provided in partnership with parents in their own homes and takes into account the family's individual circumstances. Other support available includes the National Autistic Society's "Help" programme, which offers training to parents in caring for their newly diagnosed autistic children. The Government helped to fund the development of this programme.
<P>

<a name="30908w42.html_para2">Carers of people with autism may be employed by local authorities, local or national voluntary sector organisations such as the National Autistic Society and the Disabilities Trust or private sector care providers. The wage levels of paid carers are a matter for individual employers and would take account of the grade and experience of the individual staff.

 We have no plans to commission an economic analysis of the costs associated with autism. A paper on this subject in 2001 by Jarbrink and Knapp ("Autism" Vol 5(1) pp 7&#150;22) gives estimates of the costs of autism and points up the long-term cost-effectiveness of early interventions. Early diagnosis and early intervention are key issues being addressed as part of the development of the children's national service framework (NSF), which will set national standards for health and social services departments. We have already announced that autism will be used as an exemplar in the NSF. This is being informed by the National Autism Plan for Children which was published in March.

 There is an association between parents falling asleep in bed with their babies and the tragic occurrence of cot death. The Department has issued guidance which addresses this hazard, details of which are available at http://www.doh.gov.uk/cotdeath/. There is also the possibility that an adult may roll over while asleep and smother their baby, or that the baby might fall from the bed and so be injured.

 High blood pressure&#151;hypertension&#151;is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease and other illnesses such as kidney disease and aortic aneurysm.
<P>

<a name="30908w42.html_para3">Blood pressure is part of the core data collected each year by the Health Survey for England.

Publication of the report for the 2002 survey is expected at the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="30908w42.html_para4">In order to increase public awareness of hypertension and its attendant risks, as well as the importance of prevention and early detection, the Department of Health provided funding in 2002 for the Blood Pressure Association's "National Blood Pressure Testing Week". With 100,000 people tested at 1,350 blood pressure testing stations nation-wide, the purpose of the campaign is to raise public awareness of high blood pressure and encourage everyone to know their own blood pressure numbers. The Department of Health is also supporting the 3rd National Blood Pressure Testing Week (15&#150;21 September 2003).

 The Department of Health contributes &#163;1 million annually to support a national programme of Sexual Health and HIV research which informs our work to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The current programme does not include specific research into links between HIV and AIDS awareness and the incidence of chlamydia, although we do know that the widespread HIV prevention campaigns of the 1980s did lead to a reduction in the prevalence of many other STIs. Our

regular surveys which measure the impact of the Teenage Pregnancy campaign, also provide data on the awareness of STIs among young people.

 The planning and priorities framework, "Improving, Expansion and Reform", which sets out priorities for the next three years for the national health service, includes a target for practice based registers to ensure that patients with, or at high risk of, coronary heart disease and diabetes receive appropriate care and treatment in line with national service framework standards, including advice on diet, physical activity and smoking. Patients at risk of coronary heart disease include those with hypertension, diabetes and who are obese.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w44.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. The Department of Health does not monitor or gather statistics on the management of clinical records in National Health Service hospitals and trusts and consequently has no record of numbers of files temporarily missing or lost.
<P>

<a name="30908w44.html_para6">Each NHS trust and strategic health authority is legally responsible for managing its own records and complying with legislation and guidance relating to the clinical data they collect on patients.
<P>

<a name="30908w44.html_para7">In the NHS, guidance and governance arrangements have been designed to assure compliance with law and good practice, while minimising the overheads of managing and auditing detailed procedures. Independent authorities, such as the Audit Commission, Health Service Commissioner and Information Commissioner, oversee the governance arrangements and may impose sanctions where there is a significant failure to comply.

 The closure of Community Health Councils (CHCs) was first announced in the NHS Plan in July 2000. Since then, this subject has formed part of the discussions Ministers have had with CHC staff and members as part of various visits around the country and there have been meetings with Stakeholder groups, including the Association of Community Health Council in England and Wales and trades unions.

 I met with trade unions representing Community Health Council (CHC) staff on 16 July to discuss staffing issues and also received feedback from a meeting held recently with key stakeholders, including CHC staff, members of the Association of Community Health Councils of England and Wales, the Council for Patient and Public Involvement in Health and the trades unions.
<P>

<a name="30908w44.html_para8">Officials have worked with the trade unions and a revised human resources framework for CHC staff was issued on 25 July. This document, which was jointly with Unison and Amicus-MSF, covers not only the issue of redundancy but also the support and advice that is available to CHC staff to help them secure alternative posts within the National Health Service. It is hoped that this will address some of the concerns and anxieties raised.

 To date, no Community Health Councils (CHCs) have had to leave their premises specifically because of the decision to keep CHCs operational until 1 December. However, it is estimated that about 56 CHCs will need to leave their current premises before the abolition date for reasons including the cost of extending the lease arrangements where previous notice had been given. Decisions will be based on local circumstances and suitable alternative arrangements will be discussed with local CHC staff and members.

 Nationally representative figures on the prevalence of heart disease and its risk factors are available from the Health Survey for England. Although the definition of coronary heart disease as such is not used in the Health Survey for England, the survey reports the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease which is defined as ever having angina or a heart attack, confirmed by a doctor. The most recent estimates of the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease were published in "The Health Survey for England&#151;Cardiovascular Disease 1998", table 2.2, a copy of which is available in the Library.

 The Department of Health, working with the Food Standards Agency and other partners, is taking a range of measures to improve people's diets. The following measures specifically relate to deprivation.
<P>

<a name="30908w46.html_para4">The lottery-funded New Opportunities Fund is providing &#163;10 million over two years to support "Five-a Day" community initiatives led in 66 of the most deprived primary care trusts.

 District nurses have an important contribution to make in improving health and health care. The implementation of policies to improve access, promote earlier discharge from hospital and the national service framework for older people require district nurses and others to develop their roles. To support their development I launched a strategy for nursing in primary care, in November 2002. 'Liberating the Talents: helping nurses and PCTs deliver the NHS plan' provides a framework for district nurses and other primary care nurses, for developing their roles based on the needs of patients. Workshops on implementing 'Liberating the Talents' have been held for all primary care trusts in England. It is for PCTs to determine locally how to maximise the role of nurses in delivering Government priorities.

 A joint press release was issued by the National Health Service Appointments Commission and the North West London Strategic Health Authority on 26 June 2003 announcing resignations from the board of the Ealing Hospital Trust. This stated that the chair and three non-executive directors were standing down because of a break down in relationships, and to make it easier for an independent review of corporate governance systems at the trust to be carried out by the trust's auditors. A caretaker chair is now in post and the three non-executive positions have been advertised.

<a name="30908w47.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The majority of laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors takes place in private hospitals, which are regulated by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC), which is currently monitoring developments in this area. Providers of laser eye surgery are required to be registered with the NCSC and to keep records for inspection by the NCSC of each surgical procedure undertaken, including accidents or adverse events. Service providers are subject to annual inspection by the NCSC.
<P>

<a name="30908w47.html_para11">The National Health Service does not routinely provide laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors. However, it is considered when a specific clinical need could justify its use. Examples could include adjustment of the refractive error of one eye to make it similar to the other <i>(a)</i> condition known as anisometropia) or patients shown to be severely depressed by the need to wear glasses (and where contact lenses are contra-indicated). These are rare occurrences and are evaluated on an individual patient basis.

 Since its inception the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has operated under the three guiding principles of putting the consumer first, being open and accessible and being an independent voice. To do this effectively the FSA consults widely before making recommendations, unless urgent action is required, and engages with a plethora of stakeholders as part of its general policy-making process. It uses a wide range of consultative methods such as open/public meetings, specific stakeholder meetings, focus groups, standing consultative groups and questionnaire-based surveys. For formal written consultations, the FSA has published 331 on its website since its establishment in April 2000: 46 between April to December 2000, 80 in 2001, 128 in 2002 and 77 between January to July 2003.

 The Secretary of State has overall responsibility for the National Health Service. The Secretary of State sets the strategic vision for the health service, distributes resources to the NHS, sets the national tariff and will set national standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the average length of time GPs in England spent with their patients in individual consultations in the last 12 months.  [127454]<P>

<P>
<a name="30908w49.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The data are not collected either routinely or by health authority.
<P>

<a name="30908w49.html_para2">Under the new general medical services contract, which will be introduced from 1 April 2004, length of consultation is one of the indicators within the quality and outcomes framework. Practices will be able to increase earnings if they provide appointments and consultations which equal or exceed the times specified in the framework.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w49.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The vast majority of the population is registered with a general practitioner. At 30 September 2002 (the latest published data), 8,122,456 people were recorded as registered with a GP or with a provider of personal medical services (PMS) in the areas covered by the five London strategic health authorities. In England, 51,552,391 people were recorded as registered with a GP or a provider of PMS.
<P>

<a name="30908w49.html_para3">However, these figures are greater than their respective population figures. Therefore, it is not possible to express accurately the percentages of the population that are covered. This is due to "list inflation". This arises where a patient moves his or her registration and for a transitional period may be registered on two lists. Similarly, an individual who dies or moves outside London and/or England may remain on a list for a time.

<a name="30908w49.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan set a target of recruiting an additional 2,000 general practitioners (GPs) between 1999 and 2004. A range of measures have been put in place to increase GP recruitment:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The number of GP registrars has increased from 1,340 in 1997 to 2,070 in March 2003 providing a substantial increase in the number of qualified GPs.
<P>
<BR>
The GP Returner Scheme launched in November 2002 provides a clear, supported route back into general practice. Under the scheme returning GPs receive paid, individually tailored refresher training (full- or part-time) a dedicated return co-ordinator with whom they meet regularly, and a contribution towards their professional expenses.
<P>
<BR>
The Golden Hello Scheme offers up to &#163;5,000 to new GPs or those returning to practice from the Retainer Scheme, with up to a further &#163;7,000 if they take up post in an area designated as under-doctored. On 29 November 2002 the scheme was extended to qualified doctors who are not currently working in national health service general practice who return to take up an NHS post.
<P>
<BR>
In November 2002 the Flexible Careers Scheme, which only applied to hospital doctors, was extended to offer GPs new options to work more flexibly, to work part-time and to give them a route back to practice when they want to return to the NHS.
<P>
<BR>
The NHS Delayed Retirement Scheme (formerly Golden Goodbye Scheme) which pays &#163;2,000 per year to GPs between the ages of 60 and 64 inclusive who continue to work in a substantive primary care post.
<P>
<BR>
Increased funding for locum cover for family doctors for maternity, paternity and adoptive leave.
<P>
<BR>
A &#163;22 million training package to increase the number of GP trainers and training practices.
<P>
<BR>
A &#163;55 million package to improve primary care premises in deprived parts of the country including new premises to train and employ more GPs.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30908w49.html_para4">Alongside these initiatives there is the new general medical services contract, which will provide GPs with the opportunities and funding to improve their working lives by allowing them to opt out of providing out-of-hours arrangements and additional services. This will make it easier for them to work flexibly and move in and out of salaried and independent contractor status and enable a new portfolio approach to career development which will make it easier for GPs to adapt their career to suit their aspirations.
<P>

<a name="30908w49.html_para5">We are now starting to see significant increases in the number of GPs. In the six months to 31 March 2003, GP numbers grew by 500. 1,240 of the NHS Plan target has now been delivered and we expect to see further increases as these measures take effect.

 In the 2002 General Practitioner Recruitment Retention and Vacancy Survey, health authorities reported that 2,615 GP vacancies were recorded at some stage during the period March 2001 to February 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w49.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The previous arrangements for the computer reimbursement scheme were detailed in paragraph 58 of the Statement of Fees and Allowances. The scheme allowed for the direct reimbursement of a proportion of the costs incurred by a practitioner, restricted principal, partnership or group practice in purchasing, leasing or upgrading a computer system, and for maintaining the associated hardware and software. Practices were only eligible to claim reimbursement of expenditure on systems which are accredited to national standards defined in Requirements for Accreditation 99 (v1.1 and v1.2).

Once licensed, the MHRA/CSM continue to monitor the safety of medicines in clinical practice and take necessary action to optimise their safe use.

 There are two kinds of test that can be performed to determine whether an HIV-infected patient has a drug-resistant strain of the virus. Genotypic testing, which involves identifying mutation in the viral genetic material, has been adopted for widespread clinical use and is undertaken by specialist clinical virology laboratories. Mutations are associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs and this information can be used to predict which drugs are likely to work for a particular individual. Phenotypic testing is more complex, requires high-containment laboratory facilities, and is not routinely available in the United Kingdom.

 The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), which is now responsible for publishing the NHS Star Ratings, has received a small number of queries from trusts seeking clarification over the calculation of their Star Rating. Representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health have included a small number of right hon. and hon. Members, members of the public and national health service staff proffering views on the NHS Star Ratings system. These views are being passed to CHI so that they may inform future developments of the star ratings system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health on what qualitative basis star ratings for hospital-acquired infections are calculated.  [127567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w51.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Two new performance indicators related to hospital acquired infections contributed to the star ratings this July. The first, a methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) improvement score was based on quantitative data from the national mandatory MRSA surveillance system. The second, an infection control procedures indicator was based on a qualitative assessment against the infection control standard. Full details of these indicators are on http://www.ratings.chi.nhs.uk/Trust/Indicator/indicators.asp?trustType=1

<P>
<a name="30908w51.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Fox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures his Department has in place to reduce incidences of MRSA in NHS hospitals.  [127334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w51.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson:  </B> 
We already have standards to ensure there is a managed environment which minimises the risk of infection to patients, staff and visitors. In addition, infection control procedures and a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus score are now performance indicators and contributed to the star ratings in July. We are continuing work to improve infection control in hospitals by developing a longer term strategy to reduce health care associated infections, spearheaded by the Chief Medical Officer.

 The future configuration of local maternity services in Portsmouth and South East Hampshire is currently under careful consideration as part of the wider restructuring of local acute services.

During September and October 2003, the local NHS has a programme of engagement to discuss the proposals with local residents and community representatives.

 The Department of Health does not publish guidelines on what should be recorded in a patient's medical record; the judgment of what is relevant is left to the responsible health care professionals. However, the General Medical Council (GMC) in its 'Good Practice' guidance provides general advice on the use and content of medical records.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para0">At present the patient's total national health service medical record consists of a series of paper sub-records divided according to the organisations where the patient has received health care.

The health care professionals of each organisation are responsible for compiling and maintaining the medical records.

<a name="30908w53.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Mental health services are provided across a spectrum of hospital and community services, including staff, teams and beds in hospital as well as other settings. Separate data relating to the proportion of hospital budgets alone spent on mental health are not kept. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients have received electro-convulsive therapy in each of the last five years, broken down by <i>(a)</i> men, <i>(b)</i> women and <i>(c)</i> ethnic minority group.  [127363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w53.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The latest information available on electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is that contained in the Department of Health's publication, "Statistical Bulletin Electro Convulsive Therapy: Survey Covering the Period from January 2002 to March 2002, England". This was a follow-up to an earlier survey of the period January to March 1999. Both surveys were undertaken to provide data on ECT that are not currently available elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para6">The 2002 survey confirmed the continuing downward trend in the number of administrations of ECT. It collected information from national health service and independent sector care settings, including nursing homes, on the total number of administrations of ECT in NHS and independent sector care settings including data on sex, age ethnicity, legal status and method of consent. It found that in the period January to March 2002:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2,300 patients received ECT treatment compared to 2,800 in 1999;
<P>
<BR>
there were 700 male patients receiving treatment, compared with 1,600 female patients;
<P>
<BR>
there were 12,800 administrations of ECT compared to 16,500 in January to March 1999;
<P>
<BR>
the ethnic group with the highest number of patients receiving ECT treatment was 'white', that is white British, Irish or from other white background, with 1,800 of the 2,300 who received ECT treatment;
<P>
<BR>
the ethnic group with the lowest number of patients receiving ECT treatment was the 'multi-ethnic origin' group with six of the 2,300 who received ECT treatment. However, the rates for this and some other ethnic groups were based on very small numbers of patients; and
<P>
<BR>
the spread of the ECT patients among the various ethnic groups was broadly similar to the spread seen in the general population. However, it should be noted the ethnicity category 'not stated' accounted for 18 per cent. of all ECT patients in this survey, more than twice the rate in the 1999 survey. Comparing only those patients receiving ECT whose ethnic origin was reported, 96 per cent. were white, similar to the results from the 1999 survey. However, the proportion of the general population who are white is slightly down to 91 per cent. compared with 92.7 per cent. in 1999. Further information on the ethnicity of ECT patients can be found in Table 8 of the 2002 Survey.

 Systematic mapping of local child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) provision across England was launched last year and it is intended to repeat this annually. This will provide detailed information on service provision, service activity levels and expenditure on CAMHS by provider trust and by local authority and primary care trust commissioners. Data currently available can be found on the dedicated website at www.dur.ac.uk/service.mapping/CAMH/.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para18">The Government's strategy for the development of CAMHS, initiated in 1999, has made significant progress in improving the overall quality and accessibility of local services for children and young people with mental health problems. Our current central investment programme of &#163;250 million over the coming three years aims to help secure comprehensive CAMHS in all areas by 2006 in line with the objectives contained in "Improvement, Expansion, Reform&#151;the Priorities and Planning Framework 2003/2006" published by the Department in October 2002.

 The NHS Plan set out that one thousand new graduate primary care workers trained in brief therapy techniques of proven effectiveness will be recruited to help general practitioners manage and treat common mental health problems. The target date set for local services through priorities and planning guidance is December 2004; training courses have just been established and arrangements to monitor recruitment are currently in hand. This means that the information requested about the employment by specialist trusts of new graduate workers is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para19">However, it may be helpful to point out that our guidance for local services on recruitment suggests primary care trusts, rather than specialised trusts, are likely to be the lead employers.

 The NHS Plan set a target for 2004 that 700 more staff will be recruited to increase the breaks available for carers and to strengthen carer support networks. In pursuance of this target, all regular carers of people with mental health problems will have been identified, received an assessment and have their own care support plans by 2004 and local support networks for these carers will have been developed. The statutory and voluntary sectors currently provide support to carers, and the Department of Health has developed a service specification for carers; support services, including respite breaks, against which we will measure progress.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para24">Carers' Grant, introduced in 1999, has provided an extra &#163;225 million over the past four years to increase the number of short breaks for carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. In recognition of its importance to carers, it has been extended for a further three years to 2005&#150;06, by which time it will be worth &#163;185 million to provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w53.html_spnew17"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Children and young people who require in-patient mental health care should receive it in a unit suitable for their age and development. This would normally be in a ward or unit designated for their age group, but in certain cases an adult ward may be a necessary short term alternative for some young people, depending upon the nature and urgency of their mental health need.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para26">The children's national service framework (NSF) will be setting out standards for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). A sub-group has been established to look at the specific needs of children and young people who may require in-patient services. The recommendations of this group will help to inform the mental health component of the children's NSF.
<P>

<a name="30908w53.html_para27">We are also making a substantial additional investment, some &#163;250 million over three years, to improve CAMHS. This will assist the service to meet the new capacity assumptions set out in the Department's Priorities and Planning Framework, particularly the expectation that all areas will provide a comprehensive CAMHS by 2006.

<a name="30908w57.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government have made a commitment to developing greater diversity and plurality in healthcare provision in the future. This means that the national health service will be able to explore a range of options to help it deliver shorter waiting times and increase patient choice. These options include more effective use of the independent sector in the United Kingdom, innovative use of capacity in the NHS, and using NHS and independent sector diagnosis and treatment centres. The policy is that wherever possible the NHS should seek to attract overseas providers to the UK. However, where it makes sense in terms of value for money and convenience for patients, overseas treatment does offer a further means to add to the capacity of the NHS, to reduce waiting times and extend the choice available to patients.

Conversely, if a PCT did not meet this criteria at the said date, they would be assigned a score of one. Burley, Pendle and Rossendale PCT reported that it had met the above criteria and thus was assigned a score of five for this particular performance indicator within the 2002&#150;03 NHS performance ratings.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) should be able to respond to requests for dentistry whether it is emergency, urgent or routine as defined by the clinical algorithms developed with the dental profession by NHS Direct. For each of these categories of need, the PCT needs to have a distance standard related to local geography, which has been agreed with local stakeholders and published. For emergency care, distance standards would be similar to those for other National Health Service emergency services. A PCT providing full access to NHS dentistry will be achieving compliance with both clinical and distance standards. Not all PCTs fulfil both these sets of criteria.

<a name="30908w58.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures his Department is taking to reduce the levels of <i>(a)</i> financial waste, <i>(b)</i> fraud and <i>(c)</i> inefficiency in the NHS; and what progress has been made over the last 12 months.  [127492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w58.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health monitors and manages the performance of the national health service in the delivery of the key targets set out in the NHS Plan. In addition, the NHS is subject to external independent audit by the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office. They publish a number of studies each year on the value for money of aspects of the NHS. The Department of Health considers each of these reports, and implements their recommendations where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30908w58.html_para3">The Counter Fraud Service, now Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS), was formed in September 1998, with a remit to tackle fraud and corruption within the NHS. It established a risk measurement programme to carry out an exhaustive examination of valid samples of cases in each area of NHS spending and to produce statistically robust estimates of fraud accurate to plus or minus 1 per cent. of losses. These exercises are among the first of such exercises to be undertaken anywhere in the public or private sectors.
<P>

<a name="30908w58.html_para4">The first measurement exercise concentrated on patient fraud. To deter and prevent patient evasion of NHS charges and to increase the anti-fraud culture, point of dispensing and point of treatment checks were introduced. These checks require patients to provide proof of exemption to charges. The measurement exercises have already demonstrated a reduction in fraudulently claimed exemption to these charges from approximately &#163;170 million to &#163;109.17 million per year, a reduction of 36 per cent. since 1998.
<P>

<a name="30908w58.html_para5">Over 1,400 cases of potential fraud have been detected and investigated. This has resulted in 160 successful criminal prosecutions with 98 per cent. success rate, 215 civil and disciplinary sanctions have been applied and over &#163;14 million recovered. Additionally, over &#163;31 million of fraud has been identified and stopped.
<P>

<a name="30908w58.html_para6">As action takes place to counter fraud in the NHS the measurement process will be repeated to demonstrate what progress has been made to reduce fraud to an absolute minimum.
<P>

<a name="30908w58.html_para7">In addition, governance arrangements have been improved to ensure the necessary standards of accountability, probity and openness through the introduction in 1999 of the Controls Assurance Standards.

 Providers of temporary staffing should conform to the principles and standards in the Department's Code of Practice for the Supply of Temporary Staffing when supplying temporary staff to the National Health Service. NHS employers should ensure that they request a declaration of adherence to the code of practice when engaging with a provider of temporary staff. The code states that information relating to the staff member's qualifications, training and membership of professional bodies should be obtained by the provider.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w60.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government is implementing a range of measures to increase the numbers of staff working in the national health service, including practice nurses. These include an increase in pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer through the "Improving Working Lives and Positively Diverse" programmes, increasing training commissions, reducing student attrition, running national and local recruitment and return to practice campaigns, and supporting international recruitment where appropriate. In addition, we have recently developed a dedicated NHS Careers factsheet on practice nursing, to promote further careers and opportunities in this field. A copy of the factsheet is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30908w60.html_para10">As a result of these measures, there are now over 2,500 more practices nurses working in the NHS since 1997 (NHS Workforce Census). This has contributed in helping to meet the NHS Plan target for 20,000 more nurses two years ahead of schedule.

<a name="30908w61.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The NHS Plan and the national service framework for coronary heart disease (CHD) (launched after the National Audit Office survey), sets standards for health authorities in partnership with local authorities, primary care trusts (PCTs) and NHS trusts, for the development and delivery of effective policies for reducing overweight and obesity, promoting healthy eating and increase physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30908w61.html_para0">The NHS Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&#150;06 includes targets on reducing CHD. One of these targets requires practice-based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking, to cover the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30 (that is, people who are obese).

 The most up to date costs published by the Department of Health are for the financial year 2001&#150;02 and are shown in the table. The costs detailed represent the national average cost in the national health service for all NHS patients treated as an in-patient or day case. These costs are collected using healthcare resource groups (HRGs), which are groups of treatments that are clinically homogeneous and have similar costs. Therefore, the treatments the HRGs contain are less specific than those listed in the question.

 Pain management is an important component of most patients' care. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report on pain services, published in 2000, highlighted variations in access to pain services throughout the country. The report made recommendations to National Health Service acute trusts and commissioners on how pain services should be delivered in order to reduce the variations to access. It recommended that primary care trust commissioners should review local provision of pain services, looking particularly at the provision of more specialised treatments on a networked basis. In this review, account should be taken of the needs of both adults and children, and include patients with acute pain resulting from sudden illness or accident, as well as post-operative pain and chronic pain. Trusts should agree with commissioners the services that are appropriate to meet local needs.

 The report of the Mansell Committee (HMSO) 1993) provided guidance aon services for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour. Our White Paper "Valuing People" (Cm 5086), published in March 2001, notes that psychotropic medication may be very effective if someone has an underlying psychiatric disorder but points out that there is concern that too often this medication is used as an alternative to adequate staffing. The interventions to be used will depend on the individual situation and the factors that are contributing to the nature and severity of the behaviours that occur.

 This Government are committed to reducing population average intakes of salt, and as 75 per cent. of the salt comes from processed foods, has called on industry to take a meaningful lead in reducing the salt content of processed foods. The Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) 2002 Annual Report urged:

Even a small reduction in sodium intake can help to reduce the burden of high blood pressure, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in our population.

(5 kg for each 100 kg) of their body weight from the start of the drug treatment. Treatment is not recommended for more than 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w65.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government recognise that certain terms can be used to suggest that one tobacco product is less harmful than another. We are therefore committed to banning the use of "misleading descriptors."
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para0">The Tobacco Products (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale) (Safety) Regulations 2002 prohibit the supply of tobacco products, "the packaging of which carries any name, brand name, text, trademark or pictorial or any other representation or sign which suggests that that tobacco product is less harmful to health than other tobacco products." The supply of such cigarette packets must cease as of 30 September 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w65.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Department of Health has no plans to pilot national smoking prevention schemes. With the changes under "Shifting the Balance of Power", it is now for strategic health authorities and their primary care trusts to introduce smoke-free policies.
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para2">The Chief Medical Officer's annual report recommended to Government, that among other recommendations, employers should plan to introduce smoke free workplaces; the public sector and health service should take the lead and this year set dates by which their premises will become entirely smoke free.
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para3">The Department of Health are also running a pilot study, led by St. George's hospital, to look into developing a toolkit of introducing a smoking cessation service/policy within hospitals. The results of this study should be available in 2005. We have also asked the British Thoracic Society to undertake a survey of hospitals to see what smoking policies they have introduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w65.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Chief Medical Officer's report should leave no-one in any doubt that second-hand smoke is an important public health issue, and the Government are looking very closely at the Chief 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 263W</I><P>
Medical Officer's recommendations. We wish to ensure real progress is being made in the availability of smoke-free public places.
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para4">In our 1998 White paper, "Smoking Kills", we agreed that completely smoke-free places are the ideal. The World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which the UK signed in June 2003, also called for action to protect people from tobacco smoke. Taking action on smoking in the workplace and in public places is an important element of international best practice in tobacco control.
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para5">We also want to increase the public's awareness of the real health risks from second-hand smoke: not merely the discomfort caused by being in a smoky atmosphere. That is why we have launched an education campaign, making everyone aware of the need to protect others, particularly children, from the harm caused by second-hand smoke. From 1 April 2003, the Department of Health has also taken a lead in making all our buildings smoke-free and we will be encouraging others to follow this lead.

 There are national targets. Primary care trusts (PCTs) have not been set smoking cessation targets. PCTs were asked to plan together with their strategic health authorities how to support the national Priorities and Planning Framework (PPF) target:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to reduce the rate of smoking contributing to the national target of: reducing the rate in manual groups from 32 per cent. in 1998 to 26 per cent. by 2010; 800,000 smokers from all groups successfully quitting at the four week stage by 2006".

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w65.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 International evidence shows that key elements in any tobacco control strategy are advertising and public education. In the 1998 White Paper, "Smoking Kills", the Government committed itself to a programme of public education to persuade smokers to quit and non-smokers not to start.

 The national health service stop smoking services were launched in 1999. The services received a total of &#163;76 million over a four year period 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03.

<a name="30908w65.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department of Health does not require the national health service stop smoking services to track smokers who have given up for longer than four weeks, although some services do. Follow-up at four weeks was chosen as a viable, practical way to ascertain initial success, following advice from experts in smoking cessation.
<P>

<a name="30908w65.html_para10">Data from 52-week follow up were originally collected for clients who set a quit date in specialist services in health action zones in 1999&#150;2000. A high proportion of clients were lost to the service and some services found that 52-week follow up took disproportionate resources.

 The most comprehensive source of information is the National Sentinel Stroke Audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the national health service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01&#150;02.pdf. The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts who participated had a stroke unit compared to 56 per cent. three years earlier. The audit shows that 80 per cent. of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services. While it is recognised that some services need to increase their capacity, the audit notes that very significant improvements have already been made.

 The "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" target is to reduce the death rate from suicide and undetermined injury by at least a fifth by the year 20010, from a baseline of 9.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 1995&#150;97 to 7.4 deaths per 1,000,000 population in 2009&#150;11.

<P>

<a name="30908w66.html_para8">The suicide rate for the single year 2001, the most recent available, was the lowest recorded. The European Age Standardised Rate in 2001 was 8.9 per 100,000 population, a decrease of 5 per cent. on 2000 which was 9.3. There was also a fall in mental health in-patient suicide in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30908w66.html_para9">As the only full-year figures we have since the publication of the "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" strategy are for 2000 and 2001, it is still too early to assess progress in meeting this target. Current trends do not as yet provide a robust indication of the effect of the strategy. If the trend of the last three years continues, then the target will be met, however this is much too short a period from which to extrapolate a robust trend.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was asked to appraise the use of infliximab (Remicade) and etanecerpt (Enbrel) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. NICE issued its guidance on 22 March 2002, which recommended the use of etanecerpt for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and etanecerpt and infliximab for adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Clinicians will still be responsible for exercising judgment in individual cases in the light of NICE's guidance and the evidence on which it was based.

Together, these emphasise the importance of innovative solutions to maintain local access to services while achieving compliance with the WTD. This is a local national health service responsibility, supported by the 7.4 per cent. per annum real term increase in funding over the next five years.

<a name="30908w68.html_para1">To assist trusts in meeting the WTD and to support increases in consultant numbers the Department has increased significantly the number of specialist registrar (SpR) training opportunities, including 80 in accident and emergency. I announced on 17 July 2003 that postgraduate deans will be instructed to give priority to hospitals facing WTD challenges when considering the allocation of 1,500 additional locally funded SpR training opportunities available this year. This will ensure that training posts are focused on those hospitals under the greatest pressure in complying with the WTD. Further training posts will also be approved where this can help trusts with compliance.

<sup>(88)</sup> In the calculation of the trade gap the values of exports and imports are measured slightly differently. For exports, values include the costs allowed under "free on board" which refers to the total export values of goods leaving the country. For imports, values include the costs allowed under "cost insurance freight" which refers to the total value of the goods imported into the UK. Thus for imports into the UK the cost of transportation between the port or place of dispatch and the UK port or place of importation is included. As a result imports are overstated relative to exports by about 5 per cent. The figures are not seasonally adjusted.<P>

<P>
<a name="30908w70.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The central thrust of the Department's efforts to raise awareness of environmental regulations and legislation is the NetRegs project. NetRegs aims to provide clear and coherent guidelines for businesses (principally small/medium-sized businesses) on environmental legislation, and how to comply with it. Sector-specific guidelines for 100 industry sectors will be available on its website (www.netregs.gov.uk) by the time the project finishes at the end of March 2004; currently there are guidelines for over 55 business sectors already published on the site. NetRegs is a partnership between the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Environment and Heritage Service Northern Ireland, and the DTI. It is funded by the Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund.
<P>

<a name="30908w70.html_para2">To publicise NetRegs to its target audience, the NetRegs team has successfully engaged the support of the relevant trade media, associations, and business support organisations in 'spreading the word' on a sector-by-sector basis, as each sector's guidelines are launched on the website. So far NetRegs has generated over 700 pieces of media coverage since October 2002 and over 180 organisations have to date actively supported and or promoted the site.
<P>

<a name="30908w70.html_para3">Defra also undertakes initiatives in relation to specific areas of new legislation. For example, between September 2002 and February 2003 Defra, DTI and the Small Business Service ran over 30 seminars across the UK to raise awareness of the European Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), which must be transposed into UK legislation by the summer of next year.

 Imports and exports of radioactive waste into, out of, or through the European Union are controlled under European Commission Directive 92/3 Euratom. This Directive is implemented into UK law by the Transfrontier Shipment of Radioactive Waste Regulations 1993.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w70.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Antibiotics cannot be used in animal feed unless they are authorised either as veterinary medicinal products or as zootechnical feed additives (which are used as growth promoters).
<P>

<a name="30908w70.html_para6">The Government recognises the important role that authorised antibiotics play in maintaining animal health and welfare. However it takes very seriously the possibility of their contributing to the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans. The Government has therefore developed a comprehensive strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of antimicrobial products and reducing the overall pool of antibiotic use in animals. A key element in this strategy is promoting the prudent use of authorised antibiotic medicines and feed additives in animal husbandry.
<P>

<a name="30908w70.html_para7">The Government is satisfied that the four feed additives authorised as antibiotic growth promoters are not related to any therapeutic antibiotics currently used in human or animal medicine. However it supports the phasing out of these products on a precautionary basis from 1 January 2006 under new EU legislation on Feed Additives coming into effect next year. The Government believes that this provides sufficient time for the industry to introduce new husbandry methods before the authorisations for antibiotic growth promoters are withdrawn.

<P>

<a name="30908w71.html_para0">Following the confirmation of AI in the Netherlands and Belgium in March and April 2003 respectively, the Dutch and Belgian authorities imposed a standstill on the transport of live poultry and hatching eggs within those countries. The Dutch and Belgian authorities also stopped their exports of live poultry, hatching eggs and fresh unprocessed and non-heat treated poultry manure and litter. In May 2003, AI was also confirmed in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany and the German authorities took similar action. In each instance the European Commission put in place Community legislation to reinforce the action taken by the countries concerned.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also introduced similar Declarations. EU legislation does not permit trade in fresh poultry meat if it was obtained from poultry originating in established surveillance zones in those countries. In light of Germany and Belgium's confirmation on 26 June and 16 July 2003 respectively, that there had been no further outbreaks and that the disease had been successfully eradicated, restrictions were lifted from Belgium and the affected part of Germany.

<sup>(89)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

<P>
<a name="30908w71.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government are currently considering the FSA recommendation that the over-thirty-month rule could be amended. If the rule is amended, over-thirty-month cattle would be tested for BSE using the Bio-Rad test, which is one of the five rapid diagnostic tests approved by the European Union. The test is carried out using brain stem tissue taken from the cattle following slaughter. It takes about six hours and will be carried out at LGC laboratories at Teddington, Runcorn and Edinburgh. These laboratories will run an overnight testing service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w71.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 If the over-thirty-month rule is amended, slaughterhouses would require a dedicated area for sampling including access to washing facilities. They would also need to ensure that they have sufficient space to store carcases and edible offals until test results are known. Although there are no current plans to require slaughterhouses to operate separate units for processing over-thirty-month cattle for human consumption, some might choose to do so for operational reasons.

 If the over-thirty-month rule is amended, the costs of testing for BSE over-thirty-month cattle for sale for human consumption would be shared by Government and industry. The Government will pay for the rapid test kit and the testing process. The precise cost is commercially sensitive but it is within the EU's state aid limit of 40 euros. Abattoirs will pay for the sampling, packaging and transportation of samples to laboratories and other in-abattoir costs. A significant number of abattoirs have indicated that they may be interested in slaughtering cattle aged over-thirty-months if the rule is amended.

 The Over-30-Month Scheme (OTMS) provides an outlet for cattle which are excluded from the food chain by the Over-30-Month (OTM) Rule. The Food Standards Agency has carried out a review of the OTM Rule, and has advised the Government that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the OTM Rule by BSE testing of cattle older than 30 months in two stages. Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food supply, after being tested for BSE, at the earliest from January 2004, with the possibility of complete replacement of the Rule by testing from July 2005. The Government are considering this advice. Any change to the OTM Rule is likely to lead to parallel changes to the OTMS.

 I have discussed with the Countryside Agency the way in which it manages its finances in view of the "hold" placed on some budgets, including Vital Villages, at the start of this financial year. This was done by the Agency because of the very high level of applications received and the consequent need to target money at the areas of greatest need, but it is unfortunate that this caused uncertainty to a number of organisations who were dependent on the Countryside Agency grant for continuity of their work. I am drawing to the attention of the Agency and other organisations funded by Defra the requirements on finance contained in the Government's compact with the Voluntary Sector. It should be noted that the Agency's grant in aid has been significantly increased this year.

Demand for the scheme has been high and the funds available have had to be shared among as many projects as possible.

One practical area where the Government can have a direct effect on the local food sector is public procurement. Defra has published guidance on its website (http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 291W</I><P>

We have asked Government Departments to produce their own action plans on public procurement. We are also encouraging local authorities to do the same.
<P>

<a name="30908w73.html_para0">We have recently drawn up a local food policy paper examining the rationale for public support and setting out a framework within which support will be given. The paper is published on the following website address: http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/specialfoods/localfood/index.htm.The framework focuses on added value at national level, the public procurement initiative and spreading best local food practice nationwide. We will also continue to deploy our various funding schemes to encourage a flourishing local food sector. This activity will complement measures at a regional level which the Regional Development Agencies will be implementing as part of their wider food and drink strategies.

<P>
<a name="30908w73.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Local trade fairs and farmers' markets are an excellent way to raise awareness about local and regional food. In the last 12 months, we have made provision under the England Rural Development Programme for grants for projects promoting farmers' markets and other direct sales outlets. For example, within this period we have awarded 100,256 to the National Association of Farmers' Markets to raise the profile of farmers' markets across England and increase public awareness of them. In addition, in November last year Lord Whitty wrote to all Local Authorities outlining the benefits farmers' markets bring and the role they play in bringing urban and rural communities together. Finally, Defra provides funding to Food from Britain, which has responsibility for promoting the production and consumption of quality regional food and drink. One of the measures for doing this is by providing business support, through the network of Regional Food Groups, to those producers wishing to exhibit at trade fairs both at a local and national level.

 An assessment of the environmental performance of various alternative fuels, including LPG, was carried out by the Cleaner Vehicles Task Force in 2000. The research showed that LPG can have air quality benefits over conventional fuels in terms of reduced emissions of particulates and oxides of nitrogen, and reduced noise, although progress with conventional engine and fuel technologies is reducing this advantage.

Research has also been carried out on local air quality benefits. An assessment of the emissions performance of bioethanol undertaken by AEA Technology plc (Ethanol Emissions Testing, March 2002) was published by the Department for Transport. The report found that tailpipe emissions of particulates are significantly reduced for bioethanol compared to petrol but as petrol engines are very low emitters of particulates, the large reduction in emissions from bioethanol results in only a marginal improvement in air quality. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen are not significantly changed compared to petrol.

<a name="30908w75.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 EU enlargement represents a considerable expansion of the single market. The increase in the size of the single market presents UK producers with additional markets for their output as well as potential competitors for current markets. However, the implications for UK producers are not expected to be significant in the short term, both because of the continued application of CAP market measures and because trade liberalisation between the EU 15 and CE 10 is already well under way.
<P>

<a name="30908w75.html_para1">In the longer term the effect of enlargement will depend, in large part, on rates of productivity growth, and we have commissioned a detailed study to examine this issue. The objective of this project is to analyse the potential for changes in relative productivity growth in the new member states and the existing EU and the impact that this will have on agricultural markets. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year and will be published.

 Information on the agricultural workforce in both the EU15 and the candidate countries is published by Eurostat. The latest Eurostat estimates, for 2001, show the level of employment in the Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Fishing sector was 6,701 thousand in the EU 15 and 3,871 thousand in the CE 10. This 2001 data implies that enlargement would be expected to increase the scale of the workforce by nearly 60 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w75.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government have not made such an assessment. The European Commission is responsible for monitoring the transposition of Community law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w75.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Departments are required to undertake Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA) for all proposals that impose a burden or realise a benefit to business, charities and the voluntary sector, including those arising from the EU. In February 2002, a two stage 'competition assessment' was introduced as part of the RIA process. The first stage identifies whether the regulation will have an effect on competition; if the effect on competition is significant a second; more rigorous examination of the likely effects is carried out.

<a name="30908w75.html_para3">The Working Party on International Environment/Climate Change considers key international climate change issues and develops the policy positions that the EU takes in the international climate change negotiations. It generally meets monthly and is attended by officials heading the climate change delegations of each of the member states, and the European Commission. The working party is supported by several expert groups of officials that provide advice and recommendations on a range of technical issues such as carbon sinks, the Kyoto mechanisms, reporting and accounting, and, further action beyond the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008&#150;12).
<P>

<a name="30908w75.html_para4">The Monitoring Mechanism Committee assists the European Commission with tasks related to the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by member states, and the evaluation of progress by member states towards meeting their commitments.

 Defra provides grant aid as a percentage of eligible costs to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities in England&#151;the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and internal drainage boards&#151;to assist with capital works and studies to manage flood risk. Since May 1997 approximately 800 such capital construction projects have been approved by Defra for grant and/or completed by the operating authorities. However information is not held centrally as to whether these defences were adjustable or not. I regret this information could not be provided except at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30908w76.html_para4">The Environment Agency is by far the largest flood risk operating authority in England, being empowered to manage flood risk from all rivers designated as "main" and from the sea. The agency undertakes analyses both upstream and downstream of new defences, both adjustable and fixed, prior to construction in order to understand the river regime. These "river models" provide a tool for understanding how different types of flood defence structure can influence the river regime and assist in the final selection and detailed design processes. By undertaking this in advance of construction any potential adverse impacts should be avoided or minimised.
<P>

<a name="30908w76.html_para5">Unless particular circumstances arise it is not usual to revisit river models soon after the construction of new defences given the pre-construction activities.

<a name="30908w76.html_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the Government's conclusions of the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review on 12 March 2003. We propose that Government funding of the Environment Agency's flood defence service should in future come from a single stream of Defra block grant which will replace the existing requirement to approve individual projects for capital grant and the levies currently paid by local authorities to the Agency. These changes will provide more assured flood defence funding for the Agency and allow better long-term planning. The introduction of block grant to replace individual project approvals relies on successful passage of provisions in the Water Bill and, subject to this, we aim to implement the changes as soon as possible.

<a name="30908w76.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Fluorine is a natural environmental contaminant and both feeding stuffs and water for livestock contain fluorides. Some fertilisers and ingredients of livestock and poultry diets contain relatively high concentrations of fluorides. Drinking water limits are designed to accommodate exposure to other sources of fluorides in the diet and in the

<P>

<a name="30908w76.html_para9">If the water fluoridation provisions in the Water Bill before Parliament were enacted, all local farmers or their representative organisations would be able to participate in public local consultations. There would be no new water fluoridation schemes unless the majority of the local population were in favour. Arrangements for the conduct of local consultations, and the assessment of public opinion will be set out in regulations under powers in the Water Bill. It will also be possible to alter the target fluoride concentration by statutory instrument.

 The Department has made clear its support for assurance schemes as part of the Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food.
<P>

<a name="30908w77.html_para0">Assurance schemes are a priority for grant aid under the new Agriculture Development Scheme, launched last year to take forward important elements of the strategy. Assured Food Standards has received grant aid under the scheme for projects to create an independent, authoritative body for food assurance; review assurance standards and their delivery; and develop a marketing and communications strategy.
<P>

<a name="30908w77.html_para1">Some assurance schemes may also be eligible for help under the Rural Enterprise Scheme, which forms part of the England Rural Development Programme.

 Defra has a role to play with others in providing all citizens with access to healthy food and in ensuring the continuity of essential supplies of food. The Government believes that national and international food security is best facilitated through improved trading relationships based on more open international markets and reductions in trade distorting subsidies. Our domestic agriculture industry has an important contribution to make by improving its ability to produce efficiently and sustainably what the market requires. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food sets out how Government and industry is working in partnership to deliver this objective.

 Genomics is a set of technologies central to the public sector investment underpinning crop breeding. The Government fund genomics research through a range of research programmes in Defra, Research Councils, and other Departments. As a technology, the potential of genomics is addressed in relevant strategic plans. In addition, research funders have their own mechanisms to assess the potential of their research both at programme and project level.
<P>

<a name="30908w77.html_para4">Defra's current research underpinning crop breeding is informed by a specially commissioned research project that provided an assessment of the potential of publicly-funded genomics research. The project entitled 'The Role of Future Public Research Investment in the Genetic Improvement of UK Grown Crops' was completed in September 2002. The assessment provides a strong rationale for public investment and has informed the Defra Science and Innovation Strategy. It has been widely distributed within the research and crop breeding community, and is available on the Defra website.

 The first case of phocine distemper virus (PDV) was reported at Anholt, Denmark in May 2002. This was the same place that the previous PDV outbreak in 1988 originated. The epizootic reached the east coast of England in August 2002.
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para0">Drawing on the lessons learned during the last outbreak, Defra helped voluntary organisations prepare and cope with the PDV outbreak as it hit UK waters. Discussions were held about the disposal and vaccinations options for seal carcases and the resulting guidance notes were published along with other useful information on the dedicated Defra PDV website (http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/ewd/seals/index.htm).
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para1">Defra commissioned the Institute of Zoology (Zoological Society of London) to monitor, report and produce information about the progress of the virus. The helpline was funded by Defra and the Devolved Administrations. We worked closely with voluntary organisations and other Government Departments, including The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), The Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Scottish Executive Environment Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD), National Assembly for Wales Agriculture Department (NAWAD), The Department of Environment (Northern Ireland) (DoE NI), and the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU).

[127222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30908w78.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Each local authority in England has been set statutory recycling and composting standards (targets) for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06. These targets relate to the percentage of household waste sent for recycling, not the amount collected. Individual local authorities are responsible for deciding how to meet these targets in the light of local circumstances which will include settlement patterns, waste characteristics and the market for recycling. Where authorities are contracted to supply paper (and other materials) to selected reprocessors, they will be required to supply materials in the form specified by the reprocessors, which will influence their collection practices.
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para3">Guidance on methods of collection which facilitate recycling should be based on sound data. The Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has recently conducted an extensive survey with the aim of providing a baseline measure for the quality of paper reaching reprocessors from different collection methods.

<a name="30908w78.html_para7">Neither the Department nor the Environment Agency holds definitive data with regard to on-farm drum incinerators. However it is estimated that approximately 27,000 drum incinerators are in use in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para8">A central register of operators indicates that as at 1 July 2003 there were 306 approved Specified Risk Material (SRM) incinerators in Great Britain. In addition, it is believed there are around 2,500 low capacity (less than 50kg/hour) non-SRM animal carcase incinerators mainly on pig and poultry farms in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para9">Burning waste oil as a fuel is permitted under an exemption under Part I of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. This exemption only applies when the total amount of waste oil burned does not exceed 2,500 litres an hour in any one engine. At the last count (Nov. 02) the Environment Agency had registered 36 such exemptions.
<P>

<a name="30908w78.html_para10">Applications to operate other types or capacities of waste oil burners are regulated by Local Authorities at a local level and no central database exists.However, 



<P>
<P><I>8 Sept 2003 : Column 314W</I><P>
according to the 2001&#150;02 Local Air Pollution Control Survey it is believed there are over 1,100 small waste oil burners which operate with a maximum burning capacity of 0.4 megawatts to 3 megawatts net rated thermal input. However, the industry estimate is that the actual number of burners with this capacity may be as high as 10,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the waste incinerators undergoing planning review.  [128166]<P>

 Details of planning applications for proposed facilities which have yet to be determined by the respective local planning authorities are not held centrally. The table gives the number and status, as at 16 June 2003, of proposed new municipal waste incineration plants in England and Wales of which we are aware. The table contains information shared with the Environment Agency by prospective applicants for pollution control permits. There may also be other planning applications or amendments which have been submitted to local authorities over which the agency has not been consulted. The planning status may have been changed since the data were supplied.
