 The "Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus" is not internationally recognised except by Turkey, and has consequently never been formally assessed by any of the leading global anti-money laundering organisations. There is evidence, however, that it is vulnerable to exploitation by those involved in money laundering, and it has taken some steps to combat this.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The transportation of plutonium is carried out in accordance with strict national and international regulations and recommendations. The standards applied are approved by the Director for Civil Nuclear Security, the Government's Regulator, to ensure that the security risks associated with the transportation of nuclear material are effectively countered by protective measures.

<a name="11025w01.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 A voluntary code has been developed by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council (Energywatch) and has been accepted by all suppliers of gas and electricity to domestic consumers. The code, known as the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter, will come into effect in January 2002. It will ensure that consumers who have been wrongly transferred will be returned to their previous supplier with as little inconvenience as possible. The consumer will be able to contact either supplier, who will resolve the problem and provide the consumer with any necessary information.

 Proposals have been received from two consortia: Paradigm Secure Communications (led by Astrium) and Rosetta Global Communications (led by Lockheed Martin, British Telecom and BAE Systems). The evaluation of Skynet 5 is very complex and will primarily take into account financial, commercial and technical issues. The assessment will also consider the industrial implications of each proposal. Both bidders have been invited to submit 'Best and Final Offers' by the end of November 2001. All aspects of the bids will be fully assessed before a decision is reached. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the bidders' proposals while the competition is taking place. However, on current plans I expect to announce the preferred bidder in the early part of 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the source of the 0.3 tonnes of plutonium still to be moved from AWE Aldermaston to Sellafield as of 14 March 2000; what quantities of plutonium have been moved to Sellafield and placed under safeguards since this date; and what plans there are to move further quantities of military plutonium to Sellafield.  [8962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Taken in their totality, acquisitions of plutonium for the nuclear weapons programme were predominantly from Sellafield. A number of other sources are described in the Ministry of Defence report of April 2000, entitled 'Plutonium and Aldermaston, an Historical Account'. It is however impossible to identify the specific original source of the 0.3 tonnes of weapon grade material to which my hon. Friend refers. Of this 0.3 tonnes, some 235 kilograms have been moved to Sellafield and placed under International Safeguards&#151;this represents some 162 kilograms since 14 March 2000. It is intended that the balance of 65 kilograms will be moved in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what abatement is made in respect of pay levels in the armed forces to take account of the benefits from the non-contributory pension scheme.  [9392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is the remit of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) to consider broad pay comparability, and this includes taking account of the deferred pay represented by pension provision. The AFPRB currently applies an abatement to comparators' earnings to account for the early and fast accrual of benefits under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) compared with those available in the civilian sector. The level of abatement set in the AFPRB's 30th Report (2001) is 7 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate has been made of the costs of increasing death-in-service benefits of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [8739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Within the current Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS), the death-in-service gratuity for non- attributable deaths is significantly lower than in most other comparable pension schemes. The recent consultation document setting out our initial findings from the review of the AFPS therefore recommended that the death-in-service gratuity should be increased to three times pensionable salary. Overall, the changes would represent a substantial improvement in terms for family and dependants. The additional cost of this enhancement has been estimated at some &#163;9 million per annum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme will report.  [8742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The period of public consultation was due to end formally on 31 July but was extended informally to admit some late replies. The Ministry of Defence is now undertaking an analysis of the responses with a view to identifying significant issues and recommending how it might move ahead on these. This will require detailed discussions to agree responses that meet our recruitment and retention needs, but which are also consistent with wider public sector pensions policy. In addition, we intend to engage in further discussions with the ex-service community during this process, both to discuss their particular concerns and inform them of our thinking.

 The UK and the US have taken a joint decision to bring the Tracer programme to a close in July 2002 when the current assessment phase comes to an end. In keeping with the principles of Smart Acquisition, this illustrates our willingness to take the right decision early in a programme in response to changing priorities. The Tracer programme has successfully developed a pool of key technologies that can now be utilised in future programmes such as the Future Rapid Effects System which will play a key role in meeting the Land Commander's Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance needs.

 Training for nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defence is a wide ranging and comprehensive activity for all armed forces personnel, beginning with basic recruit courses and continuing throughout their careers. Training is carried out both individually and collectively in units and formations. NBC defence is integrated into a wide range of military training, including major and minor exercises. The Defence NBC Centre at Winterbourne Gunner is world-renowned. A major task of this tri-service unit is to provide the best possible training in NBC defence for officers and NCOs, whether they are employed in staff appointments, as instructors, or at unit level. The content of training courses remains under regular review to ensure that it is relevant, up to date and effective, and mechanisms are in place to ensure that NBC Defence training is validated by all three services.

Raising the levexls of participation and attainment of young people in education and training in conjunction with other partners is seen as a key objective of the new service and is reflected in the priorities and targets of all Connexions partnerships. The progress of partnerships towards meeting these key targets will form an important part of the performance review process in future years once relevant annual data covering participation and achievement become available from 2002 onwards.

 The individual learning account (ILA) programme is to be withdrawn from 7 December in England. The programme has attracted over 2.5 million account holders and has been a great success in bringing down the financial barriers to learning. ILAs have opened up access for a great many people to a wide range of learning opportunities. However, the rapid growth of the scheme has exceeded all expectations, causing us to think again about how best to target public funds in this area and secure value for money. I also have concerns about the way in which some ILAs have been promoted and sold. There is growing evidence that some companies are abusing the scheme by offering low value, poor quality learning.

 There has been a substantial rise in primary school standards following the introduction of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. Since 1998, there has been a 10 per cent. point improvement to 75 per cent. in the number of pupils achieving the expected standard for their age in the Key Stage 2 English tests and a 12 per cent. point improvement to 71 per cent. in maths.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 2001]:</i> The amount of gross domestic product spent on education between 1992 and 1997 fell from 5.1 per cent. to 4.6 per cent. Between 1998 and 2002 it will have risen from 4.5 per cent. to 5.0 per cent. This translates to a cash increase of almost &#163;11 billion. It is estimated to rise to 5.3 per cent. by 2003&#150;04, which means the Government will have kept their manifesto promise to increase the proportion of national income spent on education in this Parliament.

 I am pleased to announce today the results of the consultation.

There was much general support for the production of a Code of Practice to help with the implementation of the practical implications of the proposals. This will include guidance on reasonable time off and the use of facilities. We will introduce legislation on this at the earliest opportunity.

<P>

<a name="11025w06.html_para1">These data are derived from the annual report for that year. We do not publish figures for cost per week so the above data have been derived by dividing the annual outturn by 52 weeks.
<P>

<a name="11025w06.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> The current weekly unit cost of housing an asylum seeker at Oakington, the only closed reception centre currently operating and based on an average occupancy of 170 in September, is estimated at &#163;1,620. This is a higher figure than quoted in earlier replies but the unit cost is subject to variation because of changes in occupancy and, during September, this was significantly lower than during any of the previous six months. This was as a result of the contingency arrangements required in the light of legal proceedings on the legality of detaining asylum seekers at Oakington.
<P>

<a name="11025w06.html_para3">The weekly costs quoted are not comparable as they compare an average cost for a prison with the specific costs of a unit designed to take quick asylum casework decisions. Oakington was set up to fast track asylum applications and this has resulted in significant savings in the time taken to process applications and therefore in asylum seekers support costs, which offset operating costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w06.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is only responsible for setting the support levels for the asylum seekers it is supporting directly. NASS has not increased its levels of support in 2001. Individual local authorities are responsible for setting the level of support paid to asylum seekers supported under the interim scheme and there is no central record of the amounts paid. But the grant paid by the Home Office is subject to unit cost limits.
<P>

<a name="11025w06.html_para4">Some asylum seekers remain eligible for support under the income support arrangements. It is understood that the rates for adults and children were increased in April and that there was a further increase in the income support rate for children yesterday. In most cases, asylum seekers in receipt of income support will also get their full housing costs paid through housing benefit.

 We are currently reviewing progress against all the Drugs Strategy targets as part of the work for the 2002 Spending Review, to ensure that we still have the right balance and focus. This supports the hard work already done by Keith Hellawell. As the Home Secretary indicated in his evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee on 23 October 2001, he is also seeking advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs on their assessment for reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C, proposing an innovative public awareness campaign on drugs aimed at young people, providing &#163;1 million as a starter fund for a pilot project to help police target regional drug traffickers with a view to a national roll-out of the scheme, proposing the roll-out of drug testing programmes, and a series of measures, in partnership with the Department of Health, to minimise the harm drugs cause.

 None. Expenditure on the benefit programme is determined by the number of benefit claimants who satisfy the qualifying conditions that apply to a particular benefit. Similarly, the employment programmes offer help to all people seeking work providing they meet any criteria for entry to a particular programme. Certain employment programmes&#151;Action Teams and Employment Zones&#151;are designed to support people in disadvantaged areas, but expenditure on these is not allocated with specific reference to the Index of Multiple Deprivation.

 The assessment report for the appraisal on Herceptin was extended following consultation in order to consider additional clinical data.

These data are routinely available on a regional basis only. Data on staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (blood infections) showing the proportion resistant to methicillin in England and Wales are published quarterly by the Public Health Laboratory Service in the Communicable Disease Report. Copies of these are available in the Library. More comprehensive information about bacteraemias, including MRSA, has been collected from all acute trusts since 1 April 2001 and these data will be published from 1 April 2002.

2. An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital.<P>

3. The criteria for submission of isolates of MRSA (and other isolates of staphylococcus aureus) to the Public Health Laboratory Service for specialist tests have been revised twice since 1996 (in January 1998 and in January 2000).<P>

4. These revised criteria have led to a fall in the number of incidents of MRSA that were reported to the PHLS. <P>

<P>
<a name="11025w09.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Local authorities will receive funding allocations through a special grant under Section 93 of the Local Government Act 2000. The grant is to be used to enable local authority community care services to work with national health service partners to significantly reduce the number of people who are ready to leave hospital but are unable to do so. Local authorities will achieve this by increasing the availability of care home places and support services which enable people to return to their own home.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2001]:</i> No. Incapacity Benefit is not income related and it would not, therefore, be appropriate to extend automatic exemption from prescription charges to recipients of this benefit. No assessment has been made of the extent to which people on Incapacity Benefit do not make use of prescriptions. People on low income who are not otherwise exempt from charges, can apply for free prescriptions under the national health service low income scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that they have an on-going programme to determine the nutrient content of a wide range of foods on a regular basis. Analytical surveys in 1994 and 1997 included foods and meals sampled from takeaway outlets or restaurants. There are plans to update this work soon.
<P>

<a name="11025w09.html_para1">This obviously is subject to the qualification that there will be significant variation in the nutritional balance between individual restaurants and individual restaurants' meals.
<P>

<a name="11025w09.html_para2">From a nutritional point of view, the composition of individual foods is less important than the nutrient content and overall balance of the diet as a whole. A varied and balanced diet, which includes plenty of fruit, vegetables and starchy foods, should provide all of the nutrients that a healthy individual requires.

 No national health service resources are allocated using the index of multiple deprivation.

These are listed in "Resource Allocation: Weighted Capitation Formulas", copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11025w09.html_para3">No personal social services resources are allocated using the index.

 The Boundary Commission for Scotland is required, by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, to submit its report to me between December 2002 and December 2006. It is a matter for the Commission when, within that time scale, it reports.

 It is the general policy of the Government art collection (an Exchequer-funded national collection) to retain for posterity and to preserve to the best of its ability all items accepted into its core holdings. The Government art collection has a disposals policy which closely follows the ethical guidelines for disposals recommended by the Museums Association. A number of items purchased with specific funds or donated with specific conditions attached may not be disposed of at all.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w11.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2001]:</i> Support for conversion to organic farming is governed by EC Regulations 1257/99 and 1750/99. The regulations require member states to set out their planned support for organic farming in a rural development programme which must be approved by the EC Commission. We have done so in the England Rural Development Programme, which can be accessed through the DEFRA website. We do not have copies of the programmes of other member states but detailed information about other Governments' support is available at www.organic-europe.net.
<P>

<a name="11025w11.html_para4">Under the EC regulations, payments to farmers who convert their land to organic farming methods must be made for at least five years. For most farmers, the conversion period is two years, thus farmers are supported during conversion and in the immediate years following. The rates and structure of payments vary widely between member states. Many of them make payments beyond the five-year period. The current England Organic Farming Scheme directs support at the time of greatest need, ie during the conversion period and the initial years of full organic status.

 The principal means of support for cereal producers in the East Midlands, as elsewhere, is the EU's Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS). Claimants in the East Midlands in 2000 received some &#163;107 million for cereals under AAPS, as well as &#163;3.6 million in agrimonetary compensation.

 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2001]:</i> The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 place obligations on certain businesses to recover and recycle specific tonnages of packaging waste, including plastic. The recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging regulations are 56 per cent. for recovery and 18 per cent. for material-specific recycling of packaging waste. We are currently consulting on recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste in 2002.
<P>

<a name="11025w12.html_para2">All local authorities have been set statutory recycling performance standards, to underpin the national targets established in the Waste Strategy 2000 for England and Wales, of recycling or composting at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. Future standards will be considered in the light of technological advances, with the aim of maximising the recycling and composting of waste. It is for local authorities to decide which waste streams they should tackle in meeting their performance standard.

<a name="11025w12.html_para3">The Government have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote more sustainable waste management through tackling the barriers to increased reuse and recycling.

<a name="11025w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have collected information about two diseases that affect oak trees, neither of which is thought to pose a significant risk to trees in Britain.
<P>

<a name="11025w12.html_para5">The first is known as Oak Dieback. The Forestry Commission has been investigating this over the last decade, and a similar decline in the health of oak trees has been reported from many other countries in Europe. The cause remains unclear but our experts consider that a strain of fungus may be thriving as a result of climate change. Drought and insect defoliation are also thought to be playing a part. The species affected is the Common oak (<i>Quercus robur</i>) while our native, the Sessile oak (<i>Q. petraea</i>), appears to be immune.
<P>

<a name="11025w12.html_para6">The second is known as Sudden Oak Death. This new disease, recently named <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i>, was identified in parts of California last year. The principal host is Tanoak (<i>Lithocarpus densiflorus</i>) although some species of true oak (<i>Quercus</i> spp.), which do not occur in Europe, and certain other plants including rhododendron and viburnum have also been affected. Similar symptoms were recorded on rhododendron and viburnum plants in Germany and the Netherlands as long ago as 1993 although it was only earlier this year that it was established that <i>P. ramorum</i> was the causal agent. The Forestry Commission and DEFRA are working together to establish whether any British oak trees have been affected or are, indeed, even susceptible to this disease. Early indications are that European oaks may not be susceptible. Current quarantine controls on plants exported from the USA, aimed at other pests and diseases, are considered sufficient to provide protection against accidental import of the disease. This disease and controls against it are being considered by the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health.
<P>

<a name="11025w12.html_para7">There are no specific pests or diseases affecting horse chestnut trees in Britain, although we are monitoring the progress of the Horse Chestnut Leaf Miner (<i>Cameraria ohridella</i>) in continental Europe. This pest was first detected in Austria in 1989 and has since spread to many parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is only found in leaves and leaf litter, and is dispersed when leaves are moved to new areas. Unfortunately, cars, lorries and trains often carry leaves long distances, and this is probably how it has spread across Europe. Leaves are, of course, also dispersed by the wind. Attacks are not fatal and trees may survive repeated attacks by successive generations of larvae. Our scientists are closely involved in research into control methods. The Forestry Commission is also planning to publish an illustrated leaflet describing the biology and symptoms of infestation of the moth next spring, to coincide with the period of the moth's activity.

 For reasons of foot and mouth disease control, there are no plans to re-open livestock markets in the immediate future. Veterinary and scientific advice is that there is an inherent risk of spreading the disease by mixing animals together and then dispersing them. Any livestock keeper with poor standards of biosecurity might attend markets from anywhere in the country and put at risk others attending the market. Even in designated free counties it would take only one such lapse in biosecurity precautions to spread the disease. It is right to be cautious at this stage but the situation will be kept under review.

<a name="11025w13.html_para10">Twenty-four hours after this stage has been completed, secondary cleansing and disinfection can commence, the purpose of which is to allow restocking and reduce the risk of recrudescence. Secondary C&D is generally undertaken by either farmers themselves or commercial contractors. Subject to preparatory work being undertaken by the farmer, secondary C&D is normally undertaken at DEFRA expense.

 Throughout the outbreak the aim has been to make payments as soon as possible subject to the necessary checks to protect public funds, but at the peak of the outbreak payments were delayed due to the large volume of claims received.

 The CPS applies the code for Crown Prosecutors in all cases referred to it by the police so that it can make fair and consistent decisions about prosecutions. Every case is reviewed to make sure that it meets the evidential and public interest tests set out in the code.
<P>

<a name="11025w14.html_para5">The more serious the offence the more likely it is that it will be prosecuted. Cases of child sexual abuse committed in children's homes are always regarded as serious and often involve one or more of the public interest factors listed in the code that generally tend in favour of prosecution. These factors include: where the defendant is in a position of trust; where the victim is vulnerable; where there are marked differences in age; or where there is an element of corruption. In such cases, a prosecution will usually take place unless there are strong public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour.

<P>
<a name="11025w17.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Recent figures are not available for the number of unadopted streets or alleyways. In 1972 there were some 40,000 private streets throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="11025w17.html_para1">Whether or not a street should be adopted is a matter for individual local authorities. They have the power to adopt such streets and to contribute towards the cost of making them up to an adoptable standard, where they deem that to be appropriate. An authority can also carry out urgent repairs to unadopted areas to prevent or remove danger to persons or vehicles, using powers conferred on them by section 230 of the Highways Act 1980, but without necessarily committing themselves to adoption. Any decision about whether to carry out urgent repairs is for the authority to make.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what is the draft timetable for the stages for implementing the proposals of Working Group 17 of EEVC.  [9048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Commission are expected to make a decision on whether to accept the Industry proposal for a negotiated agreement in December this year. If this option is taken, pedestrian protection measures will start to be introduced in 2005, and the Working Group 17 proposals (or equivalent) will be fully implemented by 2015.
<P>

<a name="11025w18.html_para0">If the negotiated agreement route is not taken, the Commission may decide to propose a Directive. Such a Directive would need to be discussed through the European Council and Parliament through the Co-decision Procedure, and the implementation dates would depend on the timing and outcome of these discussions.

[9046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of pedestrian accidents would not be affected by implementation of the Working Group 17 (WG17) proposals. However, past research by TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) estimated that measures similar to those recommended by WG17 would reduce the total number of pedestrian deaths by 8 per cent. and serious injuries by 21 per cent. This was applicable to both the UK and the EU. Other studies suggest a wider range of possible benefits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11025w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The bulk of the UK research into safer car fronts has been carried out under TRL contracts S220C/VF and S222C/VF (pedestrian protection test procedures and design) which cover the period between 1992 and 2002.
<P>

<a name="11025w18.html_para1">Related research on vehicle/pedestrian safety has taken place under TRL contracts S071M/VF (test requirements for bull bars) and S310B/VF (advanced adaptive safety systems).
<P>

<a name="11025w18.html_para2">Further work in this general area is being undertaken in three new projects under the Government's foresight programme. These include the SHORSEN and APVRU projects which look at advanced pedestrian detection systems, and PEDSALI, which examines the use of advanced materials for pedestrian-friendly bumpers.

We are studying the judgment carefully before deciding what action, if any, may be necessary. The judgment cannot become final for at least three months from its date of publication on 2 October, and there will be no immediate changes to the present situation at Heathrow or elsewhere. It is not the right time to hold meetings with any interested parties, but this may be possible at a later stage.

<a name="11025w19.html_para0">It is for local authorities to decide, in consultation with their tenants, whether they wish to pursue the available options for generating increased investment in the housing stock. In addition to housing transfer, additional resources are available through the arms length management (&#163;460 million available over the three years to 2003&#150;04) and Private Finance Initiatives (&#163;760 million over the three years).Where an authority has had an unsuccessful partial or whole housing transfer ballot it will be essential to understand the reasons why tenants voted against the transfer. There is no bar on these authorities revisiting transfer.

 Since the use of aircraft cabin air filters is not mandatory, an international agreement on the timing of their replacement is inappropriate. It is for airlines to select a suitable maintenance regime that would ensure industry or in-house performance standards are met.

 All bids for new schemes whether bypasses or other classes of scheme are assessed using the New Approach to Appraisal developed during the Roads Review in 1998. NATA is based on the five criteria that underlie our transport policies: environmental impact, safety, economy, accessibility and integration. NATA favours no particular class of scheme nor is it our policy to give special preference to bypasses, although I fully recognise the environmental benefits which such schemes can bring about.

<sup>(26)</sup> Both these programmes will be subsumed into 'single pot' for Regional Development Agencies from April 2002. The Department for Trade and Industry will have effective responsibility for all grant in aid to RDAs from November 2001.<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para0">'The Single Regeneration Budget' was based on a competitive bidding process but also included an indicative regional allocation. The methodology for determining the regional 'indicative' allocations from Round 2 onwards was:
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>50 per cent. based on region's share of district level deprivation, as set out in the Index of Local Conditions 1991 for areas with above average deprivation;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11025w20.html_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>50 per cent. based on region's share of 1993 population, again in areas with above average deprivation.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11025w20.html_para3">As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review 1998 there was a Public Service Agreement target that required 80 per cent. of the moneys to be spent in the 50 most deprived local authority areas as measured by the Index of Local Deprivation 1998.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para4">'The Land and Property Programme' includes an element of the Indices of Deprivation 2000 for the period 2001&#150;02 only. 80 per cent. of the budget was allocated on a criteria basis involving the use of seven indicators, one of which was based on the Indices of Deprivation 2000&#151;a 'deprived wards' indicator which captured the number of people living in the most deprived local authority districts. The Indices element therefore represents only a small aspect of the allocation methodology. No other indices were used in previous years, nor will they be used in future years due to the commencement of the new single pot for Regional Development Agencies from April 2002.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para5">'New Deal for Communities': The 1998 Index of Local Deprivation has been used as a basis for selection for Rounds 1 and 2 of this programme.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para6">The overall ranking measuring degree of deprivation at the district level was used as the main indicator for selection as it was the most up to date and robust. To ensure a good geographical spread, a regional quota system was applied in addition.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para7">'The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund' is distributed to authorities which figure in the 50 most deprived authorities against the six individual district level measures in the Indices of Deprivation 2000. This produces a list of 81 authorities, to which were added seven authorities not included in this list but which were in the 50 most deprived areas on any of the four measures under the Index of Local Deprivation 1998. The allocations are based on a standard amount per head of population living in the 10 per cent. most deprived wards nationally.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para8">'The Neighbourhood Management Pathfinder Programme' is targeted on areas selected from among authorities which include more than one ward in the worst 10 per cent. as measured by the Indices of Deprivation 2000, but excluding any local authority where there is a New Deal for Communities Partnership.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para9">'Housing Capital Allocations': The needs indices used in the allocation of these resources to local authorities (Generalised Needs Index) and Registered Social Landlords (Housing Needs Index) include an element of targeting of resources to deprived areas, based on the Index of Local Conditions 1991. The way in which the indices are constructed and used means that the targeting does not allocate a specific amount of the available resources. The targeting accounted for 30 per cent. of the Generalised Needs Index (before adjustment for regional cost variations) in 2001&#150;02. This was increased from 20 per cent. in earlier years as a result of the creation of Major Repairs Allowance to allocate resources for maintaining council housing; there is no targeting to deprived areas in these allocations. The targeting within the Housing Needs Index has been 15 per cent. throughout the period.
<P>

<a name="11025w20.html_para10">'Housing Revenue Account Subsidy': The maintenance allowance within this subsidy system includes a component based on the Index of Local Conditions 1991. This component has accounted for around 10 per cent. of the resources available for the maintenance allowance, which equates to around &#163;200 million, throughout the period.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2001]:</i> Neither DTLR nor HSE carries out routine checks at the port of entry on bulk fireworks entering Great Britain or on their destination.
