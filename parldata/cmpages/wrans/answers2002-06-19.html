 I have regular meetings with ministerial colleagues and discuss a range of issues including coal state aid, and understand the deep concerns of the people of Wales about the coal industry.
<P>

<a name="20619w02.html_para1">A new European framework for coal state aid, post July 2002, was agreed at the Energy Council on 7 June. We are particularly pleased, that we have been successful in negotiating the flexibility to pay investment aid, where appropriate. This allows support to be given for the development of economically viable mines. The new framework provides us with the basis on which to decide the future of coal policy in the UK, but discussion on the future of UK aid is still ongoing.

<P>
<a name="20619w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 Cardiff is Europe's youngest capital, a multicultural city which serves a country rich in both traditional and contemporary culture. Sense of place is a defining quality of Welsh culture.

 The Commonwealth Troika of Australia, Nigeria and South Africa suspended Zimbabwe from the Councils of the Commonwealth on 19 March 2002. The Troika had been mandated by Heads of Government to address Commonwealth concerns on Zimbabwe. Its decision will be reviewed after 12 months. We welcomed the Troika's decision to suspend Zimbabwe at the time, and support the ongoing efforts of Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo, and Prime Minister Howard, to resolve Zimbabwe's political problems.
<P>

<a name="20619w02.html_para3">The Troika set out what Zimbabwe needs to do for the suspension to be lifted. It also decided to facilitate dialogue between Zimbabwe's two main political parties so that legitimacy could be restored in Zimbabwe. Talks, facilitated by South Africa and Nigeria, were scheduled for 13 May but the ruling party withdrew at the last moment. We await further information on whether or not the dialogue will be resumed.

 The general policy is that computers in No. 10 have a three-year life cycle. On average, 60 have been replaced in each of the last three years. Since 2002, the replaced units, minus the hard drive, are given to charity. Costs of this can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

The Government played a key role in securing agreement for the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative at the Cologne summit in 1999, that aims to deliver a sustainable exit from debt for the world's poorest countries. At the G8 summit in Canada, the UK will continue to promote this aim and urge the G8, under the leadership of the Canadian Government, to make further progress on debt relief and ensure poor countries have a sustainable exit from debt. Ahead of the summit, the UK has outlined a number of proposals to strengthen HIPC, and in particular, has called for richer countries to provide an additional financial contribution for the HIPC initiative.

<a name="20619w02.html_para5">The G8 committed last year to looking at how their policies can support African efforts to reduce poverty and bring sustainable development to the continent. African countries have been engaged in developing the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which highlights the importance of sound political and economic governance. The UK has been active in arguing further concrete action, building on our existing strategies for conflict prevention and resolution, health and education, and of the importance of market access for African products. The G8 will come back with proposals in Kananaskis.

 I assume that the hon. Member is referring to what is now known as the learning credits scheme. This scheme comprises two forms of allowance: standard learning credits and enhanced learning credits.
<P>

<a name="20619w04.html_para5">The standard learning credits scheme (SLC) was launched on 1 April 1999 and operates on similar lines to the individual refund scheme (IRS) it replaced, but its value, &#163;175 per year, is 25 per cent. higher. Individuals must contribute at least 20 per cent. of the cost of any learning for which it is claimed. The SLC can, therefore, fund up to 80 per cent. of the cost of learning. This 80/20 split encourages development of individual understanding and buy-in to the learning process.

<P><I>19 Jun 2002 : Column 339W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20619w04.html_para6">Both the SLC and the IRS which preceded it are applicable to a wide range of learning purposes in support of an individual's personal development.

<a name="20619w04.html_para8">The second part of learning credits, which will be known as enhanced learning credits (ELC), complements the SLC scheme and is due to be launched on 1 April 2004. This is an imaginative and large-scale initiative to provide partial funding for personnel wishing to undertake academic or vocational education for their own personal development. ELC will enable personnel to access a considerably higher level of sponsorship than SLC and is available for a maximum of three claims (one in each of three separate years which need not be consecutive) during a service person's career and for up to 10 years after leaving the service.
<P>

<a name="20619w04.html_para9">The ELC scheme requires a minimum period of service in order to qualify and there are two levels of claim depending on length of service. The initial qualification period is four years' service after which an individual can claim the lower tier level of funding (&#163;1,000 pa). A further four years' service allows access to the higher tier of 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2002 : Column 340W</I><P>
funding (&#163;2,000 pa). As with the SLC scheme, an individual must show commitment to learning by funding at least 20 per cent. of the overall cost.
<P>

<a name="20619w04.html_para10">The enhanced learning credit scheme will enable the individual to make substantial plans for self improvement in a coherent and long-term fashion and will also encourage employing officers to factor major lifelong learning activities into a subordinate's personal development plan. This will have a positive effect on retention of personnel who wish to lay the foundations for success in their second career while maximising their military potential.
<P>

<a name="20619w04.html_para11">Based on the strength of the armed forces on 1 April 2002 (204,686) and the maximum available credit (&#163;175) the total cost of SLC if every service person were to apply would be some &#163;36 million. However, this does not take account of personnel on operations or already in intensive training who would be unlikely to claim; moreover, it does not reflect the historical take-up of the SLC scheme. Taking this into account, and using the latest figures in the table, a more realistic total cost would be some &#163;4 million.

<P>
<a name="20619w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> The RAF's Director of Elementary Flying Training is, and will continue to be, responsible for the Joint Elementary Flying Training School (JEFTS). JEFTS provides elementary flying training (EFT) for all three services (except for RAF graduate entrants who have completed EFT at a university air squadron), flying grading for the Army and multi-engine aircraft lead-in training for the RAF. RAF EFT is undertaken at RAF Church Fenton, Royal Navy and Army EFT is undertaken at RAF Barkston Heath, multi-engine lead-in training is undertaken at RAF Cranwell and flying grading for the Army is undertaken at the School of Army Aviation at Middle Wallop.
<P>

<a name="20619w05.html_para0">JEFTS use Firefly aircraft to meet all their training needs and these aircraft are provided by Babcock HCS. The contract to provide these aircraft expires on 7 July 2003. There is a need for a short four-year replacement contract to allow for the potential change to the way flying training will be delivered under the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System project planned to commence in 2007. The cost-effective way to deliver the task for the next four years is to undertake the RAF element of the EFT task at university air squadrons, where the majority of RAF pilots already undertake their EFT. The university air squadrons can absorb this work with only a small increase in activity at individual air squadrons, and it will result in a significant overall saving on the cost of providing EFT. The balance of the JEFTS task has been completed and the new contract will be let shortly.
<P>

<a name="20619w05.html_para1">The RAF will continue to maintain university air squadrons under the command of the Director of Elementary Flying Training. The RAF have recently undertaken a review of RAF university air Squadron

<a name="20619w05.html_para4">The NATO Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Reykjavik was an important step in the Alliance's preparation for the NATO Summit in Prague in November. Ministers agreed on the need further to adapt the Alliance to enhance its capacity to provide defence against the threat of terrorism; on the need to develop new defence capabilities; on the process for the enlargement of NATO; on the creation of a new security relationship with Russia; and on the development of NATO's relationships with Ukraine and its other partners.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> The Department has monitored the situation in California closely, and continues to do so. The underlying cause of the problems in the Californian electricity market appears to have been a shortage of generation capacity. By contrast, capacity margins in Great Britain are healthy and demand growth in GB has been much more modest than

it was in California. Overall, the Department believes a similar combination of circumstances is unlikely to occur in Great Britain, although the Department is not complacent. The Department and Ofgem set up a joint Security of Supply Working Group in July 2001 which, among other matters, is monitoring capacity issues carefully.

 Licences to export arms and other items whose export is controlled for strategic reasons are issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, acting through the Export Control Organisation (ECO). A decision has not yet been reached on export licence application number 32368, but will be taken as quickly as possible, consistent with the need to give full consideration to the issues involved including the status of end-users. The application is currently outstanding with our advisers.
<P>

<a name="20619w07.html_para0">The Government recognise that the system for processing export licence applications requires continuous improvement if we are to deliver a more efficient and effective export licensing system, which is both accountable and transparent. The ECO has introduced a number of initiatives to reduce the time taken to process export licence applications. These include the roll-out of new enhanced IT systems that will mean, for example, allowing exporters to apply for a standard individual export licence over the internet.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> The latest performance data for the cohorts of pupils taking Key Stages 1, 2 and 3 for all schools was published in May 2002 in the Statistical Bulletin "Statistics of Education: National Curriculum Assessments of 7, 11 & 14 year olds in England: 2001". The GCSE/GNVQ performance was also published in May 2002 in "GCSE/GNVQ and GCE A/AS/VCE/Advanced GNVQ Examination Results 2000/2001&#151;England". Both publications are available on the Department's website http://www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics. The Keystage and GCSE/GNVQ performance of schools with a small cohort is shown.

 The Government recognise that changes in care arrangements can disrupt the education of children who are looked after, and are determined to promote stability.
<P>

<a name="20619w08.html_para0">This Department, jointly with the Department of Health, issued guidance to all authorities in May 2000 on the education of children and young people in public care. The guidance emphasises the importance of a stable care and education placement in order to promote educational success for children in public care. The Department of Health also set targets within the Quality Protects programme to promote stability and reduce placement moves.
<P>

<a name="20619w08.html_para1">Under s22(3) of the Children Act, local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children and young people who are looked after, education being a critical dimension of their welfare. It is for local authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis whether it is in the best interests of a child in public care to remain in the same educational establishment.

 The Government's national child care strategy was introduced in May 1998 to ensure that affordable, accessible and quality child care is available in every neighbourhood and complements early education, schools and other family services. By March 2004, we will have created 900,000 new child care places for 1.6 million children which, taking into account turnover, should allow around 1 million extra children to benefit. We are working in particular to extend child care provision in disadvantaged areas through Neighbourhood Nurseries and other programmes, and to make it more affordable, through measures like the working families tax credit, under which lower income families can receive help with up to 70 per cent. of their eligible child care costs. Support with child care costs is a feature of the New Deal, particularly the New Deal for Lone Parents, and is also available to further and higher education student parents.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> In addition to holding qualified teacher status, teachers who are employed to teach classes of pupils with hearing impairment are required by regulations to undertake an additional specialist mandatory qualification (MQ). In July 1999, at the request of the then Secretary of State, the Teacher Training Agency carried out a review of existing arrangements in order to develop a new specification for MQ provision. The resulting specification, amended in light of consultation with a wide range of organisations, including those representing children with hearing impairment, requires teachers pursuing the hearing impairment MQ to acquire a minimum competence in signing equivalent to the stage one qualification offered by the Council for the Advancement of Communications with Deaf People.
<P>

<a name="20619w08.html_para3">Under the special educational needs category of the Department's standards fund, grant support is available to local education authorities and schools for training and professional development of teachers and other staff.

 The Department has not carried out a specific assessment of the potential link between the funding gap and the retention of academic staff in sixth form colleges. We are, however, aware of the funding gap between schools and the further education sector, and

remain committed to bringing up levels of funding for colleges over time and as resources allow. This issue is being considered as part of the current spending review.
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para0">We are investing significant funding in the FE sector, including more than &#163;310 million in the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) during the period 2001&#150;04 to allow colleges, including sixth form colleges to recruit, reward and retain, high quality teachers. A survey conducted by the Sixth Form Colleges' Employers' Forum has shown that 85 per cent. of eligible teaching staff are in receipt of a professional standards payment within TPI.

 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2002]:</i> The Green Paper "14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards" proposes a broader choice of learning options for young people during the 14&#150;19 phase of education. It recognises that in order to understand the range of choices open to them and their implications for future learning and career paths, young people will need additional advice and guidance, both from schools and the Connexions Service, at the beginning and throughout the 14&#150;19 phase. The Green Paper suggests that the start of the 14&#150;19 phase should begin with a review with each young person, to record achievements to date and identify learning and career goals through until age 19. It further proposes that the outcomes of the review should be recorded in an individual learning plan.
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para2">The consultation on the Green Paper ended on 31 May 2002. Ministers are currently reviewing the responses and, in the light of these, will make an announcement on the outcome of the consultation later this year.

 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2002]:</i> This is a proposal in the Green Paper "14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards". Consultation closed only on 31 May 2002 and we are reflecting carefully on the views expressed during consultation before reaching our decision. We have indicated in the Green Paper that curriculum changes would be subject to further consultation before their introduction.
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para3">Our proposals seek a balance between the need to offer pupils greater choice, and the importance of foreign languages. We propose a statutory entitlement to them in all schools. We have also expressed our aspirations to boost language learning in primary schools.

 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2002]:</i> Languages are already an option as part of a modern apprenticeship and can be included in the young person's training plan where they are deemed necessary or desirable, if the employer agrees.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2002]:</i> We have considered the findings of recent research including the final report of the Nuffield Languages Inquiry (2000); the University of Warwick, Centre for Language Teacher Education (CELTE) report on the analysis and evaluation for teaching of modern foreign languages at Key Stage 2 in England, (2000) and the European Commission's survey of the languages spoken in the EU 'Eurobarometer 54', (2001).
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para5">These reports have informed our aspirations for the future of teaching and learning languages outlined in our 'Language Learning' pamphlet and the discussions of the Languages National Steering Group.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In answer to my hon. Friend's question, the following two tables show the initial capital costs of each city technology college (CTC), including Emmanuel, and each approved academy. As far as academies are concerned, five have signed funding agreements with the Secretary of State. These projects are still at a very early stage and their final capital costs will not be known until much further into their construction stages.
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para6">Year-on-year running costs for CTCs and academies are met by the Department. As charitable companies, CTCs and academies are also free to generate additional income through charitable donations or any trading arms to supplement departmental funding. For CTCs, the first table gives the total amount of sponsorship, including any initial costs, provided to each college up until February 2002, as reported to my Department. Similar information will be collected on academies once they begin to operate.
<P>

<a name="20619w09.html_para7">There are no continuing financial obligations on CTC or academy sponsors beyond the initial contribution to capital costs. However, CTCS are required to meet at least 20 per cent. of the costs of any capital project funded by the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make it her policy to require children to declare that they have received parental support on the cover sheet of public examinations.  [62857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The awarding bodies already require teachers to confirm that they have taken steps to satisfy themselves that coursework assessed for public examinations is solely that of the candidates concerned. Teachers must present a written declaration that a candidate's coursework was produced under the required conditions.

<a name="20619w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Allen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what arrangements are made for the transfer of assets, land and buildings, when voluntary aided and voluntary controlled schools close.  [62842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The normal pattern of property ownership at a voluntary aided or voluntary controlled school is for the trustees to own the site and buildings and for the local education authority to own the playing fields. When a voluntary aided or voluntary controlled school closes, the playing fields remain the property of the local education authority but what happens to the site and buildings depends on the type of school and the circumstances of the closure.
<P>

<a name="20619w10.html_para0">When a church voluntary school which is located on its original site closes, the Secretary of State may be asked to make an order under section 554 of the Education Act 1996, which allows the diocese in which the school is situated to use proceeds from the sale for the benefit of other church schools within its area.
<P>

<a name="20619w10.html_para1">However, where a local education authority has provided new or additional premises for a voluntary school, the local education authority may later claim compensation from the proceeds of sale of the former premises. If the local education authority and the trustees are unable to reach agreement on the amount of compensation the local education authority should receive, the Secretary of State may be asked to determine the amount.
<P>

<a name="20619w10.html_para2">Where the trustees of a voluntary school have given notice to terminate the school's occupation of any land, the Secretary of State may require the trustees to repay to the Department any funds it has provided, or to transfer to the local education authority any part of the premises it needs for educational purposes. The Secretary of State may require the local education authority to pay compensation to the trustees, or vice versa, depending on whether she has ordered land to be transferred to the local education authority, and on the extent of any public expenditure on the premises.

<P>
<a name="20619w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills does not collect figures on the number of schools which hold sports days. School sports days have an important role to play as part of an overall package of PE and sport opportunities provided by schools for all children. Work being undertaken by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority suggests that the vast majority of schools do hold an annual sports day or a similar event.
<P>

<a name="20619w10.html_para3">Physical education is compulsory within the National Curriculum at all Key Stages for all pupils. Schools must provide PE in accordance with the subject's programme of study. Guidance on Key Stage 3, published by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Department for Education and Skills, indicates that the programme of study could be delivered within 90 minutes. Our White Paper "Schools: achieving success" includes a commitment that all children will be entitled to two hours of high quality physical education and school sport a week, within and outside the curriculum.
<P>

<a name="20619w10.html_para4">The school sports co-ordinators programme brings together partnerships of schools. These are championing new PE and sport opportunities for young people. One of the key aims is to increase the amount of inter and intra-school sport which does, of course include schools sport days, both within school and with other partner schools.

 Following the launch of new generation modern apprenticeships last November, a &#163;16 million marketing campaign is under way, to be run over three years in England, to promote apprenticeships and boost participation. The first part of the campaign ran during March with a new television advertisement, aimed at young people. It generated over 100,000 phone and e-mail responses. A further round of TV advertising starts on 5 August.
<P>

<a name="20619w11.html_para0">In addition, a range of marketing measures is being introduced to reach not only young people, but also key influencers and employers. At the local level, learning and skills councils, connexions partnerships, careers services and other partners will work together to raise awareness of, and foster support for, modern apprenticeships; and to provide young people with essential information and advice on the opportunities available in their communities. It is a key role of the new sector skills councils in partnership with the LSC to ensure that employers continue to support MA and that they provide sufficient places to meet the demand from young people.

 I am today publishing proposals to implement provisions in schedule 6 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act to enable the closure or diversion of rights of way where this is necessary for crime prevention or to promote pupil and teacher safety. These new powers will enable highway authorities to address the disruption caused by persistent criminal activity in back alleys, or gulleys, on housing estates.
<P>

<a name="20619w11.html_para3">As these important new powers are not regarded as a first response to tackling crime, we will designate areas where the new crime prevention powers will be available. Highway authorities will normally take the lead, working with local crime and disorder reduction partnerships, police authorities, local residents and user groups to formulate a submission to the Secretary of State advocating any area at ward level that may warrant inclusion in a designation order. In country areas, the district authority or the local crime and disorder reduction partnership may be able to make a submission if the county is unwilling to do so.
<P>

<a name="20619w11.html_para4">The new schools provisions will enable a highway authority to close or divert a right of way, where it crosses school land, for the purpose of protecting pupils or staff from violence or other risks to their health and safety. These provisions are not subject to the designation process and will be available throughout England.
<P>

<a name="20619w11.html_para5">I am also publishing proposals to implement section 63 of the Act. These new provisions will ensure that members of the public have a means to compel highway authorities to use their powers to remove certain types of obstruction.

 Since 1997 there has been a moratorium on the use of badger culling as a bovine tuberculosis control mechanism in GB, except for the culling that takes place under the badger culling trial.
<P>

<a name="20619w13.html_para3">The Government have no plans to suspend the badger culling trial which is an essential element of the Government's wide ranging research and control strategy for dealing with bovine tuberculosis (TB). The role of the badger in the epidemiology of cattle TB is unresolved and emotive. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate, once and for all, the extent to which badgers contribute to bovine TB and the effects of badger culling on the disease. It will also provide epidemiological data on the occurrence and prevalence of TB in badgers, its relationship to population density and the spatial relationship between TB-infected badgers and TB breakdowns in cattle herds.

<P>
<a name="20619w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The importation of meat is permitted from a limited number of third countries where foot and mouth disease is present and where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specified regions. Community rules permit imports from those regions of the relevant countries that are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk may be imported from other regions subject to strict controls and veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. UK domestic rules currently prohibit the import of meat from Zimbabwe where FMD outbreaks have been recently confirmed. The UK regulations governing the imports of these products are the Products of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) (England) Regulation 2002.

We do not collect information on the routine disposal of fallen stock, but the state veterinary service carried out small-scale surveys in the years 1998&#150;2000. The results, which may not be representative, suggest that the following proportions of fallen cattle and sheep were burned or buried on farm in Great Britain over those years; adult bovines ranged from 15&#150;20 per cent.; calves 20&#150;25 per cent. and sheep 65&#150;75 per cent.

 The UK Government have been working to reduce the tariffs that apply to developing country goods entering the EU. For example, the UK played a central role in establishing the Everything But Arms initiative that will provide the 49 least developed countries with duty and quota free access to the EU for all goods except arms. In addition, the UK is pushing the EU to be as generous as possible in current economic partnership negotiations with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries under Cotonou agreement. However, high tariffs remain on many goods of export interest to developing countries. In order to tackle such barriers, a new trade round was launched at the fourth WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November last year

 The Southern African countries identified by the World Food Programme as needing special assistance following reductions in agricultural production are Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. The number of people in these countries requiring emergency food supplies is expected to grow by March 2003 to 12.8 million. Winter crops now in the ground will meet only a small proportion of the food shortfall. Planting of the main maize crop begins in November with the onset of the rains. Prospects for the 2003 crop will largely depend on the amount and distribution of this rain, and on agricultural and economic policy in Zimbabwe where much of this year's shortfall has occurred.

 The Government believe that credit unions have an important role to play to encourage the accumulation of savings, provide affordable credit and, through their unique position, help tackle financial exclusion. That is why we have been involved in a number of measures designed to help the movement develop and grow. In October 2001 we published a consultation document containing seven deregulatory proposals, to which we received a significant number of

We are currently drafting an order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2000 that should bring the remaining three proposals into force later this year. These measures will help credit unions offer their members a greater range of services and compete more effectively for deposits.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking to establish an infrastructure for cross-border payments in euros.  [63056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w18.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Developing cross-border payments infrastructure is the responsibility of the banks. I am aware that UK banks are fully participating in the European banking industry's co-ordinated initiative to produce a single European market for payments, and welcome this action which should improve the current, sometimes poor, level of cross-border payments service which consumers receive.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the impact of not including sterling in the EU regulation on cross-border payments in euros.  [63055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The UK believes a competition-based approach to the problem of market failure in cross-border payments is the right one. The EU regulation could result in banks having to charge less for a service than it costs them to provide and may well give rise to perverse (potentially counter-productive) effects that harm consumers. For example, some banks may withdraw from offering the service altogether, or alternatively attempt to off-set losses made on cross-border payment transactions by increasing the cost of domestic payment costs. Thus, by not including sterling denominated payments in the scope of the regulation, these counter-productive effects are minimised.
<P>

<a name="20619w18.html_para0">It is too early to quantify the full impact of not including sterling denominated payments in the scope of the regulation. The main aspect of the regulation, article 3, which requires institutions to charge the same for euro cross-border payments as for euro domestic payments, does not take effect until July 2002 and July 2003 for electronic payments and credit transfers respectively. However, we will keep the situation under review.

 The UK, with the EU and the US uses every opportunity to raise cases of religious persecution with the Turkmen Government. Our ambassador, together with EU and US ambassadors called on the Foreign Minister in February, May, July and December 2001 to protest at the continued imprisonment of a senior Baptist and to call for his release on humanitarian grounds. The prisoner was released two weeks after the December meeting. Our ambassador has also recently requested a meeting with the Turkmen Foreign Minister to discuss religious persecution and other issues.

We also plan to open an embassy in Bishkek in 2003, and a diplomat will be posted to Bishkek to supervise the setting up of the mission. The embassy in Tashkent has been reinforced with a defence attache. We have recently reinforced the embassy in Ashgabat with a drugs liaison officer, and a regional defence attache has been posted to Almaty.

 The key consideration for EU accession is the fulfilment of the Copenhagen political and economic criteria, and the adoption of requisite EU legislation (acquis communautaires). In assessing candidates' readiness for accession, HMG takes into account the candidates' alignment with the acquis and the Copenhagen criteria as well as other relevant sources of information. Some of the Copenhagen criteria cover similar ground to key COE principles: human rights, rule of law and pluralist democracy. All Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) resolutions are brought to the attention of the Governments of all the Council of Europe member states. The resolutions play an important role in ensuring COE member states meet core COE Standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 20 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 42W, why the practice of up-rating basic state pension increments in line with the percentage increase in the rest of the basic pension was not followed in April 2001; and why the practice was resumed in April 2002.  [62608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Once retirement pension is in payment, social security legislation requires that the value of all the components of RP must be uprated each year by at least the level of price inflation, which was 3.3 per cent. for the April 2001 uprating. In accordance with that requirement, all increments, including basic pension increments were uprated by 3.3 per cent., while basic state pension was increased by substantially more than the rate of price inflation.
<P>

<a name="20619w21.html_para5">For the April 2002 uprating we decided that the more generous uprating should also apply to increments.

[62626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We assumed that fluctuations in the rate of inflation are consistent with predicted inflation from the Treasury Economic Assumptions (of January 2002) until the year 2008, after which we assume long-run inflation is constant each year at 2.5 per cent. Thus inflation rates after 2008 are assumed to never be below 2.5 per cent.

 One of the key features of stakeholder pensions is the 1 per cent. charge. The calculation of the charge by reference to a daily amount is the best way of taking an average 1 per cent. of the member's fund over a year.

To ask the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, pursuant to the answer of 10 June 2002 [Ref 59084] from the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what the format and procedures will be of non-statutory public inquiries into the proposed asylum accommodation centres; and if he will make a statement.  [61275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Pursuant to the reply given by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes), no planning notifications in respect of the proposed developments have yet been referred to the Secretary of State for determination under the procedures set out in DoE circular 18&#150;84. The circular sets out the various ways in which a dispute between the local planning authority and the developing Department may be determined. These are by means of written representations, a meeting chaired by an official of my Office, or a non-statutory public inquiry. The circular acknowledges that where there is evidence of interest of other parties it may be desirable to hold a non-statutory public inquiry.
<P>

<a name="20619w23.html_para11">Where the Secretary of State holds a non-statutory public inquiry under the circular, his practice is to follow the procedure in the Inquiries Procedure Rules which apply to local inquiries held into planning applications and appeals under the Town and Country Planning Act. The current rules are the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000. He would, of course, abide by the principles of natural justice and human rights at all times. After any public inquiry, the inspector would submit a report to the Secretary of State who would then determine the dispute.

<a name="20619w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We are keen to promote and support local authorities in developing local partnerships with each other, and across the public sector. Such partnerships will be crucial in building services around the needs of citizens and customers, and in realising the economies of scale in terms of the investment requirement to see the objectives of e-government realised.
<P>

<a name="20619w24.html_para3">As part of our commitment to spend &#163;350 million over three years to support local government online, we have made provision for &#163;75 million over the next two years to support the development of e-government partnerships. From this amount we intend to provide some &#163;47 million over the next two years to 64 local partnerships that submitted proposals to my Department. Details of the individual allocations will be placed in the Library.

<P>

<a name="20619w24.html_para4">We will also provide a &#163;2 million programme of practical support over the next two years, to ensure that these partnerships are successful in achieving their aims and that the lesson learned from them are disseminated.
<P>

<a name="20619w24.html_para5">It is our intention to make available the remaining funds (&#163;26 million) for further partnership proposals later in the year.
<P>

In addition to this, the DfES has so far designated 142 specialist sports colleges, and has set a target of 250 colleges by 2005.

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for the Arts has today published the first stage report of the joint quinquennial review of the Museum of London, the Horniman Museum and the Geffrye Museum.
<P>

<a name="20619w25.html_para11">The report examines the roles and functions of the museums, and how these functions contribute to the delivery of wider DCMS and Governmental objectives. It confirms that the three museums are contributing strongly to the delivery of the Government's educational and social policy objectives. All three museums have potential to perform a regional or sub-regional role.
<P>

<a name="20619w25.html_para12">The publication of the report marks the end of the first stage of the review. The second stage will take forward the recommendations of the first stage and consider how the museums' services and functions could be provided more efficiently and effectively in the future.

This corresponds to an average annual increase of 4.2 per cent. between 2000 and 2020. To reflect the uncertainties inherent in producing such long term forecasts, high and low scenarios were also produced showing projected passenger numbers in 2020 of 461 million and 349 million respectively.

 Pilot schemes to test the powers under section 74A of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 began in Camden and Middlesbrough on 4 March 2002.

<a name="20619w26.html_para3">We appointed consultants (Halcrow) to study the effect of these schemes upon disruption caused by utility works and the costs which it imposes on those utilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There is a wide range of guidance on the construction (including assessment, design and installation), maintenance and control of traffic lights contained in the Highways Agency's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges and in Local Transport Notes and Traffic Advisory Leaflets issued directly from my Department. This covers traffic signals at both junctions and pedestrian crossings. In addition, there is much material on this subject contained in primary and secondary legislation, and also in equipment specifications issued by the Highways Agency. A list of the relevant documents has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Site circumstances can affect the cost of constructing crossings by a substantial amount. However, for the simplest pelican, puffin or zebra crossing the costs 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2002 : Column 426W</I><P>
would be in the region of &#163;24,000, &#163;27,000 and &#163;7,500 respectively. This would include necessary design, equipment and civil engineering costs for a crossing on a typical 30 mph urban road. It would also include high skid resistance surfacing. For higher speed roads the zebra crossing would not be suitable and an additional cost of &#163;10,000, for additional equipment and works, should be added to the pelican and puffin costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The cost of upgrading a pelican to a puffin crossing will vary from site to site, depending on the number of pedestrian signals to be changed and the number of special pedestrian detectors required. Depending on the age of the installation there may also be a need to change the controller, cabling, posts, etc. However, the simplest conversion would be in the region of &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The impact of pedestrian crossings on traffic speeds will depend on where the crossings are in the network. It is for local highway authorities to assess effects on the local road network.
<P>

<a name="20619w26.html_para7">Because many crossings will be located at sites which do not lead to significant interruptions to traffic flow, the impact on overall journey times from such crossings will be minimal.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department first adopted a target 'to increase continued contact between children and the non-resident parent after a family breakdown, where this is in the best interest of the child', following the 2000 Spending Review.

 I apologise for the delay in replying. The cost to public funds of running the Immigration Appellate Authority for the year 2000&#150;01 was &#163;35.4 million. This does not, however, take account of accommodation costs and costs for court service provided services such as personnel and training.

However, progress could be patchy as implementation of the NSF for CHD to date has focused on the immediate priorities. In due course, the commission of health improvement will provide an independent assessment of progress, including a specific review of the NSF for CHD.

<a name="20619w27.html_para8">With the focus on the immediate priorities, progress in the management of heart failure has not been as rapid as that in other areas. However, heart failure will be one of our key priorities during the middle phase of the overall 10-year NSF implementation programme. We are currently developing more detailed plans for improving services. We will consider whether there is a need for any additional milestones as part of this process.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent estimate he has made of the percentage of people below the age of 24 using a condom when engaging in sexual intercourse; what the average age is at which young people in the UK have their first sexual experience; and what percentage of new HIV infections in the UK since 1997 were among people under the age of 24 years.

 The second national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (Natsal 2000) provides the best available evidence about current sexual behaviour. It was based on a survey of over 11,000 males and females aged 16 to 44 across Britain.
<P>

<a name="20619w28.html_para0">Key findings were that 83 per cent. of males and 80 per cent. of females aged between 16 and 19 and 77 per cent. of males and 76 per cent. of females aged between 20 and 24, at the time of interview, reported using a condom at first intercourse.
<P>

<a name="20619w28.html_para1">The median age of first intercourse among those aged between 16 and 19 at the time of interview was 16, for both males and females. Less than one-third of young people reported having sex before age 16.

 The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease and receives its funding via the Department for Trade and Industry. The Department has asked the MRC to develop a broad strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The MRC will be appointing an independent scientific advisory group which will include scientists with expertise in areas such as epidemiology, physiology, immunology, infections, clinical trials and psychological medicine. The MRC will be consulting with its consumer liaison group members as to the best means by which patient and charity perspectives can be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20619w28.html_para3">The Department has not recently funded any research specifically into the causes of CFS/ME. The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service. However, the Department is supporting research on cognitive behavioural therapy in CFS and on family focused cognitive behavioural therapy for adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome. Recently completed departmental- funded research projects on ME include a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of treatments and interventions for patients with CFS/ME.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will amend the Health and Social Care Act 2001 so that its powers cannot apply to the wider use and disclosure of genetic data without the consent of the patient; and if he will make a statement.  [59221]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w28.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 already provides safeguards to prevent confidential patient data being disclosed unnecessarily and the flexibility to introduce others where appropriate. The patient information advisory group will advise me, following discussion with the Human Genetics Commission, where additional safeguards are necessary.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w28.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Activity in this area is already regulated by the provisions of the Data Protection Act, the Human Rights Act and common law requirements. Where common law requirements are replaced by the regulatory code introduced through section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, there is flexibility to introduce a wide range of restrictions if appropriate. The Government are studying the Human Genetics Commission's report, "Inside Information&#151;Balancing Interests in the Use of Personal Genetic Data", and notes that it makes no specific recommendations in relation to the disclosure of medical genetic data.

[60389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Primary care trusts are responsible for securing health services for their local population and are accountable to strategic health authorities for discharging their functions effectively, including their commissioning responsibilities. In addition, the national primary and care trust development programme was established last year to support the organisational development of primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="20619w29.html_para0">Primary care trusts will be expected to honour existing agreements (financial and otherwise) previously negotiated by regional specialised commissioning groups and other specialised service commissioners. In 2002&#150;03 regional specialised commissioning groups will also have a specific role in developing primary care trust capacity to commission specialised services as part of a planned transition to successor arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20619w29.html_para1">It is important to ensure that primary care trusts provide high quality public health services. Each primary care trust will have a director of public health and a multi- disciplinary health team whose focus will be on improving health and tackling inequalities.

<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2002 : Column 435W</I><P>
with whom they consulted before presenting this statement; and what calculations they have made of the percentage of turnover such products represent for a typical specialist health food retailer.  [60200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20619w29.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 During preparation of the partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA), the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) visited a number of retail outlets, including health food shops, pharmacies and supermarkets. The Agency's broad assessment was that, typically, herbal remedies often form part of a wider range of products including for example, vitamins, minerals, other nutrients, organic food and a varied range of other herbal products that would not be classified as medicines. Clearly the proportion of shelf space allocated to herbal remedies varies significantly as between different retailers.
<P>

<a name="20619w29.html_para2">The partial RIA is currently under consultation and the Agency would welcome quantified information from retailing interests about the proportion of overall sales which relates to over the counter herbal remedies, that is remedies where the active ingredients are herbal only.
<P>

<a name="20619w29.html_para3">The MCA continues to receive feedback from key organisations in the herbal sector, such as UK manufacturers of traditional herbal remedies, that the introduction of the standards proposed in the directive is necessary if the long-term prosperity of the sector is to be maintained.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has had a wide range of discussions with a large number of interest groups from the herbal sector during development work on the proposed directive on traditional herbal medicinal products. Among those involved have been representatives of manufacturers, retailers, consumers, herbal and other complementary medicine practitioners, pharmacists and a range of individuals with relevant expertise. Interest groups from the health food sector taking part have included the National Association of Health Stores, Consumers for Health Choice, the Health Food Manufacturers's Association (HFMA) and the Institute of Health Food Retailing. In addition to meetings instigated by the MCA, the agency has participated in various conferences and meetings organised by external parties, such as the HFMA and the herbal registration forum, to discuss the implications of the emerging proposals.

 Appropriate antibiotic treatment should cure all uncomplicated gonococcal infections. However, increasing antimicrobial resistance undermines the effectiveness of treatment and means that the range of drugs available to treat the disease is reduced. We are funding a three-year project, the gonococcal resistance to antimicrobials surveillance programme (GRASP), to develop a national network to systematically monitor levels of antimicrobial resistance in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20619w29.html_para8">This enhanced surveillance programme provides a range of data that cannot be obtained from current surveillance systems and a means for more detailed monitoring of disease epidemiology. In addition, the clinical data and outcomes provide a mechanism for monitoring quality of clinical care, adherence to antibiotic prescribing policies and treatment guidelines.

 The absence of guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) does not prevent the national health service using new drugs or technologies.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> The Department has made no assessment of the relative cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In general, PCI is a less expensive procedure. It is a less invasive procedure for the patient allowing for a quicker recovery and requiring a shorter hospital stay. The decision as to which procedure is appropriate is a clinical one based on an assessment of the individual patient, and for patients who are not suitable for PCI, coronary artery bypass graft may be the only appropriate intervention.
