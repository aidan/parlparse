 The Department for Education and Skills has lead responsibility for implementing the report, together with other interested departments.

 The people's panel was set up as a representative sample of the adult population of the UK who agreed to be involved in surveys and other forms of research about their views on, and attitudes to, public services and similar matters of public interest.

<a name="10720w01.html_para9">The individuals who comprise the panel are under no obligation to participate in surveys or other studies, and have no responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="10720w01.html_para10">We have long been committed to evaluation of the panel, as a new initiative, and a small-scale evaluation was conducted last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many cases investigated and rejected by <i>(a)</i> the local government and <i>(b)</i> the parliamentary ombudsmen that have subsequently gone to judicial review have been successful and found in the complainant's favour; and if he will make a statement.  [6210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally. However, I would refer the hon. Gentlemen to general information on caseload which is published in the ombudsmen's annual reports.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w01.html_wqn10"><B> Judy Mallaber: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what action he intends to take following the consultation exercise on the review of the public sector ombudsmen in England.  [6445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 This Government are committed to the renaissance of public services, improving access and delivery and driving up standards. The effective handling of complaints is an important element of this programme of renewal, but there will be times where, having pursued a complaint about a particular public service, a complainant remains dissatisfied. Such cases need to be considered independently and that role is fulfilled by, among others, the public sector ombudsmen in England that were the subject of this review. These ombudsmen comprise the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Health Service Commissioner and the Commission for Local Administration (which comprises the three local government ombudsmen and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ex officio).
<P>

<a name="10720w01.html_para13">In 1999, following representations from the ombudsmen, the Government announced a review to determine whether the present arrangements are in the best interest of complainants and others, against the background of moves towards more integrated public services and an increasing focus on the needs of the consumers of such services. The review team consulted widely and their report was published in April 2000. A consultation paper seeking views on the review's main recommendations and its other conclusions was published last June. In all we received 174 responses to the consultation paper and copies will be placed shortly in the Library of the House together with a statement of the Government's conclusions.
<P>

<a name="10720w01.html_para14">Briefly, these are that, in light of the responses received to the consultation paper, the Government are satisfied that there is broad support for the review's main recommendations.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 465W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10720w01.html_para15">We therefore intend to replace the existing arrangements by a unified and flexible ombudsman body for central and local government and the national health service (excluding NHS Pensions, which will continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the pensions ombudsman, established by Part X of the Pensions Schemes Act 1993 (as amended)). In line with the review's recommendations, there will be direct access to this new body irrespective of whether the complaint is concerned wholly or in part with a central Government body. Furthermore, and again in line with the review's recommendations, the new body will have a collegiate structure within which the individual ombudsmen are identified with a particular group of the bodies under jurisdiction but free to carry out crosscutting investigations. Proposals for the precise powers and accountability of the new body, and on whether its jurisdiction should be extended beyond the bodies subject to the Jurisdiction of the existing ombudsmen, will be published in due course.

<P>

 The Advisory Committee on Economic and Social Research Overseas (ESCOR) was constituted in 1968 (administratively, and not by statute). It provides advice on research proposals submitted for funding to the Department for International Development. It came to be classified as a non-departmental public body (NDPB) in the early 1980s. However,

<P>

<a name="10720w03.html_para1">members are not paid for their services;

It will be re-constituted on the same lines as those Committees.

 The Commission on Intellectual Property Rights held full meetings in London on 8 to 9 May and on 4 July. On 8 May, the Commission received oral and written submissions from UK Government Departments, from industry representatives and from development charities. Otherwise, the meetings were used to prepare and finalise the Commission's work programme up until March 2002, when it is expected to present its report.
<P>

<a name="10720w04.html_para4">In addition to these full meetings of the Commission, Dr. Mashelkar visited South Africa at the end of May to discuss IPR issues in general and South African views on access to medicines in particular; while Professor Correa and Professor Barton visited Brussels and Geneva at the beginning of July to meet with representatives from, among others, the European Commission, UNCTAD, WTO, WIPO, WHO and delegations from developing and developed countries.
<P>

<a name="10720w04.html_para5">The work programme which the Commission is now pursuing essentially comprises a programme of technical studies by leading international experts as well as consultations with interested parties from Government, the private sector and civil society around the world.

<a name="10720w05.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Good Friday Agreement both mandated and enabled the Government to pursue a process of normalisation. The general reduction in the level of threat has made it possible to return the security profile across much of Northern Ireland to that consistent with a normal, peaceful society. Troop levels are at their lowest for over 30 years; the Army has closed or demolished 25 bases since the Agreement and withdrawn from another 10 it shared with the RUC; routine military patrolling has reduced by over 50 per cent. Full and final implementation of all outstanding issues should return a secure, peaceful and prosperous society to Northern Ireland. However, the serious threat still posed by dissident terrorist organisations which remain opposed to the Agreement has prevented the community in certain parts of Northern Ireland from benefiting from the kind of progress enjoyed elsewhere.

<P>
<a name="10720w05.html_spnew8"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 For operational reasons it would be inappropriate to place in the public domain the exact numbers of the new model baton rounds held by the police or old model baton rounds that have been withdrawn. However the old model baton rounds have been withdrawn and are temporarily held in secure premises until arrangements are made for their return to the military.

<P>

 A spent plastic bullet round does have 'rifling' detail on the round after firing. However, because plastic does not hold the exact detail of the marks the round cannot be identified with a specific riot gun.

 The Belgian Federal Police have agreed, as has been the case for the last three years, to lend two water cannon to the RUC during the marching season. They have been provided free of charge on a mutual aid basis between EU police forces. Last year RUC Land Rovers were supplied to the Belgian police for Euro 2000, on a similar basis. The only costs involved are shipping, insurance and maintenance costs amounting to approximately &#163;14,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w05.html_spnew11"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The death of Mr. Notarantonio was fully investigated by the RUC at the time and I understand that there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution. However, a murder investigation is not closed until those responsible for the crime have been brought to justice. As no one has yet been convicted for the murder of Mr. Notarantonio the investigation therefore remains open. Additionally Sir John Stevens is currently conducting an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Patrick Finucane and the terms of reference of this inquiry also cover the allegations of collusion in the murders of individuals like Mr. Notarantonio.

 Percussion grenades, often referred to as stun grenades, are ACPO/Home Office approved equipment held by Specialist Firearms Teams throughout the United Kingdom. In the Royal Ulster Constabulary, stun grenades are available for use in hostage type situations. None has been fired operationally in the last 12 months. For operational reasons it would be inappropriate to place figures relating to the exact amount of grenades issued to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. However 201 have been issued for training purposes of which 101 have been fired in the last 12 months. The use of this weapon would be authorised at least at Regional Assistant Chief Constable level. Rules and Guidance are provided under the association of Chief Police Officers' Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms.

 The participants at the Weston Park talks discussed the implementation of the Belfast Agreement. Participants in the talks were invited on the basis that they were parties to that Agreement. I am content that inviting participants on this basis was fully compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998.

 The security situation along the interface areas in North Belfast remains tense with nightly attacks on houses being carried out by both sides of the community. The security forces are maintaining a high presence in the area in an attempt to keep rival factions apart and calm the situation. Over 160 police officers have been injured as a result of attack from a barrage of missiles including blast bombs, bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and acid bombs. The Government have called on all those with influence in their communities to bring this mindless violence and thuggish behaviour to an end before someone is seriously injured or loses their life.

 We propose to open visa liaison offices in Jalandhar (Punjab) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat). The objective behind this initiative is to make our visa services in India more accessible to our customers. The offices, which will be staffed by locally employed personnel, will assist applicants in completing visa application formalities and offering guidance on visa related matters to those who need it. We also hope that entry clearance officers from Delhi and Bombay will visit the offices on a regular basis to assess the visa applications of those who would find it difficult to undertake the long journey to one of our visa issuing posts, such as old and infirm applicants.

To answer this question for all 164 posts we would have to ask those additional posts to extract the information requested. Given that these posts are smaller it is unlikely that many of them will pre-sift applications.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs confirmed to Dr. Adalberto Rodriquez Giarvarini, Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, during their talks in London on 17 July that, in response to commitments made by the Argentine Minister of Defence, Dr. Horacio Jaunarena, in Buenos Aires on 6 July, to strengthen the civilian scientific elements of Argentina's Antarctic programme, the UK would join a consensus on the location of the proposed Antarctic Treaty Secretariat. This was relayed to the recent meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXIV) in St. Petersburg. The texts of the Argentine and UK Statements of 6 July and 17 July respectively have been deposited in the Library of the House.

<a name="10720w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK remains in close contact with other Antarctic Treaty Parties and the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) to ensure adequate regulation of tourism activities, within the jurisdictional constraints peculiar to Antarctica. Under the Antarctic Act 1994 the UK requires tourist voyages undertaken by UK flagged vessels and tourist parties organised in the United Kingdom to obtain permits from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The FCO closely monitors compliance with the permit conditions. The UK is the sole government sponsor of the most comprehensive monitoring programme in the Antarctic Peninsula area aimed at determining what impact tourism might have on environmental and wildlife values.

 Since our human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities started in 1997, there have been some signs of progress. While these can not be attributed entirely to the dialogue itself, we believe that our dialogue with China, along with that of the EU and a number of other partners, has contributed to this process. Progress includes:

<P>
<a name="10720w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 UN sanctions on Iraq can only be lifted when Iraq complies with its obligations under Security Council resolutions, including on disarmament. To date, Iraq has refused to do so. Resolution 1284, a UK initiative, introduced the prospect of sanctions suspension, if Iraq co-operates with UN weapons inspectors to a standard well short of that required for sanctions lift. Again, Iraq refuses to engage. In an effort to alleviate the plight of the Iraqi people, the UK and US recently proposed changes to the sanctions regime. Under our proposals there would be no sanctions on ordinary imports, only controls on military and weapons-related goods. Despite widespread international support for this approach, the Security Council was unable to agree the details of the new arrangements earlier this month. But we remain serious about addressing the welfare needs of the Iraqi people and focusing controls on Iraq's weapons. We will continue to work for the adoption of the new approach as soon as possible.

 The Assistant Administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) visited in September 2000. There were monthly visits by MOD staff or military personnel to Diego Garcia and we expect that pattern to continue over the next year. We also expect that the Commissioner, Administrator and Assistant Administrator will make visits over the next 12 months.

<a name="10720w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We have a regular and on-going dialogue with the Colombian Government about the human rights situation in Colombia. Most recently, British Embassy officials in Bogota raised our concerns about the vulnerability of the peace communities in the Department of Choco with the Human Rights Unit of the Vice Presidency's office (on 16 July 2001), and HM Ambassador wrote to the Vice Presidency on 4 July about the disappearance and murder of indigenous leaders in Cauca, expressing his concern and asking the Colombian authorities to investigate and prevent a repetition. In June 2001, the UK and its EU partners strongly supported the proposal of an expanded International Labour Organisation mandate and presence in Colombia to report on trade union rights and the security of trade union members to verify measures taken by the Colombian Government to protect them. This solution was fully endorsed by the Workers Group, the Colombian Government and all the other parties. We regularly discuss forced displacement and the problems it causes; we have made no recent representations to the Colombian Government specifically about land ownership.

 There are 30 UK Diplomatic and military staff accredited in Colombia. This includes the Defence Attach&#233;, his two assistants and the Head of Security at the British Embassy. As at 18 July 2001, 22 of these staff were in Colombia; there are no other UK military personnel in Colombia.

 In its reply to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee's Seventh Report, the Government concluded that progress on the introduction of resource accounting in the Highways Agency was slower than expected and that there were shortcomings in both the procurement of consultancy support and the management of the project. The costs of implementing resource accounting in the agency reflect the agency's large and complex asset base valued at some &#163;60 billion, and its annual capital and revenue budget of approximately &#163;1.5 billion. The agency has dealt with the concerns raised and put in place robust systems and procedures for the future management of its contracts. Financial recovery was not an appropriate response. Appropriate managerial action was taken with the civil servant concerned.

 The 10 Year Plan sets out the funding to be made available for 360 miles of motorway and trunk road widening and associated junction improvements, 80 major schemes tackling bottlenecks at other junctions, 100 new bypasses and over 100 other local road improvement schemes. Decisions on individual schemes and on their timing will depend upon the outcome of the multi-modal studies and decisions taken in the context of Regional Planning Strategies in the case of trunk roads and the local transport plan in the case of local roads. Schemes will also have to be appraised using the New Approach to Appraisal.

 As my predecessor announced on 3 May, the Strategic Rail Authority and Transport for London are jointly taking forward work on project definition, including alternative service patterns, and design development of an east-west cross-London rail link.

<a name="10720w12.html_para0">The present Area Cost Adjustment mechanism used in the local government revenue grant distribution system is based on differences in labour costs and rates costs in different parts of England.

This enables us to calculate the market rates of pay in different areas of the country and to reflect the higher costs of certain areas in the funding provided to local authorities. The current system does not include specific factors for differential recruitment and retention rates, as these issues should already be reflected in the prevailing pay levels in an area and therefore captured within the earnings data.

 The information is not available in the form requested. However, the table shows the current life expiry of existing rolling stock on the network. The Government have made regulations requiring the removal of Mark 1 slam-door stock by the end of 2004. Since privatisation, over 3,300 new passenger vehicles have been ordered of which nearly half are in service or expected to enter service by the end of 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what his Department's definition is of overcrowding for each train operating company <i>(a)</i> at present and <i>(b)</i> at the time the franchise was awarded; and if he will make a statement.  [4833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Specific definitions or thresholds for capacity apply to peak commuter services in London and Edinburgh only. Each train in use has a nominal capacity and operators must plan their services so that the aggregate number of passengers in excess of capacity does not exceed 3 per cent. over both the morning and evening peak, or 4.5 per cent. for either peak in isolation. 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 508W</I><P>
For journeys of over 20 minutes the nominal capacity of the train is equal to the number of seats. For journeys of under 20 minutes the nominal capacity is equal to the number of seats plus the number of passengers who can stand at a density of 0.55m <sup>2</sup>  per passenger. These calculations apply today as they did at the time of franchising. Reducing overcrowding is a key target of our 10-Year Plan, particularly for commuter services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Information on the number of signals passed at danger (SPAD) incidents are published in the Health and Safety Executive's monthly SPAD reports, copies of which are placed in both Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has not prosecuted any drivers in the period since 1990. The British Transport Police occasionally carry out legal proceedings against drivers, as they did for example following the accident at Watford Junction on 8 August 1996, although the driver was acquitted. Train operating companies operate their own internal disciplinary procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what steps the Maritime and Coastguard Agency takes to ensure that the certificates held by foreign seafarers serving on British ships are genuine.  [4839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 When foreign seafarers serving on UK ships present their certificates for recognition, the MCA scrutinises the documents and any suspicious certificates are checked with the issuing administration. Spot checks are also carried out on foreign certificates by checking authenticity with the issuing administration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when the Government intend to extend United Kingdom work permit requirements to foreign seafarers serving on ships in United Kingdom coastal cargo and ferry trades.  [4840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Since 1996 work permit arrangements have applied to seafarers engaged in domestic shipping services in the UK where these services are provided by ships requiring a passenger certificate. This includes passenger ferries. It also covers roll-on/roll-off freight services where 12 or more lorry drivers are on board.
<P>

<a name="10720w13.html_para0">On 1 April 2001 the seafarer work permit system was extended to domestic scheduled freight services generally.
<P>

<a name="10720w13.html_para1">The arrangements apply to seafarers who are not European Economic Area (EEA) nationals. Such seafarers need work permits if they are serving on ships registered in the UK or in a foreign state other than an EEA state.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the countries whose officer certificates are automatically recognised by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.  [4835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The officer certificates of other countries are only recognised when the training and certification system of that country has been assessed and is considered to afford an equivalent level of technical competence to the UK system. All officers whose mother tongue is not English or whose examinations were not conducted in English, must satisfy the MCA of their competence in the English Language. All senior officers, except the holders of Irish certificates of competency, must satisfy the MCA that they have knowledge of UK maritime legislation appropriate to their functions aboard ship. Recognition under STCW 95 is subject to final European Commission approval. At present, under STCW 78 we recognise officer certificates of competency from the following administrations:

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many foreign seafarers were granted United Kingdom certificates of competency in each year since the scheme began, broken down by nationality.  [4838]<P>

<a name="10720w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has granted certificates of competency for around 150 years and until recently there has been no record kept of the nationality of the seafarers concerned. Since the introduction of the MCA's electronic database in 1998, records of nationality have been kept and are as follows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to ensure that the training of senior officers in the fire service forms an integral part of safety management arrangements within the Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999.  [4853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w14.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999 require the operators of certain potential hazardous establishments to prepare on-site emergency plans. The local authority for areas where there are such establishments is required to prepare off-site emergency plans including the involvement of the fire service. These plans are required to be tested at least at three-yearly intervals.




<P>

<P>

<a name="10720w14.html_para0">The emergency procedures and training are largely site-specific to the potential risks presented by each establishment. Specific training to enable senior fire service officers to deal with major hazardous materials incidents is provided centrally at the Fire Service College in the form of the Hazardous Materials and Environmental Protection course.

<a name="10720w14.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In 1998, the year in which the most recent data are available, a total of around 1,600 deaths were attributable to asbestos exposure. Between 1,500 and 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year may also be attributable to asbestos, but these cannot be determined exactly since they are individually indistinguishable from cancers due to other causes such as smoking.

 My Department has recently commissioned a study to test the likely take-up, by children who are not entitled to free home-to-school transport, if additional school transport services were provided and the extent to which this might be influenced by cost and other factors. Separately, FirstGroup has told us that many authorities are interested in running pilot schemes using American-style yellow school buses. We reached agreement with FirstGroup earlier in the year on modifications to the vehicles it intends to use for the pilots so that they will satisfy UK regulatory requirements. We intend to commission a study to monitor these pilot schemes once they have been agreed. The cost of the pilot schemes is a matter for FirstGroup and the local authorities concerned who will wish to be assured that the pilot schemes give value for money.

depend on whether an updated appraisal confirms the scheme represents good value for money and satisfactory funding arrangements being made.<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

Where provisional approval has been given, the Government have indicated that it will be prepared to release funding subject to particular conditions being met&#151;usually completion of statutory approval processes, further work on the appraisal case or funding being secured from a third party. Where, for example, a scheme requires statutory powers from the Secretary of State under the Transport and Works Act 1992, we must carefully consider all objections and other representations received before determining the application, and this may involve the holding of a public inquiry. Completion dates for provisionally approved schemes will depend on the satisfactory compliance with the conditions laid down and the outcome of applications for statutory approval, but subject to these the best current estimate is that the listed schemes will be completed by June 2006.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to reform the system of public inquiries into significant transport projects; and what research his Department has commissioned into such reform.  [5497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 We need a modern and fair process for making decisions about major infrastructure projects, such as new airports, runways, rail links and roads. These projects are essential for our economic future and bring benefits through better services but they are also controversial because they can affect the lives of people living near them.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para19">I am therefore announcing today a package of measures to streamline the procedures and reduce unnecessary delays while safeguarding public consultation and 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 523W</I><P>
involvement. Delay is costly and perpetuates uncertainty. Lengthy inquiries make it difficult and costly for people to be properly involved.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para20">The package comprises national policy statements and an improved regional framework for considering individual projects, new parliamentary procedures for approving projects, improved public inquiry procedures and reform of the arrangements for compulsory purchase and compensation.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para21">We propose that up-to-date statements of Government policy should be in place before major projects are considered in the planning system. This will help to reduce unnecessary debate at inquiry and has the potential to save a significant amount of inquiry time. The nature and approach of policy statements may vary from case to case. There would normally be prior public consultation on them so that people have the chance to comment and make an input to the policy proposed.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para22">Last year, we put in place revised arrangements for preparing Regional Planning Guidance (RPG), incorporating regional transport strategies. The process of reviewing RPG has been completed in two regions and is well advanced in another five. PRG will help to provide greater certainty as regards the broad location of new development and the need for infrastructure improvements at the regional level.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para23">These arrangements will be complemented and enhanced by the findings of the multi-modal studies of transport corridors currently under way. These will feed in to reviews of the transport elements of RPG during 2002&#150;03. Under our new arrangements for RPG preparation we have enhanced the openness and inclusiveness of the process, including improved consultation and the chance for people to have their say, with a public examination before an independent panel.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para24">Approval in principle for major infrastructure projects should be a matter for Parliament. Procedures will be developed which allow that. These will give people the right to object before Parliament debates the issues. Detailed aspects will be examined at a subsequent public inquiry if Parliament approves the project. We want the overall process for deciding projects to be shorter and more focused while ensuring that people affected have a full right to make their views known.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para25">We shall introduce legislation to achieve this when a suitable opportunity arises. We shall consult beforehand on proposals for the details of the new procedures. In the meantime, we are initiating a fundamental review of the Transport and Works Act 1992, the effectiveness of whose procedures is essential to delivering rail, tram and other forms of infrastructure falling within its scope.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para26">Public inquiries are and will remain an important feature of the planning process. They are a tried and tested way of exploring the issues in public and giving people the chance to make an input to decisions. We shall improve the procedures for dealing with major projects at inquiry by way of further changes over and above the streamlining measures we introduced for planning inquiries generally last August. These will include stricter time-tabling and more clearly focused terms of reference, supplemented by a range of measures to tackle issues more flexibly and manage the inquiry process better.

<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para27">In the light or responses to our 1999 consultation paper on streamlining the processing of major projects through the planning system, we also propose to add to inspectors' powers to deal with matters pre-inquiry. We do not intend to proceed with proposals to abolish the right of parties to cross-examine others. We shall bring forward new rules to implement the changes as soon as practicable. Similar changes will also be made where necessary for projects proceeding under other statutory regimes, such as the Highways Act 1980.
<P>

<a name="10720w15.html_para28">The implementation of major infrastructure projects sometimes depends on the compulsory acquisition of land. We propose to improve the operation of the compulsory purchase and compensation system so that it is more efficient, effective and fair. We are examining the compensation arrangements for people affected by proposed developments. The report of a fundamental review of the laws and procedures was published last year. The Law Commission have begun to look at how the legislation can be consolidated, codified and updated. We intend to make a policy statement on the way forward in the autumn. We shall also be publishing a new advice manual and good practice guide for everyone involved in the operation of the procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the methodology changes made since 1997 to the formulae for calculating the standard spending assessment and aggregate external finance figures for <i>(a)</i> Wiltshire county council, <i>(b)</i> West Wiltshire district council and <i>(c)</i> Salisbury district council; and if he will estimate the net financial effect of these changes.  [5192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w16.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There were 15 changes in the method of determining Standard Spending assessments (SSAs) for the 1998&#150;99 Local Government Finance Settlement; and 20 changes for the 1999&#150;2000 Local Government Finance Settlement.
<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para1">In 1999&#150;2000 the Government introduced a new damping grant, Central Support Protection Grant (CSPG), to ensure that no authority received less grant than the year before, and that authorities which had education and personal social services responsibilities received at least 1.5 per cent. more than the year before.
<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para2">The July 1998 Local Government White Paper announced a three year review of Revenue grant Distribution. It said that the Government did not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of SSAs except where there are changes in the functions of councils, or the funding of particular services.
<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para3">In 2000&#150;01 there were therefore only limited adjustments to SSAs to accommodate the establishment of the Greater London Authority and related changes, most notably those arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan police district and the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey police areas. CSPG was retained in 2000&#150;01.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 527W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para4">In 2001&#150;02 there was only one change in the method of determining SSAs to reflect the transfer of funding for nursery education for four year olds. CSPG was replaced for those authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities by floors and ceilings, which guaranteed that no authority would receive less than a 3.2 per cent. increase and that no authority could get more than a 6.5 per cent. increase.
<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para5">Changes in the method of determining SSAs are contained in circular letters to local authorities, dated 2 December 1997, 2 December 1998, 25 November 1999

<P>

<a name="10720w16.html_para6">The table shows the net percentage change in SSAs against adjusted SSAs for the previous year for Wiltshire, west Wiltshire and Salisbury over the period, together with the percentage change due to changes in methodology. It is inappropriate to compare actual SSA between years because of changes to the services financed by grants allocated using SSAs. Adjusted SSAs enable a like-for-like comparison between years.

<a name="10720w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's plans for the London Underground will deliver &#163;13 billion of investment over the first 15 years, giving London the 21st century underground that it deserves. London Underground is currently negotiating the contracts to deliver this investment. To estimate what the annual rate of repayment might be at this stage of negotiations would undermine London Underground's commercial position and jeopardise its ability to deliver best value.

 The Government's plans for the London underground will deliver &#163;13 billion of investment over the first 15 years, giving London the publicly-run, privately-built underground that it deserves. The contracts to deliver this investment remain under negotiation and so precise investment plans are still subject to change. I understand from London Underground that its current plans would see an interim refurbishment of District line trains by 2005. There would then be a full refurbishment or replacement of trains by 2016 at the latest, as part of an upgrade of the line.

<a name="10720w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> This is an operational matter for London Underground, which inform me that, in the time available, they are not able to provide an accurate breakdown of the number of escalators by line over the last seven years. However, they are preparing this information and I will write to the hon. Gentleman with it as soon as it is ready, placing a copy of my letter in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="10720w17.html_para0">London Underground also inform me that they track faults on escalators, but do not hold ready collated statistics showing long term trends in fault rates. This is because they regard this as a poor guide to the level of customer service provided, as many faults are minor and are corrected without affecting services. However, they do track escalator performance through keeping records of the percentage of machines available for service. These figures give a good indication of service levels because they include the effects of planned works (overhauls and renewals) as well as faults. The following table shows the average percentage of escalator availability by line for the last five years. The figures for 1994&#150;95 and 1995&#150;96 are not immediately available, but I hope to be able to include them in my letter to the hon. Gentleman.

<a name="10720w17.html_para1">Escalator availability across the network fell in the last two years because of the cracks that appeared in the top-shafts and steps of three types of escalator at various stages in 1999 and 2000. Of the 52 escalators affected by these faults, 51 have now been repaired and are back in service. The last one&#151;at Old Street station&#151;has now been incorporated into the planned refurbishment programme. The completion of these works has had a notable impact on recent escalator performance&#151;with performance comfortably above 93 per cent. since the beginning of 2001.

 While each Multi-modal Study addresses transport problems, it must also anticipate those of the future. Studies must take full account of sustainability, economic, regeneration and social exclusion objectives locally, regionally and nationally. Study reports and recommendations are submitted to Regional Planning Bodies who consider them in the regional planning context consistent with the sustainability framework for that region. Ultimately Ministers, when they consider Regional Planning recommendations, will take care to ensure they are also consistent with wider national policy objectives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what representations he has received on her Department's commissioning of a report on slot auctioning from Dot Econ; and if she will make a statement.  [5433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The findings of the Dot Econ study were presented to representatives of UK airlines and airports on 15 March. Immediate feedback was given then, and written comments were requested by 12 April. A number of representations were received. The Government will take these into account in developing their response to the proposals for revision of the current European slot allocation regulations that were published by the European Commission on 20 June.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_wqn12"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what representations he has received from United Kingdom airlines on the proposed introduction of a monetised slot auctioning or transfer system.  [5434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department has met representatives of UK airlines on several occasions to discuss its declared intention to seek a new European slot allocation regulation that provides for the auctioning of new and pool slots and the legitimisation of trading between air carriers. Written representations have also been received.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_wqn13"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will commission a report projecting the likely bidding behaviour of airlines based on consultation with United Kingdom and overseas carriers and assessing the benefits for consumers of an auctioning system.  [5394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have no plans for such a study. But in taking forward the Government's proposals for a market-based approach to slot allocation, we shall consult fully with airlines and airports. The interests of the travelling public are and will continue to be at the heart of our objective of revising the current slot allocation regime.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_wqn14"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many UK airlines have indicated to his Department their support of the introduction for a monetised slot auctioning or transfer system; how many have indicated opposition; and how many proposed new entrants to Heathrow or Gatwick have indicated their support.  [5393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w18.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is general support among UK airlines for legitimising the trading of slots between airlines. To date, only Virgin Atlantic has openly supported the idea of slot auctioning. Others have been less enthusiastic, but we continue to discuss the matter with the industry.
<P>

<a name="10720w18.html_para5">The subject has not been discussed with representatives of overseas airlines. Airlines are reluctant to discuss their development plans, so it is not possible to answer the question about potential new entrants at Heathrow and Gatwick.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what representations he has received on the decision-making procedures for constructing bypasses under the 10-year transport plan.  [5512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department receives a large number of representations about the construction of bypasses, from a wide variety of organisations and individuals. Many of these refer to the decision-making processes involved.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement about the procedures for reaching decisions on the construction of bypasses made under the 10-year transport plan.  [5513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The final decision on the construction of major road schemes, including bypasses, rests with the Secretary of State. Major schemes will generally emerge in future from the Multi-Modal and Road Based Studies commissioned following the Roads Review and from decisions taken by regional planning bodies in drawing up their regional transport strategies as part of regional planning guidance on which they will submit recommendations to the Secretary of State. Plans for bypasses may also be submitted by local authorities as part of their local transport plans, decisions on which will also be announced by the Secretary of State as part of the local transport settlement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_wqn2"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions to whom the regional planning authority is accountable for reaching its decisions on the construction of bypasses under the 10-year transport plan.  [5514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Regional planning machinery varies by region. In Yorkshire and the Humber the Regional Assembly for Yorkshire and the Humberside is the regional planning body and is accountable to its member local authorities and, therefore, indirectly to local electors. The final decision on the construction of bypasses rests with the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.

 I am unaware of any such research commissioned by my Department. The airport's owners, BAA, in preparation for the proposed development at Stansted, have commissioned reviews of both the spatial and economic effects of the airport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The implementation plan issued in March this year sets out how a wide range of initiatives across government are supporting the objectives of the Urban White Paper. This is available on my Department's website. Significant progress has already been made in delivering the measures listed in the plan. We are also working closely with towns and cities across the country to take forward the urban agenda. These efforts will feed into a proposed Urban summit in 2002 to assess progress in bringing about change and celebrate success, and a State of the Cities report in 2005.

 There are no proposals to upgrade this important route at the moment.

The emerging strategy of this study has identified the need to improve this route, the precise nature of these improvements will be set out in their final report.

 It is for the Regional Assembly to identify improvements to the trunk road network in line with their Regional Transport Strategy. The Highways Agency, however, is currently carrying out a Route Management Strategy study on the A35, as well as the A30 and A31, between Exeter and Southampton. The study is not about building new roads but about making best use of the trunk roads we already have.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what criteria are applied in designating principal roads and principal destinations;  [5521]
<P>
<UL>(2) when he last reviewed the designation of principal <i>(a)</i> roads and <i>(b)</i> destinations on the Isle of Wight. [5524]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Principal roads are the highest classification of local authority road. Decisions on their designation are based on whether the road is essential for traffic and whether it occupies a sufficiently important place in the national road system to justify central Government interest in its development. There are several principal roads on the Isle of Wight. Ministers have not received recent requests for reclassification of these roads. The Government do not have a designation of "principal destination".
<P>

<a name="10720w19.html_para0">Primary routes and primary destinations are a separate classification from principal roads. Primary routes are defined as routes which provide the most satisfactory route for through traffic between places of traffic importance. Places of traffic importance are known as primary destinations. There are no primary routes or primary destinations on the Isle of Wight. The Government office of the south-east regularly updates the primary route network and primary destinations, taking account of requests for redesignation by local highway authorities. No recent requests have been received in respect of the Isle of Wight.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for what reason Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are included in the Government's South-East region.  [5100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w19.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> Until 1994, and the creation of the Government Offices (GOs), Hampshire and the Isle of Wight had been part of the South-East standard region. That had been the position since at least 1974, when the English standard regions were established following local government reorganisation.
<P>

<a name="10720w19.html_para1">When the GO South-East region was defined in 1994, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were therefore included. Since 1994, the GO boundaries have become increasingly well established, reflecting the Government's commitment, in the "Modernising Government" White Paper, that, where possible, all Government bodies should align with GO boundaries. This need for coterminosity of regional boundaries based on existing GO configurations was also reinforced in the report by the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit in 2000.

 Her Majesty's Government do not subsidise transport links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland or offshore islands. The Scottish Executive subsidises services to offshore islands for which it is accountable to the Scottish Parliament. Responsibility for expenditure on transport links in the three years prior to the introduction of devolution lies with the Secretary of State for Scotland.

 Revised drafts of Local Transport Notes 1/86 and 2/86 have been prepared and circulated to a limited number of consultees&#151;a "reference group". The comments received have highlighted the importance of setting the advice on shared use in the wider context of Government policies to encourage both cycling and walking and the implications of those policies for the design and provision of facilities. We are therefore considering preparing comprehensive guidance which would include guidance on shared use. I will make a further announcement when a decision has been reached.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the proposed EU directives on noise levels, with particular reference to traffic noise.  [5458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 An amending directive to Directive 92/23/EEC aimed at limiting the noise from new vehicle tyres has recently been adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament and will appear in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> imminently. Studies have shown that noise generated at the tyre-road interface is a significant environmental nuisance that, as a contributor to total vehicle noise and, hence, traffic noise, becomes more significant as vehicle speed increases. The directive will apply limits to the permitted noise of tyres that are fitted to new vehicle types entering into service from 2004. In addition it will require most new tyres sold in the replacement market to comply from 2009.
<P>

<a name="10720w21.html_para2">The European Commission also proposed a directive in July 2000 on the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise. The main sources of noise to which this directive relates are transport and industry. The copy of the draft directive primarily covers noise in built up areas, in public parks or other quiet areas within built up areas and in quiet areas in open country. The proposed directive would require mapping of the principle sources of noise to provide information to the public and the European Commission, and the drawing up of action plans aimed at preventing and reducing undesirable levels of environmental noise.

<a name="10720w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boris Johnson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the methodology changes made since 1997 to the formulae for calculating the standard spending assessment and aggregate external finance figures for Oxfordshire County Council; and if he will make an assessment of the net financial effect of these changes.  [6089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w22.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There were 15 changes in the method of determining Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for the 1998&#150;99 Local Government Finance Settlement; and 20 changes for the 1999&#150;2000 Local Government Finance Settlement.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para0">In 1999&#150;2000 the Government introduced a new damping grant, Central Support Protection Grant (CSPG), to ensure that no authority received less grant than the year before, and that authorities which had education and personal social services responsibilities received at least 1.5 per cent more than the year before.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para1">The July 1998 Local Government White Paper announced a 3-year review of Revenue Grant Distribution. It said that the Government did not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of SSAs except where there are changes in the functions of councils, or the funding of particular services.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para2">In 2000&#150;01 there were therefore only limited adjustments to SSAs to accommodate the establishment of the Greater London Authority and related changes, most notably those arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan Police District and the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey police areas. CSPG was retained in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para3">In 2001&#150;02 there was only one change in the method of determining SSAs to reflect the transfer of funding for Nursery Education for four-year-olds. CSPG was replaced for those authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities by floors and ceilings, which guaranteed that no authority would receive less than a 3.2 per cent. increase and that no authority could get more than a 6.5 per cent. increase.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para4">Changes in the method of determining SSAs are contained in circular letters to Local Authorities, dated 2 December 1997, 2 December 1998, 25 November 1999 and 27 November 2000, copies of which are in the Library. For convenience, copies of the relevant extracts have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para5">The table shows the net percentage change in SSAs against adjusted SSAs for the previous year for Oxfordshire over the period, together with the percentage change due to changes in methodology. It is inappropriate to compare actual SSA between years because of changes to the services financed by grants allocated using SSAs. Adjusted SSAs enable a like-for-like comparison between years.

<P>
<a name="10720w22.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Together with local government we are reviewing the grant distribution system. We published "Modernising Local Government Finance: A Green Paper" in September 2000, and will announce our conclusions on the most promising ways forward in a White Paper later this year. Alongside this, we are currently working on a range of options for changes to the standard spending assessment formulae, but have not yet reached any conclusions on what changes should be made.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the method of calculating the size of elderly population in connection with the standard spending assessment, with special reference to resort authorities.  [6051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w22.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Estimates of the size of the elderly population for each local authority are made by the Registrar General. They are based on the 1991 Census, and rolled forward to more recent years to reflect births, deaths and migration.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para7">The standard spending assessment formula for elderly residential care is based on the elderly population in households rather than the total elderly population (which includes those in institutions). The population estimates are therefore adjusted to reflect this. This is done by assuming that the proportion of the total elderly population that is in households for each authority is the same as that recorded in the 1991 Census.
<P>

<a name="10720w22.html_para8">The size of the elderly population is thus calculated in the same way for all authorities, including resort authorities.

However, any estimates of cost savings made in each of these transactions in comparison with the public sector alternative could be provided only at disproportionate cost to my department and, as agreed with the National Audit Office, payments to be made to contractors under PFI contracts are commercially confidential.

 A survey is undertaken every year by the Strategic Rail Authority of the number of passengers travelling on peak services into London. The survey is used to monitor overcrowding by identifying the number of 'Passengers in Excess of Capacity' (PIXC) on specific groups of commuter services. The allowable combined morning and evening peak percentage above capacity is 3.0 per cent. The PIXC survey results issued by the Strategic Rail Authority on 13 July show that the First Great Eastern suburban services morning figure was 5.5 per cent and the evening figure was 1.3 per cent. The combined peaks PIXC figure was 3.5 per cent.

 The Government believe that a strategic approach should be taken in determining the level of housing development to ensure that every member of our society has the prospect of a decent home, that economic growth is not impeded and that our countryside is protected from unnecessary and insensitive development. Local authorities, representing the local electorate, play a key role in this process but Government may need to intervene in the wider public interest.

 Local people already have the opportunity to make their views known on development proposals before local planning authorities determine planning applications. There is also the right to challenge the grant of planning permission by a local planning authority by seeking judicial review. We have no current plans to introduce a third party right of appeal against authorities' decisions to grant planning permission.

council tax bills based on updated property values issuing in 2007. Revaluations will not, of course, lead to any overall increase or decrease in the council tax yield.
<P>

<a name="10720w24.html_para5">Regular revaluations will ensure that the council tax burden is distributed fairly on the basis of more up-to-date property values. Respondents to last year's Green Paper on local government finance were overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal to establish a fixed cycle for council tax revaluations. Setting out a timetable for revaluations gives local authorities a clear timetable and framework within which to make their financial plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government's objective is to create a local government finance system that distributes grant fairly and effectively and gives councils greater financial autonomy to help them better meet the needs of their local communities.
<P>

<a name="10720w24.html_para6">In our Green Paper on local government finance, published last September, we consulted on whether to extend the moratorium on changes to the formula used to distribute revenue grant to local authorities by a further year, to include 2002&#150;03. After considering the consultation responses, we have concluded that while reforming the revenue grant distribution system is an important priority, we must ensure that there is adequate time for preparation and consultation.
<P>

<a name="10720w24.html_para7">We know that there remain disparities in the education funding formula which are not justified by the education needs of children. We have been working with local government and other education interests on the best way to resolve these issues but there is not yet agreement on the way forward.
<P>

<a name="10720w24.html_para8">We have therefore decided to keep the existing grant formula stable for 2002&#150;03. Over the coming year, we will work up proposals in partnership with local government for a reformed grant formula which we will introduce in 2003&#150;04. The Government will work to the same timetable with local government and the wider education community on revising the education funding formula to focus on children's needs. I then expect to see the moratorium on formula changes re-introduced for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="10720w24.html_para9">Today's announcement will give local authorities some welcome financial stability and will allow them to plan ahead. Meanwhile we will enhance that financial stability and predictability by developing the floors and ceilings protection which we introduced for some authorities in 2001&#150;02 so that all authorities get a reasonable increase in grant and no authority gets an unduly large increase. We intend to extend floors and ceilings to cover police and fire authorities for 2002&#150;03; and to discuss how best to enhance grant stability in 2002&#150;03 for shire district councils, who do not have education and social service responsibilities.

<a name="10720w25.html_para1">Redress for mis-selling personal pensions takes the form of directing a firm to take an action, either to fund the reinstatement of a mis-selling victim to their occupational pension scheme or to top-up their personal pension. Where the Financial Ombudsman Service makes any direction to a firm, the cost to the firm will not be subject to a specific limit in cash terms, although all Financial Ombudsman Service awards will be subject to "fair and reasonable" criteria.
<P>

<a name="10720w25.html_para2">Under Section 229(4) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), it is for the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to specify the maximum amount that may be regarded as fair compensation for loss or damaged suffered by the complainant. Following a number of consultations on the Financial Ombudsman Scheme and its rules, the FSA decided that the maximum binding limit on firms for money awards should be &#163;100,000. However, the Ombudsman may recommend that firms pay the balance on a voluntary basis. There was widespread support for that limit but also general agreement that the limit should be capable of regular review. The FSA confirmed that it would review the limit, in consultation with the Financial Ombudsman Service, and in the light of experience, every three years.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> The Chancellor has already announced that the Government will, from 2003, introduce a new employment tax credit, extending the principle of in-work support to those without children. This employment tax credit will make work pay and help tackle in-work poverty for a wider range of households. It will complement a new integrated child credit, which will bring all income-related child payments into a single tax credit, providing a more transparent and streamlined system of support for families with children.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The analysis of public expenditure by region published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (Cm 5110) attempts to allocate spending over regions to reflect the relative benefits incurred by the respective populations. The commentary in that document (paragraph 8.2) notes the limitations of this approach, in particular the definitional problems associated with allocating spending on the basis of who benefits. Where there is no clear basis for deciding which region benefits from a particular spending programme, or where accounting information for allocating spending by region is not available, allocation is based on other available indicators. Spending on agriculture has therefore been allocated over regions on a per capita basis.

Of the 41 countries on the list of potentially eligible HIPCs, four have debts which will be below the level requiring additional debt relief (Angola, Kenya, Vietnam, Yemen), two had not opted for debt relief (Laos and Ghana&#151;though Ghana did then opt for debt relief later in 2001), and at least eight countries were conflict affected and hence not able to receive debt relief as the benefits of debt relief could not be shown to go to poverty reduction rather than war (Burma, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia&#151;note that Ethiopia has since signed a peace agreement to end its conflict&#151;Republic of Congo, Liberia, Somalia and Sudan).

 One condition for entitlement of the Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC) is that the applicant is receiving one of a number of qualifying benefits, or was receiving one of them up to 182 days prior to the date of application.

 On 19 July, the Inland Revenue issued a consultation document inviting comments on its proposals for implementing the next generation of tax credits, the integrated child credit for families with children and the employment tax credit for low-income working households. Final decisions on the eligibility rules for the employment tax credit will be taken in the light of responses to that document.

 The Government believe that greater openness in the operations of the international financial institutions can play a key part in improving effectiveness in all aspects of their business, in increasing accountability to members, and in contributing to a greater public understanding of their role of the world economy. Recent positive steps have included the creation of an independent evaluation office at the IMF.
<P>

<a name="10720w29.html_para0">Two publications in particular detail the Government's current policy towards openness and transparency. These are the Treasury's annual report to Parliament "The UK and the IMF 1999&#150;2000" (available online at www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pdf/2001/imf&#150;2201.pdf), and the Government White Paper on International Development "Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor" (available online at www.globalisation.gov.uk).

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A room within this Community Centre was used as a secure local field office for three Census District Managers and their teams to help with the enumeration of four Census Districts in the area. Setting up local offices in this way was part of the Census 2001 strategy for city areas particularly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The work carried out at the Centre involved the handling of completed census forms returned by the Royal Mail or otherwise collected by field staff. It was an established collection point for the transfer of census forms to the national processing centre at Widnes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Waste census material was placed in bags in an alleyway adjoining the Centre ready for collection by an authorised contractor as arranged by the local census field staff. All staff working in the office were aware of the importance of the confidentiality of the materials and of the explicit instructions given by Census HQ for the transfer of spoilt or unused forms to HQ under separate cover.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the closedown stages of the Census in late June, a household telephoned the Regional Management Team at Census HQ to say he had been complaining to the local staff about waste material being placed in the alleyway outside the flats because he viewed this is a fire hazard. Census field staff had tried to resolve this issue locally.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The householder was clearly not satisfied by this and subsequently retrieved and opened a bag containing completed census material and retained it. Despite efforts by the local Census field staff, the householder refused to hand back the material. It was finally retrieved without incident by one of the Census District Managers with the assistance of a senior officer from the Metropolitan Police in attendance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A local inspection by the Census District Manager revealed that the material included census forms, some of which were completed. The material was subsequently securely transferred to ONS Titchfield whereupon a detailed examination is being carried out.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are 190 forms, some of which contain personal information. Many are torn in half or have various notations on them. A full analysis is being carried out, including inspection of other boxes of completed forms at the processing centre, to determine exactly the status of those that have been retrieved. From what I have learned so far, it is possible that these forms which appear to have been put aside for return to HQ as spoilt forms, had been accidentally put out as waste for special collection.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The confidentiality of information provided on census forms is of paramount importance to me and to all of my staff who have been working on the Census. The ONS has an extremely high and well-deserved reputation for protecting confidential information and I regret any breach that has occurred here.

<a name="10720w30.html_para0">A large number of firms are already authorised to carry on financial services under existing legislation; a small number of firms and individuals will require authorisation for the first time at N2.

<a name="10720w30.html_para1">A number of transitional issues arise from the replacement by FSMA of existing regulatory frameworks.

 The decision whether to restore a seized vehicle to the registered owner and the terms of that restoration will depend upon the circumstances of each case. Anyone who has consented to the use of their vehicle by others accepts a variety of risks by doing so and should take all reasonable steps to ensure that it will not be used for smuggling. Customs will look sympathetically at any claim where the vehicle has clearly been taken without the permission of the owner, eg the vehicle was stolen and reported to the police prior to the seizure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Trends in sales of Scotch whisky are affected by many factors; of which duty is just one. For example, consumer preferences and pre-tax pricing play a major part. The spirits duty rate has now been frozen for four consecutive Budgets to strengthen both the international competitiveness and the domestic base of the UK spirits industry. In absolute terms this means that a standard bottle of spirits is some 60p cheaper than it would otherwise have been.

 The Government appreciate the importance of the Scotch whisky industry and the significant contribution it makes to employment in local and regional economies. Judgments on the appropriate level of alcohol duties are made on a Budget by Budget basis and, as is sensible, take account of a wide range of factors which include the Government's expenditure priorities.

 There has been &#163;100 million in value for money gains over the last three years as a result of applying modern electronic techniques to central civil Government procurement. Our objective was to purchase 90 per cent. of low-value goods and services electronically by March 2001. Recent measurements by the Office of Government Commerce indicate that at present approximately half of low-value transactions are conducted electronically. Work is continuing to realise additional benefits through means such as increased use of the Government procurement card and the replacement of antiquated IT systems with more modern ones.

<a name="10720w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2001]:</i> In the early hours of Thursday 5 July, an incident occurred at Chapelcross nuclear power station. Reactor 3 at Chapelcross was shut down for off-load refuelling. During refuelling operations, a basket containing 24 irradiated fuel elements, which had just been removed from the reactor, became dislodged inside the de-fuelling machine. Initial investigations by BNFL, the operator of the site, indicated that the basket containing the fuel had fallen approximately two feet (later revised to 1.6 metres) on to the doors of the hoist well, which is part of the route to transfer fuel to the fuel storage ponds. I was first informed of the matter at lunchtime on the day of the incident.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para0">On Thursday 12 July, remote inspection of the de-fuelling machine showed that only 12 of the fuel elements remained in the basket.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para1">Following further investigation it became clear on 12 and 13 July that the other 12 fuel elements had fallen through the hoist well doors. On 13 July following discussion between BNFL and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), BNFL decided progressively to shut down the three operational reactors at Chapelcross in order that the station's resources could be concentrated on the fuel recovery programme. On 15 July one of the operational reactors at Chapelcross was shut down.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para2">Over the weekend of 14&#150;15 July, BNFL confirmed, using remote cameras, that 12 elements had fallen around 25 metres down the hoist well and were believed to be in a water filled fuel flask at the bottom of the hoist well.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para3">On 16 July, HSE confirmed that nine substantially complete fuel elements could be seen under water in the fuel flask together with the three other fuel elements in several pieces. HSE confirm that the damaged fuel elements are safe and stable as long as they remain submerged. The hoist well is part of the fuel discharge route and, as such, has features that would mitigate any release of radioactivity. BNFL used gamma radiation monitors in the fuel discharge route to detect radioactivity levels, which HSE confirmed were consistent with the understanding of the situation.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para4">In the evening of 17 July, BNFL were able to move the fuel flask from the bottom of the well to the fuel pond area. Remote inspection of the flask has confirmed that it contains nine intact fuel elements and the pieces of the other three. Now that all the fuel elements have been located the site incident has been declared closed and the progressive shut down of the remaining two operating reactors at Chapelcross has been suspended. A project plan is now being developed to recover the 12 fuel elements in the defuelling machine. BNFL estimate that this may take one or two weeks.
<P>

<a name="10720w32.html_para5">Any incident at a nuclear power station is treated very seriously and HSE and BNFL are carrying out investigations into the incident of 5 July. HSE will not allow BNFL to resume fuelling operations at any of Chapelcross's four reactors or at Calder Hall, which has similar re-fuelling system, until they are satisfied that it is safe to do so. Other Magnox stations use different equipment and are not affected by this incident. I am receiving daily reports on developments at Chapelcross from both HSE and BNFL.

 The potential link between skin cancer and overhead power lines is one of several ill health effects that have been attributed to the electromagnetic fields that are produced by electrical equipment.
<P>

<a name="10720w35.html_para0">The Government obtain advice on the possible health implications of exposure to electromagnetic fields, including those associated with power lines, from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). In a report <sup>1</sup>  published on 6 March the NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation reviewed the potential risks of types of cancer from extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. Their conclusion, based on laboratory experiments and epidemiological studies, is that there is no evidence that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are capable of producing cancer.
<P>

<a name="10720w35.html_para1">Some evidence has been suggested that the electric fields associated with the higher-voltage power lines are responsible via indirect effects for a range of illnesses including skin cancer. These effects have been considered to arise from changes in the concentration and deposition of particles and other environmental pollutants in the presence of corona ions found in the vicinity of power lines. The physical principle for particle deposition in large electric fields is well understood. However, the NRPB has concluded that it has not been sufficiently demonstrated whether any such enhanced deposition will increase human exposure in a way that will result in adverse health effects. The difficulties with this hypothesis in relation to naturally occurring radiation have

been examined in detail earlier by the NRPB and others in peer-reviewed journals.

The accounts show that BNFL has made a financial provision of &#163;113 million to cover the costs associated with dealing with the fuel. It is the intention of the companies involved to be as open about the plans and arrangements for transporting the fuel to the UK as normal security considerations allow and they plan to make available relevant information in advance of the transport. The July 2000 UK-Japan inter-governmental agreement specified that the intention is for BNFL to return the fuel within 2&#150;3 years. This remains the case.

 Regulatory Impact Assessments have been prepared in support of all new employment legislations that have involved significant costs to business. The annual costs to employers for those provisions that can be quantified is &#163;4.8 billion. This includes recurring administration costs of &#163;25 million to &#163;29 million and one-off administration costs of &#163;37 million to &#163;45 million. The remainder has involved direct benefits to workers through higher pay, more annual leave and better treatment in the workplace.

 My right hon.

We received 54 responses to the consultation and a number of issues were raised. Some respondents thought that these were of sufficient weight to require further discussion. Points were raised about the data protection requirements which I believe could only be resolved by a further discussion on how they should be implemented. I will therefore issue in the next few weeks a summary of the consultation, a note of the conclusions we have drawn from the consultation and a draft of the regulations. We will seek comments on the implementation of data protection elements. I believe that this process will enable us to introduce regulations in the near future which will best take into account the views of those most directly impacted by this directive. We will also publish the responses to the consultation on the DTI's website.

 <i>[holding answer 28 June 2001]:</i> As a result of representation from the UK fishmeal has not been banned from feeding to non-ruminant livestock. The UK has raised the possibility of a relaxation of the ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants in the Standing Veterinary Committee and the Council. In the Agricultural Council of 19 June the Commission promised to review this ban once a test has been validated capable of differentiating between animal and fish protein in feed. The UK uses an ELISA to test compound animal feedingstuffs for the presence of mammalian protein, but this test has not yet been validated. Until this problem can be resolved we have no option but to implement the Community ban.

 It is not possible to make an accurate assessment of the number of animals which producers may be waiting to enter into the over-30-months scheme. Taking account of the normal pattern of activity on the scheme and the slaughtering which has taken place due to foot and mouth disease it is thought likely that the number of animals is between 100,000 and 200,000.

 Vaccination remains an option under continuous review, to be used in conjunction with the culling policy. We have placed a reserve on 125,000 doses of antigen held in the European Vaccine Bank. We are also establishing a bank of commercial antigen, which currently holds 1.9 million doses.

<a name="10720w40.html_para2">At the start of the outbreak we had access to 500,000 doses of the relevant antigen held for the UK in the International Vaccine Bank at Pirbright.

 It is not possible to identify which negative results may be caused by contamination by disinfectant.

 The assessment of the level of infection of foot and mouth disease in the national sheep flock is an on-going process, and is influenced by the number of cases that occur, their geographical distribution and the time scale within which they occur. In addition serological surveillance is now under way in the 3 km radius protection zones around infected premises, and other epidemiological inquiries are resulting in serological sampling in many areas of the country. Concerns now are centred mainly on Cumbria and north and west Yorkshire which were predicted to contribute to the tail of the epidemic. Confidence is growing cautiously in other parts of the country through the results of sampling in protection zones prior to the lifting of restrictions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many people on her Department's controlled or contracted premises since 26 February <i>(a)</i> have been illegally killed, <i>(b)</i> committed suicide and <i>(c)</i> died as a result of an accident.  [2736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w40.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department is aware of two deaths on such premises since 26 February: a young man died after falling from a roof on a farm in Warwickshire and another man died following a shooting incident on a farm in Gt. Orton. It is not for DEFRA to determine the nature of these deaths. DEFRA does not hold data on suicides.

to farms and businesses in Wales suffering lost revenue as a result of the foot and mouth crisis; and if she will make a statement.  [2850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w40.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Statutory compensation is payable only for livestock slaughtered because they were infected or suspected of being infected with foot and mouth disease, or for items such as animal feed which are seized to prevent the spread of disease. Compensation should now be paid within three weeks of receipt of correct documents. However, at the peak of the outbreak payments may have taken some weeks longer due to the large volume of claims handled.

<a name="10720w40.html_wqn12"><B> David Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the ranks, position and qualifications of her Department's officials were who supervised the loading/unloading and counting of sheep taken in the voluntary cull in Cumbria.  [3246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w40.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The haulage contractors counted the sheep as they were loaded. Unloading was under the supervision of a Temporary Veterinary Inspector (TVI), while the counting of the animals coming off the wagons was performed by drovers employed by the DEFRA Contractors responsible for the collection and delivery of animals.

<P>
<a name="10720w40.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No specific research has been commissioned so far, beyond the epidemiological investigations that follow every confirmed outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The effect of different farming practices on disease spread is an issue that can be considered in more detail once the current outbreak has been eradicated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will permit vaccination to save <i>(a)</i> rare breeds and <i>(b)</i> pigs through which foot and mouth infection could spread.  [3470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w40.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government would be prepared to authorise vaccination against foot and mouth disease on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser. In the spring their advice was to vaccinate cattle in north Cumbria, provided the campaign had the substantial support of farmers, consumers, veterinarians and the food trade. That level of support was not there, and, as the numbers of new cases fell, the signs were that it would not be achieved. Our advisers have not made any further recommendations for a vaccination campaign in the current situation. Vaccination remains an option, and is continually reassessed in the light of changing circumstances and knowledge of the disease.

 The key priority remains to eradicate foot and mouth disease as quickly as possible and all the necessary resources are being deployed to do that. Based on scientific and veterinary advice, the chief mechanisms for bringing the outbreak under control are:
<P>

<P>
<P>

 There are currently no automatic air quality monitoring sites in Gloucestershire that form part of the UK national air pollution monitoring network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w41.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Within the UK as a whole, there has been a steady decline since 1997 in the number of days of poor air quality recorded at urban sites. In rural areas, the number of days when air pollution is recorded as moderate or higher has fluctuated over the same period because of the variability in levels of ozone. There are, however, no air quality monitoring stations in Gloucestershire that supply data to the UK automatic monitoring networks, so we are unable to provide any validated data to indicate on precisely how many occasions since 1997 air pollution was reported above recommended health levels in Gloucestershire.
<P>

<a name="10720w41.html_para7">The local authorities in Gloucestershire have been reviewing and assessing the current, and likely future, air quality in their region as a requirement under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995.

In the case of ozone, concerted action at a European level is likely to be the best way of delivering the necessary reductions in levels across southern England. The forthcoming Ozone and National Emissions Ceilings Directives will help us to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="10720w41.html_para9">We will monitor future progress towards these objectives by means of the national air quality monitoring network, and by a programme of reviews of the objectives for individual pollutants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w41.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The number and location of the air monitoring stations that form part of the UK air pollution monitoring network are predominantly determined by the need to meet the ambient air pollution reporting requirements laid down in the EU Air Quality Framework Directive and the Air Quality Daughter Directives. Other monitoring sites have been chosen to provide input into the development of proposed legislation and to improve the understanding of sources and effects of air pollution.
<P>

<a name="10720w41.html_para10">The national monitoring network is constantly evolving. New sites have recently been installed to measure sulphur dioxide, particles and nitrogen dioxide in order to meet the requirements of the First Daughter Directive. Additional monitoring sites are also being installed to meet the requirements for benzene and carbon monoxide required for the Second Daughter Directive. There is also an extended monitoring programme for polyaromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals to inform understanding of the sources and levels of these pollutants. Other developments to the network are also under consideration, although, at present, there are no definite plans for new sites in Gloucestershire.

<a name="10720w41.html_para11">Local authorities will also continue to have to monitor their local air quality from time to time as a requirement under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995.

 My officials have been in regular contact with all the local authorities in Gloucestershire over the past few years, while they have been undertaking their local air quality reviews and assessments. Gloucestershire Pollution Group is represented at the Regional Air Quality Co-ordinators' meetings which are organised by my officials and take place every six months or so. The local authorities in Gloucestershire, along with all other English authorities, also have a duty to consult the Secretary of State on their review and assessment reports.
<P>

<a name="10720w41.html_para12">Out of the six district/borough authorities in Gloucestershire, only Stroud district council and Tewkesbury borough council have identified potentially significant air pollution problems. These two authorities have therefore had to designate a joint air quality management area (AQMA) in respect of levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO <sub>2</sub> ) adjacent to the M5 motorway, and they will now have to undertake a further review and assessment of air quality in the affected areas. They will also have to draw up an air quality action plan setting out the measures they intend to take in working towards the air quality objective for NO <sub>2</sub> .

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> Results from the 1999&#150;2000 Municipal Waste Management survey indicate that the proportion of households served by kerbside or doorstep collection schemes remained unchanged since 1998&#150;99 at 43 per cent. However, the amount of waste collected for recycling through such schemes has increased by 18 per cent. since 1998&#150;99 to 756,000 tonnes in 1999&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="10720w42.html_para1">The choice of waste facilities is a matter for local authorities to take in consultation with their local communities. The Government do not require authorities to introduce kerbside recycling, although it is expected that the setting of statutory targets for recycling is likely to lead to an increase in the availability of kerbside recycling.
<P>

<a name="10720w42.html_para2">Targets in the national waste strategy "Waste Strategy 2000" are based on the assumption that by 2020 up to 80 per cent. of households nationally can realistically be served by kerbside collections, and that 80 per cent. of households provided with the service will actually use it.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> In 1999&#150;2000, the latest year for which data are available, 10.3 per cent. of household waste in England and Wales was recycled or composted. One of the key objectives in the Government's Waste Strategy, set out in "Waste Strategy 2000", is that where the creation of waste cannot be avoided, recycling and reuse should be maximised. The Government have set targets for England and Wales, for at least 25 per cent. of household waste to be recycled or composted by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. These targets are not "ceilings" but realistic minima that will be revised upwards if experience indicates that higher levels are achievable. The National Assembly for Wales is currently consulting on revised targets for composting and recycling as part of a review of the waste strategy for Wales. Recycling in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> Landfill sites operate under the terms of waste management licences and are subject to the controls set out in Part II of the Environment Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. The purpose of licences is to ensure that waste is disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. Failure to comply with a licence condition, or the disposal of waste in a manner likely to cause environmental pollution or harm to human health, is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="10720w42.html_para5">The Environment Agency has a legal duty to inspect all licensed sites and section 42 of the 1990 Act requires the Agency to take the steps needed to ensure that (a) the activities authorised by a licence do not cause environmental pollution, harm to human health or serious detriment to local amenities; and (b) the conditions of a licence are complied with.

 The Farm Scale Evaluations is a three-year research programme now in its second full year. The Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the programme has recommended that data be gathered at between 60 and 75 sites for each crop type (winter oilseed rape, spring oilseed rape, beet and maize) over the three years of the study. To date 24 winter oilseed rape, 43 spring oilseed rape, 50 beet sites and 37 maize sites have been sown.

 No tests for distinctness, uniformity and stability or trials for value for cultivation and use on the GM fodder maize variety Chardon LL have been commenced in the United Kingdom since October 2000. The French testing authorities have advised us that they entered the variety for a second year of official distinctness, uniformity and stability tests in France in spring 2001.

 Ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety by the United Kingdom is partly dependent on legislative action at the European Community level. The European Commission has indicated that it intends to publish proposals for such legislation in autumn this year. Depending on progress with this legislation, the United Kingdom may therefore expect to ratify the Protocol before the end of 2002.

 Emergency works by the Environment Agency have reduced the risk of defences being outflanked at Rawcliffe. An application from the Environment Agency for grant on a flood alleviation scheme at Rawcliffe will be considered against the normal technical, economic and environmental criteria and priority score arrangements. The current rate of grant for such schemes is 65 per cent., but the Environment Agency grant rates are reviewed on an annual basis.

<P>
<a name="10720w44.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the severe flooding in late 2000, the Department has been made aware of the concerns of a number of communities in the Vale of York through both correspondence and the Adjournment debate which the hon. Member secured on 7 November 2000. I also met her and representatives of Rawcliffe on 30 April 2001. Operational responsibility for flood management systems rests with the local operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). Inter alia, the agency has reassessed its flood warning arrangements and is undertaking a strategic study for the River Ouse catchment.

 The Department is making contributions towards the exceptional costs incurred by the Environment Agency and Internal Drainage Boards on emergency response and repairs following the flooding in late 2000. I understand that the agency inspected all of its flood defence assets as soon as possible after the flooding and has undertaken major emergency works inter alia at Gowdall, Selby, Barlby, Wressle, Rawcliffe and the Foss Barrier. The agency has also undertaken local repairs elsewhere as part of its maintenance programme.

 The Environment Agency's "Lessons Learned" report on the floods has helped to further clarify the roles of the different agencies. In addition to the regular meetings with the organisations responsible for emergency response, I understand the Agency has held several meetings with the City of York council, Rawcliffe parish council, Kyle and Upper Ouse Internal Drainage Board and Yorkshire Water to discuss and plan flood management issues. The Department's Regional Engineer is liaising with the operating authorities with regard to plans for capital flood defence works and associated studies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department has taken since 14 March to tackle delays experienced by householders under the home energy efficiency scheme.  [4768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w44.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The delays in the installation and repair of central heating systems under the home energy efficiency scheme are due to the national shortage of qualified gas heating engineers. The Department continues to encourage the two scheme managers&#151;the Eaga Partnership Ltd. and Eastern HEES Ltd.&#151;in their efforts to recruit additional installers as an interim measure. These efforts have led to substantial improvements in the rate of work with over 2,800 boiler installations in June 2001, compared to 590 in January.
<P>

<a name="10720w44.html_para0">But the longer-term solution to the problem is to increase the pool of trained engineers. Over the next 12 months my Department is funding training courses that will provide 800 additional qualified engineers to work under the scheme. The first batch will join the scheme in November. This is currently the largest gas engineer training programme in the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The table identifies the number of boiler repairs and replacements completed since June 2000 in Dorset. Following the completion of works installers typically take between 6&#150;8 weeks to submit an invoice for payment. It is likely that work has already been completed in some of these households. The time taken should significantly decrease following the recent appointment of nine further heating companies taking the total number for Dorset to 12:

In 27 cases the foreign court refused to return the child; 15 cases were resolved by the court graning the left behind parent contact; 79 cases were withdrawn and the remaining cases are pending. Some cases involve more than one child.

<a name="10720w46.html_para7">Since 1997 Cheshire Constabulary has civilianised a significant number of operational support roles. This has contributed to the reduction in police numbers and the increase in civilian numbers. The structure of the force is periodically reviewed and changes are made to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the force. Changes in recent years have resulted in the centralisation of officers deployed on armed response vehicles and the creation of a Central Traffic Enforcement Unit. These changes have reduced the number of officers in the territorial divisions. I understand that the Constabulary plan to recruit 156 officers including 77 under the Crime Fighting Fund by March 2002.

In respect of those officers dismissed or required to resign from the Metropolitan police since 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority has submitted one request for forfeiture of pension, for which a certificate was issued in November 2000.

 The Home Office is currently developing national recruitment standards that are fair and non-discriminatory, and which will give access to a wider pool of applicants through the removal of unnecessary barriers to recruitment. Chief Constables are currently considering guidance about sexual orientation which has been drafted by the Association of Chief Police Officers with the help of the Lesbian and Gay Police Association. The draft guidance states among other matters that police forces' recruitment advertising should aim to attract lesbian and gay people as it would any other minority group, and that current arrangements concerning recruitment and promotion should be reviewed to ensure that they do not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation.

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> Shortly after the recent disturbances in Oldham, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary met representatives from a number of local communities and agencies to discuss the situation in the town. As a result, an action plan for recovery, to be prepared in Oldham by local fora including leaders of the Asian and White communities, police authorities and business leaders, is to be prepared within the next four months. We have made it clear that the Government, across all Departments, stand ready to offer support and independent advice as needed to help towns such as Bradford, Oldham and Burnley begin to heal their divisions and build a better future.
<P>

<a name="10720w47.html_para3">I visited Oldham to meet local people and learn about the town's problems at first hand. We welcome the fact that community leaders and the police are discussing what happened in Burnley and why. We are of course ready to work with local communities to ensure the safety and peaceful co-existence of people that live there. I remain convinced that the primary job of tackling the root causes of the complex social and specific problems that give rise to divisions and disturbances of this kind must be done at local level. We do of course welcome any local initiatives that help to address these issues in a constructive manner.
<P>

<a name="10720w47.html_para4">In a statement to the House of Commons the Home Secretary announced the establishment of a ministerial group with a dedicated review team to undertake further work within communities over the summer. It will provide a direct link between Ministers and these communities. The review team will seek views from people on the ground, working closely with local people to identify further what needs to be done. This team will work in areas that have suffered violence as well as similar areas that have not.
<P>

<a name="10720w47.html_para5">The review team will provide a clear link between local communities and Ministers, reporting regularly over the summer and producing a final report and recommendations in September. It will be an important way of helping local people provide local solutions, while drawing out issues for policy consideration at national as well as local and community levels.

 Available information is given in the table. Automatic camera devices provided evidence from 1995&#150;98 and all camera types for 1999. Data for 2000 will be available in the autumn, with data for 2001 due at the end of 2002.
<P>

<a name="10720w47.html_para7">All revenue received went directly into the Treasury's Consolidated Fund. However from April 2000, eight areas have been taking part in the piloting of arrangements for netting off fine revenue from cameras. This income can be used only for recovering the costs directly involved with camera operation, and there are strict financial controls, with an audit, to ensure that they are not diverted for other purposes. Section 38 of the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 now provides for court areas, subject to detailed conditions, to net off fine revenue from fixed penalty notices to fund speed limit and red light enforcement only.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> The United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) received 281 written complaints about inaccuracies in passports received by customers during the financial year 2000&#150;01.

<P>
<a name="10720w48.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> A passport card is recognised as a form of travel document in the international standards developed by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The use of a card form of passport would be by bilateral agreements between issuing states. A United Kingdom passport card will need acceptance within the European Union if it is to be a viable business proposition.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> Incidents of fraud have decreased because the new Passport Application Support System (PASS) acts as a deterrent because it includes electronic security checks and the new digital machine readable passport incorporates new and improved security features.
<P>

<a name="10720w48.html_para6">For the calendar year 1997, 1,880 fraudulent applications were detected, this represents 0.042 per cent. of passports issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w48.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> A passport card, if approved by Ministers, would provide users with a convenient travel document which can be kept in a wallet or purse. If a passport book is lost or stolen abroad, the card would provide an alternative document that can either be used to facilitate return to the United Kingdom or to present to the nearest British Consulate to support an application for a replacement passport book.
<P>

<a name="10720w48.html_para11">In addition a card form of a passport would provide a suitable platform for electronic innovations. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is developing standards for card-based travel documents incorporating electronic data storage. These documents could offer greater security, could be used as automated border controls and offer a route to speedy passport renewal.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> The United Kingdom Passport Service plans to introduce a passport card subject to gaining acceptance for the document in the European Union and subject to adequate funding and business case and subject to ministerial approval. The earliest that a passport card could be introduced is the financial year 2003&#150;04.

 There are no plans to arrange central procurement of police vehicles in England and Wales. Since 1992 the Police Information and Technology Organisation, with the support of the National Association of Police Fleet Managers, has put in place a national framework for the purchase of vehicles by the police service. It delivers significant discounts on manufacturers prices. The current national framework was implemented on 1 April 2000 and runs for five years.

<P>

<a name="10720w49.html_para0">Although the arrangement is not mandatory, the framework has delivered value for money and is well used within the police service. As the arrangement was set up under European Commission (EC) Procurement Directives, forces who purchase from it are not required to undertake any additional tendering, thereby affording further savings to the police service.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received on the implementation of antisocial behaviour orders; and what the key obstacles are to proceeding with the necessary court action.  [4981]<P>

<P>
<a name="10720w49.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 On 15 October 1999 the previous Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), wrote to the chief executive of each local authority asking what could be learned from their experiences in using antisocial behaviour orders and the other measures in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for combating unruly behaviour, and whether any good practice could be shared. As a result of the representations received a key issue for further guidance appeared to be better local inter-agency co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="10720w49.html_para2">The Home Office and the Local Government Association jointly held 10 regional seminars in March and April last year to help spread good practice in using antisocial behaviour orders. The seminars also served as a consultation exercise for the issue of a model agreement, or protocol, for effective local co-operation in tackling antisocial behaviour. This guidance was launched in June last year. Both the guidance and the seminars were well received, and indicated a widespread willingness to use antisocial behaviour orders.
<P>

<a name="10720w49.html_para3">We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of these orders, now that they have been two years in operation, to evaluate their effectiveness in dealing with antisocial behaviour and to identify best practice in how the legislation is being used. We expect the review to be completed later this year and we will consider the report carefully.

 This information is not held centrally although the Association of Chief Police Officers is currently gathering figures on employment claims, which will include the type of claim and ethnicity of claimant. It is for employment tribunals to decide the claims which are brought before them, and for Chief Constables to take whatever management action they consider appropriate in the light of the outcomes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Operation Antler inquiry by Wiltshire police into experiments on service volunteers at Porton Down.  [4588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w50.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Operation Antler inquiry is a continuing criminal investigation. Wiltshire police are in the process of interviewing a number of former Porton Down scientists and medical staff who were involved in conducting trials and experiments upon service personnel who attended Porton Down as part of the Service Volunteer Programme between 1939 and 1989. Wiltshire police will send comprehensive reports to the Crown Prosecution Service when these are completed.
<P>

<a name="10720w50.html_para4">As part of the inquiry, Wiltshire police have forwarded a report on the death of the serviceman Ronald Maddison to Her Majesty's Coroner for Wiltshire. The Coroner is in the process of seeking authority from the Attorney- General under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to make an application to the High Court of Justice for an Order to have the original verdict of misadventure quashed and for a fresh inquest to be held.

 The information requested is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Generally, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate has set targets in its Business Plan for 2001&#150;02 of deciding 70 per cent. of non-asylum applications within three weeks. These targets are currently being met.

<a name="10720w50.html_para5">The total cost of construction and the management and operation of the 550 bed centre under an eight year contract is about &#163;180 million. The estimated costs for the option to provide up to a further 300 places will not be available until the completion of a feasibility study and appraisal is complete in the Autumn.

 The Prison Service is committed to reducing the rates of reoffending by prisoners on release. Because data on reoffending rates rely on self-reporting by offenders, reconviction rates are the best proxy measure. The Home Office published a new Public Service Agreement on 3 November 2000 which sets a joint target for the Prison and Probation Services to reduce by 2004 the rate of reconvictions of all offenders punished by imprisonment or by community supervision by 5 per cent. compared to the predicted rate. Because the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 660W</I><P>
reconviction data do not become available for over two years after the offender's release, the Key Performance Indicators for the Prison Service (the management tool for delivering this target) are based on delivering the annual outputs (educational qualifications, accredited offending behaviour programmes, and reducing drug use) which evidence shows will reduce the level of reconvictions.

 A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics, showed that some 10 per cent. of sentenced women and 7 per cent. of sentenced men had a functional psychosis. Some 63 per cent. of sentenced women and 40 per cent. of sentenced men had a neurotic disorder.
<P>

<a name="10720w51.html_para4">Applying these rates to the current population would indicate that around 3,800 sentenced prisoners would be suffering from a functional psychosis and around 22,000 from a neurotic disorder. Some prisoners will have both conditions.

<P>
<a name="10720w52.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There is no general review under way, but there are currently several strands of work focused on improving police practice in relation to mentally ill individuals. The Home Office, the Department of Health and the Association of Chief Police Officers are considering the development of national protocols covering the interaction between the police and health services in dealing with the mentally ill. The current review of the police Codes of Practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 is seeking to strengthen further protections for mentally ill detainees, particularly in terms of assessing their vulnerabilities and fitness for interview. In addition, the review of the Mental Health Act which is under way is looking to increase the emphasis on using hospitals rather than police stations as places of safety for assessing mental condition.
<P>

<a name="10720w52.html_para4">More needs to be done to ensure an appropriate and properly informed response to mentally ill individuals across the whole range of circumstances in which they deal with them. This recognition is increasingly reflected in improvements to police training, operational practice and working relationships with psychiatric and other health services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w52.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> The procedures for the appointment of members of police authorities by relevant councils are set out in schedule 2 of the Police Act 1996, as amended by section 105 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.
<P>

<a name="10720w52.html_para6">In the case of a police authority, such as Hampshire, where there is more than one relevant council, councillor members are appointed to the police authority by a joint committee appointed by the relevant councils from among their own members.

<P>

<a name="10720w52.html_para8">Section 105 of the Police and Criminal Justice Act 2001, which came into effect on 19 June 2001, clarifies the question of political balance on police authorities. It requires councils, or joint committees, to ensure that, so far as practicable, the proportion of members from any political party appointed to the police authority is the same as the proportion of those members on the council, or relevant councils taken as a whole. Any other places on the police authority must then be allocated to councillors who are not members of a political party.

<P>
<a name="10720w53.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> We have received some representations concerning the accuracy of Police National Computer (PNC) records, most notably those raised by the Home Affairs Committee and the Information Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="10720w53.html_para2">We fully recognise, and share, the concerns that have been expressed about errors and omissions in some of the data, and delays in inputting data onto the PNC. We have been working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), the Information Commissioner and other concerned parties to tackle these problems. Police forces are now working to a compliance strategy that has been drawn up by ACPO. This sets quantified performance indicators for key aspects of both quality and timeliness, including the prompt inputting of data both in the initial stages of a case and following the conclusion of trial proceedings. There are also agreed programmes to tackle backlogs.

For South Western I have added all services in the south-west region. Information is not yet collected centrally on staff absence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the further advice of Sir William Stewart on the potential health risks of specific frequency ranges for the emergency radio Airwave system; and if he will make a statement.  [5385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w54.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Sir William Stewart was the chairman of the Independent Expect Group on Mobile Phones. The group was commissioned by the Minister of Public Health to assess the current state of research into possible health risks from mobile phones. The Group's report, on Mobile Phones and Health, was published on 11 May 2000.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para0">As a result of the precautionary approach recommended in the report, and recognising that concerns had been raised about Airwave, the Home Office commissioned two studies. One study is being conducted by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and the other by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The NRPB have engaged their Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) to review the available evidence. Both of these studies are in progress.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para1">We are anticipating that the AGNIR report will be available in the next few weeks. The DERA study is longer term and DERA will be reporting to us on a regular basis, up to the conclusion of their main programme in May 2002.

(3) of the primates which, according to Table 2 of the Home Office statistics on the use of animals in scientific procedures for 1999, came from outside the European Union how many were captive-bred; from which countries captive-bred primates were imported; and how many were ill or injured on arrival, indicating the illness or injury in each case and how many became ill or injured during quarantine for reasons unrelated to the scientific procedures, indicating the illness or injury in each case.  [5710]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="10720w54.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We announced in 1997 our intention that licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 will never be issued for programmes of work involving the use of great apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) and that exceptional justification is required for the use of wild-caught primates.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para2">In addition, the 1986 Act requires that non-human primates cannot be used unless no other species is suitable. Along with regulatory testing to help ensure the safety of medicines, non-human primates (mainly marmosets and macaques) are also used for other important areas of fundamental research. For example, they contribute to programmes of work relating to Parkinson's disease, visual impairment, stroke, diabetes, disorders of reproduction and vaccine development.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para3">Table 2 of the Statistics of Scientific procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 1999 records 418 non- human primates used in scientific procedures as coming from outside the European Union. The detailed information requested in relation to these animals is for the most part not held centrally by the Home Office and it is, therefore, not possible to provide all of the information required about them. However, Home Office records confirm that none of these 418 animals were wild-caught.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para4">The overseas sources of primates used in 1999 were Mauritius, the Philippines, China, Israel and South Africa.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para5">I am advised that problems encountered with imported primates are generally few and instances of death following acquisition are very rare.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para6">It is not possible to provide general information with regard to primates destined for laboratories in the United Kingdom but subsequently not used. Such animals are not included in the annual statistics. I can confirm, however, that no deaths or injuries have been reported in baboons during transportation, including the group of 28 wild- caught baboons imported from Kenya in May 1999 but not used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w54.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Information on the total number of visitors refused leave to enter the United Kingdom is not available because refusals are recorded according to the reason for refusal and not according to the entry category (ie visitor, student, work permit holder). In addition, it is only possible to determine the number of visitors admitted. Information on the period of leave granted is not available. I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave on 11 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 535W.
<P>

<a name="10720w54.html_para7">However, information is available on the number of refusals where the main reason for refusal was because the immigration officer was not satisfied the applicant was a genuine visitor. It does not include persons intending to enter as visitors, but refused entry on other grounds. This, along with information on the total number of persons refused leave to enter and removed is shown in Table 1.

 Home Office Ministers and officials have regular discussions with both Eurotunnel and the French authorities about illegal immigration through the Channel Tunnel. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary discussed the subject with the French Minister of the Interior, M. Daniel Vaillant, on 11 July; and I discussed it with the Interior Ministers of France, 



<P>

Belgium and the Netherlands at a meeting on 17 July. The issue was discussed at the Anglo-French Ministerial Summit in Cahors on 9 February, and at subsequent meetings of the UK-French Cross-Channel Commission of senior officials and its sub-group.
<P>

<a name="10720w55.html_para0">Home Office Ministers have corresponded with Eurotunnel on a number of occasions about illegal immigration problems and improvements to the tunnel security regime. In addition, Immigration and Nationality Directorate officials are in close contact with Eurotunnel.
<P>

<a name="10720w55.html_para1">We have emphasised, through these contacts, that Eurotunnel needs to do more to secure its site at Coquelles. The present situation there is unacceptable, with increased numbers exploiting security deficiencies and posing a safety risk both to themselves and to the tunnel. We are therefore consulting Eurotunnel, and other interested parties, on proposals to extend the civil penalty to Eurotunnel freight train services.

<a name="10720w55.html_para4">Provisional figures indicate that the overall number of persons who have been detected at Kent ports or inland in Kent has reduced by 25 per cent. during the first six months of 2001 compared with the same period in 2000. This includes persons who had no documents, were clandestine entrants or arrived through the tunnel system.

 Now that the criminal proceedings against Sussex Police officers involved in the shooting of James Ashley have concluded, it is for the independent Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to decide whether disciplinary proceedings should be instituted against any of those officers.

 Statistics are published on an annual basis on the number of police operations involving firearms, the number of authorised firearms officers and the number of operations involving armed response vehicles. The number of occasions on which firearms are discharged, and any resulting fatalities, are also recorded.
<P>

<a name="10720w55.html_para11">Information on specific incidents in which shots are discharged, and any subsequent findings or recommendations arising from investigations supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, are carefully considered by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) sub-committee on the Police Use of Firearms. The Home Office is represented on this committee and will consider, in consultation with ACPO, any incidents which give rise to serious concern. Any lessons to be learned from such incidents are subsequently fed into the Manual on the Police Use of Firearms and into police training arrangements.

<a name="10720w55.html_para12">There have been difficulties with the booking system at Manchester for some time, but it is only recently that technical problems with the telephony equipment have been identified. Manchester is programmed to have its entire telephone system replaced in or around October this year.
<P>

<a name="10720w55.html_para13">The other information requested is not available as the telephone logging records only show the number of successful and unsuccessful calls and do not identify the source or whether it is a first or repeat call. Figures for

November 2000, the most recent available, show that 83.5 per cent. of incoming calls received the engaged signal.
<P>

<a name="10720w55.html_para14">It has been very difficult for callers to contact the visit booking service at Manchester prison at certain times, and we regret the inconvenience this has caused. Prior to replacing the system, a weekend telephone booking facility is being introduced from 22 July, and from 19 August prisoners will be able to book visits on behalf of their visitors, who will then be able to collect their visiting orders on arrival at the prison gate.

 The Government set out their strategy for helping adults improve their basic skills in the document "Skills for Life", published in March this year. This strategy includes a strong focus on helping unemployed people improve their literacy and numeracy skills and so increase their chances of getting and keeping a job. As part of our overall strategy, it is right that we pilot arrangements to sanction people receiving jobseeker's allowance who refuse to take up offers of help in improving their basic skills. The pilots, which we propose to implement in the autumn, will be fully evaluated.

 Since 1 April 2000, the HQ functions of the Benefits Agency have been carried out by Department of Social Security (DSS) departmental directorates which support all business units in the Department. The reason for this was to ensure more resources were focused on front line delivery and to reduce duplication across the agencies. As a result, as at 1 February 2001 (the last published figures), 2,523 staff had moved from departmental support services and were not replaced. The resource was transferred to the Benefits Agency. The figures show the staffing levels for those directorates.

2. For IB and DLA the figures have been calculated from the 1999&#150;2000 Family Resources Survey. For the IS Disability Premium they have been taken from the February 2001 Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiry and the February 2001 Child Benefit statistics.<P>

3. Data are not provided for Severe Disablement Allowance because the sample sizes are too small to support a reliable estimate.<P>

The overall costs of the projects to support Working Age, Pensions, Child Support and other key welfare reforms are shown but it is not yet possible to show the IT cost component because contracts have not yet been let for many of the IT projects. Because of the number of projects involved under each of the headings, the dates given can only be a broad indication of the earliest project start date, and the latest planned and expected end dates. The dates given are overall project targets, and thus embrace the IT elements of the project.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The increase in planned and estimated cost under Working Age project work from the information provided previously in response to PC 641/2001 is due to the Department's responsibility for projects which were previously the Department for Education and Employment. An additional factor in the increased costs is the number of additional projects which have come on stream since February, as well as revised estimates for Child Support reform.<P>

2. The costs shown have the following characteristics: they do not include any increase for pay and prices over the period; they include IT and non-IT cost components relating to each IT project; they do not include on-going core costs which will be incurred once the projects 'go live'. Additionally, the figures are high level estimates which are consequently subject to change. <P>

 Poverty and social exclusion are multi-faceted problems. Therefore we do not use a single definition of poverty, but instead use a range of indicators to monitor the progress of our strategy. Information relating to the indicators can be found in the second Government "Opportunity for all" report on tackling poverty and social exclusion, "One year on: making a difference" (Cm 4865). The report also describes and monitors the impact of policies we have already introduced and sets out our plans for the future.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The information is not available.
<P>

<a name="10720w59.html_para0">Student loans and most allowances are taken into account in the assessment of income-related benefit entitlement because primary financial support for students comes from the education maintenance system.
<P>

<a name="10720w59.html_para1">If student loans were not taken into account, the benefit system would be supporting students rather than the educational maintenance system. This would operate unfairly against the majority of students who are not entitled to benefits, as well as being contrary to the whole basis on which the income-related benefits are paid. We have no plans to change the current arrangements.

<a name="10720w61.html_para0">The text on screen is displayed in a font colour, style and size with good contrast which conforms to RNIB guidelines on designing screens for visually impaired users. The flat screen technology used is easier to view and use than conventional glass screens, and provides a stable non- flickering, non-reflective image. This is the recommended solution for people with photo-sensitive epilepsy, as confirmed by the British Epilepsy Association. Accessibility by disabled people was also an important factor when developing the jobpoints. The selected design enabled comfortable access by wheelchair users as well as people standing or sitting down.

<a name="10720w62.html_para0">Significant backlogs of work accrued in the processing of Disability Living Allowance in 2000 because of the growing caseload and the introduction in October 1999 of a new system of decision-making and appeals. The Benefits Agency tackled this backlog as a priority and it has now been substantially cleared. The average clearance time in the first three months of 2001&#150;02 is 42.17 days.

 The business case to possibly re-site DARA has recently concluded that due to high infrastructure costs, along with environmental and ecological considerations, it was not feasible to move DARA to Cardiff international airport.
<P>

<a name="10720w62.html_para4">The Welsh Development Agency has now re-focused its attention back to the St. Athan option and is working closely with the Defence Estates Agency, which is now taking the lead of this project, together with DARA, to provide a solution.

 Red Dragon has not been abandoned. In conjunction with the Defence Estates Agency, the Welsh Development Agency and DARA are now focusing on an option to develop the St. Athan site as an aviation business park and for other industrial and defence uses. Much of the work carried out to define DARA's requirements for its fixed-wing aircraft business unit for possible relocation to Cardiff airport will facilitate the St. Athan study. There has therefore been very little impact on the overall project, which has not been abandoned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence who decided that the proposed move of DARA at RAF St. Athan was not feasible.  [5324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w62.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The recommendation was made jointly by the Chief Executives of the Welsh Development Agency and the Defence Aviation Repair Agency following a review meeting and was endorsed by the DARA ministerial board on 11 July 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w62.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Two options were studied at Cardiff airport&#151;a West side and an East side. The study revealed there would be extremely high infrastructure and land preparation costs of at least &#163;30 million at both locations. Additionally, the studies concluded that there was an unacceptably high impact on protected species and listed buildings within the area, and that noise pollution may have been a problem.
<P>

<a name="10720w62.html_para5">The study also revealed that the available space that could be created was not sufficient to provide for potential future expansion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w62.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Following completion of the studies for the possible move of DARA to Cardiff international airport, projected costs were estimated to be in the order of &#163;65 million including provision for up to 46 fast jets and all supporting facilities. DARA's intention was to negotiate a leased facility option to avoid up-front capital costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w62.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Red Dragon has not been abandoned, but its focus is now on developing first-class modern facilities at St. Athan that will help to reduce DARA's overhead so that it can compete favourably for long-term business. Only the Cardiff airport options have been eliminated from the study.

These changes took effect from 31 October. Previously, an attributable widow's pension was withdrawn on remarriage or cohabitation, although it would have been automatically restored on second widowhood or at the end of a period of cohabitation. Those widows or widowers who had already remarried, and have had their attributable pension withdrawn, were

not included in the change. Those in receipt of a War Widows' Pension payable under the Naval, Military and Air Force Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983, or a non-attributable widows or widowers' AFPS pension are also not affected by the change; their pensions will still cease on remarriage or cohabitation.

 The Ministry of Defence was consulted on the proposed off-shore wind farm at Cleveleys, Lancashire (also known as Shell Flats) on 27 April 2001. The response, dated 16 July 2001, objected to the proposed siting of a wind farm at this position because it lies within 15 miles of BAE Systems Ltd. Warton. The MOD applies planning safeguards to this airfield because of its use for the developmental test and evaluation flying of new military aircraft.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into relative survival rates following diagnosis of cancer in the UK and the rest of Europe.  [63]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w66.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department, through the European Union, is contributing to the funding of a set of studies known as the Eurocare studies. These are continually comparing cancer survival outcomes, treatment practice and diagnostic practice across Europe in patients diagnosed since the late 1970s. The Eurocare studies have produced evidence to suggest that, for many cancers, survival rates for patients a decade ago are lower in this country than in other comparable European countries.
<P>

<a name="10720w66.html_para0">The Department held a workshop in March 2000 to look at the Eurocare data on cancer survival rates, and there were two main conclusions. First, the poorer survival rates in the United Kingdom reported for many cancer types were to a large extent real. Secondly, for breast and colorectal cancer it appears that the poor 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 719W</I><P>
survival rates in the UK can be attributed at least in part to patients having more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The NHS Cancer Plan of September 2000 took account of these conclusions, setting out the actions required to achieve earlier diagnosis and to ensure patients receive high quality treatment.
<P>

<a name="10720w66.html_para1">The Department funded pilot work on the UK component of further Eurocare studies of survival rates for breast, bowel and prostate cancer in early 2000. The Department is currently considering whether to provide further support for this study.
<P>

<a name="10720w66.html_para2">The Department has recently commissioned, under the Inequalities in Health initiative, a project that investigates inequalities in cancer incidence and survival for the population of England and Wales over 45 years of age.

<P>

<a name="10720w66.html_para3">The White Paper "The new NHS&#151;Modern, Dependable" set the standard that everyone with suspected cancer will be able to see a specialist within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding that they need to be seen urgently and requesting an appointment. These arrangements were guaranteed for everyone with suspected breast cancer from April 1999 and were introduced for all other urgent cases of suspected cancer during 2000. Central monitoring of the all-cancer two week standard began on 1 January 2001. Figures will be available later this year.

This mirrored the higher rate of asceptic meningitis in males after wild mumps infection, (MMR vaccines containing the Urabe strain mumps were discontinued in the United Kingdom in 1992).

 As with all medicines, the safety of Prozac (fluoxetine) is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).
<P>

<a name="10720w67.html_para0">Part of this monitoring is via the Yellow Card scheme, where health professionals report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the MCA/CSM.

All reports received are routinely assessed by the MCA. The other data sources regularly used in the monitoring of drug safety in the United Kingdom include formal safety studies, published medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout the world together with information on the level of drug prescribing.

 The Department, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, plans to establish a large prospective cohort of about 500,000 volunteers. The cohort will be used to study interactions between genetic, environmental and lifestyle risk factors to help determine the relative contribution of these factors in the development of chronic diseases in middle or adult later life. The scientific programme and the business plan for this initiative is under development with a view to obtaining final funding decisions early next year. It is anticipated that full cohort recruitment will start in 2003.

 People under 18-years-old (under 19 if in full-time education); pregnant women; and women who have borne a child in the previous 12 months pay no charges for national health service dental care or treatment. Free dental care or treatment under the NHS is also available to those in receipt of certain benefits and tax credits. In addition, anyone on a low income may be entitled to full or partial remission of charges through the NHS low income scheme. We have no plans to introduce free dental check-ups for all and believe that it is a better use of scarce resources to focus help on those who need it most.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of medicines prescribed to <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> adults (i) do not have full marketing authorisation by the Medicines Control Agency and (ii) are not licensed for all ages.  [4653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w67.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> In the United Kingdom, there is a legal exemption to allow supply of unlicensed medicines under certain conditions. This allows a doctor or dentist to prescribe an unlicensed medicine or a licensed medicine outside its licensed indications ('off-label' prescribing) for the special needs of his individual patient. For instance a doctor may prescribe a medicine for a child that is licensed only for adults. The Department has not undertaken research into such prescribing, or monitored the level of its use. However, reports in the literature of results of hospital- based surveys indicate that such prescribing is extensive in children. For example, in a neonatal intensive care unit around 90 per cent. of neonates received off-label or unlicensed medicines <sup>1</sup> ; in an intensive care unit around 70 per cent. of children received a medicine outside a licensed indication and 31 per cent. of prescriptions were for unlicensed or off-label use <sup>2</sup> ; and in a study of children in medical and surgical wards 25 per cent. of the products prescribed during the admission were for unlicensed indications <sup>3</sup> . In primary care the incidence of off-label or unlicensed prescribing to the paediatric population is thought to be around 10 per cent. <sup>4</sup> . Copies of the referenced papers will be placed in the Library. No similar evidence exists for adults.
<P>

<a name="10720w67.html_para2">We recognise the critical importance of this issue and agree that children should have access to medicines that have been fully evaluated to the same high standards of safety, quality and efficacy as those available for the adult population. The problem is not confined to the UK, but affects the whole of Europe and the United States of America. The UK is leading the call for action at a European level. Medicines regulation in the UK derives largely from European legislation and an international approach to the problem is therefore needed.
<P>

<a name="10720w67.html_para3">We have consequently raised the profile of this issue at a European level, including taking the lead in developing a European guideline, adopted in 1997, to encourage companies to undertake appropriate clinical trials on the use of medicines in the treatment of children. This formed the basis for an international guideline, which came into operation in January in the European Union, and also applies in the USA and Japan. In addition, the Council of the European Union has asked the European Commission to bring forward measures to make sure that medicines for children are fully adapted to their specific needs. We are presently waiting for their proposals. However, the Commission has stated its intention to comply with this request. The UK will play an active role in the development of this initiative to ensure that effective solutions are found.
<P>

<a name="10720w67.html_para4">In addition the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), the scientific advisory committee of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), recognising the importance of this topic has announced its intention to set up a paediatric expert group to advise the EMEA and its scientific committees on all questions 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 2001 : Column: 726W</I><P>
relating to the development and use of medicinal products in children. The UK has nominated representatives to this paediatric expert group.
<P>

<a name="10720w67.html_para5">In the meantime, the UK Government have taken important steps at a national level within the existing regulatory framework. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), an independent expert committee that advises the licensing authority, asks companies for paediatric development plans where appropriate and has established a paediatric sub-group to provide expert advice on the licensing and safety of medicines for children. Product information for parents and carers is being simplified and the profile of monitoring the safety of medicines used in the treatment of children has been increased. Since 1998, the MCA has jointly funded a pilot scheme in Trent, the Paediatric Regional Monitoring Centre (PRMC), to stimulate reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to medicines used in the treatment of children. The scheme aimed to stimulate the reporting of suspected ADRs in children. The progress of the PRMC was reviewed after two years and it was concluded that it has been only of limited success. The MCA and CSM are now proposing to pursue a wider strategy to enhance existing data collection mechanisms and the lessons learned from the PRMC will be fully utilised in taking forward this strategy. The Government are committed to finding a long-term solution so that parents and carers can be reassured about the safety of medicines given to children.

<P>

<a name="10720w68.html_para4">We have made huge strides over recent years in increasing the proportion of women and black and ethnic minority candidates appointed to NHS boards. 50 per cent. of all NHS board members are now women, and 12 per cent. are black or from ethnic minorities. This compares with figures of only 39 per cent. and 5 per cent. at the time of the 1997 general election. As a result, the boards of these bodies are now far more representative of the communities they serve.

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The Department of Health funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service.




<P>

<P>

<a name="10720w69.html_para3">Between 1996 and 2001 the Department of Health and the MRC's estimated spend on research projects related to benign prostatic hyperplasia was over &#163;1.5 million. In addition to these specific projects the Department of Health also provides funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that take place in the NHS. The total investment will therefore be considerably greater than the spend on individual projects. The National Research Register contains details of these projects and is available at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/ research/nrr.htm.

 It is our intention to increase United Kingdom health care expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product towards the average of the European Union countries, which is around 8 per cent. of gross domestic product. On current spending plans, by 2003&#150;04 total health spending in the UK will be around 7.7 per cent. of gross domestic product.

 The National Advisory Group for Scientists and Technicians has been charged with developing plans to improve workforce planning, education, training and career development among this group of staff, including biomedical scientists. The Department is also developing a specific strategy for improving recruitment, retention and return, liaising closely with employers, professional bodies and trade unions to raise the profile of the work of scientists.
<P>

<a name="10720w71.html_para0">The National Health Service careers service, http:// www.nhscareers.nhs.uk, has been extended to include scientists and technicians. A new generic scientists and technicians careers leaflet has also been prepared.

<P>
<a name="10720w71.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The universal neonatal hearing screening pilot is the first phase of a national roll-out of the service. The pilot phase will provide important information, about the impact on audiology and other support services, and will provide the data that is required to enable us to plan a national roll-out to a sensible, feasible time scale. An announcement will be made early next year about a timetable for national implementation, taking account of the initial findings of the pilot phase. The pace of change will be determined by the practical challenges that the pilot will uncover.

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> This information changes constantly as a film is released at cinemas and on video or DVD in different countries at different times. The shelf life of films is long, which means there is no simple answer to the question. That is not to say that revenues are not known for films in which lottery money has been invested (in relation to territories and media where the distributor was entitled under the terms of the deal to a share of the revenues) but those revenues increase constantly and reflect changing market value and are therefore difficult to interpret.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who currently receives free-to-air channels on analogue will continue to do so digitally after the switchover to digital television, whether by terrestrial, cable or satellite means. Maps showing the predicted digital terrestrial television (DTT) coverage from each of the main UK DTT transmitter sites and relays have been placed in both Houses on CD-ROM. These show that parts of Worcestershire are covered by transmissions from the Malvern, Bromsgrove, Ridge Hill and Lark Stoke transmitters. The BBC and ITC, who are responsible for the DTT transmission network, are now considering, in consultation with the digital broadcasters, manufacturers, consumer groups and Government, how to improve the core coverage of all digital television multiplexes across the UK. Cable services are available in Worcestershire, although coverage concentrates on areas of dense population. It is for cable operators to decide on the roll out of their digital services and viability of extending services to non-urban areas.

 The award of the new news provider contract for Channel 3 is not a matter for Government.

It is the responsibility of the ITC to ensure that only companies meeting the required standard are granted such status. This system ensures that ITV has a provider of high quality national and international news that can offer competition to the BBC's national news services and in turn guarantees plurality for viewers.

 It is already an offence for a licensee to permit drunkenness in licensed premises or to sell alcohol to a drunken person. Anyone on licensed premises who procures or attempts to procure any alcohol for consumption by a drunken person commits an offence; and it is also an offence to aid a drunken person in obtaining or consuming alcohol in licensed premises.

<a name="10720w73.html_para2">We expect to bring into force shortly those parts of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 which will extend the offence of permitting drunkenness to managers of licensed premises who do not themselves hold the licence, and extend to all bar staff the offence of selling alcohol to drunken persons in licensed premises. At the same time, the new police powers to close down disorderly and excessively noisy licensed premises will be brought into force.

In relation to the entry of young artists into the music industry, I naturally fully support the Government's new deal for musicians programme.

 The Government have agreed to the request from the football authorities to appoint the first chairman of the Independent Football Commission&#151;the new self-regulatory body which they are establishing. The process of appointing the chairman is being conducted in the open and transparent manner that applies to public appointments. An independent public appointments advisory panel was convened to consider the applications which had been received by the Department for this post. The panel has made its recommendations to me. I am currently considering them. I therefore hope to make an announcement on the appointment shortly. I shall place a copy of any announcement I make on this issue in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10720w74.html_spnew6"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The report's main conclusion and recommendation was that responsibility for the royal parks should remain with central Government and that the Royal Parks Agency (RPA) should continue to manage them although the Department should work towards establishing the royal parks as a non-departmental public body (NDPB). The Government accept this recommendation and would like to see early progress to the change of status to NDPB. It is our intention, therefore, to establish the royal parks as an NDPB from 1 April 2002. I shall retain responsibility for the management of the royal parks but will be seeking Parliament's approval of an order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to delegate my day-to-day responsibilities to the new body. The Government have accepted all the recommendations in the report for improving the efficiency of the Royal Parks Agency. The chief executive has already achieved much in implementing these. This work will continue as part of the preparations for NDPB status. The Government accept the recommendation that the royal parks should be policed by a uniformed force. My Department and the Home Office are discussing the future relationship between the royal park constabulary and the Metropolitan police service so as to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective policing of the royal parks.
<P>

<a name="10720w74.html_para1">The Government believe that NDPB status, with the management of the royal parks guided by an expert and experienced board, will provide the royal parks with greater freedom and focus to continue to build on the high standard of presentation of the royal parks which has improved even further in recent years.

 As part of this Department's programme of quinquennial reviews of its public bodies, I am today announcing the conclusion of the first stage of the Sport England quinquennial review.
<P>

<a name="10720w74.html_para2">Sport England is responsible for developing and maintaining the infrastructure of sport in England, for distributing national lottery funds for sport in England and for five national sports centres. The first stage of the review concludes that the development of sport is important to both the Government's wider objectives and the public, and that Sport England should continue its unique role in the development of sport in England on behalf of the Government but at arm's length from it.
<P>

<a name="10720w74.html_para3">The first stage of the review has made a series of recommendations for consideration in the second stage of the review to enable Sport England to further become a responsive and high quality organisation responsible for the development of sport in England and play its part in implementing the proposals set out in the Government's plan for sport published earlier this year.

 I met the Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning on 17 July and we discussed the recent report of the Independent Investigation Group into Student Funding and Hardship. It is for the Assembly itself to respond to the recommendations in the report addressed to them and which fall within their powers.
<P>

<a name="10720w75.html_para4">Applications are increasing, and drop-out remains consistently low. The figures published by UCAS on 20 July show that overall the number of UK students applying to higher education has gone up by 2.4 per cent. In particular, there has been a 4.7 per cent. increase in the number of applications from students over 21. The latest Student Income and Expenditure Survey does not give evidence of widespread student hardship. However, we have increased support going to the most vulnerable students, those with dependants or with disabilities. For student parents entitled to receive maximum financial support, this could be up to &#163;13,110&#151;or &#163;17,425 if student loans are taken into account&#151;per year. But we are not complacent, and will continue to review the effectiveness of the arrangements against our widening access and increasing participation objectives. Arrangements for further education student support are matters for each country but we will continue to keep in touch with each other when considering future developments.

 The new funding arrangements for higher education introduced in 1998&#150;99 provide for contributions from students, their parents and the taxpayer. From this autumn, 50 per cent. of students will make no contribution to tuition fees following changes in the parental income threshold.
<P>

<a name="10720w75.html_para5">There is no evidence to suggest that the new arrangements are deterring students from entering higher education. The total number of full-time students enrolled in HE has risen in each of the two years since contributions to fees were introduced. The latest published figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service show a 2.4 per cent. rise in UK applicants for entry in autumn 2001 and the figures for mature students show a rise of 4.7 per cent.

 Assessments of this kind are made by each local education authority and not by my Department. Local education authorities have a duty to ensure that there are sufficient school places in their area. They must publish annually a School Organisation Plan, which sets out how they plan to deal with any surplus or deficit of school places over a rolling five-year period.

 Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilots are being evaluated extensively over a three-year period and the final report is not likely to be available before early 2003. The first interim reports were published in summer this year and the next is due early in 2002. We are looking at emerging evidence from this evaluation and practical experience from the pilots to inform our thinking about future development of EMAs.

 Ministers considered very carefully the advice from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority on the introduction of vocational GCSEs. The advice was informed by an extensive public consultation exercise.

Funding Council. The creation of the LSC has reduced the number of public bodies further education colleges need apply to for funding and the number of audits they need to undergo. The LSC has already reduced the audit burden in further education by appointing the auditors of student numbers and by developing a common audit approach for all colleges. The LSC is also reviewing the funding processes for further education colleges and is working with other public sector funding bodies to reduce further the audit burdens on the sector.
<P>

<a name="10720w80.html_para2">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) commissioned, last year, a review from PA Consulting on the accountability burden in the HE sector. The review, published in August 2000, identified four areas of burden&#151;assessments carried out by the Quality Assurance Agency in HE Institutions (HEIs), the bidding process for HEIs, the Research Assessment Exercise and the provision of information. A HE forum, chaired by the HEFCE and composed of the major HE stakeholders, has undertaken five projects to look at these issues.

 In the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilot, eligibility for an EMA is determined on the basis of where a student lives, rather than according to the school or college attended. Students who live in an area where EMA is available qualify for an award whichever school or college they attend&#151;even if it is in a different LEA area. There is a very extensive evaluation under way looking at all aspects of EMA. It has not identified fringe imports as a significant feature.

<P>

 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) took over responsibility for the funding of further education, work based learning for young people and adult and community learning. This has reduced the number of public bodies colleges need apply to for funding. The LSC is reviewing the funding processes for further education colleges and is working with other public sector funding bodies to reduce audit burdens. The reforms introduced from April 2001 to the Schools Standards Fund have done away with almost all forms of bidding for funds, so that nearly all recurrent funding is allocated to schools via transparent formulae.

 Colleges receive a Teaching Pay Initiative allocation in proportion to their main funding allocation from the Learning and Skills Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. We will explore with the Learning and Skills Council and college representative bodies whether it would be right to refine the arrangements from 2002&#150;03 for distributing funding above these minimum annual allocations, to recognise the different retention and achievement rates at different colleges while having regard to the prior attainment of their students.

 I do not believe there is any basis for aligning the levies of the CITB and the ECITB. It is for each board, in consultation with the employers in its industry, to propose its own levy arrangements, including the rate of levy. These proposals are subject to the approval of Ministers and Parliament. The levy rate must reflect the board's general policy and plans for training in the industry and the costs of those plans.

 The Government strongly support the need to ascertain the views of young people in relation to decisions that affect them. Citizenship, a statutory secondary subject from September 2002, will teach young people about their rights and responsibilities and how to participate in the decision-making processes. This month, guidance written by teachers to support the effective delivery of citizenship in secondary schools was made freely available in draft form. This includes tried and tested teaching and learning ideas to encourage active participation by young people, for example through local democratic processes and student councils. It will be sent to all schools and LEAs in the autumn and is on the Department's Standards website.

 Many schools already involve pupils in management issues that concern them. With the introduction of citizenship, a statutory part of the secondary curriculum from September 2002, active participation in decision making at school will be encouraged. Good practice already exists in many schools, for example through school councils where pupils represented on governing bodies are involved in staff recruitment, school policies and catering decisions. Guidance for secondary schools is available on the DfES website and the Department has funded Schools Councils UK to produce primary and secondary school council toolkits.

 In the financial year 1998&#150;99, grant-maintained (GM) schools in Surrey received recurrent funding from the former Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) amounting on average to &#163;1,810 per pupil in the case of primary schools and &#163;2,410 per pupil in the case of secondary schools. For the financial year 2001&#150;02, the most closely comparable figures currently available in respect of these schools are &#163;2,060 per pupil and &#163;2,660 per pupil respectively. All figures have been calculated to the nearest &#163;10 on the basis of pupil numbers from the Annual Schools Census for January 1998 and January 2001.
<P>

<a name="10720w82.html_para3">The calculations for 1998&#150;99 are based on financial information supplied to the Department by FAS. The figures include annual maintenance grant together with special purpose grants for development, nursery education, premises insurance, primary support and the purchase of books, but not other special purpose grants or capital grants. Most GM schools' annual maintenance grant included an element to compensate the schools for their inability to reclaim VAT: appropriate adjustments have been made to reflect this.
<P>

<a name="10720w82.html_para4">The calculations for 2001&#150;02 are based on information from the budget statement published by the local education authority under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, supplemented and updated (in the case of specific grants) by information separately provided by the LEA. The figures include the schools' budget shares (including School Standards Grant and transitional funding); Standards Fund resources devolved to the schools (but excluding capital grants, and other grants relating to school security and the National Grid for Learning); and Infant Class Size grants devolved to schools otherwise than through their budget shares.
<P>

<a name="10720w82.html_para5">In 1998&#150;99, under arrangements specific to the GM sector, the GM schools received formula capital allocations from FAS amounting on average to &#163;46 per pupil (primary) and &#163;31 per pupil (secondary). Under the NDS devolved formula capital arrangements which apply to all schools, the Surrey ex-GM schools' allocations for 2001&#150;02 amount on average to &#163;37 per pupil (primary and &#163;28 per pupil (secondary); all these figures are rounded to the nearest pound.

 The table shows those local authorities in England that currently have a signed schools Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract. One other project has reached commercial close, but has not yet reached financial closure. The table shows the type of contract and the PFI credit value for each project. Typically, the length of a PFI contract in the schools sector is of the order of 25 to 30 years, although contracts which provide services not directly related to buildings are for shorter periods.

<a name="10720w82.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) procurement process is a negotiated procedure which, by its nature, involves changes in the scope and cost of a project as it is developed by a Local Education Authority. Current PFI projects have many years still to run. All schools PFI projects in England require approval from the Treasury chaired Project Review Group (PRG). Financial support from the Department is in the form of PFI credits. The level of PFI credits for each project is set by PRG, after a rigorous review which ensures that projects are financially viable and offer value for money to the public sector. If, due to circumstances beyond an Authority's control, an increase in funding is required, PRG approval must be obtained.

In addition, the Lord Chancellor's Department funded an advertising campaign in January this year to help raise awareness of family mediation.

 There is no guidance on the composition of juries in areas with high proportions of ethnic minorities.

Under the Juries Act 1974, jurors are chosen at random from the electoral register.

 The competitions for grants of city status to one town in each of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and for a Lord Mayoralty, will be launched next Wednesday, 25 July, by means of press notices.

 The Government have no current plans to legislate in this area. However, the Law Commission is currently reviewing the law as it relates to the property rights of people who share homes. This covers a wide category of person including all those who live in the same household other than by reason of one of them being the other's employee, tenant, lodger or boarder. It is expected that the Law Commission will be in a position to publish a consultation paper in the spring of 2002. The Government will of course be interested in the Law Commission's proposals, and in the response to them.
