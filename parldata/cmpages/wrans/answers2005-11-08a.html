 The Welsh Assembly Government&#039;s long-term vision is that everyone in Wales shall have the opportunity to live in good quality homes. To achieve this, steps are needed to ensure that existing housing meets the Welsh Housing Quality Standard. Social landlords are expected to devise realistic programmes to bring their properties up to the standard by the end of 2012. The Assembly has an agreement with HM Treasury that enables housing authorities to pay off overhanging debt to the Public Works Loan Board, on transfer of stock to a registered social landlord.

 The Government support the use of woodfuel for the generation of heat, combined heat and power (CHP), and electricity. We are working closely with industry and others to develop markets and promote uptake. Householders and community organisations can apply for funding under DTI&#039;s &#163;12.5 million Clear Skies Initiative to install renewable energy schemes, including wood-fuelled boiler systems. Defra&#039;s &#163;60 million Community Energy programme provides capital grants to install new and refurbish old community heating networks, including renewable energy systems. DTI and the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme has allocated &#163;66 million of funding to develop end-use markets for biomass, including woodfuel, in the heat, CHP and electricity generation sectors. Grants are also available from the regional development agencies. Co-firing of woodfuel with fossil fuels in conventional power stations is a developing end-use. Support to help develop the supply chain for woodfuel has been made available under the &#163;3.5 million Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme. The Community Renewables Initiative&#039;s local support teams are working to develop local woodfuel projects in their areas.

<a name="51108w12.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_67">We recognise that there are issues that make it difficult to encourage the confidence needed for the development of woodfuel markets. The Biomass Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, was set up a year ago to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy, including woodfuel, and to recommend ways to overcome the problems. Their report was published on 25 October. The Government has committed itself to publishing a full response to the report within the next six months.

 For analysis purposes, the public sector is usually treated as part of the wider commercial and public services sector. Estimates from experts vary, depending on assumptions made. In broad terms, it might be possible to achieve savings of around 30 per cent. if all technical measures were implemented, regardless of cost, across the sector as a whole. However, the potential for cost-effective measures by 2010 is around 10 per cent.. The same figures are assumed to apply to the public sector share.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="51108w12.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The approach adopted by successive governments has been that no compensation is generally payable to those affected by flooding. This reflects the fact that flood defence legislation is based on &quot;permissive powers&quot; i.e. that bodies such as the Environment Agency are empowered to undertake flood defence works but are not obligated to do so.

 The Guaranteed Standards Scheme (GSS) sets out the conditions under which customers of water and sewerage companies are entitled to compensation.

 The recent European Court of Justice ruling turned down an application by Austria for a derogation from Directive 2001/18/EC to declare the region of Upper Austria a GM-free zone. The court&#039;s ruling was based on the fact that the Austrian Government failed to prove that the region of Upper Austria had a unique ecosystem which might justify a

<a name="51108w12.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_69">Under current EU law, as agreed by EU member states, the only legitimate grounds for narrowing the geographical scope of an approval to prevent cultivation in a defined zone are the production of clear evidence that the GM crop involved poses a particular risk to the specific area in question.

However, some crops for non-food use (eg essential oil crops) may be grown outside such schemes and out-with any arable support scheme, in addition some food crops may be diverted to non-food uses (eg wheat for starch). Accurate information on such crops and crop movements is not centrally collated. The data therefore represents an underestimate of the true non-food crop area and production statistics.<br>

2. Data presented for Short Rotation Coppice and Miscanthus areas represents information collated under the Energy Crops Scheme on planting grant applications and applications under the Woodland Grant Scheme.<br>

3. Data for non-food crops grown on set-aside and crops for energy grown on non-set-aside land in receipt of payments under the new Energy Aid Payment Scheme was derived from data collated by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). 32,927 ha of rape were grown on main regime land in 2004 for biodiesel production&#151;this is included in the figures for oilseed rape in the table.<br>

4. Data for Linseed is derived from Defra Statistics for main regime land and the RPA for production on set-aside (999 ha).<br>

5. Data for flax and hemp areas and production is derived from declarations under the UK Flax and Hemp Fibre Regime.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the impact of coastal erosion on <i>(a)</i> each coastally-sited nuclear plant, <i>(b)</i> Sellafield and <i>(c)</i> the low level radioactive disposal site at Drigg. [23555]</p>




<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51108w13.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Operational responsibility for managing the risk from coastal erosion in England rests with maritime district councils who, in partnership with the Environment Agency and other bodies with coastal defence responsibilities, take an integrated and long-term view of managing coastlines through Shoreline Management Plans. These plans, in line with Government policy, consider the implications of coastal processes, including erosion. More detailed coastal strategies are then developed, taking into account economic, social and environmental matters. These detailed strategies consider the specific needs of key coastal installations, such as nuclear power stations, Sellafield and the Low-level Waste Repository (LLWR) at Drigg.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w13.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_71">The safety of nuclear installations in the UK is regulated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which requires operators to produce safety cases which address a range of internal and external hazards, including flooding. Safety cases are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changing conditions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w13.html_para2">
HSE, the Environment Agency, maritime district councils and operators ensure, through consultation on the development of Shoreline Management Plans, that the plans do not compromise the needs of nuclear sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w13.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_72">The impact of coastal erosion on the LLWR has also been considered as part of a Post-Closure Safety Case for the site, submitted to the Environment Agency by British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited (BNGSL) in September 2002. BNGSL&#039;s assessment predicts that the LLWR could be destroyed by coastal erosion in 500 to 5,000 years if no action were taken to maintain the coastline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w13.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_73">The Environment Agency will shortly issue its decision on future regulation of the LLWR, and is proposing to require BNGSL to consider a number of options to reduce predicted impacts.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effectiveness to date of the Dublin II Regulation of 2003 in reducing <i>(a)</i> asylum shopping and <i>(b)</i> the problem of refugees in orbit.  [20269]</p>




<p><a name="st_167"><a name="51108w16.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The European Commission has recently launched a comprehensive evaluation process to cover all aspects of the Dublin arrangements, including the operation of the secure electronic communications network for Dublin II requests (&quot;DubliNet&quot;) and the supporting Eurodac fingerprint database. The resulting report, expected in 2006, will analyse the impact of the Dublin arrangements to draw conclusions on the added value of Dublin II and the Eurodac Regulation EC No. 2725/2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_92">The second Annual Report to the Council and the European Parliament on the activities of the Eurodac Central Unit concluded that Eurodac represents an extremely important tool for a faster and more efficient application of the Dublin arrangements. The report also notes that Eurodac data provide a sound indicator of the phenomenon of &quot;asylum shopping&quot; in member states. Copies of the report can be found in the Libraries. The Home Office&#039;s assessment of the report is set out in Explanatory Memorandum 10464/05 sent to the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees on 14 September 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_93">Our own assessment of the new Dublin arrangements, supported by Eurodac is favourable. Dublin II and Eurodac enabled us to return 1,982 applicants in 2004 to other European countries without considering their claims ourselves. This is far more effective than the gentleman&#039;s agreement which applied until 1997, under which fewer people were removed in a year than the Dublin arrangements have enabled us to remove in a month. While it is not possible to prove to what extent asylum shopping that would otherwise have happened is not happening as a result of the new arrangements, asylum intake across the EU15 has fallen by 21 per cent. between 2003 and 2004 (source IRSS).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51108w16.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">On the question of refugees in orbit, the Dublin II Regulation is based on a mechanism to identify the member state responsible for determining an asylum claim and provides guarantees that identified state will take charge of or take back an asylum seeker within prescribed time limits. In addition, unlike the old Dublin Convention, the regulation reflects the agreement that member states fully accept to take responsibility for an asylum applicant where a procedural time limit is breached. This ensures that asylum applicants do not face prolonged periods of uncertainty.

 The National Asylum Support Service&#039;s (NASS) target for deciding applications for support under section 4 is five working days which has routinely been met in the past year. However, a very significant increase in applications meant that NASS could no longer meet this target in all cases.
