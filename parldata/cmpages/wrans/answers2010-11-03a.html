 The UK Government would prefer to see all farm animals stunned before slaughter but accepts the rights of religious communities to eat meat slaughtered in accordance with their religious beliefs. We have not made a recent assessment of the merits of making mandatory pre-stunning prior to slaughter for farm animals entering the food chain. Current and future EU regulations give member states rights to exercise discretion over pre-cut stunning when related to religious slaughter.

<i> [holding answer 2 November 2010]:</i><i> </i>The Department for Communities and Local Government's (DCLG's) contract with EADS includes the provision of a fixed amount of consultancy support for use by DCLG, regional entities and the fire and rescue service (FRS). This support may be used by DCLG, at its discretion, either for core project activities or to support individual FRSs. EADS wrote to DCLG in June 2010 with a detailed list of activities assigned to the contractually agreed consultancy support resource. Within this, EADS had assigned 20 consultant days worth of effort, at an average daily rate of £600 in relation to preparation for and appearance at the Select Committee Inquiry hearing in February 2010. DCLG has not authorised any effort associated with this activity to be assigned consultancy support and does not agree that it falls within the scope of core project activities. It is wholly inappropriate to use taxpayers' money in this way and we have refused to pay it. A copy of this list has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

 There have been no prosecutions under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 reported to the Ministry of Justice for England and Wales, from its introduction in March 2004, up to the end of 2009 (latest available).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="101103w0002.htm_para0"><a name="10110372000291">The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 is intended to help to prevent this unacceptable practice from happening in the first place. Research suggests a number of barriers to prosecution, including pressure from the family or wider community, lead to cases going unreported. Despite the lack of prosecutions to date, the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 provides a clear message that female genital mutilation is an unacceptable practice and illegal in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="101103w0002.htm_para1"><a name="10110372000292">A range of guidance has been issued to heighten awareness among all relevant professionals. The Home Office issued guidance to all chief officers of police in England and Wales on the investigation of cases of female genital mutilation when the Act came into force in 2004. The Association of Chief Police Officers incorporated female genital mutilation in guidance for police forces which was revised and reissued in 2008. The Crown Prosecution Service included female genital mutilation in its Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Domestic Violence, which was disseminated to all prosecutors by the end of 2008. This was accompanied by a modular training package which has been rolled out to all CPS areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="101103w0002.htm_para2"><a name="10110372000293">The Government appointed a cross government female genital mutilation coordinator in September 2009 and a number of initiatives have been implemented to improve the Government response to tackling female genital mutilation. Most recently, the Home Office, in partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department of Health and Department for Education, have developed draft Multi-Agency Practice Guidelines to assist practitioners handling cases of female genital mutilation. These guidelines are open for consultation at:</p>

1. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
It is known that in some police force areas, information on remand decisions is not always readily available to those coding court proceedings returns. In certain cases, the return may be mistakenly coded as if no remand had taken place. For magistrates court proceedings, the number of remands and more importantly, the number which are in custody, are believed to be under-recorded in total. As the breakdown of remands into bail and custody cases for a number of forces is not accurate for a number of forces, estimates have to be made to provide national figures.<br>
2. Some percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.<br>

 I have met with both the CWU and Unite to discuss Royal Mail matters. Government have been clear that their policy for ownership of Royal Mail is to enable a sale of shares in the company in order to secure the future of both Royal Mail and the universal postal service, and as part of this to make available 10% of the equity for employees as part of the privatisation process. This was set out in the policy statement that we published alongside introduction of the Postal Services Bill on 13 October "Delivering for the future-a universal mail service and community post offices in the digital age". It can be viewed in the House Libraries or online at:</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 October 2010]:</i> We deeply regret all civilian casualties. Protecting the Afghan civilian population is a cornerstone of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)'s mission, and all British troops undergo comprehensive training on the strict rules of engagement. Where incidents do occur, procedures are in place to ensure they are promptly reported to the chain of command and follow-up actions take place in accordance with ISAF and UK national procedures. This contrasts directly with the attitude of the insurgents, whose indiscriminate use of suicide bombs, roadside explosive devices and human shields cause the majority of civilian deaths and injuries in Afghanistan. We will continue our efforts to prevent insurgents harming civilians and to develop the capacity of Afghan security forces to protect the population.</p>

Initial Gate seeks approval to undertake the detailed development and an assessment of available options to meet a capability gap. Following Initial Gate projects seek Main Gate approval to proceed with the demonstration and manufacture of their recommended option. Main Gate is the major investment decision, whereas Initial Gate ensures that only projects which meet a requirement and are likely to be deliverable are allowed to continue.</p>

 We remain absolutely committed to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme, which will provide a world-beating aircraft, able to operate from both the sea and land, ideally suited for our future capability needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="101103w0002.htm_para29"><a name="10110372000952">In the first instance, we intend to buy enough JSF aircraft to build up our carrier strike capability, and to operate a balanced fleet of JSF and Typhoon aircraft in the medium to long term. We will confirm the exact number of aircraft in our initial buy at the time of our main investment decision, in line with usual practice.</p>

We will bring JSF into service, initially in the land environment, and then to deliver a carrier strike capability from around 2020. The aircraft will be equipped with a range of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, the exact mix of which will be optimised to reflect the operational requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="101103w0002.htm_para31"><a name="10110372000954">We have previously committed to purchasing three JSF which will be used for Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. No further orders have been placed. Our changed plans will not therefore incur cancellation costs to the Department. We currently assess that the decision to procure the Carrier Variant will reduce the forecast cost of the JSF programme since the Carrier Variant is likely to be cheaper both to procure and to support through life than the Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variant, which we had previously been planning to buy. The cost of each aircraft depends on when in the overall production programme it is bought and will vary according to a number of factors, such as other partner nations' procurement plans. We do not routinely reveal the forecast cost of future programmes in order to protect the Department's position in commercial negotiations.</p>

<i> Caveats:</i><br>
The figures do not equate to the number of individual nationals who were granted permits because they include those applications approved to extend or amend an existing permit or where the individual has moved to another job with a different employer. Not all those who were granted a permit took up the job and some may have been refused entry clearance or further leave to remain.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) whether his Department has conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the introduction of routine screening of pregnant women for group B streptococcus; [21081]</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_39"><a name="10110375000114">(2) what estimate he has made of the cost of introducing a pilot screening programme for pregnant women to test for group B streptococcus and what analysis his Department has conducted to inform this estimate. [21085]</p>

 The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises Ministers and the national health service in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy. The UK NSC reviewed the policy for screening for group b streptococcus (GBS) carriage in pregnancy in 2009 and concluded that the evidence did not support its introduction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="101103w0003.htm_para40"><a name="10110375000116">The UK NSC commissioned a clinical and cost effectiveness study comparing different approaches to GBS. The health technology assessment took this work forward on behalf of the UK NSC and published the results in 2007. The main conclusion was that there was considerable uncertainty on the most effective approach to GBS. The study results were considered during the policy review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="101103w0003.htm_para41"><a name="10110375000117">The Department has therefore not conducted a cost benefit analysis or estimated the cost of introducing a pilot screening programme.</p>

 The Department has worked with strategic health authorities to ensure the national health service has robust arrangements in place across local health and social care areas to deal with the additional pressures winter can bring. Since the autumn the NHS has been working with its partners locally to address the challenges they will face during the course of the forthcoming winter.</p>
