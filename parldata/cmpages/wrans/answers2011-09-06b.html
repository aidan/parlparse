 Bovine TB is a devolved issue and, while we work closely with the Welsh Government, we have no current plans for a joint strategy. However, we recognise that this disease does not respect national borders and will continue to co-operate with the Welsh Government and seek to coordinate activity as far as possible.</p>

 Fully natural grasslands are very rare in England and are limited to high altitude grasslands and, in the lowlands, some very exposed, unstable south-facing slopes in southern England on chalk/limestone where the prevailing environmental conditions prevent shrub and tree invasion.

 It is a condition of payment under the single payment scheme that farmers have to meet a range of environmental standards known as cross compliance. These include a requirement for farmers to adhere to specific regulations in the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) (No 2) Regulations 2006. These regulations are designed to protect uncultivated land and semi-natural areas from being damaged by agricultural work. They also guard against possible negative environmental effects from the restructuring of rural land holdings. The regulations apply to projects that are greater than two hectares, but this threshold can be disapplied where it is thought that a project of less than 2 ha may have a significant impact on the environment (for example, this may be due to the particularly high environmental quality of the land or the cumulative impact of the project.</p>

               <a name="11090713000085"> Cross compliance also requires farmers to avoid over grazing or unsuitable supplementary feeding on natural or semi-natural vegetation.</p>

               <a name="11090713000086"> There is a broader obligation in the EU rules governing cross compliance that member states need to monitor the proportion of agricultural land that is ‘permanent pasture’ and maintain levels of ‘permanent pasture’ above a minimum ratio, set on a historic basis. However the EU definition of ‘permanent pasture’ does not distinguish between natural/semi-natural grassland of high environmental value and enriched and reseeded grassland of low environmental value so provides little protection to the former. The Task Force on Farming Regulation recognised this failing in the current system. The UK will consider this issue as part of the forthcoming negotiations to reform the CAP.</p>

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has put special measures in place to track claims arising from these disturbances, and has received two such claims as of 18 August. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2008 (the Scheme) gives people two years from the date of the incident in which they were injured to apply for compensation, so it is too early to say what the total number of claims might be. CICA cannot currently estimate the cost of those claims already in the system because they will need to receive and assess the relevant evidence for each case.</p>

 Payments began on 30 June, and hundreds of payments have been made to date. The Scheme intends to make around £500 million worth of payments to eligible policyholders by April next year, which is a significant logistical exercise. To ensure that the required systems are fully tested and robust, the Scheme's, implementation plan is to make a low volume of payments initially. Payment volumes will continue to be ramped up over the coming months as the Scheme's complex payment processes are refined further.</p>

 The euro area summit on 21 July agreed to lower the interest rate on euro area loans provided by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to Ireland. The Government welcomed this reduction in EFSF loan interest rates. This allows the UK to reduce the interest rate on our bilateral loan to Ireland, while ensuring all the benefit goes to Ireland and not to higher interest rates paid to euro area governments. The amount by which the interest rate will be reduced is under consideration. The Government will still be more than covering the cost of their borrowing. The loan can be drawn after the approval of the third quarterly review of Ireland's Memorandum of Understanding with the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.</p>

It sets out a new approach to tackling poverty and securing, social justice aimed at transforming lives and tackling the causes of poverty. At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, tackling worklessness and benefit dependency and increasing children's life chances, with tailored support to overcome barriers and a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures.</p>

 The principal VAT directive, which governs the application of VAT in the European Union requires member states to apply a VAT exemption to certain activities in the public interest, including supplies of sporting services by non-profit making organisations.

 The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) is responsible for staging the Olympic Cycling Road Races next year. The majority of the route will not require ticketing and LOCOG is working with partners to ensure that the events are a success for athletes and spectators, including ensuring provision for as many spectators as possible to view the race at Box Hill and throughout the route. Spectator arrangements must balance the ambition to provide viewing opportunities for as many people as possible with the obligation to ensure the safety of both spectators and the general public. LOCOG and Surrey county council are working with Transport for London, who are responsible for arrangements for the safe movement of spectators and the general public across the entire route. Box Hill carries two legally binding conservation designations, as both a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. LOCOG are working in partnership with Natural England and the National Trust to ensure spectators are able to enjoy the race, while safeguarding the areas of specialist habitat. Officials from this Department work closely with these organisations and other local partners.</p>

 The proposed reforms to the framework for airport economic regulation would give the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) a primary duty to promote the interests of existing and future passengers. Under the new regime airports with substantial market power and for whom regulation adds real value would need a licence and CAA would have powers to impose conditions on these airports to promote passengers' interests.</p>

 Goran Hadzic, the last remaining indictee sought by the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was arrested by the Serbian authorities on 20 July 2011 and transferred to the ICTY in The Hague on 22 July 2011. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), in a statement on 20 July, welcomed the arrest as a historic moment for international justice and for the victims of war crimes during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. He expressed his hope that the arrest will mark the closing of a horrific and traumatic chapter for the people of the region. The Foreign Secretary also congratulated the Serbian authorities and called for continued co-operation with the ICTY in supporting existing and future trials. The Government will continue to give firm support to the ICTY and the vital role it plays in upholding international justice.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) has jurisdiction, i.e. legal authority, to make a maintenance calculation and collect child support maintenance only when the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the qualifying child are all habitually resident in the United Kingdom (UK). Habitual residence is a legal concept which means more than simply 'where you live'. A person can habitually reside in more than one country or in none. Habitual residence can continue during an absence from UK.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">Under the current child maintenance scheme, which deals with cases opened since March 2003, if the non-resident parent works for a company based overseas, it is not possible for earnings on which UK tax has not been paid to be taken into account within the maintenance calculation. This is because such earnings do not align with the statutory definition of net weekly earnings upon which the calculation is based. The Commission continues to have jurisdiction over any additional income earned and taxed in Great Britain. Any arrears that were built up while the non-resident parent was earning in Great Britain would continue to be enforceable if the non-resident parent subsequently became entirely dependent on income from overseas.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The Commission has just launched an external consultation with stakeholders on these regulatory changes; one of which will include a new measure that would allow the Commission to take into account the UK taxable earnings of all non-resident parents (including those that work offshore and seafarers) that are habitually resident in the UK, even if they are paid abroad. This will reduce the number of cases where the Commission is required to make a nil-assessment. The Consultation commenced on the 26 July and will end on 26 October 2011.

                     <i>Notes:</i> 1. The social fund does not normally write of debt. However, there are some circumstance where write-off is legitimate, i.e. the claimant: has died (and there is no estate to recover from); has been deported or gone abroad (and there is no probability of returning to the country); cannot be found; has received a custodial sentence (i.e. long- term prisoners) or is bankrupt. 2. The information has been provided for the past three full years for when data is available. 3. The figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred. 4. Figures are for applications received, not for the number of people who made an application, and for initial awards made, not the number of people who received an initial award. (Some people made more than one application or received more than one initial award.) 5. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data; for example, it does not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the social fund computer system. 6. If an applicant receives an initial award and this award is increased on first review in the same month as the initial award was made, then the Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not count the initial award and the review award separately, but counts one award on the one application. However, if a first review award is made in a later month than the initial award, then PBMIS counts two awards on the one application. Similarly, if an initial or first review award is increased by the Independent Review Service, then all awards made in the same month on one application count as one award. However, if an initial award or any review award(s) on one application are made in different months, then PBMIS will count one award for each month in which an initial or review award was made. Because of this counting method, only the numbers of initial awards have been given.

 Procurement and purchasing in the Department for Work and Pensions and its non-departmental public bodies is conducted under a commercial strategy that has an objective to achieve the best outcome for the UK taxpayer in terms of cost, quality and business outcome. Progress against this objective has been measured since 2001 by a key performance indicator that reports the commercial function's contribution to the Department living within its spending review allocations. This indicator is based on tracking all commercial expenditure and measuring procurement value for money gains. The Department uses a procurement value for money measurement methodology initially developed by the then Office of Government Commerce (OGC) in response to the Peter Gershon Review of 1998-99. The methodology was subsequently updated by OGC to reflect new efficiency policy.</p>

               <a name="11090772000586"> The methodology is applied in the Department by procurement category teams and results are subject to annual internal audit. It allows savings to be counted from the value added by procurement negotiations, collaboration, process efficiencies and improved contract or asset management. It also provides a distinction between procurement action that releases cash and other action that adds value but does not release cash, for example cost avoidance by resisting a suppliers bid to raise prices.</p>

 Disability living allowance is intended to focus additional help with the extra cost of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled earlier in life and who as a consequence have less opportunity, to work, earn and save compared to non-disabled people. It is normal for pensions and benefit schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives.</p>

               <a name="11090772000617"> Where someone is in receipt of the higher rate mobility component before their 65<sup>(th)</sup> birthday, it can remain in payment beyond age 65 as long as the conditions of entitlement remain satisfied. A new entitlement to the higher rate mobility component, under whatever provision, cannot be established after the age of 65 as to do so would not be consistent with the principle of this benefit which is to ensure that additional help is focussed to those who become disabled earlier in life.</p>

1. The Department regularly publishes official statistics on the employment and support allowance (ESA) work capability assessment at the national level. The latest report, published in July 2011, covers new claimants to ESA for October 2008 to November 2010 (the latest data available) and can be found here:
http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/workingage/index.php?page=esa_wca
2. The data presented above comes from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare and appeals data from the Tribunals Service.
3. Data on appeals includes ESA claims up to the end of May 2010 (the latest month where we have sufficient volumes of appeals heard to include in the publication) where the person claiming has been assessed to be fit for work, they subsequently appeal the Department's decision and the appeal has been heard by Tribunals Service.

 Incapacity benefit claimants who return to work are not able to return to incapacity benefit.

2. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. 3. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national Insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 4. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are. 5. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. 6. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. 7. Numbers of children and pensioners have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand children. 8. Proportions in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. <i>Source:</i> Households Below Average Income.

1. Case load figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.
2. Figures are adjusted to be consistent with the overall caseload from the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS).
3. Figures do not include people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended for example if they are in hospital.
4. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data is generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5% sample (Some recipients of DLA who transferred from the AA system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time).
5. A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to DLA. Entitlement is dependent on an assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or mobility because of their disability. These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes.

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
2. ‘—’ denotes nil or negligible.
3. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.
4. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
5. ‘Mental health disabilities’ encompass the main disabling conditions ‘learning difficulties’ and ‘mental and behavioural disabilities’. In October 2008 much finer classifications were introduced for new DLA claimants. DWP do not report on these finer classifications as the majority of pre-2008 claims still have the “old codes” on the administrative system. A new code (cognitive disorders—other/type not known) was introduced within the general classification of “psychiatric disorders”. Claimants allocated to this group are included within “mental health disorders”.
6. “Physical disabilities” encompass all categories not included in “mental health disabilities”, including the main disabling conditions arthritis, muscle/joint/bone disease, blindness, stroke related, epilepsy, deafness, malignant disease, chest disease, back ailments, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disorders, aids, skin disease, frailty, multiple sclerosis. The small number of cases with unknown medical code (see note 7) have been included in “physical disorders”).
7. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on DLA disabling condition as information is more complete. However in this case the WPLS data have been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used.
8. Parliamentary constituency is based on the Westminster Parliament of May 2010.

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
2. ‘—’ denotes nil or negligible.
3. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.
4. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
5. ‘Mental health disabilities’ encompass the main disabling conditions ‘learning difficulties’ and ‘mental and behavioural disabilities’. In October 2008 much finer classifications were introduced for new DLA claimants. DWP do not report on these finer classifications as the majority of pre-2008 claims still have the “old codes” on the administrative system. A new code (cognitive disorders—other/ type not known) was introduced within the general classification of “psychiatric disorders”. Claimants allocated to this group are included within “mental health disorders”.
6. “Physical disabilities” encompass all categories not included in “mental health disabilities”, including the main disabling conditions arthritis, muscle/joint/bone disease, blindness, stroke related, epilepsy, deafness, malignant disease, chest disease, back ailments, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disorders, aids, skin disease, frailty, multiple sclerosis. The small number of cases with unknown medical code (see note 7) have been included in “physical disabilities”).
7. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data are generally the preferred source for analysis on DLA disabling condition as information is more complete. However in this case the WPLS data has been used as some of the caseload figures produced are very small and so would have a high level of statistical variation should the sample data have been used.
8. Parliamentary constituency is based on the Westminster Parliament of May 2010.

At the point of change a comparison will be made between current amount received in tax credits and/or benefits and the household entitlement under universal credit. If the universal credit entitlement is less, and no other circumstances have changed, a cash amount will be paid in order to make up the difference. Details of this protection will be available when policy details have been finalised but we would expect future increases in universal credit entitlement to reduce the need for transitional protection.</p>

 Following the termination of the FiReControl project we consulted the fire and rescue community on the future of control services and, at the same time, invited Fire and Rescue Services to discuss with us how they might use the buildings. The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority took on the lease for the building in London in March this year and are planning to move their control room later this year. We are in discussion with a number of Fire and Rescue Authorities who are interested in taking on other buildings; where there is no interest the buildings are being marketed more widely, including to other emergency services. This approach is building improved control room resilience through local solutions, not imposing a solution from central Government.</p>

 The impact of the Government's proposals to allow local retention of business rates will depend on a range of factors, including future business rates growth at the local level, the behavioural response to the changes, and the design of the scheme that is introduced. The Government have sought views on its proposals and, on 19 August, published an interactive calculator that enables councils to make estimates of the main variables for their area, and to see the comparative impact of different approaches to scheme design. This will help to inform their responses to the consultation, as well as future decisions by the Government.</p>

 As Minister for Cities I will champion the economic, social and environmental role of cities including London and support them in seizing the opportunities to create growth and prosperity across the country. London is clearly our largest city in terms of its population and its economy—but it also has different issues and a very different governance settlement from other cities. Therefore I will initially focus on the core cities and their surrounding areas. The core cities represent the eight largest cities outside of London (based on the population of the Primary Urban Area): Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Sheffield.</p>

 The British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Coal in 1969. British Coal was a very large company with records spread over numerous sites. Over the course of time many of those records were lost or destroyed. Those that remain that are under the Department's control, including the remaining BCURA records relating to the period while it was in British Coal ownership, are held by the Departments records management contractor, Iron Mountain, at their facility in Stafford.</p>

               <a name="1109082000116"> As for the period after BCURA left the ownership of British Coal, BCURA are responsible for those records and the question should be directed to BCURA for that period and for any documents transferred to them at that time. However we are also aware that the Coal Research Establishment (CRE) deposited a number of records outside the British Coal archive system. We do not know the nature and extent of those deposits. One potential source of further enquiries is with the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. A review of that Institute's annual report for 2008-09 indicates that at least some CRE/BCURA records/libraries are held by them. The National Archives also hold some documents related to BCURA.</p>

 As set out in chapter 6 of the Electricity Market Reform White Paper, further work will take place over the next year to develop policy on electricity systems, with the aim of publishing an electricity systems policy document in summer 2012. This will consider how electricity supply and demand is balanced in future given the challenges expected from more intermittent and inflexible generation and increasing demand. It will look at what changes might be required to the system framework and the incentives within it to ensure secure and efficient system balancing. This will include the future role we expect different sources of flexibility to play including storage, demand side response, interconnection to other electricity markets and flexible generation plant.</p>

 On 8 December 2010 the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation on energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT). This set out a regime for the regulation of electricity and gas wholesale markets, including mechanisms for national energy regulators to detect and deter market abuse, in co-operation with the Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and, where appropriate, national financial regulators. Following negotiations in Council working groups, an agreed text will be voted on by the European Parliament on 12 September. The regulation will also need to obtain political agreement by the Council of Ministers before coming into force.</p>

 The term “supergrid” is used in a variety of different contexts ranging from a more integrated offshore grid in the seas around the UK, to a network of large interconnectors linking low carbon generation with centres of demand across the EU. The Government are engaged in a number of processes, including the North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative and the All Islands Approach agreed at the British Irish Council summit in June, that are considering the costs, benefits and technical challenges of a more integrated offshore grid in the North and Irish seas and how it could be developed. Later this year, the Commission are expected to publish proposals for facilitating investment in energy infrastructure across the EU, including major electricity links. Any developments are likely to take place in an incremental manner over a period of years.</p>

While we have not formally announced the outcome of the consultation, our preliminary view, as set out in our paper, was that our plutonium should be reused as mixed oxide (MOX) fuel in reactors. Should we proceed with our preliminary view about reusing plutonium, implementation of this policy would require a new MOX plant.</p>

 Microgenerators are free to sell their electricity on the open market and can chose to opt out of the export tariff which, since April 2010, has been available to eligible generators as part of the support provided under the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme. The export tariff is a guaranteed payment for the amount of electricity exported to the grid and is additional to a payment for the amount of electricity generated and the bill savings associated with using electricity generated on site. Both the export tariff and the generation tariff are linked to the retail prices index and update annually.</p>

 Offshore wind farms are supported at the technology level, based on the amount of electricity they generate. Currently, wind farms accredited by 31 March 2014 are supported under the renewables obligation (RO) at two renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) per MWh. We are currently carrying out a banding review to determine RO support levels beyond then. Through electricity market reform, we are putting in place future support for low carbon electricity generation, as set out in our White Paper<sup>(1)</sup>. The UK's Renewable Energy Roadmap<sup>(2)</sup>
               <sup>( )</sup>sets out a comprehensive action plan to accelerate the UK's deployment and use of renewable energy.

 There are currently no plans to recover the policing costs from the perpetrators of the disorder. However, courts can impose a compensation order for any offence that has resulted in personal injury, loss or damage. This will apply where individual victims have been injured, as well as where individuals or businesses have experienced offences such as theft, burglary or criminal damage. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill will strengthen the law on compensation orders by giving the courts a clear, positive duty to consider imposing such an order in any case where there is an identifiable victim.</p>

The continuity of service to the Criminal Justice System remains our primary objective during the wind down of the FSS.</p>

 Defence Equipment and Support currently employs around 100 civilian staff in Glasgow and around 5,500 civilian staff at its headquarters in Bristol. The significant difference in numbers means that direct comparisons cannot readily be made. In the year to July 2011, about 2.5% of Bristol staff and about 1% of Glasgow staff left through retirement or resignation compared with around 4.5% for Defence Equipment and Support as a whole.</p>

Their statistics show that 2.1%, representing 36 individuals, of those seen rough sleeping in London between 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 had previously served in HM armed forces.

               <b>Mr Robathan:</b>
 The data are not held in the format requested. Complaints about military low flying are recorded by the low flying area in which they occur. Data on the amount of low flying conducted, and the number of complaints received, is published annually to Parliament in “The Pattern of Military Low Flying across the UK”. Since 2009-10 the publication has been retitled as “Military Low Flying in the United Kingdom statistical appendix.”</p>

               <a name="1109082001339"> Prior to 2006-07, the published figure for complaints was an overall total; however, the complaints database has been analysed to provide figures for each Low Flying Area (LFA) and Tactical Training Area (TTA) since 2004-05. These figures are given in the following tables.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup>Alcohol-related admissions
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at:
http://www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf
The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). Information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data.
<sup>(2)</sup> PCT/SHA data quality
In July 2006, the NHS reorganised SHAs and PCTs in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years. Data have been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided.
<sup>(3)</sup> SHA/PCT/local authority of residence
The SHA, PCT or local authority (UK) containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another area for treatment.
<sup>(4)</sup> Assessing growth through time
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
<i>Note</i>:
Data quality: HESs are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

Further information on these proportions can be found at:

The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data. These data should not be described as a count of people as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion.
2. SHA/PCT/LA of residence: The SHA or LA of residence is that containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where patients were treated as they may have travelled to another area for treatment. The number of admission episodes provided for the Yorkshire and the Humber SHA has been obtained by summing the admission episodes for all PCTs within Yorkshire and the Humber SHA. These are: Barnsley PCT; Bradford and Airedale Teaching PCT; Calderdale PCT; Doncaster PCT; East Riding of Yorkshire PCT; Hull Teaching PCT; Kirklees PCT; Leeds PCT; North East Lincolnshire Care Trust Plus; North Lincolnshire PCT; North Yorkshire and York PCT; Rotherham PCT; Sheffield PCT; Wakefield District PCT.
3. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.
4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies.

<i>Notes:</i>
1. As it not always possible to anticipate the demand for the services provided by the above call centres, final spend is often lower than the budget allowed.
2. The budget allowed may include some non-phone line costs such as staff training, data management and fulfilment.
3. The budget allowed will also include some non-voice help offered by the call centre such as text phone use, web chat and e-mail handling.
4. The chart is based on call centres rather than individual phone lines. Most call centres run multiple phone numbers to allow for campaign measurement

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract on 1 April 2004. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most Personal Medical Services (PMS) practices also taking part.
2. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.
3. QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.
4. Coverage of QOF: Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF. Not all practices participate in QOF and some participate in only some parts (especially PMS practices who are paid under different arrangements for providing services which are part of QOF for GMS practices). Most indicators in QOF have rules that allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease. Note also that some indicators have age limits and so exclude some patients on the register.

Currently, registered medical practitioners are required to immediately report cases of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia to the HPA.

Services that will be commissioned by the NHS Commissioning Board will be referred to as prescribed services and will be those that are included within specialised services that are currently commissioned both nationally and regionally.</p>

 National health service organisations and local authorities are responsible for nutrition screening policies. There are a number of initiatives in place to help organisations develop their policies. These include the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on malnutrition which recommends that all hospital in-patients be weighed, measured and have their Body Mass Index calculated on admission to hospital. Additionally, the “Essence of Care” benchmarking system includes a benchmark on “food and drink” which illustrates the good practice of screening and assessment of patients on initial contact with a health professional in health and social care settings. This is reinforced within the Council of Europe resolution on food and nutritional care in hospital recommending the screening of all patients on admission to hospital.</p>

 The National Radiotherapy Advisory Group report ‘Radiotherapy: developing a world class service for England’, published in 2007, recommended that, where possible, patients should not travel more than 45 minutes for radiotherapy treatment. It was for local trusts to take account of this recommendation.

 When establishing the Specialised Services Patient and Public Engagement Steering Group, the Department was mindful of the need to ensure broad representation from a range of different stakeholder interests without making the steering group so unwieldy that it would have problems discharging its functions.

The availability of illicit tobacco undermines activity to try to reduce the affordability of tobacco, including through tax increases. Reducing the share of the illicit tobacco market also helps to reduce tobacco consumption, reduce organised crime in local communities, reduce potential revenue loss to the Treasury and support legitimate retailers. Latest estimates indicate action led by HM Revenue and Customs over the past decade has reduced the illicit share of the cigarette market down to 11% in 2009 (from 20% in 2000) and the illicit share of the hand-rolling tobacco market down to 49% in 2009 (from 60% in 2000).</p>

 Ofqual have acted quickly and decisively to address the serious and unacceptable errors in this summer's exam papers. However, in the light of the concerns raised by these errors, the Government are currently considering whether any additional powers of enforcement would further equip Ofqual to: tackle poor practice to prevent the kind of errors that happened this year; incentivise improvements in the standard of awarding body performance; and provide proportionate and effective sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory requirements whenever it occurs. Further information on the outcome will be available in the autumn.</p>

 Currently, the Department for Education does not collect information about the impact of special schools on the ability of a young person to gain employment. However, in the recent Green Paper, “Support and aspiration: a new approach to special educational needs and disability”, we announced our intention to introduce Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 destination measures. These school and college level measures will demonstrate how many of schools’ and colleges’ former pupils progress into further education, employment or training. It is our intention to include special school pupils within these measures at the earliest opportunity, following testing of the data collection processes.</p>

 In March 2011 the Government published their SEN and Disability Green Paper, “Support and aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability”. The Green Paper made wide ranging proposals to improve the efficiency of special educational needs provision across the country, including in Pendle. Consultation on the Green paper closed on 30 June with over 2,300 responses received.</p>

               <a name="11090819000131"> Proposals in the Green Paper include: a new single early years setting and school- based category of SEN; replacing the statutory SEN assessment and statement for children with complex needs and the Learning Difficulty Assessment for those aged 16-25 with a new, stronger single assessment and plan, called the Education, Health and Care plan; reducing the time limit for the statutory assessment process from 26 weeks to 20 weeks; a local offer, set out by local authorities and other services, of all services available to support children and young people who are disabled, or who have SEN and their families and the option of a personal budget by 2014 for all families with an Education, Health and Care plan.</p>

               <a name="11090819000132"> The Green Paper also promotes a reduction in the bureaucratic burdens on professionals so that they can concentrate on helping children and young people fulfil their potential. It commits the Government to simplifying and improving statutory guidance for professionals working with children with SEN and disabilities so that it is clear accessible and helpful and to withdrawing guidance that does not provide useful support. In particular, we will shorten the SEN Code of Practice and incorporate within it other guidance that is considered helpful to professionals.</p>

 Schools and agencies will continue to be responsible for appointing the most suitable supply teachers. The Department's Quality Mark scheme will continue to ensure the quality of supply teachers provided to schools by agencies. The Quality Mark recognises private sector agencies and local authorities which have demonstrated good practice in recruiting and managing supply teachers for schools. The award gives increased confidence to schools, parents and pupils that staff supplied through agencies have been recruited properly.</p>

               <a name="11090819000136"> The Agency Workers Regulations will entitle agency supply teachers to be paid the same rates they would receive if they had been recruited by either the school or the local authority. This will only apply after the teacher has completed a qualifying period of 12 weeks in the same role with either the same school or local authority. After the qualifying period, teachers in maintained schools will be paid at their appropriate point on the main or upper pay scale in the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD). Teachers in academy schools which are outside the STPCD will be entitled to the same salaries as other teachers in the academy.</p>

 A study commissioned by the European Commission shows that the use of Single European Payment Area (SEPA) payment instruments holds a potential of up to €123 billion in benefits (cumulative over six years) for the European Union. When fully implemented, all parties (consumers, SMEs, other corporate) are shown to benefit while banks would retain their current margins. According to the same study, the full implementation would lead to gains annually for the UK of 0.15% of GDP. That would be between 0.08% and 0.17% of GDP for other countries of the European Union.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 18 July 2011]:</i>BIS has estimated that in 2006 3.5 million jobs were linked directly and indirectly to the UK's trade with the EU, representing around 12% of UK's work force. This is based on the assumption that the share of UK employment linked to trade with the EU is equal to the share of total UK value added generated in the production of goods exported to the EU.</p>

 The Government believe that there continues to be scope to improve the single market in services. One important element of this should be to fully and effectively implement the services directive, which would boost EU GDP by 2.8%. The European Commission will produce a report by the end of this year on how well EU member states have implemented the directive to date and is also carrying out legal assessments (so-called "performance checks") to ensure that the services directive is working in practice. The UK will work closely with the European Commission to take forward this work.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 18 July 2011]:</i> There is no estimate available for the effect of trade with EU member states on UK national income as the consequences of the counterfactual, the absence of trade with these countries, are particularly difficult to establish. However, there is no doubt that the single market is important to the UK's prosperity: it gives UK business access to the world's largest market with 500 million people generating about £10 trillion economic activity. EU countries account for half of the UK's overall trade and foreign investments. As a result, around 3.5 million jobs in the UK are linked to the export of goods and services to the EU. Available estimates show that the greater level of trade liberalisation achieved through the single market leads EU countries to trading currently twice as much with each other as they would do otherwise. As a result, the single market may be responsible for income gains in the UK between 2% and 6%, that is between £1,100 and £3,300 a year per British household.</p>
