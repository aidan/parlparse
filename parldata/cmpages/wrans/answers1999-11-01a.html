To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer of 26 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>27</i>, concerning his meeting with KLA officials on 18 May, who were the officials referred to in his answer.  [95419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 At the meeting, which was held in Tirana, Albania, I was accompanied by my Foreign Affairs Private Secretary, a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official and an interpreter.

<P>
<a name="91101w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister how many bodies of victims of war crimes, by nationality, have been uncovered in Kosovo.  [95545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which is responsible for investigating alleged war crimes in Kosovo, is collating the results of forensic work undertaken over the last four months. UK forensic teams have made a major contribution to this work. Within the next few weeks, ICTY should be able to confirm the number of bodies of victims which have been uncovered. Our estimate is that at least 10,000 civilians were killed between June 1998 and June 1999. Most of the victims have been Kosovar Albanians although the bodies of some Serbs have also been recovered.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer of 26 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>26</i>, what criteria are used to assess the effectiveness of the work of the Ambassadors for British Business initiative. [95785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w01.htm_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Ambassadors for British Business Initiative is a voluntary scheme in which participating business leaders make time when overseas on company business to promote the UK's wider commercial interests.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will list those areas <i>(a)</i> the EU Presidency, <i>(b)</i> the Commission and <i>(c)</i> the Government have expressed a willingness to discuss at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.  [95543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w01.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Neither the Presidency nor the Commission has yet formally stated its position on the IGC. The Presidency is currently preparing a report that it will present to the Helsinki European Council in December. The Dehaene Report, published on 18 October, was commissioned to feed ideas into the Commission before the next IGC. The Commission will now consider the report and submit its formal opinion in due course.
<P>

<a name="91101w01.htm_para0">The Government, along with the other member states outlined their position at the European Council in Cologne. This called for an IGC dealing primarily with the institutional issues not resolved at Amsterdam (Commission size, vote reweighting, possible extension of QMV). The Government will issue a White Paper before the IGC begins next year.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the Answer I gave to the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) on 28 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>20</i>, following the decisions of the Cologne European Council.
<P>

<a name="91101w01.htm_para1">The then Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), wrote to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) and the Chairman of the European Communities Committee in the Other Place (Lord Tordoff) on 7 October enclosing the Presidency's proposals for the practical arrangements governing the Charter drafting body. These were finalised and agreed by Heads of Government at Tampere, and are annexed to the Tampere conclusions, copies of which were deposited in the Libraries on 19 October.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 1999]:</i> The extra investment that the Government have made, particularly in our key priority areas of health and education, is conditional on achieving higher standards, improved productivity and the modernisation of all our public services.

<a name="91101w01.htm_para2">Central government itself does not have specific targets beyond those which are the responsibility of the Cabinet Office. The full list of the Government's manifesto commitments, together with a summary of progress to date on each of them, is contained in the Government's Annual Report (Cm 4401).

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 1999]:</i> I discussed Tibet with President Jiang Zemin at Downing Street on 21 October both during our bilateral talks, and at the lunch which followed. It is the Government's firm view that Tibetans should have a greater say in running their own affairs in Tibet. The best way to achieve this is through dialogue between the Chinese and the Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama. We take every opportunity to encourage both sides to enter into such dialogue.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w04.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government inherited a shortfall on Army manning and are committed to achieving full manning by around 2005. We recognise fully that improved recruiting and retention will be key to realising this goal.
<P>

<a name="91101w04.htm_para2">In 1998-99, the Army recruited some 610 officers and 15,609 soldiers, which represents 98 per cent. of the overall recruiting target for the year. It was the best recruiting year for the Army since the beginning of the decade and there are encouraging signs that the momentum is being maintained this year. A broad range of national and regional recruiting initiatives are in hand to encourage young people to view the Army as a career of first choice.
<P>

<a name="91101w04.htm_para3">The rate at which we lose our people has been too high for too many years, and it is one of this Government's highest priorities to rectify the situation. There has been some improvement in retention in the Army in the last two years, but achieving further improvements remains a challenge. The Army has in hand a series of initiatives as part of its Human Resources Strategy. This includes a six month strategic review being undertaken by external consultants to examine the effectiveness of present Army retention policies, which includes field research and making recommendations for improvements, the results of which will inform the Army's personnel management policies. Other measures to improve retention, which have been welcomed by Army personnel, include an improved operational welfare package, life long learning, and the efforts of the Service Families Task Force.

 The Army Retention Study, which is being undertaken under contract by the Hay Management Group, will draw on and initiate structured quantitative and qualitative market research into retention in the Army. In addition to analysis of existing research and retention initiatives, a programme of field research will be conducted to establish a cross section of views from all ranks, and their families, to determine why people leave the Service and to identify trends. Further consultation will take place with Unit Retention Officers, Policy Staffs, and individuals who have recently joined and left the Army, among others. The Study will consider the extent to which current retention policies and initiatives are effective, and identify areas where they can be improved.

Developers' contribution to archaeological costs is estimated at &#163;30 million per annum. Although the Local Government Finance Settlement is the best one for seven years, the provision of conservation services in local authorities is kept under review, and, where necessary, EH will continue to fund a number of archaeological posts (costing &#163;150,000 in 1999-2000).

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 1999]:</i> With the collaboration of the DTI's Radiocommunications Agency, my officials are considering the current use of analogue radio frequencies and the scope for new services. Representatives of the commercial radio broadcasters, the Radio Authority, the BBC and the Community Media Association have been invited to participate. One of the key requirements of the licensing process is for applicants to demonstrate consumer need within the licence area and consumer interests will be an important part of our policy consideration. We shall ensure that consumer needs are properly addressed in this review.

 The Department has set out the key performance targets on which it will be judged in its PSA, and the measures of success it will use in the Output and Performance Analyses (OPA) published in March this year. Performance targets, where appropriate, have also been set for the Department's NDPBs and its agency through the production of annual funding agreements. These agreements have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Information on targets and their delivery can also be found in the annual reports and accounts of the agency and non-departmental public bodies. The high level targets which appear in funding agreements, the PSA and the OPA are supported at operational level by numerous targets to ensure delivery by individual units. Listing these operational targets would be inappropriate and disproportionate in terms of resources.

<P>
<a name="91101w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Responsibility for the content of radio services rests with the BBC and the independent broadcasters. The BBC operates within the terms of its Charter and Agreement and undertakes to provide services which are of high general standards in all respects. Independent radio services are licensed and regulated by the Radio Authority under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. The Authority is under a general duty to facilitate the provision of licensed services which (taken as a whole) are of high quality and offer a wide range of programmes calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests.
<P>

<a name="91101w06.htm_para0">The Broadcasting Standards Commission is responsible under the Broadcasting Act 1996 for producing codes of practice relating to standards and fairness in programmes, considering and adjudicating on complaints and monitoring, researching and reporting on standards and fairness in broadcasting. The BBC and Radio Authority are required, when drawing up or revising their own codes relating to principles and practice, to reflect the general effect of the Broadcasting Standards Commission's codes.

 We hope that the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which came into effect on 1 September, will bring an end to a war that has caused untold suffering and damage to the region. We continue to urge all parties to implement the agreement in full, but the onus of implementation lies with the parties themselves.
<P>

<a name="91101w06.htm_para13">We and our EU partners have made clear our readiness to help with rebuilding the country, providing there is tangible progress towards respect for human rights, democracy, economic reform and the rule of law. Britain was the first bilateral donor to pledge support to a World Bank managed Trust Fund intended to focus on immediate reconstruction and rehabilitation following the fall of President Mobutu. The conflict has diverted attention away from the key task of establishing the essential economic and governance reforms necessary for utilisation of the Trust Fund. It is vital that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo use the opportunity of the Lusaka Agreement to focus on these issues.
<P>

<a name="91101w06.htm_para14">In the meantime, the UK is responding to demonstrable humanitarian needs where access and security allow.

<a name="91101w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Alcohol advertising is subject to general legislation and other rules relating, for example, to accuracy, truthfulness and decency. In addition, there are specific rules relating to alcohol in the Codes of Practice of the principal bodies controlling advertising in the UK: the Independent Television Commission; the Radio Authority; and the Advertising Standards Authority. These rules are designed to ensure that alcohol advertising is socially responsible. Advertisements should not appeal to young people, should not show alcohol in association with dangerous activities such as driving, sports or operating machinery, and should not give the impression that alcohol improves performance.
<P>

<a name="91101w07.htm_para1">In addition, television advertising is also subject to a European Union Directive. Article 15 of the Television Without Frontiers Directive requires that television advertising for alcoholic drinks must not be aimed specifically at minors or depict minors consuming them. The regulators have reflected this in their Codes of Practice by specifically prohibiting advertisers from directing promotions for drinks containing alcohol at people under eighteen years of age.
<P>

<a name="91101w07.htm_para2">I understand that compliance with the Codes in this area is very high. Relatively few complaints are received about alcohol advertising and we have no reason to believe the system is not working well across the media. My colleagues in the Department of Health are examining the role of advertising in the context of the development of the new alcohol misuse strategy for England.

[96700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Draft regulations to amend the Working Time Regulations, in respect of the requirement to keep records for workers who have opted out of the working time limit and extending the scope of the unmeasured working time exemption, were laid before Parliament on 19 October. They will be debated in both Houses before being made.
<P>

<a name="91101w07.htm_para4">The extension of the 'unmeasured working time' derogation provides greater flexibility for workers who can determine their own hours of work, but have an element of their working time predetermined. The second amendment replaces the requirement to keep records for those who opt-out of the working time limit, with a single requirement to keep a list of those who have signed an opt-out.

<a name="91101w08.htm_para0">In a letter to RDA Chairs in June, RDAs were asked to consult local partners and make recommendations on the boundaries for local delivery of SBS services. The letter also set out the criteria for determining these boundaries. The underlying principle for determining SBS boundaries was the desire to have no more than 40-50. This would maximise administrative savings and provide a more effective local network for planning, funding, managing and driving up quality, while still ensuring that businesses would have good access locally to business support services.
<P>

<a name="91101w08.htm_para1">Specifically, RDAs were asked to ensure that boundaries:

 We intend to bring section 16 and Schedule 5 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 into force by Easter next year. These provisions will extend the right of protection for those dismissed for taking lawfully organised industrial action to complain to a tribunal of unfair dismissal. They will make it automatically unfair to dismiss workers for the first eight weeks of the action and give employees a right to claim unfair dismissal, if dismissed after the eight week period, where the employer has failed to follow all reasonable procedural steps to try to resolve the dispute. These provisions are designed to stop precipitate dismissals and to place an onus on both employers and unions to settle disputes by negotiation.

 At the invitation of the Ukrainian Government, an official election monitoring mission is being carried out by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We have funded the Head and Deputy Head of the OSCE/ODIHR Mission. In addition, we have funded the participation of two long-term and 20 short-term monitors for the first round of voting on 31 October. The United Kingdom will fund the continued participation of 11 monitors in the event of a second round of voting. Around 10 members of the British Embassy in Kiev, as well as visiting staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, are also accredited as official election monitors and will coordinate their activities with the OSCE/ODIHR Mission. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones) will participate in monitoring as a member of the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action he is taking to ensure that companies involved in the production of genetically modified foods do not disadvantage farmers in the world's poorest countries; and if he will make a statement.  [96604]<P>

<P>
<a name="91101w10.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We wish to see the benefits available from genetic modification spread equitably, in ways that support sustainable development, help to eliminate poverty, and do not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment. We are working to develop appropriate international frameworks: in particular to agree a Biosafety Protocol regulating movements of living modified organisms; and to promote an internationally agreed Code of Responsible Behaviour in the development, testing and release of GMOs. The Department for International Development has published a briefing document setting out how it reflects these aims in the support it provides for sustainable agriculture in developing countries.

In the particular cases of the assaults on Robert Hamill and Gregory Girvan, the ICPC is currently supervising the police investigation of disciplinary matters arising from a complaint relating to the conduct of police in Portadown on 27 April 1997. When the disciplinary investigation report is submitted the Commission will issue a statement as to whether or not the investigation was conducted to its satisfaction. Following this, the Chief Constable will inform the Commission of his opinion in relation to the preferring of charges. At that juncture, the Commission will review all the evidential documentation and decide whether or not the bringing of disciplinary charges is warranted.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> As I said in an earlier reply, the terms of reference of the Review of Criminal Justice and the Patten Report cover areas highlighted by the report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The Criminal Justice Review team is due to report shortly and the Government are currently consulting on the recommendations of the independent Commission on Policing as required by the Good Friday Agreement. The Government will be making a statement 



<P>

on the outcome of consultation on the Patten report, "A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland", after that consultation is complete.
<P>

<a name="91101w11.htm_para1">The Government remain committed to the principles of equality of treatment, respect for human rights and different cultures as fundamental elements of policing in Northern Ireland. Since April the Government have announced a number of significant measures. For example, the new Equality Commission for Northern Ireland was established on 1 October and the appointment of Mrs. O'Loan as Police Ombudsman Designate was announced on 11 October.
<P>

<a name="91101w11.htm_para2">The report of the working group considering the treatment of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses in the criminal justice system was published in July. The group endorsed the recommendations made by a similar working group in England and Wales. In particular they recommended, and I agreed, that the provisions in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, which relate to such witnesses, should be extended to Northern Ireland by means of Order in Council. This has now been done. The group is continuing to meet to oversee implementation of its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="91101w11.htm_para3">Following the Report the Deputy Chief Constable of the RUC has taken responsibility for co-ordinating activities and action plans are being introduced. A Positive Action Team has been set up to progress ethnic minority recruitment. All probationers complete a Police Community Relations module dealing with equality and race relations legislation, human rights and harassment. Officers receive local training on how to respond effectively and sensitively to racial incidents. Family Liaison Officers have been established force-wide.

 Precise estimates of net costs using the pensions model are not available.

A delay in changes until 2005 leads to estimated income-related benefit savings of the order of 0-5 per cent. of gross costs between 2000 and 2010, and between 5-15 per cent. of gross costs between 2010 and 2020.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the application of the minimum wage in respect of work used as therapy for people with severe disability.  [96248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w13.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Entitlement to incapacity benefits is based on the fundamental principle that they are for people who are incapable of work because of sickness or disability. It is recognised that in some cases a limited amount of work can benefit a person's medical condition and may increase their prospects of a return to the labour market. A longstanding provision, known as the therapeutic work rule, allows benefit recipients to do some paid work on the advice of a doctor without it affecting their underlying entitlement. The work is subject to a weekly earnings limit. An hours limit of 16 hours a week also applies unless the work is done under medical supervision, as part of a hospital treatment programme, or in a sheltered workshop.
<P>

<a name="91101w13.htm_para1">The application of the national minimum wage to this work is not a relevant consideration for benefit purposes. However, last April the earnings limit was increased from &#163;48 to &#163;58 to ensure that the hours limit was consistent with 16 hours work paid at the national minimum wage rate of &#163;3.60 an hour (16 x &#163;3.60 = &#163;57.60).

<P>
<a name="91101w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 October 1999]:</i> The inflation assumptions underlying the Department's expenditure forecasts were set out on Page 89 of the Social Security Departmental Report (Cm 4214). The Report also makes clear that the forecast depended on a number of other assumptions. These include economic assumptions such as the rate of unemployment and the growth in earnings which underpins forecast spending on the Minimum Income Guarantee. It also takes account of Government policies already announced, such as above inflation rises in Child Benefit. The effect of a 1 per cent. variation for all benefits is around 830 million. This assumes that both the RPI and the Rossi index vary by the same amount.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assistance he will give to organic farmers who have already made the conversion from conventional to organic farming; what assessment he has made of the take-up of financial aid among organic farmers; what he is doing to ensure organic farmers know what aid is available to them; what assessment he has made of the length of time it takes for financial aid to be given to organic farmers after application under the Organic Aid Scheme; and if he will make a statement. [96267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w13.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Prior to the introduction of the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS), the Government considered carefully the question of whether those already farming organically should receive aid. We decided to target available resources on the conversion period when yields drop and premia for organic produce are not available. I have no plans to extend aid beyond the five year period provided by the OFS.
<P>

<a name="91101w13.htm_para2">I expect the review of the OFS to consider the take-up of organic aid by farmers since April 1999 and to make recommendations for the future design of the conversion aid schemes.




<P>
<P><I>1 Nov 1999 : Column: 46</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91101w13.htm_para3">Advice to prospective organic farmers on how to obtain free advisory visits is provided by a dedicated Helpline telephone number and advice on conversion aid payments is available from MAFF Regional Service Centres. The scheme literature sent to each prospective applicant points out that organic farmers can still benefit from a range of aid measures which are available to farmers generally.
<P>

<a name="91101w13.htm_para4">The timing of payments to farmers under the Organic Aid Scheme formed part of the 1998 review of support for the organic sector. The review recommended moving from payments made in arrears to payments made annually in advance, at the end of the first quarter. We implemented the recommendation and have retained the same pattern of payments in the OFS.
<P>

<a name="91101w13.htm_para5">We want to see organic farming succeed. We inherited a situation in which total payment for organic conversion averaged about &#163;1 million annually. Over the last six months we have allocated about &#163;16 million to more than 750 farmers. In the debate on agriculture on 28 October 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1131, my right hon. Friend the Minister announced that further money would be made available. This will allow another 250 or so farmers to benefit from the OFS. And it will allow us to pay aid to all the farmers already in the OFS much sooner than would otherwise have been possible.

 The Government are committed to ensuring their policies are fair and inclusive, and focus on public service users, not providers. This aim is contained in guidance (published in 1998) which helps Departments consider the impact of their policies on gender, ethnicity and disability. In addition to considering impact the guidance encourages consultation with women's groups and others where appropriate and action to deal with any differential impact if this appears appropriate. The Treasury applies the principles contained in the guidance when developing its policies. For example a full gender analysis of the Budget's impact was undertaken last year and will be again this year.

 The way in which NHS Direct deals with calls about continence will depend very much on the nature of the caller's symptoms and needs. Calls from members of the public generally fall into two broad categories. If the continence problem is a new symptom for the caller, the nurse adviser would assess the call using the relevant protocol and would refer the caller to the most appropriate health professional, for example the general practitioner. Otherwise, if the call was a general inquiry about continence, the caller would be referred to the most relevant source for further information.

 The identification and accreditation of suitable training courses for any complementary therapy is primarily the responsibility of the professional body or bodies which regulate it. An increasing number of higher education courses in complementary and alternative medicine are being offered in publicly-funded institutions and are meeting the requirements set by the Education Student Support Regulations 1999 for automatic designation for student support. While the Department for Education and Employment does not routinely collect details of such courses, any which are either wholly run by a private institution or are jointly provided by a privately and publicly funded institution must apply to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment for special designation.
<P>

<a name="91101w15.htm_para0">Any student on a designated course receives the same package of financial student support as any student in higher education. Tuition fees are means-tested and, depending on individual circumstances, a student may pay all, part, or none of the cost himself. Student loans are available. And supplementary grants may be made in particular circumstances, for example to disabled students or those with dependants. Students on non-designated courses do not qualify for student support.

 The spending on official publications by the Cabinet Office and its Executive Agencies between 1 May 1997 and 31 July 1999, which includes identifiable costs incurred by the Department in publishing, production and purchase of copies for official use, is listed in a table, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. This excludes publications produced solely for internal purposes. Where the Department makes use of a private sector publisher, the publishing, printing and design costs are normally met by the publisher, as part of their acceptance of the risks of publication.

<a name="91101w15.htm_para1">The targets for each of my Department's agencies are shown in the table.

<a name="91101w15.htm_para2">Details of performance targets for COI can be found in COI's annual reports. The last report was published in July 1999 by the Stationery Office (ISBN: 0-10-273199-3).

 Estimates of the likely effect on the prison population vary between a few hundred and a few thousand depending upon the exact nature of the new arrangements introduced, whether the sentences they replaced were custodial or non-custodial, the length of any such custodial sentences and the rate of activation of the new suspended sentences. The current restriction, which limits suspension of a custodial sentence to cases where exceptional circumstances exist, was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Criminal Statistics for England and Wales 1997 show that the number of offenders sentenced for indictable offences to a fully suspended sentence fell from 25,800 in 1987 to 2,700 in 1993.

 Promoting inclusion within mainstream schools, where parents want it and appropriate support can be provided, is a cornerstone of the Government's special educational needs strategy. The education of children with special needs is a key challenge for the nation, and critical to the creation of a fully inclusive society. There are strong educational, as well as social and moral, grounds for educating pupils with special needs or disabilities with their peers.
<P>

<a name="91101w19.htm_para1">Where parents want a mainstream setting for their child our policy is to try to provide it. We are providing, this year, &#163;8 million through the Standards Fund and &#163;20 million through the Schools Access Initiative to promote inclusion. Equally, when parents want a specialist setting for their child it is important that their wishes are respected. Our approach has been practical, not dogmatic. We are advocating inclusion by choice and have underlined that there remains a continuing and vital role for special schools. The key objective must be to safeguard the interests of all children and to ensure that they achieve to their full potential.

 Our Programme of Action on Special Educational Needs, published in November 1998, is an integral part of our strategy for improving all schools. Measures in it will develop the existing statutory framework and procedures, building on experience and best practice. They aim to shift the emphasis from procedures to practical support. It is a measure of the priority we are giving to children with SEN that we have virtually doubled--to &#163;35 million--the targeted support for SEN under the Standards Fund in 1999-2000. We have also increased five-fold the capital support under the Schools Access Initiative, from the &#163;4 million we inherited in 1997-98, to &#163;20 million in 1999-2000. We are planning further big increases to the SEN Standards Fund and the Schools Access Initiative for the following two years.

<P>
<UL>(2) what information his Department issues concerning anaphylaxis and contact between young children and nut products;  [96440]
<P>
(3) what recent representations he has received from groups concerned about anaphylaxis and the difficulties faced by sufferers in everyday life;  [96438]
<P>
(4) what representations he has received from leisure providers concerning the use of their facilities, and participation in activities, by sufferers from anaphylaxis. [96654]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w20.htm_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department has not received any recent representations from anaphylaxis groups or from leisure providers. We have issued guidance for schools on "Supporting Pupils with Medical Needs" which contains advice on anaphylaxis. Advice is also available on the joint DfEE and Department of Health Wired for Health website. We will be consulting shortly on draft regulations on new nutritional standards for school lunches. The new standards will allow caterers flexibility to respond to the requirements of children who have allergies to particular foods. I will send a copy of the draft regulations to the hon. Member when they are published. The question about early sensitisation is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health.

<a name="91101w20.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list all performance targets set for his Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies since May 1997, other than those listed in Public Service Agreements 1999-2002 [Cm 4181], stating in each case <i>(a)</i> the target to be reached and <i>(b)</i> the date by which it was to be reached. [94987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 My Department has set out the key performance targets on which it will be judged in its PSA, and the measures of success it will use in the Output and Performance Analysis (OPA) published in March this year. A full list of the targets and target dates for Agencies and Executive NDPBs can be found annually in the Next Steps Report and Executive and Non-Departmental Public Bodies Report on the Stationery Office website. In addition, my Department has published a Strategic Framework to 2002: Learning and Working Together for the Future, setting out our aim, objectives, targets and supporting policies for that period; and has published the Government's National Learning Targets to 2002 in the leaflet "National Learning Targets for England for 2002--now including the new Learning Participation Target" and in its publication "National Learning Targets--action plan".
<P>

<a name="91101w20.htm_para3">These high-level targets are supported at operational level by numerous targets to ensure delivery by individual units. Listing these operational targets would be inappropriate and disproportionate in terms of resources. However, the DfEE annual Departmental Report and Annual Report of the Employment Service also include performance related information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on progress in the development of national programmes to deliver information and advice on education and training for adults.  [96409]<P>

<P>
<a name="91101w20.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 As set out in the White Paper, "Learning to Succeed" (Cm 4392), we want adults to have the help they need to make informed choices about learning and work. That help will be available through Learning Direct, the national learning helpline; through Lifelong Learning Partnerships, who are developing a free information and advice service for adults at local level; and, for unemployed people, through the comprehensive advice and support service associated with the Employment Service's New Deal programmes for young people, the unemployed and people with disabilities.

<a name="91101w20.htm_para4">Since it was launched last year, Learning Direct has helped more than 860,000 callers. Following consultation earlier in the year, my Department is now agreeing plans with Lifelong Learning Partnerships for the development of information and advice services that are tailored to local needs. To date, more than 348,000 young people aged 18-24 and 144,000 adults aged 25 and over have received specialised advice and support through the New Deal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91101w20.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 It is for universities to decide on their admissions policies. Early indications are that they are considering using AS qualifications rather than GCSEs as predictors of likely A level performance. Universities such as Cambridge have also indicated that they are considering using the new Advanced Extension Award as an alternative to its STEP exam. Universities will normally make final offers on the basis of final A level and GNVQ scores, but may also include AS qualification and AE achievement as evidence of breadth and depth.
