 There is a wide range of measures in place to communicate crime prevention advice, both at regional and local levels. The Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office provides advice, as well as financial support, and works in partnership with other statutory and voluntary organisations to tackle many crime prevention issues. These include domestic burglary, car crime, hate crime, business crime, crimes against older people, antisocial behaviour, illicit drugs, domestic violence and sexual violence. Advice is provided through a variety of mediums including television and radio campaigns, project staff, leaflets, face to face advice and websites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="70712w0003.htm_para12"><a name="07071264000317">At a local level, Community Safety Partnerships are located in every district council area throughout Northern Ireland. Each partnership has a published action plan which specifies the crime issues to be addressed in that particular area. They offer advice through local road shows, seminars, community newsletters and targeted leaflets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="70712w0003.htm_para13"><a name="07071264000318">PSNI communicates crime prevention advice to the public in many ways.

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="70712w0003.htm_para14"><a name="07071264000319">PSNI have also made presentations at public meetings on a variety of topics. For example, in Londonderry during May 2007, a presentation was given to more than 70 business owners on preventing Tiger Kidnaps. Likewise, the PSNI participate in a number of groups such as the National Security Inspectorate, the Tobacco and Alcohol group (to give anti-robbery advice for high value loads), Retailers Against Crime In Northern Ireland (dealing with all aspects of crime against the retail community) and Northern Ireland Bankers Association (cash in transit robberies, kidnap or robbery of bank staff and counterfeit currency).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="70712w0003.htm_para15"><a name="07071264000320">PSNI also recently staged a theft from a vehicle, which was filmed for local television news, to highlight ways to secure against the theft of Satellite Navigation Systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="70712w0007.htm_para1"><a name="07071270000090">Over the lifetime of the loans, the total gross payments of interest and other subsidies to the debt owners, in respect of loans made to English and Welsh domiciled students, is estimated at &#163;635 million in 1998/99 net present value (NPV) terms. After deducting the interest subsidy costs, which the Government would still have incurred if the loans had not been sold, the estimated net lifetime costs of the sale for interest and other subsidies are &#163;125 million in 1998/99 NPV terms. This assumes the current relevant Treasury discount rate of 3.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="70712w0007.htm_para2"><a name="07071270000091">The discount rate at the time of the sales was 6.0 per cent. Using this rate would have resulted in future cash flows having lesser value, which would have made the sales more attractive to the Government. The estimated total gross payments of interest and other subsidies would have been &#163;545 million, with a net estimated lifetime saving of &#163;130 million. The actual final cost/saving will depend on the performance of the sold loans over their remaining life.</p>

This work is continuing with the aim of having an action plan in place in October 2007. At the same time, the East Midlands forces have made advances in the delivery of policing services to tackle serious organised and cross-border crime through the establishment of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit.

 The regulatory window for making payments under the 2007 single payment scheme (SPS) runs from 1 December 2007 to 30 June 2008. While the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will aim to start payments as early as possible within that window, the date will depend in practice on progress with the validation of claims.</p>

While this represents a greater degree of challenge for the agency in the coming year it also reflects the fact that it is still in a recovery period.

 We cannot give a firm date for when we will make the final payments under the 2005 and 2006 single payment scheme (SPS). The claimants who have yet to receive any payment are the more complex cases, such as those involving probate, which by their nature are more difficult to resolve. As the Secretary of State reported to the House on 2 July, there are also some 20,000 SPS 2005 claims where entitlement values have been identified for review and possible adjustment, upwards or downwards. This may identify a further payment to be made or an overpayment to be recovered. The RPA is now switching resources to deal with these cases.</p>

 Since May 2006, animal health inspectors at Dover have found five calves in a collapsed state on vehicles intended for export. Notices were served requiring the immediate humane slaughter of all of these calves, although one died naturally. The notices did not require any further action as it was the opinion of the inspectors that the means and conditions of transport were not the cause of the calves condition.

 The Government consider that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of possible control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management (particularly for rabbits and foxes) and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical. In these circumstances snares restrain rather than kill and may prove to be more humane than other methods. The DEFRA snares action plan and the DEFRA code of good practice on the use of snares in fox and rabbit control in England can be found at:</p>

 No. The provision of social care is based on the National Assistance Act 1948. Sections 21 and 29 of the Act relate to the duties and powers of local authorities to provide social care services. Following the Local Authorities Social Services Act 1970, local council social services departments were set up to provide services to a wide range of people, including children in need, people with mental health problems and learning difficulties and older people.</p>
