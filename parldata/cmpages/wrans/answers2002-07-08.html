To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list the budgets for the training of military and security personnel from overseas <i>(a)</i> in the UK and <i>(b)</i> overseas for (i) each of the past two years, (ii) the current year and (iii) future years for which estimates are available.

<a name="20708w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Funding for the training of military and security personnel (including police forces, customs and border guards) from overseas comes from a variety of FCO departmental budgets. It supports FCO objectives such as promoting international peace and stability, and improved quality of life world-wide through good governance and crime reduction. A breakdown of approximate expenditure as requested by financial year (f/y) is:

<a name="20708w01.html_para0">Future estimates are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para1">The reduction of FCO expenditure in f/ys 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 does not reflect a reduction in activity. It is because the FCO contributed a large part of its military and security training funding to the two cross- departmental Conflict Prevention Pools (involving FCO, MOD, DfID and HMT) established in April 2001 for Africa and the rest of the world. Each of the four Government Departments made a contribution to the pools. Many of the training activities continue to be supported by the pools because they achieve HMG's conflict prevention objectives overseas. In f/y 2001&#150;02, the Africa Pool had a budget of &#163;50 million and this will remain the same through to f/y 2003&#150;04. The Global Pool was allocated &#163;60 million for f/y 2001&#150;02, &#163;66 million for this financial year and will have &#163;76 million to spend in f/y 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para2">Information on the FCO's ASSIST training budget f/y 2000&#150;01, which was the principle contribution to the pools is available from an earlier answer given by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) on 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 957W.

 As a non-regulatory Department, the FCO does not have a dedicated regulatory impact unit. Since 1997 issues relating to regulatory impact have been dealt with by a member of FCO staff as part of his overall duties.

Nor do we at present maintain statistics on the nationality of applicants, although we are currently looking at ways of improving our information technology to enable us to do so.

<a name="20708w01.html_wqn3"><B> Paddy Tipping: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how the Government consider applications for export licences for the supply of military equipment for incorporation into final products for possible onward export; and if he will make a statement.  [67534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In recent years there have been far reaching changes in the defence industry in the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the United States. Against the background of the end of the Cold War and the resulting reduction in defence budgets world wide, the defence industry has been subject to massive rationalisation. One consequence of this change is that increasingly defence goods are manufactured from components sourced in several different countries.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para3">This restructuring of the defence industry presents new challenges for the Government's approach to export licensing. Many export licence applications are for goods which are to be incorporated in defence equipment in a second country, which thereafter may be exported to a third country.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para4">The Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria set out in a statement by my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), <i>Official Report</i>, column 199&#150;203W on 26 October 2000, make clear that they "will not be applied mechanistically" to decisions on export licence applications, but rather "on a case-by-case basis, using judgment and common sense". The criteria do not provide specific guidance on what approach should be adopted in these "incorporation" cases.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para5">Other EU and NATO member states face the same rapidly changing environment for their defence industries as the UK. Enquiries by Her Majesty's Government suggest, however, that while as yet there is no common policy in such cases, many of our European partners recognise the need to adopt a special approach towards cases involving incorporation for onward export.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2002 : Column 653W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para6">After very careful consideration, Her Majesty's Government have, therefore, decided that it is necessary to set out how it will in future approach licence applications for goods where it is understood that the goods are to be incorporated into products for onward export. The Government will continue to assess such applications on a case by case basis against the Consolidated Criteria, while at the same time having regard to, inter alia, the following factors:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the export control policies and effectiveness of the export control system of the incorporating country;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the importance of the UK's defence and security relationship with the incorporating country;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the materiality and significance of the UK-origin goods in relation to the goods into which they are to be incorporated, and in relation to any end-use of the finished products which might give rise to concern;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the ease with which the UK-origin goods, or significant parts of them, could be removed from the goods into which they are to be incorporated; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) the standing of the entity to which the goods are to be exported.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para7">Against this background the Government have considered its response to a number of applications for the export of parts, subsystems and components to the USA for incorporation into equipment eventually destined for other countries. These include Head Up Display units (HUDs) for incorporation in F-16 aircraft scheduled for delivery to Israel in 2003. The UK content in F-16s is less than 1 per cent. in value, but the supply of HUDs is part of a long-standing collaboration in this US programme. Any interruption to the supply of these components would have serious implications for the UK's defence relations with the United States.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para8">The Government continue to be seriously concerned about the situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories. There has to be a break to the cycle of violence, which has brought so much misery to both peoples, and a resumption of the peace process. We are working closely with partners including the US to reduce the level of tension and to bring about a sustainable and peaceful settlement through negotiation.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para9">The United States Government maintains a strong and effective export licensing system. The Quadripartite Committee has noted that the United States' conventional arms transfer policy
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"does not appear to differ in any important way from the EU Code or the UK national criteria. In some respects . . . it is an improvement"
(HC 467 xxix 73 (25 July 2000)). Appropriate use of arms exported to Israel by the US is the subject of regular dialogue between the two countries, and when the US have concerns they make these known to the Israelis (as required by Congressional legislation). The State Department has been monitoring Israeli actions carefully and will continue to do so.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20708w01.html_para10">At the same time the Government carefully take into account the importance of maintaining a strong and dynamic defence relationship with the US. This relationship is fundamental to the UK's national security as well as to our ability to play a strong and effective role in the world. The importance of this role has been demonstrated repeatedly in recent months. There are 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2002 : Column 654W</I><P>
also wider benefits to the UK's national security of maintaining a strong indigenous defence industrial capability.
<P>

<a name="20708w01.html_para11">Taking account of all these considerations, the Government considered that the applications should be approved, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has today granted licences for the export of the HUDs, and other equipment to the USA. The Government will apply similar considerations to similar applications in future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on what grounds it was decided not to hand out leaflets on Gibraltar during the overseas territories exhibition organised by his Office on Britain's overseas territories; and who took the decision.  [67218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> No such decision was taken. An updated information leaflet on Gibraltar was prepared specially for the event, and was inserted into all the packs prepared before the event. These packs ran out on the day, due to high demand. Additional packs were prepared but, due to an oversight, these were given out for a short period without Gibraltar leaflets. This situation was quickly corrected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the Government's policy is on the status of joint proposals agreed by the United Kingdom and Spain on the future of Gibraltar, should they be rejected by the people of Gibraltar in a referendum; if such proposals would form the basis of future negotiations; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 2 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 276W. As I said in Westminster Hall on 18 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 38WH, no deal will be implemented unless the people of Gibraltar agree in a referendum.

<a name="20708w04.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education reported jointly to the Secretaries of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Education and Employment in 1999 via the report "All Our Futures". The report contained 59 detailed recommendations for action by a range of bodies including Government, schools and higher education institutions. My Department has worked closely with the Department for Education and Skills, and external partners, to implement the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20708w04.html_para1">Some of the main steps taken so far include funding of &#163;270 million for the introduction of the Music Standards Fund to protect and expand LEA music services; the establishment of Artsmark, a national awards scheme now in its second year which recognises schools which offer a wide range of arts provision; and the recent joint announcement of &#163;130 million for the Space for Sport and Arts programme which will fund almost 300 primary schools nationwide to modernise or build new multi-use halls and sports facilities and new music and arts studios.

<P>
<a name="20708w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government believe that the rapid roll-out and adoption of broadband across the UK is important to both their social and economic objectives. The Government and other organisations have conducted studies of the application of information and communication technology and e-commerce to business and small and medium enterprises which suggest that broadband has a range of benefits and that industries stand to gain from productivity improvements. However, an assessment of the specific benefits to each industry within DCMS' remit could be undertaken only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="20708w04.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> On 27 May the Independent Television Commission (ITC) published the Charter for Broadcasting in the Nations and Regions, an agreement with the ITV companies to secure a sustainable future for regional programming. The charter includes commitments to guarantee out of London investment, improve scheduling of regional programming and strengthen local accountability. It also involves a greater standardisation of regional programme hours, and therefore some reduction in output that is less well funded and shown at the least accessible times. The ITC considers that the emphasis should be on quality rather than quantity and that the public interest is best served by better funded, more accessible programming. The Department has no plans to intervene.

 The law does not require passengers to wear seat belts in the rear seats of coaches but advice in the Highway Code is that they should be worn where available. Unlike the case of drivers of cars, goods vehicles and the smaller minibuses, it would be unreasonable and potentially unsafe for drivers of these larger vehicles also to be responsible for seat belt wearing by passengers under 14 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many bus services in each metropolitan transport authority area for which his Department pays subsidy have been <i>(a)</i> temporarily and <i>(b)</i> permanently suspended in the last 12 months.  [66880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department does not collect information in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="20708w06.html_para0">All local bus services following a registered route and timetable are eligible to receive grant from the Department in the form of fuel duty rebate. However, in the vast majority of cases (nearly 90 per cent. of total bus provision in the areas of passenger transport authorities) decisions on service provision are for commercial operators.
<P>

<a name="20708w06.html_para1">In the remaining cases, the service is provided under contract from the passenger transport authority and subsidised by that authority from its own resources. The resources available to authorities are augmented by payments from the Department's rural bus subsidy grant scheme. I understand that only one service supported by a passenger transport authority with funding form this scheme has been withdrawn in the last 12 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures he is taking to increase the take-up of concessionary fares on rural bus services.  [66781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> Our minimum requirement for concessionary fares schemes has, since June 2001, guaranteed at least half-fares for pensioners and disabled people on local buses to the benefit of seven million people overall, some of whom will be travelling in rural areas. This is an improvement on the previous position where 16 mostly rural areas had no concessionary travel scheme at all. From April 2003 the Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002 will ensure that men aged 60&#150;65 will also receive the benefit of concessionary travel. Further, our Rural Bus Subsidy Grant has provided an additional 1,800 services upon which concessionary travel is possible. Many of the innovative schemes supported by our Rural Bus Challenge competition also provide further scope for take-up of concessionary travel.

<P>
<a name="20708w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Hertford county council originally proposed that the Baldock bypass should be funded through the Private Finance Initiative. However, following a re-evaluation of the scheme, Hertfordshire concluded that the Baldock bypass should be procured through conventional funding. They agreed to provide revised cost estimates in support of this view.

<a name="20708w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Up to June 2002 the DTI used a variety of waste contractors, who operated their own waste minimisation techniques, including minimisation at source, re-use, recycling and energy recovery. An accurate figure for the proportion of waste recycled, composted, reused and segregated from 1997 to date could be obtained only at disproportionate expense. However, I attach a high importance to monitoring and improving on current waste outputs, and a total waste management tender has been developed and has taken effect from July 1 2002. The successful contractor will be required to report on the percentage of waste streams that are recovered, while ensuring that the following targets are achieved:

 In line with the end-June benchmark date set in the WTO Doha ministerial declaration for the exchange of initial requests between WTO members for liberalisation under the current General Agreement on Trade in Services negotiations, the European Community's requests were finalised on 28 June following consultation between the Commission and member states. They are being transmitted this week to individual WTO members to whom they are addressed.
<P>

<a name="20708w07.html_para1">In the case of the EC's major trading partners, both developed and developing countries, requests are made in most services sectors. The main exceptions are health, education (with the exception of the US, to whom requests are made in the area of privately funded higher education services) and audio-visual services.
<P>

<a name="20708w07.html_para2">As regards developing countries, requests are made in line with their levels of development. In the case of the least developed countries, requests are in the main limited to three to five sectors, with the sectors identified being those where liberalisation is most likely to contribute to development&#151;primarily business, financial, telecommunications and transport services.
<P>

<a name="20708w07.html_para3">Throughout the requests, the EC emphasises that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services or the privatisation of state owned companies. The requests also make clear that the EC recognises the importance of liberalisation being underpinned by domestic regulatory frameworks designed to ensure the achievement of public policy objectives.
<P>

<a name="20708w07.html_para4">The requests are not demands. They are an opening basis for negotiations. Nor, as WTO Director-General Mike Moore has confirmed last week, do requests constitute agreements by WTO members to include such sectors as part of their commitments.

 All relevant export licence applications, whether for Standard Individual Export Licences (SIEL) or Open Individual Export Licences (OIEL), are considered on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. I refer the right hon. and learned Member to the reply from the Minister for Europe, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Peter Hain), to right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Peter Hain), to my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) on 26 October 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 199&#150;203W.
<P>

<a name="20708w08.html_para0">In assessing applications for OIELs, the Government considers whether an OIEL would provide for sufficient control in relation to the goods and countries or end users concerned. If not, SIEL applications will be invited instead. Furthermore, OIELs will normally only be granted to exporters with a proven track record of applications for SIELs, and where the particular nature of their business makes the use of SIELs inappropriate or inefficient.

<a name="20708w08.html_para1">There is currently no long-term management policy for either high level or intermediate level radioactive waste. Both high and intermediate level wastes are currently stored safely on licensed sites and are subject to strict regulatory control by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installations inspectorate. Any discharges relating to the storage of waste are similarly regulated by the Environment Agency. Wastes in liquid form may be high, intermediate or low level. Low level liquid wastes are discharged from a number of sites throughout the country under authorisations granted by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20708w08.html_para3">The Government focus their efforts on assessment of potential end-use at the export licensing stage, including where needed through checks made by our posts overseas. Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. Nevertheless, the Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20708w08.html_para4">The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) applies to residential homes, boarding schools and university halls of residence. HSWA sets out general health and safety duties which employers, the self-employed and people in control of premises have towards their employees, and others who could be affected by the work activities. It is the 'umbrella' legislation under which other, more specific, health and safety regulations are made. The Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1998 allocate inspection responsibility for different types of undertakings to either the Health and Safety Executive or to the Local Authority. Inspectors are appointed under Section 19 of HSWA to carry out inspection and enforcement in relation to health and safety.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Comprehensive Performance Assessments bring together different judgments about a local authority's performance, many of which arise from audits and inspections carried out under the best value powers in the Local Government Act 1999. Such assessments will be used to determine, in consultation with individual councils, the timing and content of subsequent audit and inspection activity. In the case of good performing authorities, we anticipate reduced levels of inspection from next year. All authorities can expect a more proportionate risk based programme of both audit and inspection, and better co-ordination across the range of their functions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w08.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the cost to local authorities of complying with the comprehensive performance assessment system; and if he will make a statement.  [67437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Comprehensive Performance Assessments make significant use of existing performance information from the following sources:

<a name="20708w08.html_para5">Additional inspection fieldwork is kept to the minimum necessary to provide fair and robust judgments. The Audit Commission will undertake the majority of this fieldwork by redirecting their scheduled inspection activities. Because the fieldwork will replace some, or all, of the planned inspection activity for the period up to December 2002, it will be achieved within the existing fee envelope for local councils.

It recommends that the Government develop and implement a national rehabilitation strategy, which should pull together the contributions of all relevant Government Departments. As part of this strategy, the report recommends improvements to key reception and release procedures in prison, and a 'Going Straight Contract', which would deliver improvements in mental health outcomes, particularly in how they join up with many of the other factors affecting prisoners. An action plan setting out the Government's response to the report will be published later this year.

<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that we are today issuing a consultation document covering reform of the system we use to distribute grant to English local authorities. The consultation will run for 12 weeks over the summer. I have placed copies of the document in the Library of the House. It is being sent to all local authorities, as well as other stakeholders, and is available via the internet.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para6">The system covers key services including education, personal social services, police, fire and a wider range of other responsibilities. It accounts for distribution of over 85 per cent. of the resources government provides for those services, currently about &#163;36 billion per year. Its importance to local government, other stakeholders and 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2002 : Column 683W</I><P>
public service delivery across the country means that we want a full and open public consultation on the new system.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para7">The consultation document sets out the Government's broad objectives for the reform. Responses to the 2000 Local Government Finance Green Paper showed that a big majority of the local government respondents wanted the new system to continue to be based on formulae. The Government announced in the 2001 Local Government White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services" that we agreed. We want new formulae that are fairer, simpler; more intelligible and more stable.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para8">We are concerned to make sure that the new system is more easily understood that the old one. It is important to improve transparency and accountability. Clearly, it will never be possible to achieve a very simple system; the complexity of the issues it seeks to address see to that. The extremely technical nature of the issues means that there is frequently no clear-cut optimum solution. But we believe it is possible to make improvements.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para9">In considering how to reflect local authorities' relative needs and circumstances, a range of factors have to be taken into account. Three elements seem fundamental:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. a basic amount per head of population (or other relevant unit cost);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. an appropriate emphasis on the need to tackle deprivation; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. the variation in pay costs between different areas of the country.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para10">Because deprivation and pay components are core drivers of the costs authorities face in most areas and the problems the system will need to address, we are particularly keen to see them separately identified in formulae. However, that is not to say that other components (for example sparsity) are unimportant. Indeed, they may be a key consideration in particular instances. They will be clearly identified where they form part of a formula.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para11">The document sets out options for the various components. These options are detailed to the level of showing the effects on each relevant local authority, comparing against the baseline of 2002&#150;03. This will enable authorities and other interested parties to form views about the desirability of each option.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para12">However, these figures are not those that will appear in the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement later this year. They will differ both because of changes in the overall funding totals (as a result of the spending review) and as a result of changes to data such as population that will not be available until the autumn. Waiting until that information is available would severely restrict the time available for consultation and in any case would not improve the consultation because we want responses to be about the system and the formulae, rather than on the basis of yearly variations in data. So the options are presented in terms of changes from the 2002&#150;03 local government finance settlement.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para13">We will not necessarily limit ourselves to building the new system from the choices specifically consulted upon here. It is likely that other options will be put forward in response to this consultation, and we will not exclude 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2002 : Column 684W</I><P>
those before taking decisions. Our conclusions arising from the consultation and further consideration of options will be incorporated in the provisional settlement for 2003&#150;04 that will be published at the usual time, towards the end of the year. Following a further period of consultation, final decisions will be announced in early 2003 in time to take effect in the 2003&#150;04 financial year.
<P>

<a name="20708w09.html_para14">This is a difficult and important issue. The Government recognise that pragmatic decisions will be needed to produce a workable system, and the complexity and variety of the pressures that are put upon the system from all sides means that it will not be possible for all authorities to get what they want from this process. So no authority should feel that it is guaranteed to get a bigger share of the fixed amount of resources the system can distribute. But the Government are seeking a fairer distribution of resources which takes account of today's pressures on local government and the particular needs of areas of deprivation. We will consider all of the views that are put forward, and weigh them up carefully before decisions are taken.

 The Department worked with the task force of the Advisory Committee on Packaging (ACP) in the production of a report, published in November 2001, which looked at packaging material flows from raw material manufacturer to seller, and at packaging waste flows from point of discard to ultimate disposal or recovery. This report, which is publicly available, also looked at the likely level of packaging waste arising in the household stream and which would increasingly have to be recovered if likely higher targets are to be met.
<P>

<a name="20708w10.html_para3">New packaging waste recovery targets have not yet been finalised but for the purposes of the estimates in the task force report an overall recycling target of 60 per cent. is assumed to have to be met in 2006.

 The Government are committed to the principle that developed countries, as the biggest emitters, should take the lead in reducing emissions.

Developing countries are covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Under its terms, they do not have legally binding greenhouse gas emission targets but must take steps to limit their emissions and to report on their efforts. A number of developing countries have already ratified the Protocol and we hope that as many developing countries as possible will follow that lead. The Government hope that the entry into force of the Protocol will provide the basis on which we can enter into an international dialogue with developed and developing countries (or "all countries") on future action to tackle climate change. In due course, all countries that emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases will need to take action if we are to meet the UN Climate Change Convention's objective of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a safe level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects to announce the budget allocation for the financial year 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 for organisations sponsored by her Department; and if she will make a statement.  [64280]<P>

<P>
<a name="20708w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department operates a system of delegated budgeting. Budgets for 2002&#150;03 were issued to policy commands during April, for them to allocate as appropriate. Organisations who are sponsored by the Department are part of the delegation process. They are notified of the level of sponsorship once this has been determined.

<a name="20708w11.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 If the application for an import licence is complete and correct and we have up-to-date import conditions in place that have been agreed with the exporting country, we can dispatch a licence within three days. It is, however, more common for us to have to negotiate new or amended import conditions with the veterinary authorities of the exporting country. This can be a slow process and can take several months. For this reason we do not have a target date for such applications.
<P>

<a name="20708w11.html_para1">The existing licensing procedure will be retained until the European Commission introduces harmonised animal health rules for the importation of camelids into the Community.

 The Commission gave a verbal summary of its views at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 10 April this year. We have not yet received formal notification of any changes to the existing arrangements. We have written to the Commission seeking clarification of their position and have alerted them to the impact a suspension of such imports would have on the UK, not only for the well established trade in alpacas but also for breeding programmes of certain endangered species across the Community. There have been a number of formal and informal discussions in Brussels with the Commission and other member states and the Commission intends to introduce harmonised rules for certain species covered by Directive 92/65/EC.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

In using and interpreting table 2 the following points should be noted:<P>

A proportion of TB incidents remain unclassified, awaiting the results of culture tests which can take several months. Therefore the number of confirmed incidents, for 2002 in particular, will currently be under-recorded. For instance, 9 per cent. of new TB incidents in January to May 2002 were unclassified when the data were extracted.<P>

The number of TB incidents depends on the number of tests carried out and on the nature of the testing regime at the time (as well as on the underlying prevalence of the disease). In 2002, testing resources are being concentrated on herds which are overdue their tests (because of the backlog following the foot and mouth disease outbreak) and which have therefore had a longer period than usual in which to contract the disease. Those currently being tested also contain a higher than usual proportion of high risk herds. During the FMD outbreak, TB testing was significantly reduced and necessarily targeted to higher risk herds e.g. those tested following routine inspection of animals at slaughterhouses. At any time, the more herds are tested, the more likely you are to find TB.<P>

It is therefore very difficult to assess the underlying trends at this time.<P>

Any reactors, inconclusive reactors and direct contacts still awaiting removal and slaughter on the date of the data download were not included in the tables. These only show the number of reactors, inconclusive reactors and direct contacts that had been slaughtered as at 11 June.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2002]:</i> The rolling nature of the backlog of herd testing for bovine TB makes it difficult for us to set a specific target for its elimination although we are working hard to address the backlog which currently stands at 20K. As overdue tests are cleared, more fall due and join the backlog. In addition as further incidents of TB are disclosed more testing is triggered.

It is estimated that the number of sheep still alive which were born before 1 August 1996, is less than 500, representing approximately 3 per cent. of the UK national flock.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Director General of Water Services' powers and duties are set out in the Water Industry Act 1991.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Director General of Water Services has powers to set price limits. Within its price limit, each company is responsible for deciding individual charges. Under the Water Industry Act 1999, companies must publish these charges annually in a charges scheme, for which they must obtain the Director General's approval.

 The Department has not received any specific representations about changes in the value of registered common land which might be due to the provisions contained in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. This was an issue on which comments were invited during consultation on draft regulations under section 68 of the Act relating to vehicular access over common land, but no specific representations were received. As the published regulatory impact assessment makes clear, the Department cannot predict with confidence the detailed impact of the regulations.

<P>
<a name="20708w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> Assessment of the condition of these habitat types, or of specific features within them, is carried out in a number of contexts.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para1">Countryside Survey 2000 has provided a national assessment of long-term changes in the extent and condition of habitats. The Department is funding further research to improve understanding of the underlying reasons for this and the results are expected in Spring 2003. The report and related material can be found at www.cs2000.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para2">As part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) individual action plans have been published for upland and lowland calcareous grassland, upland heathland and bogs. Each plan contains an assessment of the factors affecting the habitat, targets for maintenance or improvement of the habitat condition and actions aimed at achieving these targets. Implementation of the action plans is being led by the statutory conservation agencies in partnership with the relevant Government and voluntary sector bodies. Further information on the plans can be found at www.ukbap.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para3">English Nature also assess the condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Where SSSIs are not in a favourable condition, a number of factors may contribute to this. Agriculture is a major factor, particularly grazing intensity. Overgrazing or undergrazing can adversely affect the condition of sites. We are addressing these problems on a number of fronts. For example, we continue to expand agri-environment schemes, which can assist many of these habitats. In addition, the sheep quota purchase scheme announced on 26 June is an example of the development of more direct and innovative measures to help alleviate grazing pressure.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para4">Grazing regimes also affect these habitats on common land. We shall shortly announce our plans for improving the legislation to enable better management of common land.

 The security situation has deteriorated sharply since the Maoists abandoned peace negotiations in November last year. Since then an estimated 3,000 people have died as a result of the conflict.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para10">The Government holds all the district towns, but large parts of the countryside are under effective control of the Maoists. The intensity of the conflict varies, with the Maoist "heartland" areas of the mid-west and far-west most affected.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para11">The war is generally regarded to be unwinnable by military means alone, as the country is ideally suited to guerrilla warfare. There are growing concerns about human rights violations on both sides. In recent weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in confrontations between the Security Forces and the Maoists, but this lull in the fighting is believed to be temporary.
<P>

<a name="20708w15.html_para12">While there is no direct threat against development workers, there are indirect risks of being caught in crossfire. Restrictions on movement, especially of people and supplies, and the withdrawal of Government counterparts in rural areas, means that Government development programmes in some remote areas has effectively stopped. None the less, Maoists are allowing continuation of development projects in some areas under their control, particularly where work is strongly supported by local communities.

 Property rights are an important element in poor people's range of livelihood assets and can assist directly in processes that eliminate poverty. My Department has made a series of assessments of property rights, mainly concerning land ownership and housing, in both rural and urban contexts.
<P>

<a name="20708w16.html_para0">Research has been undertaken, for example, to establish the range of tenure arrangements available to poor people in developing countries that allow people degrees of security and freedom in where they live, from which they can build their livelihoods for the future. The results are published by Intermediate Technology Development Group Publishing under the title "Land, Rights and Innovation". This tenure framework is currently being used to observe how poor people manage to establish their property rights in 15 developing countries. The work is being shared with the UN and World bank.

21 initial entrants to full-time and sandwich courses expressed as a proportion of the averaged 18 to 19-year-old population. The sharp rise in participation rates in the early 1990s reflects the expansion of the higher education sector during these years. There was an increase in entrant numbers in 1997 related partly to the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999.

<a name="20708w20.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We have acknowledged the historic gap between funding in schools and further education (FE) colleges and we have pledged to bring up the levels of support for FE to ensure upward convergence of funding between the two sectors. We will do this over time and as resources allow. However, as independent corporations, it is for each FE college to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to it.
<P>

<a name="20708w20.html_para2">We are investing significant funding in the FE sector. An additional &#163;314 million is available for FE this year compared with 2001&#150;02 and by 2003&#150;04, total funding for FE will be up by 26 per cent. in real terms since 1997, with total funding per full-time equivalent student up by 16 per cent. over the same period. Separate to any general pay rise a FE lecturer may receive, the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) provides &#163;311 million over the period 2001&#150;04 to reward excellent teaching. The substantial additional investment we are making in the sector should help the FE sector support the pay aspirations of their staff.

 One of the principles of the Connexions strategy is to take account of the views of young people both individually and collectively. This includes young people from faith communities and the organisations that represent them. Nationally, the Connexions Service National Unit has discussed and agreed with the Catholic Education Service the basis on which Connexions personal advisers work in Catholic schools and colleges. Locally, Connexions partnerships work with many different voluntary and community groups which support young people, including faith-based organisations. There are examples across the country of faith based organisations being involved in local Connexions management or advisory groups. Some local faith based organisations receive grants from Connexions Partnerships. Organisations with a faith basis also feature prominently among the National Voluntary Youth Organisations (NVYOs) who receive funds from the Department's NVYO Grant Scheme. This is administered by the Connexions Service National Unit to support personal development programmes for young people.

<a name="20708w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 In the last financial year (2001&#150;02) the Connexions Service spent approximately &#163;320 million. Of that, &#163;107 million was incurred by Connexions Partnerships&#151;i.e. those fifteen that were operating during 2001&#150;02; twelve of which were in place for the full 12 months and three for the last seven months. The remainder was used to support careers services in those areas where Connexions was not operational and to fund central costs such as the training of personal advisers.
<P>

<a name="20708w21.html_para1">We do not collect information centrally on the exact amount of funding transferred to other bodies, mainly because the variety of different ways in which Partnerships operate makes it impractical to do so. It is for each Connexions Partnership to determine, within broad guidelines, how best to use its funding to meet identified local needs. In some cases this involves sub-contracting work to other organisations such as voluntary and community bodies.
<P>

<a name="20708w21.html_para2">According to the latest available information (relating to the situation at the end of March 2002), the 15 Connexions Partnerships operational at that time employed 3,933 staff&#151;this includes all staff involved in the delivery of Connexions i.e. delivery staff (mainly personal advisers), managerial and administrative staff, etc.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much funding Connexions receives from Government sources; what non-governmental sources of income Connexions has; how much Connexions disburses to other organisations; and by what mechanisms Connexions makes this money available.  [66708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 In the current financial year (2002&#150;03), Connexions has been allocated &#163;446 million from central Government funds. The majority of that funding (ie &#163;359 million) is devolved to Connexions Partnerships through the main Connexions grant&#151;this relates to the 27 partnerships operational at the start of 2002&#150;03 and the remaining 20 due to become operational during the financial year. The remainder of the overall Connexions budget is used to support careers services in those areas where Connexions is not yet fully operational and to fund central costs such as the training of personal advisers.
<P>

<a name="20708w21.html_para3">We do not have an exhaustive list of other sources of income but they include the European Social Fund, the National Lottery, the private sector, the Learning and Skills Council and local partners such as local authorities, etc. The strength of Connexions is its ability to pull together the contributions of a range of local partners to eliminate any gaps and duplication in the provision of support for young people. Much of the contribution of local partners is, therefore, of an "in-kind" nature rather than simply financial.
<P>

<a name="20708w21.html_para4">We are not yet able to quantify how much funding Connexions partnerships expect to receive in 2002&#150;03 from sources other than the main Connexions grant. However, in the last financial year (2001&#150;02), operational Connexions Partnerships received approximately &#163;1.4 million in cash plus an estimated &#163;8 million in contributions "in-kind" from sources other than the main Connexions grant. Early data from partnerships' business plans show that those figures are expected to be substantially greater this year.

<a name="20708w21.html_para5">We do not collect information centrally on the exact amount of funding disbursed to other organisations, mainly because the variety of different ways in which partnerships operate makes it impractical to do so. Once their funding has been allocated to them by DfES, Connexions Partnerships have the flexibility to use it in whatever manner they judge to be the most effective in relation to their local circumstances. In some cases this involves delegating work to partner organisations such as voluntary and community bodies. In those cases, the Connexions Partnership raises a grant or sub-contract with the organisation concerned in order to control the flow of funding.

 From 1996 to 2001 the number of offending behaviour programmes successfully completed by prisoners has risen almost fivefold despite a 19 per cent. growth in the prison population over the same period. Last year 16,000 prisoners achieved basic skills certificates, there are no firm indications yet that the number of prisoners is significantly affecting the provision of rehabilitation programmes in prisons. However, it is inevitable that at times of high population pressure such provision may be disrupted. The Prison Service will continue to do everything possible to minimise this.

 The recent Home Office review of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) found that unnecessary bureaucracy was a problem in some areas. The review recommended that local agencies draw up simple, streamlined protocols designed with the local area in mind and made a number of practical suggestions for minimising bureaucracy and delays. Advice on how best to do this will be included in the new Home Office guidance on ASBOs.

 The Government shares the profound revulsion which is caused by crimes against elderly people, and is determined to ensure that even the most vulnerable people can feel safe both in their homes or out in their neighbourhood. The latest British Crime Survey (BCS) published last year does not separately identify the level of violent crime against elderly people. However, the BCS did show that the risk of elderly men becoming victims of violence was less than 0.5 per cent. and that the corresponding risk for women was about 0.6 per cent.

<P>
<P>

 Special constables are a key element of our police reform agenda, and we are already working, with stakeholders, to increase the recruitment and retention of special constables as part of that process. Indeed, we announced a package of measures on 18 June that are designed to improve the way specials are recruited, managed, deployed and how their welfare is considered within forces.
<P>

<a name="20708w25.html_para0">We are particularly keen to improve liaison with employers and encourage them to support employees who are specials. Specials bring skills and experience back to their workplace which makes them of real value as an employee. Later this year the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary will publish a joint discussion paper on fiscal and other changes we can make to promote community service, including service as a special constable. A new headline role has also been published, focusing on intelligence-led patrolling and crime reduction initiatives. And a new national foundation training package for specials was issued last month. Revised Conditions of Service Regulations and new Conduct Regulations are in preparation.
<P>

<a name="20708w25.html_para1">Central to this whole process will be Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering all aspects of the recruitment, management and deployment of specials, which will be issued by the end of the year.

We have set aside &#163;300,000 to support these champions and we are working very closely with ACPO in this area.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 is a direct response to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. The Government brought forward amendments to the Race Relations Act 1976 to strengthen the duties placed on public authorities. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 presents both a challenge and an opportunity to public authorities. So for the first time we have placed a statutory duty on Criminal Justice System organisations to eliminate racial discrimination and also to promote race equality and good race relations when carrying out their functions.

 Police strength in West Mercia increased by 125 between the end of March 2001 and the end of January this year, when it reached 2,012 officers. The force plans to have record police numbers in the course of 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20708w27.html_para0">The Government's Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) has played a major part in driving up the number of officers. It is enabling forces to take on 9,000 recruits over and above previous plans in the three years to March 2003. In the first two years of this recruitment initiative West Mercia appointed 109 CFF recruits and they will be able to take on a further 43 CFF recruits in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20708w27.html_para1">Overall, I understand that West Mercia Police Authority's budget will support a planned increase in strength of 300 officers in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="20708w29.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The UK is leading the co-ordination of international anti-narcotics assistance to Afghanistan (which is the source of 90 per cent. of the heroin consumed in the UK). This involves working with international partners and organisations to build law enforcement capacity in Afghanistan to interdict opiates and undermine those criminal organisations engaged in drug trafficking. The international effort is also directed towards eradicating opium poppy and creating alternative livelihoods for Afghan opium farmers.
<P>

<a name="20708w29.html_para0">The UK has also sought to assist drug interdiction efforts of Afghanistan's neighbours. The FCO's Drugs and Crime Fund provided anti-narcotics assistance of around &#163;1.5 million in 2000&#150;01 to Iran, Pakistan and the Central Asian Republics. We have also provided assistance to Balkan countries through which heroin is trafficked from Afghanistan.

 It is a long-standing principle that people receiving benefit have a responsibility to confirm their continuing entitlement on a periodic basis. Where a person may have failed to meet that obligation, it is right that payment of benefit should be suspended.

<a name="20708w29.html_para5">Benefit may be suspended in whole or in part and the suspension continues until the decision maker is able to make a substantive decision on entitlement. If the substantive decision results in no entitlement or a reduced entitlement, the fact that payments have been suspended means that an overpayment is avoided. If the doubt is resolved in a person's favour, payments are restored and arrears paid. Decisions on suspending payment of benefit are discretionary. There is no formal procedure for revising such decisions, but they can be changed in the light of any relevant new evidence or information submitted to the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what assessment he has made of the effect on those whose benefit has been suspended in full for failing to keep an appointment at Jobcentres from the time of suspension to reinstatement of benefits;  [67320]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will introduce a sliding scale of penalties, short of immediate suspension of benefit, for those who have failed to adhere to provisions relating to appointments at Jobcentres;  [67324]
<P>
(3) how many claimants, broken down by age group, have had benefits suspended in <i>(a)</i> the Angus constituency and <i>(b)</i> Scotland in each of the last five years for failing to keep an appointment at a Jobcentre;  [67325]
<P>
(4) what guidance has been given to local Jobcentres on the suspension of benefits from those who fail to keep appointments.  [67326]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 It is a long-standing principle that people claiming jobseeker's allowance have a responsibility to confirm their continuing entitlement to benefit by attending the Jobcentre fortnightly and also by keeping other appointments arranged to help with their job search. Where a person may have failed to meet those obligations, it is right that payment of benefit should be suspended.
<P>

<a name="20708w29.html_para8">When making a decision about suspending benefit, staff in Jobcentres have access to the "Suspension and Termination Guide for Decision Makers" and the "Labour Market Conditions Guide" which gives advice on procedures. This advises that where someone has failed to attend an appointment, benefit should be suspended at the end of that day. The person may then contact the office within five days to show good cause for failing to attend. Examples of good cause include domestic emergencies, attending a job interview or illness. If good cause is demonstrated, then the suspension is lifted and payment made. If not, then the claim is terminated from the day of non-attendance.
<P>

<a name="20708w29.html_para9">No departmental research has been undertaken on suspensions of benefit and no information is collected centrally on the number of people who have had their benefit suspended.
<P>

<a name="20708w29.html_para10">We keep all our policies under review. However, we have no plans to change the current arrangements under which benefit can be suspended.

 Information is not available in the format requested. The available information for Housing Benefit recipients in Scotland for each of the last five years is in the tables. The samples on which this information is based are too small to provide reliable figures for individual constituencies.

It is not possible to say exactly how many people receive their payments at a post office because some people choose to pay a girocheque directly into a bank/building society account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to the answer of 12 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 570W, how many participants in the New Deal have received training through Ambition IT Initiative since January.  [64355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Ambition initiatives are demand-led, and are aimed at training disadvantaged people for good quality jobs. The availability of jobs is key to their success. In the latter part of 2001 there was a reduction in the global workforce in the IT sector as a number of key companies scaled down their operations. At the same time, a number of American companies which employ people in the UK froze recruitment as a result of the events of 11 September. The Ambition:IT initiative was consequently put on hold in December 2001 so that the Department could conduct a review of the skills requirements of the IT sector in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20708w30.html_para2">The review has concluded that the demand for people with IT skills is now most acute in the public sector. The programme has therefore been refocused on this sector and we now expect to start new deal participants in training from this autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of claim forms issued to men aged over 60 years who were potentially eligible for winter fuel payments were returned by 30 March; how many of those claims proved well founded; and what extra steps he is taking to advise men aged over 60 years of potential eligibility in winter 2002.  [64720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20708w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The information is not held in the format requested, However in the 2001&#150;02 winter, the total number of claim forms issued was 285,431. The number of claim forms returned, by 30 March, was 223,927. Of these, 172,281 were successful. A significant number of people who requested claim forms could have become entitled to the winter fuel payment without the need for them to submit a claim and would have been paid automatically.
<P>

<a name="20708w31.html_para1">This year, as in previous years, we will run an information campaign to inform everyone aged 60 and over about winter fuel payments. The campaign for winter 2002 will run until the end of March 2003.

 Poverty is a complex multi- dimensional issue, affecting many aspects of children's lives&#151;including income, health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. There is therefore no single measure of 'child poverty levels' in the Portsmouth, South constituency.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Government believe that work is the best route out of poverty and research has shown that nine out of ten lone parents want to work, either now or in the future. Lone parents face problems on moving into work due to balancing their work life with their caring responsibilities. That is why we are providing extra help to reduce these inequalities and offer lone parents a range of choices to gain more independence by moving into work.
<P>

<a name="20708w31.html_para2">We have introduced measures to make work pay, including the working families' tax credit and the national minimum wage. From 2003 a lone parent working 16 hours a week will have a guaranteed minimum income of &#163;179 a week. We have also provided help to make work possible for lone parents through the child care tax credit and the national child care strategy, which since 1997 has created new places for the benefit of more than 900,000 children.
<P>

<a name="20708w31.html_para3">The New Deal for Lone Parents is available to all lone parents and offers a personalised service of advice and guidance. Personal advisers help with identifying child care, give advice on work and training opportunities and continue to offer in-work support once the lone parent is in work. Nearly 300,000 lone parents so far have participated in the programme and over half have found work. The programme now offers greater training flexibility by funding work-focused courses in skills that will be of benefit in the labour market, such as basic IT skills. In addition, everyone who joins any of the New Deal programmes is now assessed for literacy and numeracy needs and offered high quality learning opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20708w31.html_para4">We are continuing to roll out compulsory personal adviser meetings for lone parents claiming income support to ensure that they are aware of the range of help and support we have introduced to enable them to move into work. Our new Jobcentre Plus offices are providing an integrated service to ensure that lone parents receive the benefits they are entitled to and the help they need to move into work.
<P>

<a name="20708w31.html_para5">The Government are encouraging everyone with the necessary qualifications, including lone parents, to enter further and higher education. For further education institutions in England <sup>1</sup>  we have increased the ring-fenced budget for child care funds by 20 per cent. to &#163;36 million in 2002&#150;03. In higher education in England <sup>1</sup> , lone parents have access to a range of support including child care grants, a grant for school meals and a grant towards travel, books and equipment.

The salaries of special advisers are negotiated individually within the stated pay range (up to &#163;125,000, although the Special Advisers Remuneration Committee may award salaries up to &#163;90,000 only: salaries above that figure are set by the Prime Minister). Details of expected costs are not given in order to protect the privacy of the appointee concerned, in line with exemption 12 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance which is set out in Government accounting, Chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of the insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where <i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance is more cost effective than other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para 30.2.11a]
<P>

<a name="20708w34.html_para5">The Lord Chancellor's Department incurs insurance costs as a condition of their lease on various leasehold properties they occupy through the landlord service charges levied.

 The Legal Services Commission contracts with both quality assured solicitors' firms and not-for-profit organisations to provide legal services which meet the identified priority needs for those services. The Commission is confident that there is sufficient provision in Wales, in all categories of law and in all counties. However, it is developing and improving coverage.

 The timetable and extent of the courts Tribunals Modernisation Programme has not been finalised so it is not yet known what the subsequent effect on staffing levels will be. Initial business planning assumptions indicate that it may be possible to minimise redundancies through the effective management of retirement and recruitment policies, natural turnover of staff and by exploring opportunities for staff in other areas such as the Immigration Appeal Appellate. Redundancy options will be explored only as a last resort, and there will be full consultation with the relevant trade unions throughout.

 Increasing participation in sport has a role to play in raising the rates of physical activity. Low rates of physical activity together with an unhealthy diet contribute to increased rates of obesity. Major cross- Government work has been put in place to raise the level of physical activity, and participation in sport. This includes: &#163;581 million from the new opportunities fund for a physical education and sports programme; the national active sports programme and the Department's recently announced &#163;2.5 million programme of community physical activity pilots, which will test out different community approaches to increasing physical activity. All pilots will involve sport action zones.
