<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to review the decision taken in the Strategic Defence Review to reduce the role of the TA in nuclear biological chemical reconnaissance; and if he will make a statement. [R]  [9671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There are no plans to review the decisions taken in the Strategic Defence Review with regard to the role of the Territorial Army in nuclear biological chemical reconnaissance. Since the SDR a regular Joint NBC Regiment comprising Army/RAF elements has been formed at RAF Honington, and became operational in December 1999. Its role is NBC reconnaissance, survey, detection/identification/monitoring and decontamination. Currently, two squadrons of the Royal Yeomanry form the reserve element of the Joint NBC Regiment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 An Army recruiting initiative 'Operation London Soldier', from 10 to 23 September 2001, culminated in a competition on 30 September. The planned prize had been a period with Exercise Swift Sword. However, due to the events of 11 September, a replacement prize of one week of military/adventure training in Gibraltar was introduced instead.
<P>

<a name="11031w02.html_para0">Exercise Swift Sword, as with all such large exercises, served to heighten awareness of the armed forces, with considerable daily coverage in the media. In addition, the live footage and photographs from the exercise will be used to enhance and update the services' recruiting libraries and will provide up to date and topical material for future recruiting literature.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The cluster bombs used in Afghanistan do not contain anti-personnel landmines and are, therefore, legitimate weapons that have not been prohibited by any treaty or convention. They are used with discretion and

<P>

<a name="11031w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> No napalm has been used by coalition forces operating in the Afghanistan region and there are no plans to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his policy is on a bombing pause to assist the more effective delivery of humanitarian aid in Afghanistan; and if he will make a statement.  [11647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As the UN has made clear, the military campaign as such has not hampered the delivery of assistance in any significant way. We have no plans at present to suspend military activity in Afghanistan in order to facilitate the delivery of aid, not least because a pause in the bombing would simply encourage the Taliban to harass humanitarian supplies more than at present.

services in the last year in respect of service personnel who tested positive under the Compulsory Drug Testing programme.  [10702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 During the year 2000, no disciplinary action was taken against personnel from any of the three services for testing positive at a Compulsory Drugs Test (CDT). Failure of a CDT will normally lead to the Administrative Discharge of an individual on the basis that drugs are incompatible with service in the armed forces. A positive test by itself is not a criminal or disciplinary offence. Disciplinary action will only be invoked, in relation to CDT, if an individual commits the offence of failing to provide a urine sample for the purpose of testing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's proposal concerned the reclassification of cannabis. However, misuse of drugs, of all classes, will remain incompatible with the requirements of life in the armed forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Regular Commission Board (RCB), which is currently based at Westbury in Wiltshire, is part of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA). Its role is to select potential officers for entry to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS), also part of ATRA.
<P>

<a name="11031w02.html_para2">Historically, the RCB was part of the Directorate of Army Recruiting but in 1998 it was placed under the control of RMAS, as there is clearly a synergy between the selection and training of potential officers.




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 665W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11031w02.html_para3">We have now decided that RCB should be collocated with RMAS as from February 2003. Collocation of the two parts of what is essentially a single operation will further enhance coherence, achieve economies of scale and could enable ATRA to achieve a degree of estate rationalisation. The role and ethos of RCB will not change.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence does not run specific courses teaching advanced driving safety, although service personnel do attend courses provided by organisations such as the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA). This training is arranged locally. The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="11031w03.html_para0">MOD does, however, provide training for all categories of driving licences. This includes basic training plus familiarisation training on the relevant type of vehicle, refresher training, and any specialist courses required. All these courses stress the importance of driving safely. More specifically, MOD has recently introduced a defensive driving training programme&#151;some 4,000 personnel were given this training over the year April 2000 to March 2001.

 The standing level of security at Ministry of Defence nuclear installations is maintained at a high level and is specifically designed to counter an attack by armed terrorists. This high baseline level of security is maintained at MOD nuclear installations irrespective of fluctuations in the terrorist alert states that may apply to other Government establishments or MOD installations. Security measures at defence nuclear establishments include armed guarding and strict control of access. As my hon. Friend would expect, these security arrangements are kept under constant review.

 The F680 is an informal process under which companies can obtain advice on the prospects for approval of exports at the marketing stage. The F680 also gives formal clearance for release of classified information, where required, for marketing purposes. The information sought is not currently held in the form requested. However, the Ministry of Defence is carrying out an audit of extant F680 applications as part of a programme to improve this service to industry. I will write to the hon.

 The Committee of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers visited Zimbabwe on 25&#150;26 October. They found a divergence in the views and facts relating to farm occupations. The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) have reported that occupations continue unabated, and that since the Abuja meeting on 6 September, 688 farms had new people join the occupations. The CFU estimate 200&#150;300 new occupations since 6 September. The Government of Zimbabwe dispute these figures. The Farm Community Trust of Zimbabwe have cited several new occupations since Abuja in Mashonaland West. At Abuja, the Government of Zimbabwe gave an assurance that there would be no further occupation of farm lands. We continue to urge the Government of Zimbabwe to abide by this commitment.

<P>

<a name="11031w04.html_para5">I also intend to ensure that I am satisfied on the following issues:

<BR>
1. <i>Efficiency and Viability</i>
<BR>
The technical expertise of the proposed transferee to operate, maintain, renew and enhance the railway network. This will include:
<BR>
presenting proposals for focused and effective management (particularly in relation to contract management and planning, and a willingness to facilitate enhancement by special purpose vehicles or alternative structures for financing enhancements and developments which separate enhancement and development risk from operation, maintenance and renewal), and
<BR>
demonstrating that employees with appropriate skills will be retained and, where applicable, recruited;
<BR>
A proper understanding of the projected liabilities of the transferee and the performance risks it faces;
<BR>
A proper understanding of Railtrack plc's network operating licence and a demonstrable intention and ability to comply with it;
<BR>
A proper understanding of the Government's strategic plans for the railway industry and a demonstrable commitment to them (including the 10-Year Plan and the SRA's Strategic Agenda);
<BR>
A coherent and cost-effective business plan for:
<BR>
ascertaining the condition of the network assets and life cycle cost minimisation;
<BR>
implementing output based contracts for maintenance and renewal;
<BR>
facilitating the successful implementation of special purpose vehicles (or equivalent arrangements) delivering large scale enhancements and renewals; and
<BR>
the maintenance of an assets register, including a description of process and timetable;
<BR>
Proposals for ascertaining the cost structure of the network business and the control systems to be implemented at both central and regional levels and how successful reporting mechanics are to be achieved;
<BR>
A cohesive, achievable and cost-effective strategy for dealing with those renewals and small enhancements that are not to be delivered by special purpose vehicles (or equivalents).
<BR>
2. Safety
<BR>
An ability to run the network safely, with a clearly defined safety policy;
<BR>
Evidence that the Heath and Safety Executive has confidence in the proposed transferee and that the relevant Safety Case will be in place immediately following the transfer.




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 673W</I><P>

<BR>
3. Key Relationships
<BR>
Proposals for creating, at regional level, relationships with railway passenger and freight service operators and other stakeholders;
<BR>
Evidence of support from employees and their representatives;
<BR>
Evidence of the confidence of relevant stakeholders in the industry, for instance railway passenger and freight service operators and suppliers of finance.
<BR>
4. Financial viability and value for money
<BR>
A demonstrated ability to finance the activities of the proposed transferee in a cost-effective manner (including its proposed treatment of existing and future, short and long term finance creditors, and a demonstration that it will have a sufficiently high, investment grade, credit rating to raise the necessary finance for its activities);
<BR>
A coherent plan for the treatment of existing trade and other creditors;
<BR>
A demonstration that its approach would ensure that effective maintenance and renewal takes place at the lowest practical cost.
<BR>
Proposals for the transfer of liabilities which relate to the operation, maintenance, renewal and development of the parts of the network that are to be transferred.

<P>

<a name="11031w04.html_para6">In addition, and to achieve my overall objective, I will have regard to the extent and nature of Government support that will be required to operate the network after the proposed transfer and the value for money that this would represent for Government.

 As I have stated in an answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick) on 23 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 195&#150;97W, it is my firm intention to ensure that our proposal to the administrator would, if accepted, result in the transfer of the business of the company and its finance creditor's indebtedness to a new, financially sound, vehicle and that the debt transferred will have a long-term credit rating of at least BBB/Baa2 and a short-term credit rating of at least A-2/P-2.
<P>

<a name="11031w04.html_para7">In relation to the proposal that we will be putting to the administrator for a company limited by guarantee, we will be targeting a long-term credit rating of A/A2 or higher, to reflect the financing capacity requirements of the rail infrastructure business. I am advised that this would secure a robust balance sheet for the company.
<P>

<a name="11031w04.html_para8">I can also reaffirm my firm intention that our proposal will, taken in the round, preserve the economic rights of the current finance creditors in all material respects. Such proposals must, however, retain the flexibility to translate some of the detailed terms and conditions of the debt into a form that reflects the different structure and credit rating of a company limited by guarantee.

 Licences for underground petrol tanks have conditions attached which are intended to prevent and detect leaks. The conditions are based on guidance issued by HSE and the Local Authorities Co-ordinating body on Food and Trading Standards (LACOTS).
<P>

<a name="11031w05.html_para0">HSC are to consult early next year on a proposal to remove licensing at all workplaces except retail petrol filling stations. All workplaces storing petrol, whether licensed or not, will be subject to the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) which will come into force in the summer of next year.
<P>

<a name="11031w05.html_para1">DSEAR places comprehensive duties on employers to eliminate or reduce fire and explosion risks from dangerous substances including petrol. DSEAR will require measures to reduce risk of releases and the escape of petrol.
<P>

<a name="11031w05.html_para2">Because of the close involvement of the public at retail petrol filling stations it is proposed to develop additional controls to supplement DSEAR, as a replacement for the current licensing regime.

 Local authorities receive an additional amount of revenue support grant to compensate them for properties exempted from the council tax because they consist of student households.

<P>
<a name="11031w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Cadet training is a matter for the shipping industry itself. But the Government provide financial support for training under the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. A company entering the UK tonnage tax has to meet a training commitment equivalent to one officer trainee per year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet. We believe these measures will increase cadet training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when regional planning guidance for Yorkshire and the Humber will be published.  [12006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w07.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My right Hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is today publishing Regional Planning Guidance for Yorkshire and the Humber (RPG12).




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 681W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para0">RPG12 provides the spatial development framework for the Yorkshire and Humber region. Its core objectives are to support sustainable economic growth and regeneration and to achieve urban and rural renaissance in the region. Development will be focused on the region's main towns and cities making best use of previously-developed land and helping to reduce the need to travel.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para1">The new Yorkshire and Humber Assembly, launched on 22 October, will be at the heart of the implementation of the strategy, working with the region's local authorities, Yorkshire Forward and other stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para2">I am pleased that much of the format and content of RPG12, including the vision, objectives and core strategy, carries forward what was proposed in the original draft RPG prepared by the Regional Assembly. RPG12 reflects very effective working between the Assembly, local authorities and other stakeholders who have made valuable contributions to refine and enhance the original draft strategy. It builds on the new inclusive process for preparing RPG that the Government have put in place. Many of the comments received in response to the consultations carried out earlier this year were constructive suggestions and have been taken on board in finalising the guidance.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para3">The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly will now take the strategy forward and work with partners to ensure its effective implementation, monitoring and review.

<a name="11031w07.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Building Regulations</center></H4>

<P>
<a name="11031w07.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he will publish guidance on amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations, which deals with energy efficiency, to Part H of the Building Regulations, which deals with drainage and solid waste, and to Part J of the Building Regulations, which deals with combustion appliances; and if he will make a statement.  [12012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The 2002 editions of the Approved Documents which give guidance on ways of meeting the new requirements of Part L1, Conservation of fuel and power in dwellings, Part L2, Conservation of fuel and power in buildings other than dwellings, Part H, Drainage and waste disposal, and Part J, Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems, as introduced by the Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3335, were published today by The Stationery Office.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para4">The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3335 and the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) (Amendment) Regulations 2001, SI 2001/3336 were laid before the House on 11 October 2001. The Building (Amendment) Regulations 2001 made changes to the technical requirements with regard to Part L, Conservation of fuel and power, Part H, Drainage and waste disposal, and Part J, Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems in the Building Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2531. Both sets of Regulations also made some consequential administrative changes to both the Building Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2531 and to the Building (Approved Inspectors etc) Regulations 2000, SI 2000/2532. Both sets of Regulations will come into force on 1 April 2002.




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 682W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para5">Taken together, these new regulations and their supporting Approved Documents introduce a package of measures that will bring a number of environmental, safety and economic benefits.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para6">The review of Part L has been a noteworthy example of the good relations the Government wish to forge with industry and others with interests in our energy policy and the development of proportionate regulations. The performance standards in the new Approved Documents L1 and L2 are significantly higher than those introduced in 1995 and will set most builders and building services engineers something of a challenge. However the close contact with industry has ensured that the new standards can be achieved by adopting reasonable standards of design and construction practice. They will yield substantial benefits for the occupiers of new dwellings and other buildings through lower heating bills (up to 25 per cent. in the case of dwellings), lower air conditioning bills and/or improved comfort and productivity, and for the nation in the avoidance of carbon emissions. It is estimated that these measures will contribute 1.4 MtC in 2010 of the overall 23 per cent. cut in the UK's greenhouse gas emissions that we set out in our Climate Change Programme published last November, and of course those savings will continue to accumulate thereafter.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para7">On 5 March 2001 I announced the package of amendments that were to be made to Part L following consultation. As industry requested, the material has been split into two Approved Documents, L1 for dwellings and L2 for other buildings. The guidance in the new Approved Documents raises the performance standards for building insulation, introduces new ones for airtightness and solar shading, widens the standards for heating to include boiler performance, widens the lighting standards to include luminaires and display lights, and introduces new ones for air conditioning systems including their controls. To back these physical measures up there are new requirements for testing and commissioning that will help to make designers' intended performance capabilities a reality, and the provision of users' manuals and log books so that occupiers can obtain all of the potential benefits.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para8">To back up the guidance in these Approved Documents we have also published today "Limiting thermal bridging and air leakage: Robust construction details for dwellings and similar buildings". This document was prepared in collaboration with industry and provides construction details which are a way of showing compliance with the new standards for thermal insulation and airtightness.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para9">Part L now also addresses summer performance as well as insulation against winter cold and heating and hot water systems. There are new building fabric provisions aimed at limiting solar overheating, and new air conditioning and mechanical ventilation measures aiming to ensure that, when specified, they can perform efficiently.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para10">These new provisions are not restricted to new buildings. Around half of the carbon benefits mentioned will come from the application of the new requirements for work in existing buildings. For dwellings, we have introduced provisions that apply whenever new windows and glazed doors, boilers and hot water vessels are to be replaced. For buildings other than dwellings the same provisions apply for windows and all the building systems addressed by Part L, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting, are also included. These provisions are qualified 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 683W</I><P>
however, in that reasonable provision depends on the circumstances in the particular case. Sympathetic treatment of historic buildings is necessary for instance to enable conservation and restoration and new guidance in both the Approved Documents will help to establish what reasonable provision is in these special cases.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para11">The review of Part J has addressed the increasing risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, the ill-health effects of flue-gas entering living space, and the risks of injuries caused by fires, and also to address for the first time the oil pollution threat from domestic central heating oil storage systems.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para12">The outcome of investigations into possible additional risks posed by lower specification concrete flue liners was announced in November 2000. These investigations found no certain evidence of additional risk but made a series of recommendations. The amendments to Part J and the publication of the 2002 edition of Approved Document J complete our response to these. They incorporate a new requirement (J4) to fix permanent notices indicating hearth, fireplace and chimney performance limits, and the Approved Document gives examples of what are satisfactory provisions using the new European Method for specifying performance of all types of flue liners.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para13">A new requirement J5 makes provisions for reasonable steps to be taken to ensure that when external liquid fuel storage (oil and liquefied petroleum gas) systems are provided they are protected from fire in adjacent buildings or premises.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para14">The new requirement J6 makes provision for oil storage tanks and connecting pipework serving buildings used wholly or mainly as private dwellings to be constructed and protected to reduce the level of risk of oil escaping and causing pollution. This new requirement also makes provisions for notices which give information on how to respond to an oil escape to be fixed in a prominent position.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para15">The publication of a consultation on amendments to Part H of the Building Regulations was announced in July 2000. The outcome of that review is reflected in the amendments to Part H of the Building Regulations and in the 2002 edition of the Approved Document.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para16">The new requirement H4 applies when building work takes place over sewers. This has enabled the repeal of Section 18 (building over sewer etc) of the Building Act 1984. Provision of foul drainage is now required by the Regulations, and this has enabled the repeal of Section 21(1) and (2) of the Act. These changes bring necessary requirements all together into the Regulations, and should simplify matters for practitioners.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para17">The new requirement H2 includes the provision of a durable notice giving information on necessary continuing maintenance for septic tanks, wastewater treatment systems and cesspools. Lack of maintenance is one of the main causes of failure of septic tanks and other non-mains drainage systems, and this new requirement seeks to address this. There is also improved guidance on drainage fields from septic tanks.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para18">Guidance in the Approved Document includes guidance on the use of infiltration drainage systems and a presumption that this method of drainage is the preferred 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2001 : Column: 684W</I><P>
option for rainwater disposal rather than storm sewers. This will ease the load on storm sewers and may reduce the risk of flooding due to run off from new development.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para19">Guidance in the Approved Document recommends that drains serving more than 10 properties should have a minimum diameter of 150 mm. This should help to reduce the incidence of private sewers and drains.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para20">Copies of "Limiting thermal bridging and air leakage: Robust construction details for dwellings and similar buildings" have also been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="11031w07.html_para21">A Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations and it too was published today. It has also been placed on the DTLR website at (http://www.safety.dtlr.gov.uk/bregs/brpub/02.htm).

 The Starter Home Initiative assistance available for teachers is being targeted on the compulsory education sector where the most severe recruitment and retention problems for teachers, which the Initiative aims to help alleviate, are being experienced.
<P>

<a name="11031w08.html_para3">We recognise that other key workers, including teachers in further education, need to be able to find affordable homes within a reasonable distance of their workplace. Our wider housing policies to increase the supply of affordable homes, particularly in areas where demand is high, will benefit other groups of key workers. By 2003&#150;04 capital investment in housing will have risen to more than &#163;4 billion compared with planned spending of &#163;1.5 billion in 1997&#150;98.

<P>
<a name="11031w09.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Since 1999 we have provided support to the Independent Electoral Commission to develop and upgrade its electoral records database. In the run up to the presidential elections we provided consultancy support and various items of equipment in support of the voter re-registration exercise.
<P>

<a name="11031w09.html_para0">During the elections themselves we contributed to the costs of international observers to monitor the election process.

<a name="11031w09.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The support we have already provided to the Independent Electoral Commission prior to the presidential elections, particularly on voter re-registration, will also be relevant to the Parliamentary Assembly elections in 2002. We have not yet had discussions with the IEC about any additional requirements for the Assembly elections, but when we do so we will take into account possible support from other donors and experience in the presidential elections.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w09.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Over the past year our assistance to The Gambia has been concentrated on facilitating the electoral process, and on the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. The future of the programme will depend on our overall assessment of The Gambian Government's commitment to poverty reduction, democracy and human rights. We will review the programme early in 2002.

 We are financing a &#163;15.3 million HIV/AIDS prevention and care project in China, which aims over five years to help the Government of China develop an effective national response to HIV/AIDS. We are also working with the Government of China to design specific support for the delivery of HIV/AIDS education to young people, where funding is likely to be in the region of &#163;5 million over three years.
<P>

<a name="11031w09.html_para1">The Government of China recently launched their first five year action plan to contain, prevent and control HIV/AIDS. We are currently considering what further support we can offer the Government in helping them achieve this plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w09.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The needs of the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo are desperate. Some progress on the peace process and a gradual improvement in access for humanitarian agencies has enabled my Department substantially to increase the level of our support for humanitarian work through well-established non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="11031w09.html_para2">We have contributed funding towards direct humanitarian assistance particularly in the areas of health and nutrition, water and sanitation, prisoner protection, and assistance to refugees, child soldiers and other vulnerable groups. We have also funded human rights projects in the DRC and in the wider Great Lakes region. Since January 2001 we have committed &#163;5.5 million to the ICRC's emergency appeal.
<P>

<a name="11031w09.html_para3">The Government are also working to promote an end to the country's conflict and a secure and lasting peace. We are providing support to the peace process through the office of the Facilitator for the National Dialogue had peace-building projects, and we are actively exploring opportunities to support the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of combatants in the country.

In support of this strategy DFID will work to highlight the way more effective use of environmental resources can contribute to poverty reduction; and gaining wider international acceptance of the principles of strategic planning for sustainable development, which have already been agreed at ministerial level in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2001]:</i> The RDAs have taken on board Recommendation 17 of the DETR report on Strategy Development and Partnership Working in the RDAs. The principles for successful partnership working used in the original development of the Regional Economic Strategies are now reflected in the preparation of RDA Action Plans and the revision of their RESs. Under a new fund worth &#163;15 million over three years, the regional chambers have been awarded a total of &#163;5 million in 2000&#150;01 to enhance their RDA scrutiny role and thus strengthen regional accountability.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> Posts overseas have intense contacts with potential inward investors. Invest UK as the Government agency that promotes the whole of the UK as the best inward investment location in Europe is working in partnership with all UK Development Agencies to maximise the level of inward investment.
<P>

<a name="11031w11.html_para14">The Government are encouraging all Development Agencies to build on their strengths and on existing clusters in their regions to attract further inward investment. They are also increasingly collaborating with each other, on overseas promotional activities, to increase their attractiveness to investors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will provide an estimate of foreign direct investment for each region of the United Kingdom for each year since 1997, and the forecast for each region for 2001.  [10995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w11.html_spnew10"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The figures in the table are based on information provided by companies at the time of the announcement of the decision to invest in the UK. They are based on the companies' best estimate, at that time, of the number of jobs to be created/safeguarded by the investment in its first three years.
<P>

<a name="11031w11.html_para18">There is no requirement to notify inward investment decisions and so the figures include only those projects where Invest UK and its regional partners were involved or which have come to their notice.
<P>

<a name="11031w11.html_para19">Figures for 2001&#150;02 are still being collected and will be available in July 2002 when Invest UK announces its annual results.

 In conjunction with the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and the Consumers Association, we recently issued revised guidance, "Commercial Activities in Schools: Best Practice Principles". It revises and updates guidance produced by the National Consumers Council in 1996. Far from being a relaxation of criteria, the guidance makes it clear that schools should satisfy themselves that the educational benefits of the commercial activity outweigh the potential disadvantages; that explicit sales messages should be avoided wherever possible; and that the level of any branding should be appropriate to the activity.

<a name="11031w14.html_para3">Our education maintenance allowance (EMA) programme is having a positive effect on the lives of many young people. Around 100,000 young people have applied for an EMA to date in this academic year. Early evidence is encouraging: EMAs have produced a 5 percentage point increase in participation among the target group. Our EMA transport pilots and pilots for the homeless, teenage parents and people with disabilities are now in their second year of operation. Initial findings suggest that vulnerable young people are benefiting from EMAs.

We are also looking at proposals for an overarching award covering challenging goals in formal qualifications, but in which other achievements&#151;such as volunteering&#151;might also be recognised.

 The Secretary of State has made it clear to admission authorities that parents should not be pressurised into sending their child to school before he or she has reached compulsory school age. The code of practice on school admissions encourages admission authorities to allow parents to secure a school place but defer their child's entry to school until later on in the same academic year. Admissions policy is under review with proposed changes currently the subject of consultation. The Secretary of State is looking to strengthen the message in the code by making it clear that she expects all admission authorities to allow parents to defer entry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what consultation has been carried out with the parents of pupils in special schools on the policy of inclusion and the future of those schools; and what the results of that consultation were.  [10962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have consulted widely on their strategy to raise standards for pupils with special educational needs. Like others, parents, pupils and staff from special schools have contributed to the consultations on the Green Paper, "Excellence For All Children: Meeting Special Educational Needs" (October 1997), "Meeting Special Educational Needs: A Programme of Action" (November 1998) and the provisions of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (March 2000). The Government's proposals received broad support.
<P>

<a name="11031w15.html_para0">There is a continuing and vital role for special schools within an inclusive education system. Inclusion is not a drive to close special schools. Rather, the Government want all special schools to be outward-looking centres of excellence working hand in hand with each other and with mainstream schools. Special schools can act as a source of expertise, advice and professional development. When mainstream and special schools work together there are benefits for all.

 A draft special educational needs code of practice was laid before Parliament on 20 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w15.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The original target for the pilot phase of the Computers within Reach scheme was to supply up to 35,000 refurbished computers by March 2001 for those on certain benefits who were seeking to gain or retain employment. Due to problems associated with the sourcing of equipment and the logistics of delivery, the scheme was extended to 31 October 2001. This was to enable all individuals on waiting lists who had paid for a computer to receive one. Until figures from suppliers are collated I cannot give a final number for computers delivered through the scheme. However, it is anticipated that around 24,000 computers will have been delivered by the end of the pilot phase.

The Experience Corps was established specifically to support and mobilise older people to become active in their communities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> We are determined that people who have offended in the past should not be unfairly discriminated against. The Code of Practice issued under the Police Act 1997, following extensive consultation, emphasises the need for information to be used fairly, and for guidance issued or supported by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) to be observed. The Code also requires employers to have written policies in relation to the recruitment of ex-offenders. The CRB is working closely with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and with Nacro to develop guidance material for organisations that wish to use the CRB's service. Two publications have been issued so far. Both offer practical and policy recommendations on employing people with a criminal record. The Bureau will continue to work with these organisations and others on the creation of guidance materials. A publicity campaign aimed at offenders, ex-offenders, employers, volunteering groups and the public is currently being developed by the CRB, to help inform people about the disclosure service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Home Office-funded research into the premature wastage of special constables, completed last year, found that the primary reasons for leaving were often external to the service. However, the research identified some underlying management factors contributing to the decision to resign.
<P>

<a name="11031w16.html_para2">Recommendations aimed at reducing the wastage included making improvements to: the flexibility of duties and hours offered; the management structure within which specials operate; the quality of training provided locally; and to local efforts to monitor and prevent wastage.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received during the last 12 months on the impact of the price of goods manufactured by prisoners on similar products made by commercial businesses outside; and if he will make a statement.  [10144]<P>

<P>
<a name="11031w17.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Prison Service policy on pricing is that goods and services should be offered at a fair market price, which covers direct manufacturing cost plus a contribution to the recovery of overheads. Prison overheads are higher than outside because of high fixed costs, such as high ratios of costly supervision, a short working week and low productivity rates. Once a prison has recovered all variable costs and a contribution to the direct costs, its rates are in most cases no lower than those of comparable commercial ventures.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para0">The Prison Service has dealt with three cases during the last 12 months in which concerns were expressed about under-cutting by prisons. All three cases were fully investigated and it was found in each case that Prison Service policy had been adhered to.

 A number of professional sports bodies were involved in the discussions of the Football Working Group, which was chaired by former Home Office Minister, Lord Bassam of Brighton and which reported in March 2001. The working group report includes recommendations aimed at encouraging Premiership and Football League clubs to maximise and expand their community investment programmes, notably through developing partnerships with local communities, local authorities and businesses. The report highlights the social and public order benefits of encouraging, facilitating and funding young people to participate in grassroots football and other sports projects.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para1">In January 2001 senior Home Office officials met officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Department for Education and Skills (formerly Department for Education and Science) and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (formerly Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions) to discuss the contribution youth sport can make to crime reduction. Officials subsequently attended a seminar organised by the DCMS and featuring an American expert in this field. Further discussions took place in June and officials remain in touch with a view to identifying examples of effective schemes which can be recommended to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships.

<a name="11031w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 My Department receives large amounts of correspondence from hon. Members and members of the public. We aim to send a substantive reply to all letters as soon as possible. I am determined to achieve a high level of performance in dealing quickly with correspondence.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para5">We are working with our information technology partners to develop next summer a customer contact centre which will radically change the way we handle letters, e-mails and telephone inquiries. In the short term we are implementing a number of organisational and process changes to bring about improvements in the quality and timeliness of replies and to prepare for the contact centre.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para6">General information on the volumes of correspondence received across Whitehall and on overall performance is published by the Cabinet Office. Figures for 2000 were published on 6 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 324W, and on 19 July 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 454W.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para7">The Home Office also receives a high number of parliamentary questions each Session and takes its responsibilities for answering them seriously. This is reflected in the performance levels indicated in the tables, which are, in the main, within the recommended response times required by both Houses. The Home Office has, since 2000, had a performance indicator of answering 95 per cent. of parliamentary questions within target. In the most recent financial year for which figures are available&#151;2000/01&#151;the figure achieved was 94 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11031w17.html_para8">The tables show the number of written parliamentary questions answered by the Home Office in the House of Commons and the House of Lords respectively since 1995; the percentage of those questions which took more than a month to provide a substantive answer; the percentage of questions which took more than three months to provide a substantive answer; and the average response time in days from the point at which the question is due for answer (ie the date on which it appears in the order book). The figures for questions in the House of Commons have been broken down in terms of questions which were for ordinary written and named day answer respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> I will draw up the Code of Practice in consultation with communications service providers and the law enforcement and security and intelligence agencies. The general definition of communications is in Part I, Chapter II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The types of data within that category that will be covered by the code will be agreed in the course of consultation. That way we can be sure that both sides are clear about the types of data which are retained.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2001]:</i> I intend to make it clear that communications service providers may retain data for up to 12 months for law enforcement and national security purposes. I will then work with the telecommunications industry to develop a voluntary code of practice on retention of data.

<a name="11031w19.html_para2">In the latter part of the 1990s the chief constable civilianised a significant number of non-operational police posts, which accounts for the fall in police numbers from 1997 to 2000. At the end of August 2001 the force had 2,948 officers. Much of the recent increase reflects the success of the crime fighting fund.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2001]:</i> The figures provided by the acting chief constable of Sussex police in the answer of 22 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 68W, are full-time equivalent numbers for officers and civilian support staff except for the expected new recruits in the current year. The projection for new recruits (224) is actual officer numbers because predictions cannot be made on whether new recruits will be full or part-time officers.

 Political agreement was reached between 177 countries on the implementation of the Kyoto protocol at the resumed Sixth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn in July. This was a significant political achievement.
<P>

<a name="11031w20.html_para1">The Seventh Conference of the Parties is now taking place in Marrakesh (29 October-9 November). Our aim will be to complete the task of converting the Bonn agreement into detailed decisions. We should not underestimate the scale of this task, but I am optimistic agreement should be possible. It is vital that we maintain political momentum and the spirit of co-operation that was evident in Bonn. We hope that agreement in Marrakesh will pave the way for ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto protocol by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002.

 The UK's climate change programme, published in November 2000, sets out details of the policies and measures that the Government are introducing to meet the UK's target under the Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12 and to move towards our domestic goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. We estimate that these policies could reduce emissions by 23 per cent. by 2010. This is substantially beyond our Kyoto target.
<P>

<a name="11031w20.html_para2">The Government have been making progress with implementing the policies outlined in the programme. The UK's Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was published on 30 October, provides an update of this progress.

<P>
<a name="11031w20.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Major benefits are expected to flow from bringing together responsibilities for farming and food, environment and conservation and the rural affairs portfolio within one Department, although the benefits&#151;both policy and operational&#151;will be realised gradually. On foot and mouth disease, there was already close joint working between Departments, via the Cabinet Office co-ordination machinery and via the rural task force, which brought together both Departments involved and external stakeholders. The establishment of DEFRA has offered scope for further integration. Great efforts are being made to establish a new culture within the Department, with clear aims and objectives through a process in which stakeholders and staff at every level have been involved. We are also seeking to develop close partnerships as a way of working within the new Department, across Whitehall and with partners at a regional and local level throughout England as well as on the international stage. The new Department has created a post at Board level to bring together general weight of DEFRA field delivery as a whole.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2001]:</i> Regional development agencies have played a crucial role in responding to the needs of businesses affected by foot and mouth disease. I am grateful to them for their positive response to the challenges and the high degree of co-operation we have received from them in recent months. As with earlier tranches of money, it will be for the individual regional development agency to decide on the best way to allocate the Business Recovery Fund (BRF) in its region and to set the deadline for applications according to local circumstances. Regional development agencies must ensure that grants are consistent with the European Commission's state aids rules as well as the guidance issued by this Department.

<a name="11031w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The purpose of the review of flood and coastal defence funding arrangements was to ensure that funds were appropriately sourced and targeted, and delivered effectively and efficiently. Funding and institutional arrangements are inextricably linked. In addition to researching funding options and prioritisation, the review has gone on to consider whether current institutional arrangements were fit for purpose. The conclusions of the review are expected to be published later this autumn. The Government are satisfied that the outcome of this review, and other on-going reviews relating to flood management, will contribute substantially to ensuring a focused, integrated, efficient and effective service.

 The National Audit Office's March 2001 report on inland flood defences includes condition ratings for flood defences made by the Environment Agency. These data form part of the input for two recent research projects on the "National Appraisal of Assets at Risk from Flooding" which were commissioned by this Department; the most recent report of this research was published in September. It suggests that investment in capital and maintenance would need to be increased from current levels by between &#163;110 million and &#163;120 million a year to maintain current standards of defence, with a further &#163;30 million a year to improve to indicative standards.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2001]:</i> A veterinary risk assessment regarding the possible relaxation of the foot and mouth disease controls over hunting with dogs in England and Wales has been carried out by the State Veterinary Service and is currently being considered by Ministers. Hunting with dogs takes a variety of forms all of which pose different levels of risk, and therefore require different levels of risk management measures. The assessment will shortly be published on the DEFRA website http:/www.defra.gov.uk/ and copies will be made available in the Library of each House.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The veterinary risk assessment regarding the possible resumption of hunting with dogs is currently being considered by Ministers. It takes account of the varying degrees of risk in different parts of the country. Hunting with dogs takes a variety of forms all of which pose different levels of risk and therefore require different levels of risk management measures. In the context of the Government's clear commitment to do everything possible to prevent future outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, this needs careful consideration. We hope to be able to reach a decision and will publish the veterinary risk assessment on which our decisions will be based.

 Allocations for the environmental protection work performed by the Environment Agency are made on a national basis, and not by county. On flood defence, I have recently announced the allocations to flood and coastal defence operating authorities for 2002&#150;03. The capital allocation, on which we are prepared to pay grant, for the Environment Agency in Somerset is &#163;4.4 million (compared with &#163;2.5 million in 2001&#150;02). The rate of grant has been increased by 10 per cent. to 75 per cent.

<a name="11031w21.html_para1">The UK, like other EU member states and the European Commission, is a member of the International Coffee Organisation. At the 85th meeting of its governing body, the International Coffee Council, on 25&#150;28 September 2001, the Council resolved to establish a Quality Committee to facilitate measures for the withdrawal from the market of defective beans and those with a moisture content above a certain level. This will provide practical advice and support to a resolution by producers aimed at reducing the total amount of low-grade coffee beans on the world market. The beans would not be stockpiled but either destroyed or diverted to other purposes such as cosmetics, animal feed or fuel.

 We have considered the case for payment of optional agrimonetary compensation to the arable sector. While we acknowledge the difficulties that the sector is facing, we have decided not to draw down these funds given the many competing demands on the Exchequer at present, not least the cost of eradicating foot and mouth disease. The arable sector will, however, receive &#163;28 million in compulsory agrimonetary compensation this autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w22.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his policy is on the granting of requests for debt write-offs by national and local government and wholly- owned companies of the Government; how many such debt write-offs have been agreed since 1996&#150;97; and which Minister gave approval to such write-offs in each case.  [10926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Treasury expects all public bodies to have appropriate systems to manage their finances within the funds available and to take a prudent approach to the raising and financing of debt. While Treasury approval is generally required for write-offs, the final decision in individual cases rests with the relevant Secretary of State. The decision to remit lending will of course depend on the particular circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="11031w22.html_para5">Departments are responsible for accounting for all loans, including write-offs. In the case of loans from the National Loans Fund, primary legislation is required before any loan can be written off. In the case of lending financed by Departments, all other write-offs must be recorded in the accounts of the leading department and any remission of voted lending above &#163;20 million is reported to Parliament by way of a Treasury Minute.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what clarification was given on 24 November 2000 by DSS officials to representatives of the Association of British Civilian Internees Far East Region on the interpretation of which category of claimant could count as British in order to qualify for the ex gratia claims announced on 7 November 2000, following a meeting on 15 November between the DSS, the War Pensions Agency and other interested organisations.

<a name="11031w24.html_para1">Through the latter part of November 2000, DSS officials were talking to representatives of ex-service organisations on a daily basis.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para2">While there is no specific record of contact with the Association of British Civilian Internees Far East Region on 24 November 2000, the advice being given at that time was that to be eligible for the ex-gratia payment civilian claimants must have been British at the time of internment.

<a name="11031w24.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Highland district council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para3">Inspectors found that despite covering the largest geographical area of any council in the UK, the council was effective at promoting the take-up of benefit and provided access to advice on HB and CTB through a number of local outlets.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para4">Although benefit claims were processed on time, inspectors consider the council's claim form was poor and its approach to verification was inconsistent, resulting in serious implications for the security of the benefits gateway. The report notes the council intended to phase in the Verification Framework from April 2001 and also agreed to revise its claim form.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para5">Inspectors consider one of the underlying problems was the council's failure to manage benefits, particularly the lack of a senior manager with direct responsibility for HB and CTB. The report notes that addressing this failure is fundamental to facilitating improvements and successfully implementing BFI's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para6">Inspectors found limited counter-fraud activity, with no procedures in place with the procurator fiscal to effectively pursue prosecutions nor to offer administrative penalties. Insufficient staff were allocated to the counter-fraud team. Investigation work was in arrears and some investigations had not been fully completed. BFI considers one third of the council's Weekly Benefit Savings claims were incorrect.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para7">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter-fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="11031w24.html_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment framework is employed by the Child Support Agency to decide the level of a working non- resident parent's child maintenance contributions.  [7586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w25.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Currently, the amount of child maintenance a non-resident parent is required to pay is calculated in accordance with a formula set out in the Child Support Act 1991 and the Maintenance Assessment and Special Cases Regulations. The formula takes account of both parents' ability to maintain their children. Both parents' incomes and essential living expenses are considered and it can take up to 100 pieces of information to assess maintenance.
<P>

<a name="11031w25.html_para0">From April 2002, a much simpler maintenance calculation will be used, based on percentage rates of the non-resident parent's net income (15 per cent. for one child, 20 per cent. for two children and 25 per cent. for three or more children). The rates will be reduced for non-resident parents on low incomes, for those who share the care of qualifying children and for those with children (including stepchildren) in a second family.

<P>

<a name="11031w25.html_para1">Jury retiring rooms are used whenever a jury is considering a verdict. During this time jurors are not allowed to come into contact with anyone outside the retiring room and resource constraints mean it is not always possible to provide a separate dedicated smoking facility for each retiring room, although smokers are asked to consider the comfort of their fellow jurors while in the retiring rooms. The often stressful nature of deliberation means that it is neither feasible to introduce nor possible to enforce a ban in these rooms.

<P>

<a name="11031w26.html_para4">The chief inspector's report describes the work of the Inspectorate over the past year and reports some of its principal findings. Magistrates courts committees (MCCs) are seen to have made improvements in many areas. In particular, the co-operation between the courts, police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) at an operational level, has strengthened further. The progress made on the operation of the 'Narey' reforms aimed at reducing delay in the magistrates courts and the Government's pledge to reduce the time taken to deal with persistent young offenders are examples of the benefits of close working.
<P>

<a name="11031w26.html_para5">There have been advances made in the collection of performance information, and in the way it is represented to the MCC, but effective analysis of this information remains a weakness for a number of MCCs. This is in spite of the situation being highlighted in last year's report. MCCs are, however, demonstrating a better awareness of the need to provide the strategic direction and of leaving operational matters to their officers.

An extensive range of specific legislative measures is in place for tackling violence and disorder at football matches while general public order and other provisions are available for dealing with the much lower levels of disorder experienced at other sporting events. Legislation alone will not eradicate violence and hooliganism. That is why the Government are committed to monitoring implementation of the 55 recommendations contained in the Working Group on Football Disorder report, published in March, and to helping the relevant authorities take forward the recommendations on crowd management contained in the Cricket Disorder Review Group report, published in September.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what financial support is provided through <i>(a)</i> Sport England, <i>(b)</i> UK Sport and <i>(c)</i> other Government funding sources to develop football at the grassroots.  [10987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11031w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Football is the nation's most popular participation sport by far, and it is a priority for both the Government and Sport England to develop the sport at the grass roots. Sport England's funding for football has been channelled through the Football Foundation since July 2000. The Foundation received Lottery funding totalling &#163;7 million from Sport England in 2000&#150;01, and the majority of this went to funding the sport at the grass roots level. Children's and recreational football also benefits from substantial Sport England Lottery funding for multi-use capital projects, and the financial benefits to grass roots football cannot be quantified.
<P>

<a name="11031w28.html_para0">In addition, exchequer-funded grants from Sport England to the Football Association to fund work on grass roots development totalled &#163;165,000 in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;144,000 in 1999&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="11031w28.html_para1">The primary role of UK Sport is to support elite sportsmen and women by funding the development of training and competition facilities, and the provision of high quality coaching. UK Sport does not fund grass roots development initiatives in any sport.

 Decisions about recruitment of staff and equal opportunities are the responsibility of the BBC. I understand that the BBC has launched a number of managerial development schemes and training initiatives aimed at ensuring that 10 per cent. of BBC staff are from ethnic minorities by 2003.
