 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what estimate he has made of the <i> (a)</i> energy savings and <i> (b)</i> emissions reductions which would arise if (i) 60 per cent., (ii) 80 per cent. and (iii) 100 per cent. of UK households were thermally insulated. [242464]</p>

 As of April 2008, the remaining potential for insulation measures in Great Britain totalled 7.75 million wall cavities; 6.33 million lofts (where less than 100 mm of insulation is already present); and 6.3 million homes in need of solid wall insulation (excluding homes in conservation areas).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90119w0003.htm_para0"><a name="09011914000437">We project that, if all remaining measures were installed (with solid-wall insulation achieving a &#145;U&#146; value of 0.45 W/m2K), this would save 20.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) per year. In terms of energy savings (comprising gas, electricity and oil), this would represent 230.89 TWh per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90119w0003.htm_para1"><a name="09011914000438">The savings delivered from treating 80 per cent. and 60 per cent. of homes would depend on the combination of measures installed. The following table therefore provides the figures for savings from insulating cavities, lofts and solid walls separately for each of these percentage scenarios.</p>

 The waters around the British Antarctic Territory are wholly within the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). It is mandatory for all long-line fishing vessels to undertake measures to minimise seabird by-catch and to deploy an international scientific observer to monitor compliance with these requirements. In recent years, there has been no by-catch of seabirds in legal fisheries in these waters. There has thus been no need for the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) to work to reduce by-catch in these waters and it has instead focused its efforts on by-catch reduction in other parts of the oceans. In those areas the Parties to the Agreement have begun to work with regional fisheries management organisations to advance the use of mitigation technologies as well as to improve by-catch monitoring and have agreed a strategy to take this forward.</p>

While around 28,000 new customers claimed Jobseeker's Allowance in November across the region, over 34,000 new vacancies were notified to us and 21,700 customers moved off the register.</p>

We have had a magnificent response through our Local Employment Partnerships initiative with 3,120 employers now signed up to offering work opportunities for our most disadvantaged customers and newly redundant people, resulting in 6,417 jobs. We are also working closely with local employers and partners, for example, in the call centre, care and retail sectors to offer bespoke pre employment training to fill their significantly increased vacancies. We also offer a wide range of support for people facing redundancy. This includes helping support employers to retain their staff through retraining; and encouraging staff to gain vocational qualifications to prepare for the economic recovery rather than having to make staff redundant. We also support employers where they need to go into short time or temporary stop working and we are tailoring our advice to meet their needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90119w0012.htm_para3"><a name="09011914004762">Since 1998 progress has been made against all of the indicators. 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative low income between 1998-99 and 2006-07, a shift from 3.4 million children to 2.9 million children. The number of children living in absolute low income has halved from 3.4 million to 1.7 million. Between 2004-05, the first year data was available, and 2006-07 the number of children in the UK defined as poor using the combined indicator of relative low income and material deprivation fell by 200,000 from 2.2 million to 2.0 million on the particular material deprivation threshold that was chosen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90119w0012.htm_para4"><a name="09011914004763">Low income is not the only dimension to poverty and a child&#146;s quality of life, including access to health care, education and a safe environment, are critical. The three indicators are therefore underpinned by the broader Opportunity for all indicators. Opportunity for all is the Government&#146;s report on poverty and social exclusion which includes a wide range of poverty and social exclusion indicators for children and young people (as well as working age adults, older people and communities) including health, education and housing. Details can be found on the Opportunity for all website at:</p>

Despite the scale of the challenge the Government&#146;s commitment is stronger than ever. The Prime Minister&#146;s recent announcement of our intention to legislate on child poverty gives us renewed impetus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90119w0012.htm_para6"><a name="09011914004765">The Secretary of State meets regularly with Cabinet colleagues and others on the issue of child poverty. The Child Poverty Unit was established at the end of 2007 to put a sharper focus on cross-Government working to develop a truly integrated approach to tackling child poverty. The Government are committed to working with stakeholders to develop a strategy and move forward with legislation.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 January 2009]:</i> The provision of air services is subject to general UK competition law.

 The purpose of the charge at the Dartford crossing is to tackle congestion. The local discount areas of Dartford and Thurrock were established following a consultation process, and were the maximum that could be justified to enable us to maintain a kerb on increasing levels of traffic using the crossing. But we said that we would keep the local discount scheme under review. The scheme has been in operation for only two months and it is too early yet to review either its operation or eligibility.</p>

 Application of the working time directive, by setting a 48-hour maximum to the working week, would be likely to greatly reduce the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full-time for their primary employer. The UK Government therefore places great importance on retaining its opt-out from the directive, a position that was acknowledged by the European Union Council of Ministers in June when it agreed in the Common Position that it should be retained, and will continue to defend it.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 12 January 2009]:</i> Sport England invested &#163;2 million in the Cricket Foundation's &#145;Chance to Shine&#146; programme between November 2005 and March 2007. The formation of the National Sports Foundation led to an agreement that &#145;Chance to Shine&#146; would receive investment of &#163;2.5 million for the 2007-08 financial year. The National Sports Foundation has now been wound-down and its funds integrated with the new Whole Sport Plans. As a result &#145;Chance to Shine&#146; will be funded through the ECB's Whole Sport Plan. The details of this plan, like the plans of all national governing bodies, are still under discussion and will be finalised in due course.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) began its programme of bilateral support to Helmand in 2006, committing  to spend &#163;30 million in the province from 2006-07 to 2008-09. DFID spent &#163;23.7 million from 2006-07 to 2007-08, and will spend around &#163;23 million in 2008-09, meaning a spend of around &#163;46 million over the three-year period. Itemised details of spend are listed.

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90119w0024.htm_para5"><a name="09011930000698">The primary channel for DFID support is the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP). The programme is implemented by the government of Afghanistan (both the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Ministry for Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock). &#163;14.8 million has so far been disbursed through this programme in 2006-08. The government of Afghanistan is responsible for the allocation of funds to, and evaluation of, the hundreds of individual projects under HARDP. Once complete, each phase of HARDP is subjected to a formal DFID Project Completion Report. An independent review published in September 2008 concluded that the programme's accomplishments had been significant.</p>

 The UK Government generally do not consider the Government of Zimbabwe to be a credible development or humanitarian partner and we do not receive systematic reports on visa and other issues related to humanitarian work.

As part of this, any obstructive behaviour by the Government of Zimbabwe will be raised with them directly through UN channels.</p>

 The Government are committed to improving safeguards for children and has taken a range of actions over the past year. This includes making significant progress towards the implementation of the new vetting and barring scheme, which will further strengthen the system for preventing unsuitable adults from working with children, including in schools. In October 2008 Sir Roger Singleton, chair of the Independent Safeguarding Authority, was asked to lead a review of safeguarding arrangements in independent school, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools. The review will examine the practical operation of the current statutory and non-statutory safeguarding arrangements that apply to independent schools, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools in the maintained, non-maintained and independent sectors in England. Sir Roger expects to conclude his work in February 2009.</p>

 The Department has benefited enormously from the positive working relationship with the 23 regional pathfinders. They were particularly influential in helping to develop, test and refine the guidance we issued to local authorities in December 2007 on the requirement to develop and agree a Primary Strategy for Change. Most pathfinders have confirmed that they remain on track to complete their projects by the end of September 2009. They have also been very helpful in terms of developing and sharing good practice both nationally and regionally: the primary capital programme area of the teachernet website currently includes a range of good practice examples and case studies developed by the pathfinders. Further materials will be added over the coming weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90119w0034.htm_para0"><a name="09011942000434">Going forward, we will continue to work closely with pathfinders to ensure that the lessons learned in terms of design quality, sustainability and impact on outcomes informs the future development and roll out of the programme nationally.</p>

 Ofsted published &#147;Sustaining improvement: the journey from special measures&#148; in June 2008.

 The co-location of services is a useful way of providing a single point of access for children, young people and families, and a more effective and efficient way of professionals working together. While many areas are working hard to co-locate services and achieve the benefits this can bring, feedback suggests there are some barriers that are preventing services from co-locating as a matter of course. In response to this, we announced in the Children&#146;s Plan: One Year On progress report that we will be setting up a dedicated &#163;200 million fund to support co-location of services. This fund will run from April 2009 and will assist local areas to move ahead rapidly on capital investment projects where the co-location of services will help join up work between professionals and promote better outcomes for children and young people.</p>

This programme of reform includes a set of measures to raise the level of skills and competencies of the workforce and provide a common platform of skills and training that rationalises and improves the existing arrangements for all staff including professionals and support workers.

One of the aims of the initiative will be to improve transparency in the mining sector by, for example, linking to implementation of the extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI) in the province. However, the initiative will not directly address the award of new mining contracts in DRC. The initiative is currently in the planning phase and we expect to begin implementation later this year. We understand the World Bank may include strengthening national government capacity to negotiate mining contracts as part of their planned mining sector reform programme.</p>

 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts overseas derive income from visa fees and consular services, and incur expenditure in running costs, programme and capital expenditure. The figures in the table represent the net running costs of missions calculated by deducting income from expenditure figures. Fluctuations in the figures from one year to another can result from changes in income from visa fees as well as increases or decreases in post expenditure. Increased expenditure in Ottawa in 2004-05 is attributed to higher than usual Programme Expenditure of &#163;4.6 million in that year.</p>

 We are deeply concerned by the recent reports of attacks against Christians in Orissa. There can be no justification for such violent attacks against innocent people. On 1 October 2008, my noble Friend the Minister of State for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown raised the matter with the Indian High Commissioner. On 17 October, he also discussed our concerns with Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of External Affairs, and Mohammed Quereshi, chairman of the Minorities Commission in New Delhi. We understand that the Indian government fully recognises the seriousness of these incidents and is engaged with the Orissa State authorities in restoring law and order to that region.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 January 2009]:</i> The investigation into Major-General Alavi&#146;s death is a matter for the Pakistani authorities. We do not normally interfere in another country&#146;s judicial proceedings, unless under special circumstances that country asks for our assistance. We do not normally have any consular involvement in cases concerning dual-nationals in their other country of nationality, except in cases where we judge there is a special humanitarian reason to do so, for example, cases involving minors, forced marriage or a conviction involving the death penalty, but even then only where the state of other nationality agrees.

 The Identity and Passport Service (IPS), a Home Office Agency, has the lead on the policy on who does or does not get a British passport. As long as the EPS have been notified of a fugitive from justice, there are specific procedures in place to ensure any such applicant for a British passport is properly scrutinised and relevant UK authorities are consulted on the decision to issue or not.

 In the White Paper &#147;Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths - delivering the future&#148;, the Government stated that they consider that chief pharmacists of provider organisations, primary care trusts (PCTs) and other commissioners should have the lead role in ensuring that safe medication practices are embedded in patient care. To support this, and at the request of the Department, the National Patient Safety Agency hosted an event for senior pharmacists. This took place in London on 15 October 2008. The primary outcomes from the event were agreement by senior pharmacists to take on this role and the establishment of a virtual medicines safety forum where best practice can be shared. The White Paper also announced the appointment of two National Clinical Directors in pharmacy. Now in post, the National Clinical Directors will champion safe use of medicines as part of supporting the implementation of the pharmacy White Paper.</p>

be provided. Guidance to care providers, entitled &#147;The handling of medicines in social care&#148; is published by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB). This includes guidance about obtaining prescribed medicines in general; it is not specific to controlled drugs. It also includes general information about the use of controlled drugs in care services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="90119w0047.htm_para3"><a name="0901204000411">Regulation 13 of the Care Homes Regulations 2001 requires registered providers to make arrangements for the recording, handling and, safe keeping, safe administration and disposal of medicines received into the care home. This applies to all medicines, including controlled drugs. The National Minimum Standards (NMS) contain detailed requirements, governing the protection of service users, the safe receipt, administration, recording, storage and disposal of medicines in the home. Controlled drugs are specifically referred to in the NMS, which also refer providers to the RPSGB Guidance, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations 1973 and other relevant legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="90119w0047.htm_para4"><a name="0901204000412">The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) does not provide specific guidance to care providers about repeat prescriptions for controlled drugs. During regulatory inspections, CSCI looks for a robust procedure within a care home to request repeat prescriptions residents, irrespective of whether they are for controlled drugs. Failure to obtain prescribed medicines, or occasions when a care service orders more prescriptions than a person needs&#151;for example when the medicines are prescribed for use as and when needed it would be identified to the registered provider/manager and included in the inspection report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="90119w0047.htm_para5"><a name="0901204000413">CSCI&#146;s most recent guidance on reports about serious incidents in care homes includes a requirement to report every error involving a controlled drug. However, these are identified to individual services and are not collated nationally. CSCI pharmacist inspectors look at the handling of controlled drugs in the services they visit. CSCI recently carried out an analysis of its findings between April and December 2008; overdose was not an issue identified as a problem area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="90119w0047.htm_para6"><a name="0901204000414">If a serious incident is reported to CSCI under regulation 37 of the Care Homes Regulations, which governs notification of death, illness and other events in care homes, it is followed up by the Regulation Inspector/Regulation Manager associated with that service. Depending on circumstances, they may refer the issue to the pharmacist inspector. It is one of CSCI&#146;s referral criteria to contact a pharmacist inspector and this may result in inspection of the care home and a resulting report with requirements and recommendations. If the overdose is a result of an incorrect prescription from the general practitioner,  the pharmacist inspector will liaise via the Local  Intelligence Network through the NHS Accountable Officer at the relevant primary acre trust, who will deal with the issue.</p>

 My officials are in regular contact with organisations representing businesses to discuss business crime issues.

Key members of these groups include organisations representing business (such as the British Retail Consortium, Federation of Small Businesses, and the Association of Convenience Stores) as well as businesses directly affected by these problems. We also regularly discuss fraud issues with APACS (the UK Payments Association) whose members may bear the financial loss caused by cheque and card fraud.

The sole 0845 number to the Passport Adviceline was replaced at the same time with a 0300 number. There is however a transition period that is currently halfway through and both numbers will be accessible until 31 August 2009. The revenue arising from the previous 0870 IPS arrangements was approximately &#163;300,000 per year and was used to offset the cost of providing the service to callers.</p>

Following this, taking a DNA sample in the custody suite has become routine procedure. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>

 The enforcement of any speed limit is an operational matter for the police, and the Department has not issued guidance in this area. We would however expect 20 mph zones to be largely self-enforcing through traffic calming measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_545"><a name="90119w0055.htm_para6"><a name="0901206001300">The decision to introduce a 20 mph zone and the installation of traffic calming measures are matters for individual local authorities. The Department for Transport issues guidance to local authorities on the factors to take into account in reaching such decisions, including the need to consult with the police and other interested parties.</p>
