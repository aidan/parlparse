<a name="91202w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many targets have been agreed between his Department and (i) local authorities and (ii) other bodies apart from his own agencies and non-departmental bodies since May 1997.  [99475]<P>

<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> The Department's Public Service Agreement (PSA) sets out the Department's own targets in respect of local government. Details of any targets agreed with local government are not held centrally, although the Secretary of State will specify performance indicators and targets covering the broad range of local government functions under the best value provisions set out in Part I of the Local Government Act 1999. These indicators and targets will be introduced by Order by the end of 1999, and will apply from April 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what information has been provided for local residents on the proposed reduction in rail services between Nunhead and Victoria.  [99586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The changes which will affect Victoria to Nunhead services from the start of the new year are currently shown in the timetable information available at stations, as these form part of the winter 1999-2000 timetable which came into effect on 26 September 1999. Since that timetable was agreed, Connex have reinstated the two trains per hour to Victoria, and will provide an hourly service from Victoria.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many <i>(a)</i> drivers, <i>(b)</i> riders, <i>(c)</i> passengers and <i>(d)</i> others have been killed in crashes where one or more driver or rider has exceeded the legal alcohol limit in each of the past five years, for (i) urban and (ii) rural areas; what the average figures were for 1981 to 1985; and if he will make a statement.  [100041]<P>

<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The numbers of fatalities in road accidents where one or more driver or rider was over the legal alcohol limit are not available for urban and rural areas; however, estimates can be made by the speed limit of the road on which the accident occurred. The estimates in the table, shown rounded to the nearest 10, are for built-up roads with a speed limit of 40 mph or less and for non-built-up roads with a speed limit of more than 40 mph, for the last five years for which figures are available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will describe the nature of the unacceptable effects on the environment which he would consider sufficient to prevent commercial exploitation of GM crops.  [99907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Before any release of a GMO can take place, the regulatory authority must ensure that all appropriate measures are taken to avoid any adverse effects on human health and the environment which might arise. Assessment of adverse effects is carried out on a case-by-case basis, looking at such things as gene transfer to wild relatives, toxicity of gene products, allergenicity, 



<P>
<P><I>2 Dec 1999 : Column: 274W</I><P>
invasiveness and persistence of the plant as a weed, etc. The statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) has been set up to advise ministers on these issues and has published the guidance note "The Regulation and Control of the Deliberate Release of Genetically Modified Organisms" on the risk assessment procedure.
<P>

<a name="91202w01.html_para0">In the case of the farm-scale evaluations of GM oil seed rape and fodder maize currently underway, ACRE has already advised on the risks to the environment of the GM plants themselves. In addition, the independent scientific steering committee will also be able to advise Government on the significance, and therefore the acceptability, of any impacts on farmland wildlife associated with the

<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Many alternative road fuels have the potential to offer significant environmental benefits, and the Government are keen to encourage their wider use wherever it is cost-effective to do so. Bio-diesel has the potential to offer reduced CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions compared with ordinary diesel. We will continue to keep under review bio-diesel's potential for cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from road transport.

<UL>(2) what plans he has to amend planning guidance for telecommunications permitted development in order to allow planning authorities to apply a precautionary principle in sensitive areas until the full non-thermal health effects of mobile phone radiation have been established.  [100267]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government are aware of public concern about mobile phone systems and health and have set up an independent expert group to advise on possible risks to public health. The group, chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE, is currently holding open meetings around the UK to take views.
<P>

<a name="91202w01.html_para2">My Department issued for consultation the draft of a joint circular with the Department of Health on land use planning and electro-magnetic fields (EMFs). The draft circular provides advice to local planning authorities in deciding applications for development giving rise to EMFs, such as telecommunications base stations.

<P>
<a name="91202w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Department's Circular 4/99, "Planning for Telecommunications", makes clear the Government's expectation that developers should provide the local planning authority (LPA) with clear evidence that they have fully considered the use of existing masts, buildings and other structures before seeking to erect any new mast. If this evidence is not considered satisfactory, the LPA may be justified in refusing approval of the mast's siting. The information on shared masts is not available in the form requested. However, the mobile operators have told us that one third of existing masts owned by them are shared.

In their strategies, RDAs have also developed, or have given a commitment to develop, further indicators which address the specific features of their region. These will include indicators covering some key social issues.

At present, SPAD incidents are reported by the seven regional Railtrack zones and are not broken down into train operating companies. The Health and Safety Executive's 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 annual reports on railway safety contain details of SPADs listed by Railtrack zone. Copies are available in the House Libraries.

<P>

<a name="91202w02.html_para1">The application will be considered on its merits in the light of relevant policies. These include, on the one hand, our policy of encouraging the movement of freight by rail rather than road where appropriate and, on the other, the restrictive planning policies that apply to development in the Green Belt. These issues and any others raised by interested parties will be carefully considered by the Secretary of State in deciding whether or not to make the Order.

<P>
<a name="91202w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Regulation (EC) No 1655/99 of 19 July 1999, which amended the 1995 trans-European network (TEN) financing Regulation (2236/95), established a financial framework of euro 4,600 million (about &#163;2,890 million at current exchange rates) for TENs in the fields of transport, telecommunications and energy for the period 2000-2006. The financial framework for the period 1995-1999 was 2,345 million ECU. Any member state, or body within a member state, is entitled to bid for TEN funds to support a project of common interest. The decision to grant aid to a project rests with the Commission, with assistance from a Committee of representatives of member states for each TEN sector. There is no provision for sharing out the budget between the member states.

<P>
<a name="91202w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The transport trans-European network (TEN) guidelines (Decision No. 1692/96/EC) required the Commission, before 1 July 1999, to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council indicating whether the guidelines should be adapted. The production of that report has been delayed and its publication is not now anticipated before Easter 2000. The Commission has indicated that, should the report suggest that the guidelines do need to be adapted, it expects to come forward with formal proposals before the end of 2000.

 Bids for funds from the 2000 transport trans-European network (TEN) budget must be with the Commission by 10 January 2000. Our officials have received a number of proposals and are currently considering which of these should be submitted to the Commission. Ministers will make a decision on the bids later this year. At this stage, it is possible to confirm only that we will submit bids for support for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and for the West Coast Main Line modernisation, as we indicated in our 1998 White Paper on the Future of Transport (Cm 3950).

 Improving local authority financial accounting is an important part of our agenda to modernise local government.

Today I have published a consultation paper asking for views on the details of how this could be done. Removing rent rebates from the HRA will make councils housing finances simpler and more transparent. It will be easier for local residents to see how money is being spent, increasing openness and accountability. Copies of the new consultation paper have been placed in the Library of the House.

It is expected that this extended testing will lead to the

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 assumes that all experiments cause stress to the animals involved and it is therefore normal practice to humanely kill the animals at the end of the experiment.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces, when Under-Secretary of State for Defence, reviewed the matter of a medal for those who served in the Canal Zone between 1951 and 1954 last year. He concluded that he could find no grounds for reopening the case to award a medal for service in the Canal Zone between 1951 and 1954. He saw no new evidence that he believed would enable him to persuade the Committee on the Grant of Honours Decorations and Medals to overturn their policy of non-retrospection, or revoke any of the decisions made at the time or following the various reviews since 1990.

 <i>[holding answer 25 November 1999]:</i> The Medical Research Council (MRC) has invited a number of research proposals on the potential therapeutic uses of cannabinoids. A funding decision is expected in December on a clinical trial concerning the therapeutic uses of cannabinoids/cannabis in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Two further trials of its use in post-operative pain will be considered next year.

<P>
<a name="91202w05.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 No estimate has been made, and I do not have the commercial information available to enable me to make one. However, it is Government policy to limit the number of masts where possible through mast sharing. The Telecommunications Act 1984 licences of the mobile network operators therefore require that before they erect a new mast they investigate the possibility of using an existing mast belonging to themselves or another licensee; of replacing an existing mast belonging to themselves or another licensee with a mast for joint use; and of erecting, in co-operation with any other telecommunications operator, a mast for their joint use. This is reinforced by the Government's planning policy, which is to encourage mast and site sharing where appropriate.

<P>
<a name="91202w05.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The purpose of the revaluation of non-domestic properties on 1 April 2000 is solely to update rateable values in line with changes in the property market since the previous revaluation in 1995 and to ensure they accurately reflect the relative rental value of properties. Although the total rateable value for England will increase--reflecting the improved state of the economy since the 1995 revaluation--the National Rate Multiplier will be reduced for the first time since it was introduced in 1990. Overall, the total amount collected in rates will be broadly the same in real terms as in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="91202w05.html_para9">A consultation exercise was undertaken on the need to introduce transitional arrangements to mitigate the impact of the 2000 revaluation of the rates bills of individual businesses. In their responses to the consultation paper--which included a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment--the vast majority of businesses supported the need, under the present arrangements, for a transitional relief scheme. The scheme announced on 25 November will place tight limits on the amounts that individual bills can rise as a result of the revaluation.

 The Department has set out the key performance targets on which it will be judged in its PSA, and the measures of success it will use in the Output and Performance Analysis (OPA) published in March this year.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para1">In addition, the Secretary of State sets annual targets for the Department's agencies. These targets are announced to Parliament by means of a written parliamentary answer. A full list of the targets and target dates for the Department's agencies can be found in the Next Steps Report and in individual agency Business Plans. Performance against targets is also reported in agencies' Annual Reports. Copies of these documents can be found in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para2">These high level targets are supported at operational level by numerous other internal targets in order to ensure delivery by individual units.

<a name="91202w07.html_para3">A National Insurance benefit task force was set up to assist people who experience difficulties or who have queries about the problems arising from NIRS2.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para4">As at 31 October 1999 we have paid &#163;2.113 million in compensation for NIRS2 delays to benefit recipients. Of this &#163;1.986 million relates to the flat-rate &#163;10 compensation payments and &#163;0.127 million to payments made under the normal rules of the Department's Special Payments Scheme. It is not possible at this time to estimate how much more compensation will be paid because of NIRS2 delays.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para5">The Department operates a long-standing non-statutory compensation scheme, the terms of which have been agreed by the Parliamentary Ombudsman and his predecessors. Under the terms of the scheme compensation is calculated using the "Retail Shares and Deposit Average Rate" provided by the Building Societies Commission. Compensation may be provided for any period of delay beyond normal processing time (referred to as the "indicator of delay") for the benefit concerned. The rate currently in use is 3.872 per cent. Where a person would be due more than &#163;10 under the terms of that scheme he or she is paid the balance in addition to the &#163;10 outlined above.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para6">As at 1 November 1999 the Inland Revenue estimate the cost of additional payments to Pension Providers, in respect of individual scheme members, for the delay in the payment of Age Related Rebates, was &#163;36.2 million.

<a name="91202w07.html_para7">Up to the time that NIRS2 began providing Retirement Pension calculations on 6 January 1999, it was estimated that 285,000 pensioners had been affected by NIRS2 problems. Of these there remain about 40,000 cases to be reviewed. Not all of these will be in receipt of an incorrect amount of benefit.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para8">Since 6 January NIRS2 has not been able to provide the amount of additional pension (SERPS) in about 10 per cent. of the cases in which it is known SERPS entitlement exists. For these estimated 60,000 claims a year the Benefits Agency is carrying out clerical calculations, with a view to ensuring that all new pensioners are receiving their full entitlement by the date of their retirement. In total, therefore, the maximum estimated number of new pensioners affected by NIRS2 problems to the end of 1999 will be 345,000.
<P>

<a name="91202w07.html_para9">Information about the full amount of Retirement Pension which has been underpaid because of the delayed implementation of the NIRS2 computer, and the compensation payable, will not be available until recovery action is complete.

 When the Family Credit scheme was introduced in 1988, provision was made to replace the value of entitlement to free school meals (and free milk/vitamins for the under-fives). This was done by adding &#163;2.55 a week to each child credit. The total child credit has since been uprated annually by the Rossi index.

 The differing professional representation on primary care groups and local health groups reflects the differing roles of and expectations which we and the Welsh Assembly have of the two organisations.

 The Commission Directive 99/83 EC, adopted in September 1999, amends the Annexe to Directive 75/318 EC. This new Directive provides additional guidance on the data required to meet efficacy and safety requirements where a company seeking marketing authorisation wishes to use bibliographical data for the purposes of establishing that the product has a well established use. We will shortly be bringing forward an amendment to the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulations 1994 to incorporate the change into United Kingdom legislation.

<P>

 We know of no research on the role of paramedics involved in conveying people to hospital under the Mental Health Act. It is for individual chief constables to consider their forces' training needs in specific areas of work. National police training includes some formal training on mental illness, supplemented by practical role play exercises, during the course of the fifteen-week residential phase of the probationer training programme undertaken by all recruits to police forces other than the Metropolitan Police (which has its own training programme, including training on mental illness).

 The Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice encourages the development of local protocols by all the agencies involved in the operation of section 136 of the Mental Health Act. This section gives the police power to remove to a place of safety mentally disordered people found in a place to which the public have access and who are considered to be in immediate need of care or control. I understand that, in accordance with the Code of Practice, the Metropolitan Police and the London Ambulance Service are currently discussing a draft procedure to be followed on the transport to hospital of people who have been arrested under s136 of the Act. Once finalised, this will supplement existing guidance on admitting mentally ill patients to hospital and I would expect that both authorities would be willing to make it available to other organisations with an interest in these matters.

 As with all medicines the safety of Prozac is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The possible association of suicidal thoughts and hostile behaviour with Prozac was reviewed by the MCA and CSM in 1990. The available evidence did not suggest an increased risk with Prozac.
<P>

<a name="91202w10.html_para1">It is well known that suicidal ideation is associated with depression. Features of depression, including suicidal behaviour, can worsen after introduction of any anti- depressant prior to its beneficial effects being apparent and therefore reports of suicide attempts associated with Prozac are not unexpected. The Summary of Product Characteristics for Prozac warns that the possibility of a suicide attempt may persist until significant remission of depression occurs.

 Specialist schools submit annual reports about progress against their targets and we monitor their examination performance compared with the performance of all other schools.

Research projects about the effectiveness of the specialist schools programme carried out by the London School of Economics and Leeds University will be reporting soon and will be published in the new year.

 Since KFOR's deployment in Kosovo on 12 June 1999 and mid-November, there have been 137 abductions reported, including 43 Serbs and 77 Albanians. No figures are available for other minorities abducted nor for the number rescued.

<P>
<a name="91202w14.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The European Employment Pact recognises the importance of improving the incentives for people to work and ensuring that employment policies are sustainable. An appropriate incentive structure is one that reduces the burdens of tax on low-paid workers and ensures that they are better off in work than on benefits. The Government have implemented a number of reform measures to put this into place. The Working Families Tax Credit, reforms to National Insurance Contributions, the new 10p rate of income tax and the cut in the basic rate to 22p all reduce the burden of tax on labour, and help to ensure work pays for everyone. A long-term approach to fiscal sustainability must include a strategy to cope with demographic change, including population aging. To this end, member states--the UK included--have an interest in pursuing fiscal and budgetary policies which respect the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.

 Section 24 of the Presidency Conclusions from the Cologne European Council relates to a proposal enabling member states to introduce a lower VAT rate on labour-intensive services for a three-year trial period beginning in January 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w14.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The maintenance of "appropriate wage development", in the context of section 20 of the Cologne European Council conclusions is an essential factor in achieving macro-economic stability, in particular in keeping control of inflation. As section 20 makes clear, this is particularly imperative for the Euro 11 (the group of countries adopting the Euro in the first wave). The Cologne Conclusions do not bind the Government to specific policy measures on wage developments; however, the Government believe it is important that wage developments across all sectors reflect productivity and labour market conditions and accord with the aim of maintaining low inflation and a stable macro-economic climate.

The estimated cost of providing free television licences to all such households is approximately &#163;290 million a year at current licence fee levels. Costs in future years would depend on the number of households consisting solely of pensioners below the age of 75 and the level of the television licence fee, which is not fixed for the next 10 years.

 <i>[holding answer 29 November 1999]:</i> Detailed figures are not available, since records do not distinguish between beneficiaries who have attained the age of 75 and those who have not. However, it is estimated that approximately 500,000 households currently in receipt of a concessionary television licence include a person aged 75 or over.

 Over three million households include a member aged 75 or over and will therefore benefit from the free television licences announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We hope to announce details of the scheme, including the starting date, shortly. An estimated three million households consist only of people of state pensionable age but below the age of 75, of which approximately 100,000 qualify for the existing &#163;5 concessionary television licence.

Ms Page explained that it was unlikely that the proposals would be taken forward in the precise format outlined, but that they would be fed into the creative process by those in the company with day-to-day editorial control of the relevant zones. Ms Page said that she was interested in exploring the future of books as part of the focus on literacy in the Learning zone and also the function of books as a tool to help us expand our minds in the Mind zone. She said that she would welcome any further views the National Book Committee might have on these issues and asked that they be addressed to the named zone editor who would coordinate NMEC's response.

 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1999]:</i> Information provided by the organic sector bodies shows that the additional funding will be sufficient to provide for all farmers in England who had applied to them for registration by 4 October when the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) was suspended. Registration with an organic sector body is a condition of entry to the OFS. A number of farmers who applied for registration after 4 October will also have been able to submit applications for aid.

<a name="91202w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 For species such as pigs, where animals produced in the UK are subject to higher statutory welfare standards, we have been encouraging retailers, caterers and public procurement authorities to source their supplies to British standards. These high welfare standards offer the domestic pig industry a strong marketing advantage. This is recognised by the Meat and Livestock Commission, the body responsible for promoting meat and meat products, which has made welfare an important part of its British Quality Standard for pigmeat scheme.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of vessels from the Republic of Ireland fishing in area VIIa and South West of the Isle of Man, what (i) surveillance and (ii) boardings have been carried out in the last 12 months; what conservation measures must they comply with; to what extent they are obliged to comply with conservation measures introduced by the UK; how many vessels from the Republic of Ireland have licences to fish these waters; and how these licences were acquired.  [100729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 From January to November 1999, the total number of Republic of Ireland (ROI) vessels sighted in Area Vlla (which includes the water South West of the Isle of Man) was 87. Five boardings were made. These vessels must comply with the relevant EU Technical conservation measures for the area, including, for example, minimum landing sizes. They are not obliged to comply with additional conservation requirements laid down in our domestic legislation. Details of the number of ROI vessels licensed to fish in Area Vlla and the terms on which these licenses were granted are held by the authorities in Dublin.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress has been made by the Environment Agency in respect of its action plan following the Easter 1997 floods and the subsequent report of Sir Peter Bye.  [100784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency produced an Action Plan for implementing the recommendations in the Independent Report on the Easter 1998 Floods, chaired by Sir Peter Bye.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para0">The Chairman of the Environment Agency has provided me with a report of progress up to the end of September 1999. Copies have been placed in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para1">I am pleased to note that the Agency remains on course for completing the substantial work programme set out in the Action Plan to the agreed timetable.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para2">Key developments since the Agency's last report, which covered the period to end of June 1999, are as follows.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para3">Indicative flood plain maps for all watercourses with a catchment greater than 10 square kilometres in England and Wales have been delivered to over 450 local authorities.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para4">Pilot work on flood warning awareness has been analysed and brought together to form the basis of the 1999 public awareness campaign which commenced on 18 October and to which I was pleased to lend my support. The first phase of the campaign focused on raising awareness of flood risk and self help measures to reduce flood damage. Future elements will repeat and reinforce these basic messages and introduce new and additional information to improve public understanding.

<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para5">The head of the Agency's National Flood Warning Centre has been recruited and the programme is in place for the centre to be operational by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para6">The results of a review of the Agency's internal management have been translated into a project plan which will see the core flood defence roles and responsibilities harmonised across the Agency by the end of December 1999, with full implementation by April 2000.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para7">Work continues in other important areas such as the project to implement the operational changes to the colour coded flood warning messages by September 2000.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para8">The Agency continues to work with local authorities in inspecting and recording the condition of all flood defences. Details of defences owned and/or operated by the Agency and local authorities are being collated. However, one area of uncertainty is the inspection of flood defences owned and/or operated by third parties. The question of how to identify such defences, and the scale of the inspection exercise that will be required, is currently being considered by the Agency in partnership with other operating authorities.
<P>

<a name="91202w18.html_para9">The Agency continues to make good progress in implementing the Easter Floods Report and I will ensure that the House is updated on future progress.

<a name="91202w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what measures he is taking to assist farmers to diversify their businesses.  [100275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Funding to encourage a wide range of agricultural activities, including farm diversification, is available in the six areas designated under the English Objective 5b Structural Fund Programmes which are due to close on 31 December 1999. The European Council Rural Development Regulation (1257/1999), which applies from 2000, enables member states to support projects to encourage diversification of agricultural activities, among other things. A decision on the implementation of the Regulation will be made shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> the Treasury and <i>(b)</i> the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions about securing an 80 per cent. discount from climate change levy rates for protected horticulture.  [100459]<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what evidence he has 



<P>
<P><I>2 Dec 1999 : Column: 334W</I><P>
received as to whether transgenic plant DNA is broken down in commercial processing and treatments in animal feed.  [100167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w18.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Ministry-funded work has confirmed that DNA is degraded during the processing of most animal feed materials. For example, extracting oil from oilseeds caused complete degradation of the DNA in the by-products. This work, and a further current study, has concerned commercially available feed ingredients as an indicator of what would happen to transgenic plant material.

<a name="91202w18.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the principal activities of his Department and its agencies which provide business for <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices and <i>(b)</i> other post offices; if he will assess whether the level of business generated in each case is likely to increase or decrease over the next five years; and which new areas of business for post offices are likely to be developed by his Department and its agencies over the same period.  [99559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My Department and its agencies do not have activities or services which provide business for post offices, and currently no specific areas of business are foreseen, but the targets for electronic delivery of services (50 per cent. by 2005 and 100 per cent. by 2008) set out in the Modernising Government White Paper represent a real opportunity for additional business for the Post Office network across all public services delivered by central Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91202w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> It has not been possible to sell British beef in France or Germany since March 1996, and inevitably it will take time to build up sales when these countries lift their import restrictions. Any estimate of sales lost since 1 August would be entirely speculative.
