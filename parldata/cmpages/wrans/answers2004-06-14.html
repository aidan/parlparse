This will be assessed by examination of the evidence of need provided in the proposal, the scale and nature of research and consultation undertaken, the Countryside Agency Officer&#039;s existing knowledge of the area and their consultation with representatives of key organisations working there.
</p>


<p>

(For project applications) that it is likely to be socially, environmentally or financially viable by the time the funding from the Countryside Agency ceases. Ideally, all projects should seek to break even by at least the end of the funding period, although it is often found that during the early years of operation there is a deficit, i.e. receipts do not cover costs. For non-profit making schemes, with costs often provided on an ongoing basis in kind, from fund-raising or from grants, commercial viability is not so important.
</p>

The Department has been considering the possibility of funding for a programme to provide connection to deprived communities without mains gas. The Design and Demonstration Unit, which is based in DTI and designs and develops projects in support of White Paper objectives, has completed two pathfinder projects to provide gas connections to deprived communities, and is currently working on a third.

 The Department funded an assessment of the impact of global warming on global food production using scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to characterise a range of possible global development pathways over the 21st century.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w03.html_para3">
The work showed that the development scenario leading to the greatest increase in global temperature resulted in the greatest decreases both regionally and globally in crop yields. The world appears to be able to continue to feed itself under these scenarios during the rest of this century, but only through production in developed countries compensating for declines projected mainly in developing nations. Regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger over time, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger among the poorer nations.

<p>

There is considerable complexity in the world food supply system, and the impact of socio-economic developments could also be substantial, with the potential at the regional level to both increase or decrease yields.

 I have already received and considered a detailed report from CPS Wiltshire concerning the case against Mr. Robert Duqueria who was charged with removing 25 Roman coins and three artefacts from a protected site following a police investigation including obtaining expert evidence.

Prosecutions of this nature are relatively rare and may well demand appropriate expert evidence depending on the facts of the individual case. In this case all possible avenues were pursued and the case was correctly reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

<p><a name="40614w12.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Department for International Development&#039;s (DFID) expenditure on forestry-related projects in Cameroon over the past three financial years has been: <i>(a)</i> 2001, &#163;2.6 million <i>(b)</i> 2002, &#163;2.4 million; <i>(c)</i> 2003, &#163;1.0 million <sup>1</sup> . The planning figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;3 million. DFID&#039;s future forestry support of Cameroon will be focused on the African Forestry Law Enforcement and Governance initiative. DFID plans to commit &#163;11 million over the next four years in support of the Cameroon Government&#039;s Forest and Environment Sector Programme (FESP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para2">
The FESP is being implemented by the Government with support from DFID, the World Bank, the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the Canadian International Development Institute (CIDA), the European Union (EU) and the French Development Agency (AFD). The programme aims to implement wide ranging institutional reform and an effective strategy to control illegal logging, and to take measures to consolidate the rights of communities and protect the community forests from industrial exploitation. In particular, community development will be supported through the redistribution of a proportion of forestry revenues to rural communities. DFID also plans to develop a related initiative to strengthen the contribution of civil society and the private sector to forest sector reform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para3">
Extensive analysis of the forestry sector has been undertaken by the Government, DFID and other donors as part of the FESP appraisal process, including a thorough social, economic and environmental assessment. In addition, DFID and the World Bank have commissioned reviews of over 10 years of fiscal and community forest reform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para4">
DFID is strongly committed to stopping illegal logging and international trade in illegally produced forest products. One of the central aims of the reform programme is to stop illegal logging through (i) strengthening the capacity of government regulatory agencies (ii) introducing new forest management standards and regulatory systems (iii) encouraging increased community involvement (iv) encouraging private sector involvement in the management and (v) maintaining the independent monitor of forest operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para5">
Specifically, DFID has funded an independent body (Global Witness) to monitor the conduct of forest operations for the past three years in order to improve governance and transparency in the forest sector. DFID also strongly endorses the EU Forest Law and Governance Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. We are encouraging the Government of Cameroon to develop a Voluntary Partnership Agreement with the EU to support its reforms and prevent illegal exports of timber. Such an agreement would strengthen government efforts to stop illegal logging and promote sustainable forestry.

<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para6">
In addition to Community Development support through the FESP, DFID funds various community development projects. The Small Grants Scheme, operating through the British High Commission, supports a wide range of development proposals from different Non Governmental Organisations and Community Based Organisations on a annual basis (e.g. in Human rights, Education, Health, Water and Sanitation). DFID also supports a Capacity Building Programme run by the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) to strengthen civil society organisations in the forest sector. Assistance is also provided to the Cameroon Mountain Conservation Foundation (CAMCOF), to provide funding to enable communities to be engaged in biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use, thereby improving livelihoods.

<p><a name="40614w12.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 A senior DFID official chaired the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Task Force on Donor Practices and Aid Harmonisation. The Task Force produced the DAC Guidelines &#039;Harmonising Donor Practices for Effective Aid Delivery&#039; which set out good practices for improving harmonisation. At the DAC High Level Forum in Rome, February 2003, the representatives of 51 multilateral and bilateral development agencies, including DFID, and 28 developing countries endorsed the Guidelines and committed themselves to taking forward this agenda. DFID produced a Harmonisation Action Plan in February 2003 that we are due to report on (at the DAC) in early July.

<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para7">
Following the Rome Declaration, the DAC Working Party on Aid Effectiveness and Donor Practices was established to further the work of the DAC Task Force. DFID is represented at official level on the Working Party and its sub-groups; the Task Team on Harmonisation and Alignment, Joint Venture on Public Financial Management, Joint Venture on Managing for Development Results, Procurement Capacity Building and Aid Untying. DFID staff members have attended meetings of all five subgroups since their inception, making a significant contribution to their work programmes.

<p><a name="40614w12.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b>

practices for donors to follow. DFID has adopted an Action Plan to promote Harmonisation, which aims to reinforce on-going changes within DFID (as well as encouraging similar reforms in other donor agencies). These changes make procedures simpler and more flexible, so that we can more easily harmonise with other donors, align our assistance with national poverty reduction strategies, and make greater use of partner government systems (rather than separate parallel channels) where this is appropriate. DFID is also aligning its own internal incentives to ensure that they encourage staff to promote these good practices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w12.html_para8">
Harmonisation is a particularly high priority for African governments which find dealing with a large number of donor agencies burdensome. DFID supports many country-led harmonisation initiatives like Uganda&#039;s Partnership Principles and Rwanda&#039;s Partnership Framework, and has led donor efforts to harmonise budget support in several countries including Ethiopia, Ghana and Mozambique.

 On 3 June, a meeting of donors took place in Geneva to discuss the donor response to the humanitarian situation in Darfur, Sudan. The UK was represented by Alan Goulty, UK Special Representative for Sudan.

The meeting was co-chaired by the UN (Jan Egeland), EU (Tom Kitt, Minister for Development and Human Rights, Ireland) and Constanza Adonolfi, (Director of ECHO), and the US (Andrew Natsios, Administrator USAID).

The UN presented a 90 day plan for Darfur, and highlighted the unmet requirements of the Darfur and Chad appeal ($236 million). Pledges in response to this request amounted to approximately $57 million Additionally, the US pledged $188 million to be disbursed from 4 June to the end of 2005.

At the meeting in Geneva, donors and humanitarian agencies including the UK stressed to the Government of Sudan the need to ensure the protection and security of its citizens, to respect human rights, and to actively implement the provisions of the Ceasefire agreed on 8 April.

<p><a name="40614w14.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what discussions he had during his recent visit to Sudan on <i>(a)</i> ethnic cleansing in Darfur and <i>(b)</i> breaches in the ceasefire; and what access he had to internally displaced persons;  [178008]

</p>



<p>(2) whether he met Mr. Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator in Darfur during his recent visit; and what assessment he has made of Mr. Egeland&#039;s recent statements on the possibility of hundreds of thousands of people dying as a result of the situation in Sudan;  [178009]
</p>



<p>(3) what assessment he has made of the health of people in Darfur, Sudan, following his recent visit.  [178010]</p>








<p><a name="40614w14.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 I discussed the security situation in Darfur with the Sudanese Government including the First Vice President, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and the Minister of Finance. I stressed to them the importance of respecting the terms of the 8 April ceasefire and the need to rein in the Janjaweed and stop attacks on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civilians. In my statements I also called on rebel groups to respect the ceasefire. The recent UN report on human rights in Sudan, while identifying disturbing patterns of human rights violations, stopped short of calling the conflict ethnic cleansing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w14.html_para9">
I met with the first African Union (AU) monitors in El Fasher, North Darfur. The AU is preparing to deploy 120 monitors across Darfur to support the terms of the 8 April ceasefire and the UK has contributed &#163;2 million to the mission. We expect the deployment of ceasefire monitors to have a positive effect on the security situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w14.html_para10">
Mr. Egeland was not in Sudan during my visit. I met with Kevin Kennedy, Acting UN Resident Co-ordinator/Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Sudan and Tom Vraalsen, UN Secretary General&#039;s Envoy on Humanitarian Affairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w14.html_para11">
The security situation remains a real concern with attacks on civilians continuing. The scale of need is enormous and there are significant gaps in the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The onset of rains will hinder delivery and increase the vulnerability of the internally displaced persons. There is no doubt that urgent action is required by all parties. I echo Mr. Egeland&#039;s statements about the need for more donor assistance to Darfur. During my visit I announced a further allocation of &#163;15 million for Darfur, taking the total UK allocation for humanitarian response to &#163;34.5 million. DFID is also urging other donors to give more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w14.html_para12">
During my visit to Sudan I saw first hand the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Darfur. This is the most serious humanitarian emergency in the world 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Jun 2004 : Column 676W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
today and many lives are at risk. The UN estimates that over one million people have had to flee their homes and that a further 130,000 refugees have crossed into Eastern Chad. During my time in Darfur, I visited three camps for internally displaced people. I visited a Medecins Sans Fronti&#232;res feeding centre for young children at Kalma camp, near Nyala in South Darfur, which has approximately 20,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). At El Meshtel, near El Fasher in Northern Darfur, I visited a temporary camp where many people have no shelter and are waiting for transfer to Abu Shouk. I then visited Abu Shouk, which has 30,000 IDPs already there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w14.html_para13">
I also spoke with representatives of UK funded NGOs and UN agencies engaged in provision of health care, including Medecins Sans Fronti&#232;res the World Health Organisation and UNICEF. My visit and these discussions confirmed to me the gravity of the situation in Darfur, including that of the health of IDPs. There are high levels of malnutrition, and the lack of sanitation and adequate shelter is contributing to high child mortality rates. With the onset of rains, the risk from communicable diseases from poor sanitation will become more acute.

[177484]</p>








<p><a name="40614w15.html_spnew1"><b> Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The information requested is as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w15.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i> Where DFID provides general budget support, our assistance to sectors such as water can best be assessed in terms of the proportion of budget going to particular sectors and in consultation with other donors. However, in terms of impact, progress in the sector is 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Jun 2004 : Column 677W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
best assessed by the data returned by the country departments themselves, supported where appropriate by technical assistance. For example, DFID have provided a water adviser to work with the Ministry of Finance in Uganda to assist in measurement of investment and impact in water and sanitation. Internationally, DFID provide support to the Joint Monitoring Programme of UNICEF and WHO, which assemble data on coverage by country, and DFID are currently supporting work to establish a better evidence base linking water and sanitation improvements to progress against the full range of poverty indicators using one of our Resource Centres.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w15.html_para1">
<i>(b)</i> It is correct that sanitation often does not get the prominence it deserves, particularly at the national government levels. But there are some good examples of how greater importance can be focused on sanitation. In Bangladesh for example DFID is supporting WaterAid in raising the profile of water and sanitation in the Poverty Reduction Strategy and national sanitation strategy, as well as provided financial assistance in holding a regional sanitation conference for South Asian countries at the end of 2003 resulting in a declaration signed by ministers from nine countries. These examples show what can be done and how a higher profile for sanitation can be achieved. DFID are working with other countries and donors and our research centres to build on these lessons.

<p><a name="40614w15.html_spnew2"><b> Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 In general terms, DFID agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg the target for all countries to develop Integrated Water Resources Management and Water Efficiency plans by 2005, with support to developing countries. DFID support the &quot;Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment&quot; reports of the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme which include water availability data and work under the Global Water partnership on integrated water resource management. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Jun 2004 : Column 678W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
These reviews assist in developing frameworks for better assessment, allocation and monitoring of water use, particularly in the water scarce areas mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w15.html_para2">
<i>(a)</i> In Yemen recent DFID visits confirm that there continues to be very poor management of the water resource and a lack of action by government and others to prevent what is expected to be a severe water crisis in the next few years. The donor community has tried to intervene in this sector with little success due to the poor institutional arrangements. DFID is funding community based water supplies through its contributions to the Social Fund for Development and is considering more direct engagement in the sector once our Yemen programme is more established.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w15.html_para3">
<i>(b)</i> In India DFID currently works in four focus states, none of which are in north-west India, as human development indicators for the NW states are relatively better than for other states where DFID work. As a result, DFID has not conducted specific examination of water scarcity in NW India nor undertaken specific projects there. However, our support to other programmes, notably through DFID-supported work with UNICEF, includes specific work on water scarcity in Rajasthan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w15.html_para4">
<i>(c)</i> There are substantial shortages of water in China, particularly in the west and north. In China as a whole, per capita water availability is a quarter of the world average. Almost one third of the world&#039;s population without access to safe drinking water and sanitation live in China. Water scarcity is increasingly seen as a factor limiting overall economic growth. DFID has developed a significant water related programme with a total commitment of around &#163;30 million. This includes assistance in revising the national water law to promote more sustainable use; improving water demand management in the two provinces in the north-west and north-east; improving irrigation water use; and rural water supply and sanitation programmes in the south-west. DFID has a close collaboration with the World Bank and others in this area.

<i>[holding answer 7 June 2004]:</i> Drawing on the learning from personal dental services pilots and the field site programme being managed by the Modernisation Agency, to ensure a smooth transition to local commissioning, we will be working closely with the British Dental Association and the national health service to develop a simple and robust base contract that all primary care trusts (PCTs) and practices will be able to put in place from 2005. Details of the base contract are still under discussion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w16.html_para0">
The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 puts a new duty on all PCTs to provide or commission primary dental services &quot;to the extent it considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements&quot; in its area. This is the same general duty as for other NHS services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w16.html_para1">
Under transitional arrangements, the new base contract will be made available, but dentists and PCTs who wish to develop this further will be able to do so. The transitional arrangements will provide protection of dentists&#039; gross earnings for three years to enable them to come off the treadmill of item of service, to see their patients at intervals appropriate to their oral health needs and to modernise and adjust their workload.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w16.html_para2">
The current statement of dental remuneration describes the care available on the NHS. We expect a similar range of care to be provided under the new system. As now, the care dentists offer must be necessary to secure oral health and dentists will be expected to provide all proper and necessary treatment which a dentist usually undertakes and which the patient is willing to undergo.

 New European Union rules on ingredients listing for pre-packed foods have been agreed recently (Directive 2003/89/EC); they will require declaration of all ingredients on the label, with only a small number of exemptions allowed. No exemptions are allowed for 12 specified food allergens and their allergenic derivatives: these include those allergens most often associated with anaphylactic shock. This will help those with food allergies identify products they may need to avoid. The new rules will come into effect in November 2005. In the meantime, the Food Standards Agency has issued advice encouraging voluntary declaration of specified allergens.

<p>
<a name="40614w18.html_para1">
Guidance issued to NHS trusts on the achievement of the Department&#039;s single sex accommodation objectives made it clear that a variety of ward layouts and designs can be used to deliver separate sleeping accommodation, including the use of single sex wards, or combinations of single sex bays and individual rooms. Single sex bays, together with increasing numbers of single rooms, are common features of modern hospital design both here and abroad and can provide acceptable levels of privacy and dignity.

<sup>(10)</sup> 1999 vacancy survey is unable to split between diagnostic and therapeutic radiography staff.<br>





Three month vacancy notes:<br>

1. Three month vacancy information is as at 31 March each specified year.<br>

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which Trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole-time equivalents).<br>

3. Three month Vacancy Rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff-in-post.<br>

4. For 2002 and 2003 three month Vacancy Rates are calculated using staff-in-post from the Vacancy Survey.<br>

5. For earlier years three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff-in-post from the non-medical workforce census the previous September.<br>

6. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>

7. Figures for 1999&#150;2002 exclude health authority staff.<br>

Staff-in-post notes:<br>

1. Staff-in-post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September each specified year.<br>

General notes:<br>

1. Vacancy and staff-in-post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

2. Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<br>

3. Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<br>

There will be opportunities to practice from assistant right through to consultant practitioner level. With the implementation of the &#039;Improving Working Lives&#039; standard, there is greater opportunity for radiographers to work flexibly, access childcare and still extend and progress their roles.

The decision to convert a footpath or footway to a cycle track is for individual local highway authorities to determine after careful consideration of all the issues.

Shared use facilities can have a role to play in providing improved facilities for cyclists but in the main they are best suited to lightly trafficked pedestrian areas, to links in cycle routes or where facilities for cyclists cannot be provided on the road. The conversion of footways and footpaths should not be introduced at the expense of pedestrians and should not be seen as area wide solution to providing improved facilities for cyclists. Local highway authorities should always consult widely on any such proposals at an early stage.

<p><a name="40614w19.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 JAR-OPS 1 and 3 do not contain any requirements on flight and duty time limits as the Joint Aviation Authorities were unable to agree requirements when they were adopted in 1996.

<p>
<a name="40614w19.html_para5">
We recognise the need for harmonised flight and duty limits to ensure a high level of safety and a level playing field in the single aviation market. We can therefore support the proposal provided that it achieves an acceptable level of safety. The Civil Aviation Authority has reviewed the proposal and advises that while the proposal in its original form was unacceptable, with a number of relatively small amendments it could form an acceptable baseline European flight time limitation requirement, supported by additional requirements in

 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many staff have been seconded by Deloitte to advise the Government on public service reform; and on how many contracts arising from that work Deloitte have been designated as a preferred bidder.  [175102]</p>








<p><a name="40614w23.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Three staff were seconded from Deloitte to work in public service reform units.

 The Government published &quot;Let&#039;s make it accessible: Improving Government information for disabled people&quot; in 2001 to help Government Departments and agencies to develop strategies to meet the information needs of their disabled customers.

The guidance covers the potential needs of people with a range of impairments, including people who are learning disabled or who are profoundly deaf and use British Sign Language as their first language. It also suggests a range of methods for making information accessible to disabled people.

The Guidelines for UK Government websites (published 2002) and the Quality Framework for UK Government Website Design (published 2003) require government websites to implement the World Wide Web Consortium&#039;s Web Accessibility Initiative.

 We are aware of the allegations of involvement by the Colombian armed forces in these incidents.

<p><a name="40614w23.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 Human rights abuses in Colombia remain unacceptably high, although we have seen a decline in recent years in the numbers of cases. We are very concerned about abuses against all vulnerable groups, including trades unionists. We are engaged in an on-going dialogue with the Government of Colombia, the UN, EU and other international partners and civil society groups on how to improve the human rights situation in Colombia. As I made clear to the House on 23 March 2004<i>, Official Report</i>, columns 237&#150;41WH, human rights are at the heart of our policy towards Colombia. The issue will be at the top of the agenda for discussion with the Colombians when I visit the country later this month. Rory Murphy of the TUC is due to be with me during that visit.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the level of kidnapping occurring in Colombia; and what discussions he has had with the Colombian authorities on this.  [178001]</p>








<p><a name="40614w23.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The level of kidnapping in Colombia, a serious human rights abuse, remains alarmingly and unacceptably high, even though 2003 saw an estimated decrease to 2,200 from 2,986 in 2002. Illegal armed groups and criminal gangs are largely responsible for the kidnaps, presenting a huge challenge for the Colombian security forces. We have worked closely with the Colombian authorities in individual cases of kidnapped British nationals. We support the Colombian Government in the efforts they are making to bring peace and security to the country, while urging them to do so in full observance of international human rights standards.

 We do not believe that sanctions offer the most effective means of promoting the transition to a pluralist democracy in Cuba.

 The DTI has carried out an analysis of the possible impact of the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) as part of the Energy Bill Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) (www.dti.gov.uk/energy/leg and reg/acts/ria2.pdf). Benefits to domestic customers are likely to accrue mainly to those in Scotland.

<p>
<a name="40614w26.html_para0">
The RIA estimated that a combination of increased electricity wholesale competition and a re-allocation in the way transmission charges are calculated could see annual domestic electricity bills in Scotland falling by around &#163;13 per customer, all other things being equal. Customers who switch suppliers could make further gains.
</p>

Notes:<br>

1. The table does not contain schemes that started winding up in the time period given and have since completed wind up. The Pensions Schemes Registry only records the present status of a scheme so only those winding up at the moment are captured. This is unlikely to bias the figures extensively as the winding up process can take many years to complete, particularly for large firms.<br>

2. A winding up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has commenced winding up procedures.<br>

3. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify OPRA of any status change so the data for the current year is provisional. <br>

<a name="40614w31.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Allotments</h3>





<p><a name="40614w31.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Sheerman: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what encouragement he is giving to local authorities to <i>(a)</i> maintain and preserve allotments and <i>(b)</i> provide replacement land where land formerly used for allotments has been subject to development.  [177616]</p>









<p><a name="40614w31.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has a number of measures to encourage local authorities to maintain and preserve allotments. Firstly, if an allotment authority is of the opinion that there is a demand for allotments in its area, it is required, under section 23 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908, to provide a sufficient number of allotments and to let them to persons residing in its area who want them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para3">
Secondly, our advice to local planning authorities on planning for open space, sport and recreation is contained in Planning Policy Guidance note 17 (PPG 17) and recognises allotments as one of the types of open space that may be of public value. Local planning authorities are required to undertake robust audits of such spaces and to conduct assessments of need for their areas. Where the need for particular types of open spaces such as allotments is established, planning authorities are expected to protect them through adopting and implementing appropriate policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para4">
Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3) appreciates the value that open spaces such as allotments can add to a community&#039;s quality of life, health and contribution to nature conservation. Paragraph 53 states that local planning authorities should have clear policies for the protection and creation of open space, and new housing developments should incorporate sufficient provision where such spaces are not already adequately provided within easy access of the new housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para5">
PPG3 (Annexe C) also specifically excludes parks, recreation grounds and allotments from the definition of previously developed land&#151;even though these areas may contain certain urban features such as pavilions and other buildings, and protecting them from the priority given to development on brownfield land.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Jun 2004 : Column 738W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para6">
Thirdly, in partnership with the Local Government Association, Greater London Authority, and Shell Better Britain Campaign, we published &quot;growing in the community: a good practice guide for the management of allotments&quot;, in June 2001. This guide provides comprehensive advice and good practice for local authorities on all aspects of allotment management.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para7">
In terms of providing replacement land, a requirement of section 8 of the Allotments Act 1925 is that if an authority wishes to dispose of statutory allotment land, and existing plotholders would be displaced &quot;adequate provision&quot; must be made for them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para8">
PPG17 also provides advice for the instance where a replacement is needed for a site required for development. It specifies that the replacement land should be at least as accessible to current and potential new users, and at least equivalent in terms of size, usefulness, attractiveness and quality. Where possible the aim should be to realise qualitative improvements.


</p>







<p><a name="40614w31.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Sheerman: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many allotments existed <i>(a)</i> 10 years ago and <i>(b)</i> in the last year for which figures are available.  [177617]</p>









<p><a name="40614w31.html_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The &quot;English Allotments Survey: report of the joint survey of allotments in England&quot;, published in 1997 by the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, provided estimates of the numbers of allotment plots in England for four specific years&#151;1970, 1977, 1978 and 1996. Therefore data on allotments in 1994 are not held centrally, however in 1996 there were 296,923 plots in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w31.html_para9">
In &quot;Living Places: Cleaner, Safer, Greener&quot; the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sets out plans to update the survey and expand it to include community gardens and city farms. This research has now been commissioned and links to the development of a national database of different types of green spaces. Disposal of statutory allotments are also administered and monitored by the Government offices for the regions.

<p><a name="40614w32.html_spnew0"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Building Regulations set functional requirements rather than specifying particular ways of showing compliance. This enables builders to develop their own ways of complying with the requirements, using conventional or new technologies as appropriate. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing the energy efficiency provisions in line with the commitments made in the Energy White Paper and the prospective higher standards that we aim to bring into effect in 2005 are likely to make new systems like micro-renewables more attractive. I hope to announce consultation on the proposed new requirements in the next few weeks.

 There are various incentives in the planning system to bring about the provision of social housing once consent has been granted. First, consents are time limited. Secondly, the local planning authority may ask the developer to execute planning obligations, or it may impose conditions which provide that a specified proportion of the general market housing on the site cannot be occupied until the social housing element has been built and transferred to a registered social landlord (RSL). Finally, the Housing Corporation seeks to engage with RSLs at an early stage in the planning process, so that funding through its Approved Development Programme can be made available, where appropriate.

 All asylum claims are considered on their individual merits in accordance with the United Kingdom&#039;s obligations under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.

<p>
<a name="40614w35.html_para1">
In considering claims the Home Office takes full account of up to date information from a wide range of sources about the situation in the country of origin. These sources include intergovernmental organisations (such as the UN), governmental sources (including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) and human rights organisations (for example Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch).

<a name="40614w35.html_para3">
The only country to which, as a matter of policy, we do not at present generally enforce the return of failed asylum seekers is Zimbabwe. This policy is not based on asylum or human rights reasons but on our view that in the wider context of the Government&#039;s position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate to return forcibly failed asylum seekers at this time.

<i>[holding answer 27 May 2004]:</i> The requested information is unavailable and could be produced only at disproportionate cost. Data on asylum applications is collated on when the application is made, and not on when applicants arrive in the UK. For applicants entering clandestinely or through legitimate legal entry routes and applying in country, their date of arrival is not necessarily recorded on entry and they are not at that point identifiable as a future asylum seeker. The table shows asylum applications to the United Kingdom by port and in country.

 Information on the number of asylum seekers who have exhausted their rights of appeal is not readily available and could be obtained only by examination of individual case files to obtain information on the final outcomes from each tier of the appeal process. This would incur disproportionate cost.

There is no centrally held record of the number of instances of such an action taking place.

<a name="40614w36.html_para6">
Government, the credit card industry, and law enforcement are actively considering what action can be taken in respect of individuals convicted of an offence which has involved the purchase of child abuse images using any payment mechanisms. More widely work remains ongoing to proactively identifying sites selling child abuse images, seeking the removal of payment facilities from these sites and appropriate action taken by law enforcement.

<p><a name="40614w36.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Extensive work has been undertaken on the issue of preventing credit cards and other payment mechanisms from being used to purchase child abuse images online. The Association of Payment Clearing Services (APACS), the UK Trade Association for Payments, the Internet Watch Foundation, and the Children&#039;s Charities&#039; Coalition for Internet Safety, have all worked actively to prevent such activity and have developed close working relationships over the last few years. This resulted in a joint announcement by them in March 2003.

<p>
<a name="40614w36.html_para7">
The arrangements now in place have made it possible for law enforcement agencies to become more effective in investigating detecting and taking action against those sites that use specific payment services to sell child abuse images. The relevant card companies will also seek to trace the banks and the billing companies involved in processing payments and to cease the use of their cards for such activity. Units such as the National Hi Tech Crime Unit through their industry outreach programme, have been particularly successful in working closely with industry on intelligence and target hardening to design out hi-tech crime.

<a name="40614w36.html_para8">
It is clear that co-ordinated action by the major credit card schemes in conjunction with other relevant organisations can have a major impact on the commercial trade in child abuse images. We welcome the efforts that have been made so far and will continue to work with them to make this as effective as possible, involving as many different payment mechanisms as is possible.

 &quot;Legislation on Identity Cards&#151;A Consultation&quot; (Cm 6178), makes clear that there will be no general power to share data held on the National Identity Register. Applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases only to establish that an application for a card, or related purpose such as reissue, is genuine. Such checks might include a Population Register developed under the Citizen&#039;s Information Project, were that to go ahead and subject to enabling legislation. We will also consider whether any changes to an individual&#039;s name and address details within the National Identity Register might be supplied through the Population Register.

 Following the launch of the National Drug Strategy in 1998 (Revised 2002) ring fenced investment in action to tackle drugs has increased significantly.

The Department is in the process of producing new guidance on fire safety for schools.

The guide is comprehensive and stresses the value of using risk assessments as the basis for determining, for example, the types of fire alarm and detection systems needed in particular school buildings. It will be aimed at schools, local education authorities (LEAs), design consultants, building control bodies and the fire and rescue service.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what discussions his Department is holding on learning disabilities in children.  [176817]</p>








<p><a name="40614w43.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 June 2004]:</i> Ministers and officials from my Department regularly meet organisations which represent learning disabled children and their families to ensure that their interests are reflected in the development of our policies for children. The Department&#039;s Board of Stakeholders, which I chair, includes the Director of the Council for Disabled Children (CDC) and the Chair of the Special Educational Consortium, which represents a large number of voluntary organisations in the learning disability field.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w43.html_para1">
Many of these organisations responded to the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; and my ministerial colleague Baroness Ashton recently met representatives of the CDC, the Disability Rights Commission and the Learning Disability Task Force, on which the Department is represented, to discuss the implementation of Every Child Matters with regard to the needs of disabled children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w43.html_para2">
The new special educational needs (SEN) strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, which we published in February, will complement Every Child Matters and the Children Bill. It puts forward a strategy to improve provision for all children with SEN, including those with learning disabilities. It is a long-term strategy which was developed after discussions with a number of organisations, including ones which represent the interests of children with learning disabilities and we will involve such groups as the strategy develops. For example, we will be working with the voluntary sector to develop practical tools for involving children, including those with learning disabilities, in decisions about their own education and local SEN services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40614w43.html_para3">
The strategy also complements other relevant policies, where we are also working with learning disability organisations. For example, we are working with them on the Children&#039;s National Service Framework through the External Working Group on

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from local education authorities&#039; section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data subject to change by the LEA. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. Hence, for consistency, the combined unit cost is provided since 1996&#150;97 but due to problems outlined below (in footnote 4) the unit cost for primary education is a more robust measure.<br>

2. Prior to local government reorganisation (LGR) in 1998&#150;99 Blackpool LEA was part of Lancashire LEA. Consequently figures for 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 are for pre-LGR Lancashire LEA and figures for 1998&#150;99 onwards are for Blackpool LEA.<br>

3. Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

4. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. 



Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

5. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector. Blackpool LEA has no maintained nursery schools but does spend a significant amount of money on the pre-primary sector (around &#163;2.8 million in 2001&#150;02). This additional expenditure on the pre-primary sector has the effect of inflating the combined pre-primary/primary unit cost as it includes expenditure on both pre-primary and primary education divided only by the pupils in maintained primary schools.<br>

7. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

8. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

9. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

There are a number of schemes designed to encourage people to consider teaching as a potential career option. These range from taster schemes that give people the opportunity to work in a classroom environment before making a commitment to financial incentives such as Golden Hello and Training Bursaries. Thanks to the continued success of these and other schemes, teacher numbers are at their highest level since 1981. The Government remain committed to attracting good quality people into teaching and encouraging them to remain in the profession.
