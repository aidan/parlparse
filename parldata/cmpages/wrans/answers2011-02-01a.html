<i> [holding answer 31 January 2011]:</i> The Government's approach to broadband is to drive the rollout of superfast broadband to as much of the country as possible and to deliver at least a decent level of broadband access to virtually everybody as part of that commitment. That approach is underpinned by the work that BDUK conducted over summer 2010 examining the choice of cost effective solutions available to provide a minimum level of coverage to all premises without access to at least 2 MBps. Among the conclusions of that exercise was that a universal service commitment should not be seen as separate from the superfast broadband objective, but rather an integral part of pushing next generation networks deep into rural Britain. The £530 million allocated to support broadband rollout up to 2015 will help the UK achieve its aim of having the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.</p>

 In the current fiscal climate, we have not considered making additional public funds available, but some listed piers may be eligible to apply to English Heritage for funding, who also contribute advice as part of their planning responsibilities, and from the Heritage Lottery Fund, where a strong case can be made for public benefit. In addition, some pier restoration projects in private ownership have been successful without public funding, for example Weston Grand Pier.

 There are a number of powers available to local authorities and the police to tackle various types of inappropriate behaviour from people outside public houses. These include introducing a designated public places order, where individuals can be stopped from consuming alcohol in a public place, powers to direct individuals to leave an area if they are contributing to alcohol related antisocial behaviour and noise abatement notices which can be issued by the local authority.</p>

This will enable the licensing committee to attach further conditions if it considers it necessary to do so, to the licence, to address the problems being caused by people outside of the premises. These could include for example conditions on the smoking area of the public house, or not allowing anyone to re-enter the premises once they have gone outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="110201w0001.htm_para32"><a name="11020141000297">Additionally, we are proposing to amend the Licensing Act to ensure that the licensing authority has more powers to refuse to grant licences to, or to revoke licences from premises which cause problems for their local community.

 The Forensic Science Regulator was appointed to set and monitor quality standards in forensic science across the board; he is working closely with the police, the National Policing Improvement Agency and the private sector laboratories to develop a single quality standards framework. The regulator is a member of the Forensic Science Service Transition Board and will monitor the movement of forensic science services to ensure that quality standards are maintained. All the private sector forensic science laboratories across the UK work to demanding quality standards and are accredited against BS/EN ISO 17025 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories) by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service. This is the standard adopted by the Forensic Science Regulator for forensic science laboratory functions and is a requirement of the police contracts with the laboratories. ISO 17025 is also the standard being adopted by the police in-house fingerprint enhancement laboratories with an NPIA-led project to co-ordinate the adoption of the standard by all police forces, in line with the European Union framework decision which mandates it, by 2015.</p>

 The alcohol provisions in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill are designed to ensure that local communities have more of a say in the decisions taken in their local area. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill introduces a late night levy where 70% of the net revenue raised will be passed to the police by licensing authorities who choose to implement it. The police could use this revenue to pay for late night policing linked to alcohol related crime and disorder. In addition, the amendments to early morning restriction orders will assist the police and local authorities to take action that reflects the needs of their local communities in policing the night time economy.</p>

As a guide to the levels which have been set by the Commission, a daily fine is calculated by multiplying a uniform flat rate (currently €640) by coefficients for seriousness and duration, and then multiplying this figure by a special factor for each member state, which for the UK has been set at 18.31. The minimum lump sum fine (for the UK) is set at €9.666 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="110201w0001.htm_para64"><a name="11020141000689">Current European Commission guidance (Commission Communication SEC (2005) 1658 as updated by Commission Communication SEC(2010) 923/3) sets out three criteria which are taken into account when calculating the level of fines. These are: the seriousness of the breach (which affects the lump sum only and can be a multiple of between 1 and 20), the duration of the breach (a multiple of between 1 and 3) and a deterrent factor designed to ensure the breach is rectified and the offence is not repeated. Each case is treated on its own merits, so it is extremely difficult to estimate the level of any fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="110201w0001.htm_para65"><a name="11020141000690">Any litigation costs would depend on how far the case goes, and the scope of the issues involved. It is very difficult to estimate these in advance.</p>

 There are no proposals to regulate advertising the sale of pets on the internet or in newspapers specifically. To regulate and police internet adverts would, even if it were feasible, require a considerable investment of resources. I am not satisfied that the net welfare benefits could justify Government giving further consideration to intervention in this area. With regard to newspaper adverts, welfare organisations have worked constructively with the newspaper industry to encourage self-policing and to raise customer awareness of what they should do when responding to small adverts. I am very grateful to those newspapers that have now decided to take positive steps to promote animal welfare and protect the interests of their readers. I do not consider that further action by Government is either feasible or necessary.</p>

 The Pet Animals Act 1951 (as amended in 1983) controls the sale of all animals as pets from licensed premises. The 1951 Act requires any person selling pet animals to be licensed by the local authority. Before granting a licence, the authority must satisfy itself that the animals are kept in accommodation that is suitable and clean, that they are supplied with the appropriate food and drink, and are protected from disease and fire.</p>

If a person is convicted under the Act or for any offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, a court may cancel any pet shop licence or disqualify a person from keeping a pet shop for any period as the court thinks fit. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 is the principal piece of legislation protecting all domestic and captive animals, in England and Wales. Under the 2006 Act, it is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to-or fail to provide for the welfare needs of-any domestic or captive animal.</p>

 The target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010 was an EU-wide one. The Commission reported in October last year that the EU had missed it. The UK provided details to the Commission on progress towards the target in early 2010. This showed that the decline in biodiversity had slowed and in some cases had been halted or reversed but that there remained a lot more to do. The EU has agreed a successor target to halt biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. A strategy to deliver this new target is currently in preparation.</p>

 The Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999, which amended and extended the provisions of the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 and the Breeding of Dogs Act 1991, provides protection for dogs used in breeding establishments. Under this legislation, any person who keeps a breeding establishment for dogs at any premises and carries on a business of breeding dogs for sale at those premises must obtain a licence from the local authority. Those people who are not in the business of breeding dogs for sale and produce less than five litters in any period of 12 months-so called "hobby breeders"-do not need to obtain a licence. Local authorities have powers to grant or withhold a licence as well as to inspect a pet shop for standards of welfare.</p>

This began by recruiting site-based volunteer 'Energy Wardens'-providing them with a range of resources to help them foster and maintain good, energy conscious behaviours with their colleagues, with ongoing support including targeted messages and stories using the Department's intranet. To complement this, automatic meter reading facilities have been installed at 600 DWP sites to provide half-hourly data to assist in identifying and resolving excessive energy usage.</p>

 Entitlement to disability living allowance is not normally linked to particular disabling conditions, but on the extent to which a severely disabled person has personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disability. People with a visual or hearing impairment can claim disability living allowance in the same way as anyone else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"><a name="110201w0002.htm_para49"><a name="11020168000062">There are two exceptions to this general rule which specifically affect people with sensory impairments. People who are both deaf and blind are taken to automatically qualify for the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance where they have a 100% per cent disability due to blindness and an 80% disability due to deafness and, by reason of the combined effects of their blindness and deafness, are unable, without the assistance of another person, to walk to any intended or required destination out of doors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="110201w0002.htm_para50"><a name="11020168000063">From April this year we are also extending automatic entitlement to the higher rate mobility component to people with prescribed categories of severe visual impairment. The Pension Disability and Carers Service, which is responsible for the administration of disability living allowance, is in the process of contacting all existing recipients of the benefit who have a visual impairment and are in receipt of the lower rate mobility component to ensure that those eligible can be reassessed for entitlement to the higher rate mobility component.

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="110201w0002.htm_para56"><a name="11020168000161">Ahead of the spending review Lord Hutton produced an interim report which found that the value of public service pensions had been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s. Most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="110201w0002.htm_para57"><a name="11020168000162">At the spending review, based on the clear rationale set out in Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government announced that they would implement progressive changes to the level of employee contributions to public service pensions that lead to an additional saving of £1.8 billion a year from 2014-1 5, to be phased in from 2012-13. This is equivalent to three percentage point increase on average. In taking this decision, the Government considered a range of factors including the impact on gender equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="110201w0002.htm_para58"><a name="11020168000163">In addition, the Government announced their intention to launch consultations on the discount rate used to set contributions in unfunded public service pension schemes and the Fair Deal policy. Any assessment of the impact on gender equality will be undertaken in due course should there be any proposals to change policy.</p>

 We are refining the estimated costs of redundancy and early release as we go through the Department's annual Planning Round. Compensation payments depend on a number of factors including salary, rank/grade and length of service. The precise drawdown of military and civilian staff is still being considered. Estimates are therefore subject to change. The Planning Round is expected to conclude in the spring at which point we will be prepared to set out the estimates for early release under the expected terms of the civilian and service schemes.</p>

Given, for example, the legal aid reforms and the programme of court closures that we have proposed as part of our efficiency savings, we do not believe that the new additional funding that the office of chief coroner would require is justifiable.

 The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced in August 2010 that the Audit Commission would be disbanded and the work of its audit practice transferred to the private sector. My right hon. Friend decided that the Commission Board needed additional private sector expertise to help steer the organisation as it addresses these changes. Accordingly he appointed three Commissioners (Janet Baker, Brian Landers and Tony Harris) with significant private sector expertise, and decided that Dame Denise Piatt and Jenny Watson would not be reappointed after their first terms expired on 31 August 2010. The Secretary of State wrote to both Dame Denise Piatt and Ms Watson to thank them for their service.</p>

 Following extensive consultation with experts and key stakeholders, the Department is developing a new secondary uses dataset covering child health, maternity and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) as a key driver to achieving better outcomes of care for mothers, babies and children. The dataset will provide comparative, linked data that can be used to plan and commission services. The dataset will cover such things as referrals to CAMHS, encounters, care planning, interventions, in-patient stays and outcome measures.</p>

The Department's contract with Durham University for this project expires on 31 March 2011. While the CSM project has done valuable work to develop new approaches to the gathering of information on child health and well-being, it no longer meets stakeholders' needs for robust and reliable benchmarking information that would inform service quality and value for money decisions in the current economic climate. The board of the Child and Maternal Health Observatory has concluded that the best course is to discontinue the service from the end of the current contract.</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 January 2011]:</i> The Government launched the Independent Public Service Pension Commission chaired by Lord Hutton last June to conduct a fundamental structural review of public service pension provision which will report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer before Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="110201w0004.htm_para36"><a name="11020175000605">Ahead of the spending review Lord Hutton produced an interim report which found that the value of public service pensions had been increasing following dramatic increase in life expectancy at retirement. Current pensioners are expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to 30% for pensioners in the 1950s. Most of these extra costs have fallen to employers and taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="110201w0004.htm_para37"><a name="11020175000606">At the spending review, based on the clear rationale set out in Lord Hutton's interim report, the Government announced that they would implement progressive changes to the level of employee contributions to public service pensions that lead to an additional saving of £1.8 billion a year from 2014-15, to be phased in from 2012-13. This is equivalent to three percentage point increase on average.  <br>

 The Government are committed to reduce the levels of regulation. There have been several recent government-wide initiatives to reduce regulation, including the one-in one-out system introduced in September 2010 which requires policy makers to address and minimise the net cost to business and civil society. The Government also intend to publish a forward statement of regulation, providing an overview of the Government's regulatory plans up until June 2011.</p>

The taskforce is addressing the question "what can we do to cut red tape for small organisations?" The taskforce is looking at a range of issues that we know cause difficulties for charities including funding, licensing, employment law, and insurance and will report in the spring.</p>
