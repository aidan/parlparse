To ask the President of the Council if she will list those Ministers in her Department who were present at the recent Brit Awards in an official capacity, indicating the organisation acting as their sponsor or host. [76649]<P>

<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Administration Committee what steps she proposes to take to ensure that copies of ministerial statements and accompanying documents are available in the Vote Office at No 7 Millbank on the day of the statement.  [76576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 The Vote Office endeavours to arrange distribution of ministerial statements throughout the Parliamentary estate on the same afternoon that such statements are made, where considerations of security, timing and the quantity of documents make this possible. However, it would be impracticable for the Vote Office to undertake always to distribute unknown quantities of documents which often arrive very late (or even sometimes after a statement) unless a van was made permanently available to the office, which would not be economic.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the Government's policy in respect of possible increases in United Kingdom contributions to the EU budget which do not involve modifying the Fontainebleau rebate procedures.  [75059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The UK is arguing that spending on the existing Union should be stabilised at its present levels by 2006. This will ensure that the present member states can afford the additional costs of enlargement to central and eastern Europe. Stabilisation will help to keep down the largest net contributions, including the UK's "Co-financing" and other reforms of the CAP also have a role here.
<P>

<a name="90315w01.htm_para0">Even with these measures the Fontainebleau arrangements will remain justified. Even after the rebate the UK's net contribution will remain much larger than those of some more prosperous states.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Last year, in my capacity as G7 Chairman, I wrote to Ukranian President Kuchma on three occasions. These letters covered a number of issues relating to the G7/Ukraine Memorandum of Understanding on the closure of Chernobyl, including the safety improvements being carried out at the plant, the importance of power sector reform in Ukraine and the proposed financing package for the completion of the Khmulnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear power reactors. In particular, I consistently stressed the need for Ukraine to honour its commitment to close Chernobyl by the year 2000, as agreed under the Memorandum.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will list the steps taken to work with the European Commission in countering fraud at EU level; and if he will publish the memoranda submitted by Her Majesty's Government to the President of the European Commission.  [76199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 March 1999]:</i> The Government believe that there must be a policy of zero tolerance to fraud and have consistently supported the European Commission in initiatives to fight fraud against the EC budget.
<P>

<a name="90315w01.htm_para1">At the January ECOFIN Council, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor called for a strong, independent head of fraud investigations, reporting to an independent management board. These ideas are being used in discussions currently taking place on how to strengthen internal fraud investigations. Following this, the Government offered practical assistance to the Commission, specifically offering to share UK experience of best practice on codes of conduct for behaviour in public life. I am pleased to say that this offer was welcomed and officials have been in contact to take this forward. It is among the issues that will be covered in joint training with Commission officials and officials from other Member States starting in September of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 An amendment has been made to the Civil Service Order in Council to allow for the appointment of a limited number of Special Advisers to Ministers in the Scottish Parliament and Assembly Secretaries in the National Assembly for Wales. The amendment takes account of the new ministerial arrangements that will apply in Scotland and Wales following devolution, and sets out the terms and conditions under which they can be employed including an upper limit on the numbers that can be appointed. A copy of the amended Order has been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Prime Minister what recent discussions he has had with the Prime Minister of Spain about Gibraltar with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> frontier delays and <i>(b)</i> the allegations made by the Spanish Foreign Minister about criminal activity in Gibraltar; and if he will make a statement.  [76659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In the last month, I have discussed the delays at the Gibraltar/Spain border twice with the Spanish Prime Minister, Sr. Aznar, most recently on 25 February. I made it clear that we regarded the delays as unacceptable and unjustifiable.
<P>

<a name="90315w01.htm_para3">The Spanish Foreign Minister's remarks were made after my meeting on 25 February. I have not discussed them with Sr. Aznar. Sr. Aznar's staff handed over on 26 February a paper referring to some alleged cases of criminal activity in Gibraltar. We have been looking into these allegations, together with the relevant Gibraltar authorities, and expect to respond very shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In June 1997, after discussion with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission was authorised to "passport" Gibraltar-based insurance companies to operate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the European Union. Authorisation for "passporting" in the fields of banking and investment services will be granted when the relevant financial services regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom are satisfied that Gibraltar has introduced the necessary legislation and regulatory structure and procedures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w01.htm_spmin8"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office gave the Foreign Affairs Committee unprecedented access to key official documents for the purpose of its inquiry on Sierra Leone. It is the Government's view that the Intelligence and Security Committee, set up by the previous Government under the Intelligence Services Act 1994, is the appropriate forum for Parliamentary oversight of the Intelligence Agencies. The Intelligence and Security Committee has been conducting its own inquiry into Sierra Leone. No previous Administration has ever agreed to witnesses from the Secret Intelligence Service appearing before Select Committees.

<P>
<a name="90315w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Church Commissioners act as trustees for the management of their own endowment and have no general power to offer investment management for others. However, they are always willing, with their partners in the Archbishops' Council, to consider ways of furthering co-operation with other Churches.

[75336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 There will be no reduction to the World-class Performance Programme. I can confirm that the amount of Lottery money available to sport has not reduced. In fact it has increased. When the Lottery was launched, the good causes expected to receive &#163;9 billion in total over the licence period which ends in September 2001: that is &#163;1.8 billion for each good cause, including sport. The National Lottery is now set to raise &#163;10.6 billion for good causes over the current licence period. On this basis Sport will receive an extra &#163;50 million over this period.

<P>
<a name="90315w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The amount of money available to sport has not reduced but will increase over the current licence period on the basis of current projections.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para3">The allocation Lottery funding to sports and individuals who are in the World-class Performance Programme is a matter for the Sports Councils to decide at the moment on the basis of the forward plans submitted by the national governing bodies of sport and of the competing priorities. The hon. Gentleman may be assured that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are determined to support our athletes. My right hon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 There are a range of initiatives designed to increase the availability of after-school sports provision.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para4">Through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) we have committed &#163;400 million of National Lottery money to out of school hours activities during the current licence period to September 2001. Of this, &#163;180 million has been committed to education activities, &#163;200 million to child care, and &#163;20 million to projects combining child care and education. Out of school hours education projects should involve at least half of all secondary schools, at least a quarter of all primary schools, and at least half of all special schools by 2001. Out of school child care projects should provide places for 865,000 children by 2003.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para5">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has also announced an extra &#163;400 million for the New Opportunities Fund between now and 2001. We have consulted on how this money should be spent and have proposed that part of the additional amount should be committed to an expansion of the existing out of school hours initiative, to enhance the contribution made by summer schools not only to literacy, numeracy but also opportunities for sport.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para6">The Policy Directions issued to NOF ensure that it takes into account relevant national and local strategies in relation to each initiative. For out of school hours learning this includes "Extending Opportunity: a national framework for study support" (in England) and any similar guidance produced elsewhere. Study support is learning activity outside normal lessons and embraces many activities, including sports, games and adventurous outdoor activities.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para7">The National Lottery Act 1998 required NOF to draw up a strategic plan containing its assessment of needs and its priorities in dealing with them, on which it must consult the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. This ensures that there is a proper strategy for distributing Lottery proceeds. No specific targets have been allocated to NOF for providing physical exercise opportunities at after-school clubs, but in reviewing NOF's strategic plan we shall ensure that the projects it supports promote young people's well-being through a range of activities, including sport and creative activities.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para8">The TOP programmes are continuing to prove a valuable resource in enhancing the games element of the PE curriculum. Sport England, together with the Youth Sport Trust, are working with 126 Local Education Authorities and have put equipment and education/training into 10,000 schools. Sport England has provided funding of &#163;1.8 million to support this delivery.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para9">In addition to its extensive range of revenue programmes for young people, Sport England is committed to the Community Sports Co-ordinators. The Co-ordinators will act as a catalyst to assist young people to take maximum advantage of continued participation in sport by substantially improving the network between school, club and community.
<P>

<a name="90315w02.htm_para10">The Lottery Awards for All, a unique small grants scheme, will be focused on groups who have missed out in the past. It will allow all distributors to give out grants of between &#163;500 and &#163;5,000 for capital revenue projects which involve people in their community and encourage school-club links. It will bring people together to enjoy sports and other activities.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> Although the bulk of the information my Department uses on local authority expenditure is collected by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my Department has, since 1998, required all library authorities to provide it with Annual Library Plans, containing structured information about their services and forward strategy and solicits, in a number of individual cases, detailed information on library expenditure.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 1999]:</i> I am aware of possible library closures in a number of authorities and I am looking in detail at these proposals. Some of them are part of a wider restructuring and modernisation of services, but in all cases my concern is to ensure that library authorities continue to meet their statutory responsibility to provide a 'comprehensive and efficient' service. It could be prejudicial to my inquiries to name the authorities concerned.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> The new arrangements reflect the special and significant role that private institutions have in delivering dance and drama provision in England. All EU citizens will be able to apply for assistance under the new arrangements, including the small number of Scottish students who have traditionally gone to England for specialist courses. There is no evidence that there will be an adverse impact on Scottish colleges from the new arrangements, but we are monitoring the position. Further education colleges in Scotland are already eligible for grant-in-aid support from the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department budget for dance and drama activity, and are encouraged

 No. The provision of a telephone service for use by patients and visitors, including the choice of provider, is a matter for individual trusts. Detailed guidance on the setting of fees and charges by NHS trusts is contained in the Treasury publication "The Fees and Charges Guide". Where a service is to be provided by a third party, trusts, should ensure best value both for the hospital and the user by seeking tenders from potential operators.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will publish the financial targets set for each NHS trust in Scotland and the surplus or deficit incurred in each year since 1992-93.  [76145]<P>

 NHS Trusts in Scotland are required by the NHS in Scotland Management Executive to achieve three financial targets.
<P>

<a name="90315w04.htm_para4">These financial targets are to break even on the Income and Expenditure Account, after payment of interest and dividends taking one year with another; to produce a 6 per cent. return on net relevant assets before interest and dividends; and to achieve it's External Financing Limit as set.
<P>

<a name="90315w04.htm_para5">The table shows the surplus and deficits (after payment of interest and dividends) incurred by each Scottish NHS Trust in the years (a) 1992-93, (b) 1993-94, (c) 1994-95, (d) 1995-96, (e) 1996-97 and (f) 1997-98. Surplus and deficit figures are not yet available for 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="90315w04.htm_para6">The deficits incurred by Trusts often arise as a result of the losses on disposal of fixed assets in-year.

the preamble to and in the objectives of protocol. This approach is consistent with the European Community legislation controlling the release and marketing of genetically modified organisms and with the Government's general policy on the planting of trial and commercial genetically modified crops. Rigorous scientific risk assessment, carried out as part of the strict regulation of GM crops, identifies appropriate risk management measures to ensure that risks are reduced to a minimum. In the UK, field trials of GM crops may require risk management such as pollen barriers or isolation distances. In respect of the commercial planting of GM crops, the Government support a programme of managed development involving farm scale evaluations with full ecological monitoring. The Government believe that this approach offers sufficient safeguards to ensure that large-scale plantings do not proceed until there is sufficient evidence that a particular crop does not harm the environment.

[75901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 prescribe an extremely strict standard of 0.1 microgrammes per litre for individual pesticides. Since 1989 water companies have been obliged to enter into legally binding programmes to install pesticide removal processes whenever water supplies have exceeded the standard.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is governed by EC Directive 90/220. The European Commission published its proposal to amend the Directive in February 1998 and since then the UK Government have played an active role in negotiating the draft amending Directive. The Commission's proposal seeks to make a number of significant changes to the Directive, such as strengthening provisions on environmental risk assessment and monitoring, streamlining some procedures, ensuring greater transparency and better labelling requirements, and providing for the consultation of EU ethics and scientific committees. The Government have been active in their support for revision of the Directive to ensure full protection for human health and the environment.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 1999 : Column: 457</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90315w05.htm_para14">In the Government's view the amendment should be taken forward seriously and rapidly. At the Environment Council this week, I intend to press the German Presidency to devote time to this dossier with a view to securing common position at the June Council.
<P>

<a name="90315w05.htm_para15">Pending the revision of the Directive, EU Environment Ministers agreed in December 1998 to use the flexibility within the existing Directive to introduce new principles on risk assessment and monitoring. These new requirements, based on provisions in the draft amending Directive, were adopted as a direct result of public concerns about GMOs and the European Parliament's call for action. The new principles on risk assessment and monitoring will allow a clearer picture to be built up of the direct and indirect, and immediate and delayed, effects of GMOs on the environment.
<P>

<a name="90315w05.htm_para16">On top of the new EC requirements, my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I announced before the House of Lords Select Committee on 21 October 1998 that the Government have reached agreement with the plant breeding industry for a managed development programme for herbicide tolerant GM crops. Farm-scale evaluations will ensure that first commercial plantings of herbicide tolerant GM crops will be strictly limited and monitored for ecological effects alongside comparable plantings of conventional crops. The Government are funding ecological studies of the diversity and abundance of plants and invertebrates associated with the management of GM and non-GM crops to test whether there are any significant differences, initially over a four year period. This will assist consideration of what effects GM crops may have on higher species and our agricultural landscape. If ecological monitoring reveals adverse effects then appropriate action will be taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the negotiating position of the UK delegation to the biosafety protocol discussions in Cartagena, Colombia; what support Britain gave to proposals from the Miami Group; and at what stages Britain supported moves which would exempt genetically modified ingredients from the clear labelling and advance notification proposals.  [73980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given to the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) on 9 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>153-54</i>, which set out the UK's negotiating line for the meeting. The EU maintained its agreed position throughout the negotiations in Cartagena, and the UK remained firmly within that position. The UK, together with European colleagues, attempted to build a bridge between the positions adopted by most developing countries and the Miami Group. The EU did not support any proposals that would have exempted living modified organisms (LMOs) within the scope of the protocol being subject to a requirement for documentation and clear identification. An EU compromise package introduced in the final stages of the negotiations with a view to achieving consensus included a provision enabling the first Meeting of the Parties to decide whether and how the protocol's procedures would apply to the transboundary movement of LMOs for

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason the UK at the recent Biosafety Protocol meeting in Colombia did not support inclusion of the precautionary principle in the operational articles of the Protocol.  [75091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> The UK goal was to secure reference to the precautionary principle in the Protocol. We therefore strongly supported the EU submission prior to the penultimate meeting on the Biosafety Protocol to include a reference to the precautionary principle in the Preamble, and in the Objective of the Protocol. The latter provides the fundamental underpin for all the provisions of the Protocol.
<P>

<a name="90315w06.htm_para0">While these proposals were retained in the draft negotiating text for the Colombia meeting, there was considerable opposition to the inclusion of references to the precautionary principle in the last round of negotiations. In the final stages, the EU put forward a compromise package based on the text put forward by the Chair of the Working Group. The package included retaining a reference to the precautionary approach in the Preamble and in the Objective of the Protocol. In an attempt to achieve consensus, the EU was prepared to agree to delete wording based on the precautionary principle in the article dealing with the decision procedure if the reference to the precautionary principle remained in the Objective and a formulation of it was contained in general principles section of the risk assessment annex: all notifications under the Protocol would have required a risk assessment. Hence, the operational provisions of the Protocol would have been based on the precautionary principle.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make money available to local authorities to help them to enable shopping centres in town and cities to compete equally with designated out-of-town shopping areas.  [75277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to encourage retail development in the centre of towns and cities rather than at out of town locations. This was set out in our Response to the Select Committee report on Shopping Centres [Cmnd 3729], which also reaffirmed our commitment to Planning Policy Guidance note 6 (PPG6): Town Centres and Retail Developments. Through our funding of the Association of Town Centre Management and the Civic Trust, we have been assisting local authorities to promote town centre management by preparing and disseminating good practice.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many <i>(a)</i> out-of-town shopping mall and <i>(b)</i> superstore planning applications in England have been refused, and on what principal grounds, on appeal in the past year.  [75504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Planning permission has been refused, on appeal, in respect of two applications for superstores in England, in 1998, primarily on the grounds that they failed the policy tests in PPG6.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w07.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Prior: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will make it his practice to publish lists of <i>(a)</i> all outstanding planning permissions for superstores, <i>(b)</i> all superstore planning appeals that have been approved in the past five years, with a summary of the reasons for the approval and <i>(c)</i> all superstore planning appeals that have been refused in the past five years, with a summary of the reasons for the refusal; and if he will make a statement;  [75779]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Most decisions on planning applications for retail developments are taken by local planning authorities. They provide statistical returns on applications which they handle under the general category of "major retail, distribution and servicing". The information requested in respect of appeals is not held centrally over the timescale requested. It is, therefore, not feasible to assemble the information requested, except at disproportionate cost. We have no current plans to publish such lists.

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> Like all other Government Departments and Agencies, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency submits quarterly reports to CCTA on progress towards millennium compliance. These reports are analysed by the Cabinet Office and from the basis of my right hon. Friend the President of the Council's reports to Parliament. It would not be appropriate for me to anticipate her next statement, but, when it is made, a copy of DVLA's report will be placed both in the Library and on the Internet. Reports will be accompanied by a series of tables that illustrate how well departments and agencies are doing against a number of specific performance criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In December 1998 we issued a consultation paper "A New Financial Framework for Local Authority Housing: Resource Accounting in the Housing Revenue Account" seeking views on proposals for changes to local authority housing finance. The proposals would introduce a form of resource accounting for the Housing Revenue Account (HRA). It is also proposed to remove expenditure on rent rebates from the HRA leaving the account as a landlord account reflecting the cost of providing housing at below market rents. The aim of the proposed New Framework is to make housing accounts easier to understand for both councils and their tenants and to enable better-informed decisions about the management of housing assets. Consultations are not yet complete and there will be an announcement about our plans in due course. A copy of the consultation paper is in the Library.

<a name="90315w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Land Use Change Statistics published by my Department provide information on the area of land changing to residential use that was previously developed for urban uses. (Urban uses comprise residential, transport and utilities, industry and commerce, community services, previously developed vacant land and derelict land). Numbers of new dwellings built on previously developed land (excluding conversions of existing dwellings) are also recorded. This information provides statistics for the proportion of new residential development that takes place on previously developed land.
<P>

<a name="90315w07.htm_para0">Some previously developed land is located in rural areas. My Department has developed the analysis of land use change to identify separately changes that occurred inside and outside urban areas as defined for the 1991 Census. At present it is not possible to distinguish those land use changes that occurred within town centres, but this might become possible following research under way to define the boundaries of town centres for statistical purposes.
<P>

<a name="90315w07.htm_para1">The latest results of the Land Use Change Statistics, together with more information about how they are compiled, were published in the statistical bulletin "Land Use Change in England No. 13", a copy of which is in the House of Commons Library.

and 2000 and over 350 responses were received. The UK packaging recovery rate is expected to have reached approximately 32 per cent. in 1998 and the interim business targets are designed to enable the UK to achieve the mandatory EC Directive recovery and recycling targets in 2001. Industry itself has reported that there was an oversupply of reprocessing capacity in 1998 compared with the targets that had to be met and this was damaging the market. The increase in the interim business recovery and recycling targets should therefore generate the necessary momentum to enable sufficient activity to be carried out to achieve the 2001 targets. A further consideration was the need for sufficient resources to be directed at generating the necessary collection and reprocessing capacity that will be needed to meet targets in 2001. With this additional infrastructure in place, the UK should be able to meet these mandatory targets.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The table from the 1996 English House Condition Survey indicates that pensioners aged over 80 years are much more likely to live in poor quality housing than pensioners below that age. The likelihood of the latter living in poor quality housing is on average not that much different from the population as a whole.

 The Franchising Director's office currently publishes information from train operators' Passenger Charters in its Quarterly Bulletin.

The Franchising Director is currently consulting on improved public performance measures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what conclusions he has reached concerning the types of planning application on which the new Mayor for London should be consulted by the local planning authorities as being of potential strategic importance; and if he will make a statement.  [77234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under the proposals set out in the White Paper, A Mayor and Assembly for London, and reflected in the Greater London Authority Bill currently before Parliament, London boroughs and the City of London will remain the planning and development control authorities for their areas. However, their Unitary Development Plans must be in general conformity with the Mayor's Spatial Development Strategy. The Mayor must also have a means of representing the broader pan-London view for individual planning applications where issues of genuine strategic importance are concerned. The Mayor will therefore become a statutory consultee for a limited number of applications of potential strategic importance, to be defined in secondary legislation. He or she will also have a fall-back power to direct the refusal of planning permission in these cases where this is considered necessary on strategic grounds. The applicant would then have the normal right of appeal to the Secretary of State, who will also continue to be able to call in applications for his own decision where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para0">Last August the Government issued a consultation paper setting out our initial proposals for the categories of development on which the Mayor is to be consulted. A summary of the responses received is being placed in the Library.

<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para1">Having considered the responses, we have decided that the broad categories set out in the consultation paper will be retained, but with changes to some of the sub-categories and thresholds proposed.
<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para2">In summary, the categories will be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Very large scale development including:</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) major residential developments (over 500 units or 10 ha);</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) Applications likely to affect key strategic policies, including:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c)the loss of housing (more than 200 units) or designated housing land (more than 4 ha);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the loss of land (more than 4 ha) in use or designated for employment purposes;</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para3">A paper setting out the proposed definitions in more detail, and showing the main changes from the consultation draft, is being placed in the Library, and is available from the Government Office for London.
<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para4">We believe this package represents an appropriate balance. It will ensure that the Mayor is able to have a say in key planning applications in support of his or her Spatial Development Strategy, whilst recognising that the vast majority of planning applications are properly a matter for the local planning authorities. Setting clear thresholds will provide certainty and minimise the scope for dispute. We expect that between 150 and 250 planning applications out of some 70,000 submitted in Greater London each year will fall into the categories identified above.
<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para5">The Mayor will be consulted in parallel with other statutory consultees, and will have no power to delay the taking of a decision by the local planning authority. He or she will, however, have a further period of 14 days after the local planning authority has reached a view within which to use the fall-back power of direction.
<P>

<a name="90315w10.htm_para6">Subject to Parliamentary approval, it is intended that the Order defining these categories of applications will come into effect when the Mayor begins work in July 2000. It will be subject to review and, if necessary,

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the measures currently planned to be taken, pursuant to the enactment of Common Position (EC) 8/1999 (1999/c 55/01), with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> recitals 8 and 16, <i>(b)</i> their costs and <i>(c)</i> data privacy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w11.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90315w11.htm_para3">The Common position is that adopted by the Telecommunications Council on 21 December 1998 on a series of guidelines, including the identification of projects of common interest, for trans-European networks for the electronic Interchange of Data between Administrations (IDA). IDA aims to achieve the most efficient and cost effective means of data interchange in support of European Community policies.
<P>

<a name="90315w11.htm_para4">The Common position relates to a second phase of IDA that will run for five years from the point of adoption. The first phase ran from 1995-1997 and supported Community policies by the development of networks for the exchange of data related to subjects including agriculture, fisheries, health, statistics, employment and customs matters. The second phase is likely to continue work in some of these areas and other areas where Member States and the European Community identify the need for data interchange.
<P>

<a name="90315w11.htm_para5">At this stage, there are no specific proposals on exchange of information related to Recitals 8 and 16 of the Common position text. The proposed budget for the IDA guidelines proposal is estimated as euro 38.5 million for the first three years of the programme.
<P>

<a name="90315w11.htm_para6">Any work carried forward under IDA, will take full account of the sensitivity of the data to be passed across a network and the relevant data protection legislation. Appropriate security measures will be taken to protect sensitive data.

 Estimated additional revenue of some &#163;1.8 billion would be raised in 1999-2000 if the Upper Earnings Limit on employees' Class 1 contributions was increased from its present level to the same level as the threshold of higher rate income tax, which is to be set at &#163;622 a week from April 1999. If the Upper Earnings Limit was removed, the estimated additional revenue raised would be &#163;4.2 billion for that year.
<P>

<a name="90315w11.htm_para7">The figures assume that the current 10 per cent. Class 1 contribution rate would apply to earnings above the present Upper Earnings Limit, and that this limit would remain in place for the calculation of employee and employer contracted-out rebates.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The definitions of high and low suspicion are set out in the Governmental Statistical Service Area Benefit Review Results published in November 1998 and you may wish to refer to this document. The published headline figures of fraud and error exclude high and low suspicion of fraud. We are following up specific cases so that those originally classified as high suspicion of fraud can be subsequently confirmed as fraud, re-classified as correct, or remain as high suspicion.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of our commitment to improve the administration of the benefit system we have been working to clarify the definitions as published in the above report. The revised definitions are set out below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Low suspicion of fraud means that the reviewing officer suspects that fraud exists, but the evidence is weak, and benefit entitlement does not change. For example, a customer with a long-term claim appears to be living above their means, but there are no solid grounds for suspicion, and no means of establishing the source of the financing.</FONT></UL>

<a name="90315w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No one will qualify for the State Second Pension prior to April 2002, as this is the proposed implementation date. The qualifying conditions for the first stage of the State Second Pension are set out in Chapter 6 of the Green Paper "A new contract for welfare: Partnership in Pensions". The introduction of the second stage of the State Second Pension is dependent on stakeholder pensions becoming established as low-cost, value-for money, funded second pensions. It is expected that, once the second stage is implemented, the qualifying conditions will remain the same.

 This Department does not hold retirement survey data in a format that would allow the information to be produced.

Findings were published in "The Dynamics of Retirement" (1998) DSS Research Report No. 72, The Stationery Office. Converting the data to an appropriate format and producing a reliable analysis would involve disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w13.htm_wqn7"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will define the broad-based mechanism to check awards of disability living allowance under the new periodic review system referred to in his letter to hon. Members of 28 January.  [76765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w13.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We are determined to ensure that people are receiving the correct amount of benefit. From April 1999, a new fairer system of periodic inquiry into benefit entitlement will commence for existing recipients of Disability Living Allowance (DLA). The process will incorporate lessons already learned and will be evaluated and refined as it develops.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para2">Initially, cases will be selected for inquiry action on a proportional basis across the range of awards to be included. People selected for inquiry action will be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire, based on the current claim form for DLA, either by post or at a home visit. These two methods of approach will be applied evenly across the range of people selected to help identify the best means of approach in individual cases. Once completed, the inquiry form will provide the Benefits Agency (BA) with an up to date picture of the need that the individual has for help with personal care and mobility and allow the BA to determine whether a review of entitlement would be appropriate. This will enable awards to be increased or decreased in line with entitlement. All staff involved in the new processes will receive full training before commencing this new work. The inquiry action will be monitored and evaluated after six months of operation and the findings will be used to continue to improve the process.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para3">Initially, the new system will exclude DLA recipients whose cases were examined by the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) and those groups of disabled people that were specifically excluded from the action of the BIP. People who are terminally ill and meet the criteria set out in Section 66(2)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and people with a fixed period award due to end within the next three years will also not

be contacted. Full details are set out at in my Written Answer to the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) on 10 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>251-52</i>.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para4">Some disabling conditions, and the needs that they generate, change very little over time whilst others can be very variable in effect and/or degenerative in nature. The BA is therefore working to establish the proper frequency with which individuals should be asked about their current needs, so that, in the future, inquiries can be made at the most appropriate time and new claimants can be advised from the outset when inquiries are likely to be made in their case. This action does not affect the responsibility of all claimants to tell the BA about changes that may affect benefit entitlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w13.htm_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what discussions he has had with the Meteorological Office concerning its proposals to pilot a study of weather stations in Scotland to take account of the wind chill factor in the assessment of cold weather payments; how much such a scheme would cost; and what plans he has to initiate such a scheme.  [76146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w13.htm_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 No discussions have taken place with the Meteorological Office on such a pilot. Nor is it possible to estimate the cost of introducing into the current scheme an allowance for the effects of wind speed because no trigger criterion exists combining it with external air temperature.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para5">A number of formulae are used to calculate the combined effects of air temperature and wind speed on the human body when in the open air (commonly referred to as "windchill"). However, the Building Research Establishment advises that these are not appropriate when assessing heat loss from buildings, because different heat transfer mechanisms apply.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para6">We are committed to tackling the problems associated with vulnerable people keeping warm and have already introduced numerous substantial measures to meet this objective. The most recent ones were announced in the Budget and will provide extra help for pensioners and young children in low income families. They include increasing the level of Winter Fuel Payments for pensioner households to &#163;100 from next Winter and a substantial increase in the rates of benefit payable in income-related benefits for children under the age of eleven. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill proposals will also provide extra help for those in greatest need who have a long-term illness or are disabled.
<P>

<a name="90315w13.htm_para7">Taking into account all the measures already introduced we do not believe that amending the Cold Weather Payment scheme would be the most effective way to get help to those who need it most.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on current progress on the introduction of the new National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2).  [77192]<P>

<P>
<a name="90315w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Social Security, in his written answer on 18 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>368-70</i>, 



<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 1999 : Column: 487</I><P>
updated the House about progress that the Contributions Agency had made in addressing outstanding issues relating to the introduction of the new National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2). These issues include recording 1997-98 National Insurance Contributions, links between the NIRS2 system and claims for benefit, and wider roll-out of NIRS2 functionality.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para0">Since January the Contributions Agency has worked closely with Andersen Consulting to address these issues. Details of the progress that has been made are set out. Where issues have not yet been fully resolved, the Contributions and Benefits Agencies have endeavoured to minimise their impact on individuals and action is being put in place to identify the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para1">In the light of outstanding issues relating to the introduction of NIRS2, it has been necessary to review the Contributions and Benefits Agencies' objectives for the remainder of the year and to re-prioritise activity. To ensure that we receive the greatest benefit from the system capacity, I have decided that the recording of 1997-98 National Insurance Contributions and payment of age-related rebates should be the first priorities. This will minimise the disruption to individuals and ensure that payments to individuals' personal pensions are made. However, a consequence of this decision is that some system backlogs will not be cleared until into the next financial year.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para2">My hon. Friend the Minister of State reported that, at 11 January, 31 million National Insurance contributions for the tax year 1997-98 had been posted. At 14 March 1999, 39 million items had been posted for the year, with 5.8 million items still to be posted. Action is underway to clear these outstanding items swiftly.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para3">The cumulative total of age-related rebate payments paid to occupational and personal pension schemes in respect of individual scheme members in this financial year has increased from &#163;1,411 million on 4 January 1999 to &#163;1,882 million on 1 March. This is over 75 per cent. of the expected net total for the year. (The cumulative total figure includes a compensation element.) Action is underway to clear the outstanding backlog.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para4">The NIRS2 link to Retirement Pensions, Widows Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Incapacity Benefit is being used to process new claims to benefit. Where 1997-98 contributions are not yet recorded, there is a continuing need to make initial awards of Retirement Pension and emergency payments to widows. Initial and emergency awards of National Insurance benefits made since April 1998 will be reviewed following completion of the recording of 1997-98 National Insurance contribution information. The Benefits Agency hopes to begin reviewing these claims from April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para5">The Benefits Agency continues to calculate entitlement to State Earnings Related Pensions clerically for people who request this. 5,703 such calculations had been completed at 15 March.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para6">By 8 February 1999 a cumulative total of over &#163;415 million of self-employed and voluntary National Insurance contributions had been billed and/or collected through the monthly payment method. In addition, over &#163;286 million had been billed through the quarterly payment method.

The exercise to process Scottish Juvenile registrations is complete. The full Juvenile Registration facilities were made available on 10 March 1999.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para9">All the work involved is being taken forward through a coordinated plan agreed between the Agencies involved. In order to minimise the impact on customers, we have set up a Benefits Agency taskforce that will take on responsibility for benefit claims affected by the delays. This will give customers a single point of contact by both telephone and post. The taskforce can be contacted, at local call rates, on 08456 010586 between 08.30 and 16.30 Monday to Friday, or customers can write to the taskforce at PO Box 6, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE98 1XB.

For plans which meet most of the planning guidance but have some gaps in information, approval will be conditional on the subsequent submission of material to fill the gaps. Where plans do not show that the statutory duty to provide nursery education places for four year olds will be met, where there is clear evidence of a failure in partnership working or where the plan falls well short of meeting the criteria in the planning guidance, approval will be deferred until an acceptable plan is submitted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w14.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Our manifesto commitment to get all young people on the road to a Level 2 qualification by the year 2000 is being taken forward by our Investing in Young People strategy. A key component of the strategy is the expansion of National Traineeships, as part of the reform of Youth Training. 28,000 people have now started National Traineeships, which build on the success of Modern Apprenticeships and are available in 46 sectors of industry and commerce. A target of 100,000 starts has been set for March 2000.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para13">The strategy is wide ranging and includes piloting of an Education Maintenance Allowance in 12 areas, refocusing of the Careers Service on those most in need, expansion of the New Start strategy, and implementation of the Right to Time for Study legislation.
<P>

<a name="90315w14.htm_para14">We expect to develop the strategy further in the light of the forthcoming Social Exclusion Unit report into young people not in education, employment or training.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The nursery education voucher scheme was replaced in September 1997 by local Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships and Plans which, from September 1998, have guaranteed a free, part-time early education place for all four year olds, for the three terms before compulsory school age, for those parents who want one in the maintained, private or voluntary sectors. The savings which accrued have been allocated to fund the establishment of a pilot scheme of 25 Early Excellence Centres by 2001, of which 17 have already been announced. From September 1999, additional funding will be provided to expand early education places for three year olds.

 The Home Office has issued guidance, in conjunction with the DfEE, to both police forces and local educational authorities on the application of the truancy provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

The Faculty has recently established a database for use by forces on information relating to the policing of young people with a view to disseminating good policing practice.

 15 complaints cases were recorded as having been referred to another force for investigation in England and Wales in 1997-98, the latest year for which figures are available. Each case may consist of one or more complaint. This figure does not include investigations involving allegations of criminal or disciplinary offences in which no complaint has been received from a member of the public.

 Individual targets will be set for each force for the recruitment, retention and progression of ethnic minority officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w18.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The primary purpose of the Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) is to investigate the medical complaints of UK Gulf War veterans and, so far as possible, to diagnose what they are suffering from and recommend appropriate treatment, or provide reassurance if no illness is found.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para6">When the MAP was first established in 1993, its first Head, Wing Commander (now Group Captain) Bill Coker, initially carried out those tests he felt necessary on clinical grounds to establish a diagnosis. When the number of patients referred to the MAP increased, he carried out a number of screening tests, similar to those then used by the US Department of Defense's Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Programme (CCEP), which is broadly equivalent to the MAP. These screening tests did not include a test to detect the presence of uranium because Group Captain Coker had not previously seen any features in patients to indicate that such testing was clinically necessary. The US experience had suggested that the urinary excretion of uranium was only significantly increased in those veterans with retained fragments of depleted uranium (DU). As MOD was not aware of any UK Service personnel who had sustained shrapnel injuries from DU-based ammunition, it was not thought necessary to screen routinely for uranium excretion, although testing could be carried out on a case by case basis if clinically indicated. Any other tests considered clinically appropriate would also be performed, these additional tests varying from patient to patient. This system of investigation was in place at the time of the Royal College of Physicians' (RCP) clinical audit in 1995.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para7">The RCP's subsequent report, published in July 1995, endorsed the MAP's professional independence and integrity and made specific comments on how the Programme could be improved. However, with the exception of a recommendation concerning psychiatric assessments, the RCP did not recommend any changes to the tests and examinations carried out by the MAP.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para8">The baseline tests currently carried out on MAP patients by St. Thomas's Hospital on the MAP's behalf are very similar to those which were in place at the time of the RCP audit in 1995. They are as follows:

intend that this will be made public in due course. This work will then be followed by a clinical audit which will include a review of the range of tests and examinations currently undertaken at the MAP.

<a name="90315w18.htm_para21">The tests listed are the baseline investigations at the MAP; additional investigations and/or referrals to other consultants/specialists are sometimes required for particular patients. As part of this, any tests which are considered clinically appropriate by the examining MAP physician, which could include those to detect the presence of uranium, are arranged. However, MAP physicians have not so far considered it clinically necessary to conduct tests on any MAP patients to detect the presence of uranium.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para22">Contrary to some recent media reports, the MOD is not conducting testing in relation to the possible exposure of Gulf veterans to DU, secret or otherwise.

I expect to publish the results of this work shortly and will make arrangements for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para24">The MAP is not a research programme and it is not involved in any research concerning DU. Although the Ministry of Defence is funding a range of studies into aspects of Gulf veterans' illnesses, none of these are specifically aimed at investigating the relationship between possible exposure to DU and the illnesses being experienced by some Gulf veterans.
<P>

<a name="90315w18.htm_para25">The Ministry of Defence is well aware that a link has been suggested between DU exposure and Gulf veterans' illnesses. However, this is only one of a number of factors which have been suggested as causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses and, pending further medical and scientific evidence, MOD is keeping an open mind on this issue. MOD would be very interested to see any new relevant information on this subject.

As explained in a Minute laid before Parliament on 4 February 1999, our offer to destroy Saudi JP233s, to provide 100 Paveway 3s as replacements, and to provide modifications and training to allow the Saudis to operate the new system underlines our commitment to the Ottawa Convention, while maintaining strong relations with a strategically important, friendly country.

<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 1999 : Column: 507</I><P>
Our policies, applied rigorously and reinforced by strong leadership from the Service Chiefs, are designed to ensure that racism is eliminated.
<P>

<a name="90315w19.htm_para0">All personnel, of whatever rank, need to understand that there is no home or hiding place for racist attitudes or behaviour. This must be understood not only by serving personnel but also by potential recruits and society generally. The Armed Forces, as a major institution and public body, are taking a clear stand on this. Prejudice, when encountered, is being challenged. Those who transgress the high standards required are, and will continue to be, dealt with firmly. This will include discharge if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90315w19.htm_para1">It has long been the policy of the Armed Forces that Service life precludes membership of, or support for, groups or organisations whose purpose includes incitement to racial hatred and violence. All three Services already have in place regulations and instruction which give clear guidance to the Chain of Command on the rules, grounds and process governing membership of groups which is incompatible with Service life. This morning, each Service Chief has written to the Command Chain to remind them of the powers and procedures that are available to them and to ensure they are applied in all appropriate circumstances.

The security situation in Freetown is being monitored carefully. UK Based staff will return to Post as soon as it is safe to do so. Visa issuing will resume as soon as practicable thereafter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the Government's policy is on sanctions; and if he will make a statement.  [77194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w22.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The Government have recently completed a wide-ranging review of its sanctions policy. All Whitehall Departments with an interest in sanctions were involved in the review.
<P>

<a name="90315w22.htm_para0">As a result, the Government have decided to launch a new policy of better targeted "smarter" sanctions. This will sharpen the focus and effectiveness of sanctions whilst trying to minimise their impact on ordinary people, including children, and on our own commercial and economic interests.
<P>

<a name="90315w22.htm_para1">Apart from the threat of or use of force, which will remain essential in the more extreme cases, sanctions are the only coercive measure available to the international community to respond to challenges to international peace and security. The review concluded that they will remain an important tool of our foreign policy.
<P>

<a name="90315w22.htm_para2">The review also concluded, however, that better targeting would be likely to enhance the effectiveness of international sanctions and minimise the risk of harm to ordinary people. A range of sanctions, of varying type and severity, is available and different measures may be selected depending on particular circumstances. Comprehensive sanctions should be reserved for cases where the objective is to isolate and contain a very serious transgressor.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 1999 : Column: 516</I><P>
The review concluded that although the circumstances in which sanctions are imposed vary from case to case, there are a number of broad principles that should normally be followed. Sanctions should:
<P>

<a name="90315w22.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be targeted to hit the regime, rather than ordinary people.
<P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90315w22.htm_para8">The review also agreed a revised set of inter-Departmental procedures for the efficient imposition, amendment, and lifting of sanctions, as well as for their enforcement and monitoring. These will further improve co-ordination between Whitehall Departments on sanctions issues.
<P>

<a name="90315w22.htm_para9">I shall keep the House informed of current sanctions and their scope on a yearly basis. All new sanctions or any amendments to existing sanctions will be announced at the time. We shall shortly be laying in the Library of the House a list of all sanctions imposed by the UK. An updated version will be laid in the Library annually (or more frequently if policy changes require a revision).

<P>

 Our Embassy in Sana'a has provided modest financial support for human rights organisations operating in Yemen.

Of these 28 were reported where blood transfusion or blood product receipt was a possible risk factor (although other risk factors may have also been present). The Haemophilia Society reports that there are 105 people infected with hepatitis C through their National Health Service treatment with blood products. A number of NHS patients other than haemophiliacs will have acquired hepatitis C infection.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what changes by health authority area have taken place in dental registrations of <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> adults since the introduction of the 15 month registration period. [75332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w23.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The 15 month registration period was introduced in September 1996 and information on the percentage of the population registered with a dentist for NHS care for each quarter from that date to September 1998 is given in the following table. Prior to September 1996 the registration period for adults ran for two years from the date of registration or re-registration; the registration period for a child ran from the date of registration or re-registration to the 31 December of the following year.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para8">The introduction of the 15 month period for adults and action by the Dental Practice Board to remove duplicate registrations, has led to a decrease in the number of adult registrations in all Health Authorities.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para9">The main effect of the introduction of the 15 month period for child registrations has been to remove the seasonal effect resulting from the lapse of all child registrations at the end of each year. This last occurred in December 1997 and since that date the pattern of registrations has levelled out in all Health Authorities.

<a name="90315w23.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what percentage of treatments requiring prior approval from the Dental Practices Board was submitted to dental reference officers for further examination in each of the last three years; what percentage was refused; and what was the <i>(a)</i> shortest, <i>(b)</i> longest and <i>(c)</i> average time taken to consider these submissions.  [75310]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w23.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Information for 1995-96 is not available.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para11">In 1996-97, 6 per cent. of prior approval applications in England, Wales and the Isle of Man were referred to dental reference officers for further investigation and 71 per cent. of these patients were seen ie 4 per cent. of the total number of applications. In 1997-98, 9 per cent. were investigated further and 56 per cent. of patients were seen ie 5 per cent. of the total number of applications.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para12">Of those patients seen in 1996-97, the dental officer had a fundamental disagreement with the treatment plan in 0.47 per cent. of cases and had a major disagreement in 4.72 per cent. of cases. For patients seen in 1997-98, there was a fundamental disagreement in 0.38 per cent. of cases and a major disagreement in 3.48 per cent. of cases. However, refusal to give approval takes place only after further consultation at the Dental Practice Board.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para13">In 1996-97, the quickest approval was given in 45 days, the average time taken was 85 days, and the longest time taken was 138 days. In 1997-98, the equivalent periods were 46, 97 and 124 days respectively.

[75312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w23.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 A Peer Review scheme for general dental practitioners (GDPs) in Wales was introduced as a pilot in September 1991. The pilot scheme has been twice reviewed by outside consultants, and on each occasion it was concluded that the scheme was a valuable initiative. The latest review in June 1996 reported favourably on the cost effectiveness and benefit for patients.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para15">The Peer Review scheme and Audit for GDPs is well established. An Assessment Panel composed of representatives from the dental profession and the Welsh Office, is responsible for the funding, probity, training and development in Wales.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para16">Details concerning the budget for Peer Review in 1999-2000 will not be known until the end of March. Funding for dental audit will fall within the Clinical Governance remit of Local Health Groups which all have dental membership on their boards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w23.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Information for 1995-96 is not available. Of courses of treatment scheduled for payment for England, Wales and the Isle of Man in 1996-97 and 1997-98, about 0.5 per cent. and 0.6 per cent. respectively were referred to a dental reference officer for scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para19">Of those patients seen, the Dental Officer had a major or fundamental disagreement with the treatment in 1.75 per cent. of cases in 1996-97 and 1.37 per cent. of cases in 1997-98. These percentages cover both poor quality and invalid treatments. The Dental Officer was unable to comment in 3 per cent. of cases seen in 1996-97 and 4 per cent. in 1997-98.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w23.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 I recognise that, in the more rural parts of Wales, patients who are not registered with a dentist can sometimes find it difficult to obtain NHS dental treatment close to home.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para21">Stage 2 of the Welsh Office dental initiative, launched on 10 July 1998, introduced more flexible conditions specifically designed to address the particular problems being encountered in rural parts of Wales. It offers the possibility of enhanced levels of grant aid for dentists who want to open new part-time or branch practices in certain areas where this would be the best way of meeting local needs.

<a name="90315w23.htm_para23">Changes introduced in September 1996 brought the child registration system in line with the adult system, with both running for a period of 15 months from the date of registration or re-registration. Prior to this child registrations ran from the date of registration or re-registration to the 31 December of the following calendar year, which created a seasonal pattern in registrations. The change was fully effective by the end of December 1997 but care should be taken when comparing data from different times of the year where one quarter was prior to September 1996 as data are not strictly comparable.
<P>

<a name="90315w23.htm_para24">Despite general improvements in the oral health of the population, and of children in particular, there are considerable regional variations. Even in areas where the prevalence of tooth decay is low, there remain pockets of disease frequently related to social deprivation. The Department has developed a targeted incentive scheme to increase the registration of children in their early years. This will deliver enhanced fees to dentists for registered patients aged 5 and under who live in specified areas.

<a name="90315w25.htm_para2"><i>(c)</i> Until 1994-95 most of the proceeds of sale were returned to Health Authorities. Since then the normal procedure is for sale proceeds to be retained by the Welsh Office and used to part fund the All Wales Capital Programme. Health Authority and Trusts may retain the receipt for a related capital development on production of a sufficiently convincing business case.Following the transfer of functions, this issue will be a matter for the National Assembly.

 In Wales the Care in the Community initiative was not funded through a special transitional grant, as it was in England, but was instead distributed as part of the revenue support grant settlement. The distribution of the additional resources was identified as part of the settlement announcement each year and are given in table 1. The amounts spent by each local authority on personal social services in the independent sector are given in table 2. The latest available information on home care expenditure for each local authority in Wales is given in table 3.

 Identification and monitoring of abuse of older people in care and their protection are the responsibility of local and health authorities in Wales. Information is not held centrally on this. We have established a multi-agency working group, including senior police representatives, to make recommendations on the protection of all vulnerable adults including older people. The policy and practice guidance which will be the outcome of this work will be for the National Assembly to consider.

 No commercial plantings of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops will take place in 1999. The Government are determined to ensure that these crops do not harm the environment. We have therefore reached agreement with the industry on a programme of managed development starting this spring, whereby the first field-scale plantings of the crops will be strictly limited and monitored for ecological effects alongside conventional varieties.

 Since 1991-92, the Ministry has funded three research projects which have incorporated information on ferrets and shot guns as methods for rabbit control. The projects involve one research group whose contracts have been extended for fixed periods following reviews of their work. The information on ferrets and shot guns includes results from research funded by other organisations. This research found that, for ferrets, rabbit populations were reduced by no more than 35 per cent. and, for shot guns, by only 30 per cent.

<a name="90315w27.htm_para4">The research programme for 1999-2000 has been reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Krebs report and a research requirement document was published in April 1998. Research will be focused on understanding the causes of outbreaks of bovine TB and developing improved strategies to reduce the number of outbreaks, especially by creating a cattle vaccine. For details of the research projects for 1999-2000 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given to our hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on 10 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>300</i>.

<a name="90315w27.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the likelihood of the UK's dairy beef herds losing their TB-free status and <i>(b)</i> the implications such a development would have for UK agriculture; and if he will make a statement.  [76290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w27.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 March 1999]:</i> The officially tuberculosis-free (OTF) status of an individual bovine herd within Great Britain is suspended if an animal in that herd reacts positively to a tuberculin test or if, for any other reason, a veterinary inspector suspects that an animal in that herd is infected with tuberculosis.
<P>

<a name="90315w27.htm_para5">The EU legislation (Directive 64/432/EEC), as it currently applies, does not provide for member states, or regions of member states, to obtain OTF status. Certain member states and regions have been exempted from the routine herd testing requirements of the Directive by virtue of a Commission Decision, although they have not been granted OTF status as such. This exemption has never applied to any part of the UK.
<P>

<a name="90315w27.htm_para6">Amendments to the Directive, which were agreed during the last UK Presidency and will come into effect from 1 July 1999, provide for member states and regions to apply for OTF status. Outside such areas, the Directive allows cattle from herds with OTF status to be eligible for intra-Community trade provided that they are subject to a tuberculin test, with negative results, either 30 days before or 30 days after movement.
<P>

<a name="90315w27.htm_para7">Similar testing requirements applied to live cattle entering intra-Community trade from Great Britain prior to 27 March 1996.

 The UK Government strongly support the current International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling and the existing whale sanctuaries.

<P>

<a name="90315w28.htm_para0">We are keen to develop ways of further these objectives and of improving the conservation of whales. We are therefore in favour of the proposal being developed jointly by Australia and New Zealand for a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary, and will strongly support any firm proposal for such a sanctuary that is submitted to the IWC.

 The third Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee report did not include a detailed evaluation of the scope for the expansion of student intake at existing medical schools.
<P>

<a name="90315w29.htm_para0">The Government have announced that medical school intake in the United Kingdom will be increased by about 1,000 places by the year 2005, to about 6,000. Because of the current distribution of medical school places, the increase will principally affect student intake in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="90315w29.htm_para1">In England, all universities and their National Health Service partners have been invited to submit proposals for a share of the increase in medical student intake by 12 March 1999. The Joint Implementation Group appointed to oversee the increase will consider all proposals, and make recommendations to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which will announce the allocations later in the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w29.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Chiropodists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists are regulated under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960. It is an offence to pretend to be registered under that Act. In addition, employment in the National Health Service is restricted to those who are registered under the Act. We plan to replace the Act with new legislation to improve public protection, including restricting the use of common professional title to registered practitioners wherever they work.
<P>

<a name="90315w29.htm_para2">NHS employment of speech and language therapists is restricted to members of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. NHS employment of paramedics is restricted to those who have a qualification accredited by the Institute of Health Care Development. We are currently considering petitions to extend the 1960 Act to these two professions.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> For 1999-2000 the national average real terms increase was 4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90315w29.htm_para4">We use a weighted capitation formula to determine each health authority's fair share target of available resources. Health authorities which already receive more than the formula suggests is their fair share received less than the average increase. Seven of the eight health authorities in the South West were in this position. In 1999-2000 the region as a whole received 1.4 per cent., or &#163;4.3 million more than the formula suggests is their fair share.

 The National Health Service provides a considerable number of services to which people suffering from Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) have access, and such patients are seen within a wide range of hospital specialties. The recently established CFS/ME Working Group will produce guidance aimed at improving the quality of this care and treatment. We have consistently emphasised the importance of close partnership between the NHS and local authorities to plan and commission services and have set in hand a number of initiatives, including legislative change, to strengthen this.

 None. The provision of a telephone service for use by patients and visitors, including the choice of provider, is a matter for individual trusts. Detailed guidance on the setting of fees and charges by National Health Service trusts is contained in Her Majesty's Treasury publication "The Fees and Charges Guide". Where a service is to be provided by a third party, trusts should ensure best value both for the hospital and the user by seeking tenders from potential operators.

 As our consultation paper <i>A First Class Service</i> indicated, participation of doctors and dentists in clinical audit schemes is central to our strategy for improving the quality of health care. Local audit and peer review advisory panels assess dental schemes and those dentists who participate are required to prepare resumes of their experience. A recent analysis of a sample of these reports showed that 89 per cent. of dentists viewed the process positively and 63 per cent. had acquired knowledge with a direct, beneficial impact on patient care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will list by health authority area the average number of dental registrations per dentist; if he will make a statement on the impact on dental health of differences in the average number; and what measures are being taken to reduce such differences;  [75534]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many adults have been seen by dentists under NHS regulations in each health authority area in each of the last three years for which figures are available. [75533]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="90315w30.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The table gives, by health authority (HA), the number of registered dental patients on 31 January 1999 as compared to the number of General Dental Service (GDS) dentists at 31 December 1998. Differences in these numbers between HAs will reflect differences in the level of commitment of dentists to the GDS (lower registrations per dentist are likely to indicate a lower level of commitment to the GDS by the dentists involved) and other factors. Figures on the number of adult patients seen by GDS dentists are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health in each of the last three years what percentage of all types of dental treatments was referred to a dental reference officer for scrutiny; and what percentage was declared to be <i>(a)</i> of poor quality and <i>(b)</i> invalid.  [75433]<P>

 In 1996-97 and 1997-98 about 0.5 per cent. and 0.6 per cent. respectively of courses of treatment scheduled for payment for England, Wales and the Isle of Man were referred to a dental reference office for scrutiny. Of those patients seen, the dental officer had a major or fundamental disagreement with the treatment in 1.75 per cent. of cases in 1996-97 and 1.37 per cent. of cases in 1997-98. Information for 1995-96 is not available. These percentages cover both poor quality and invalid treatments. The dental officer was unable to comment in 3 per cent. of cases seen in 1996-97 and 4 per cent. in 1997-98.

<P>
<a name="90315w30.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90315w30.htm_para6">Table 1 gives the number of child patients, aged 15 years and under, seen for treatment by the community dental service (CDS) by health authority (HA) in England during the financial year 1997-98. The activity for each Trust is allocated to the HA for which the work is carried out. Table 1 also includes information on the number of episodes of care for children aged 15 years or under. An episode of care is a series of face to face contacts with a member of the CDS to complete a treatment plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of treatments requiring prior approval from the Dental Practice Board was submitted to dental reference officers for further examination in each of the last three years; what percentage was refused; and what was <i>(a)</i> the shortest, <i>(b)</i> the longest and <i>(c)</i> the average time taken to consider these submissions.  [75434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90315w30.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 6 per cent. of prior approval applications in England, Wales and the Isle of Man were referred to dental reference officers for further investigation in 1996-97 and 71 per cent. of these patients were seen, for

example, 4 per cent. of the total number of applications. In 1997-98, 9 per cent. were investigated further and 56 per cent. of patients were seen, for example, 5 per cent. of the total number of applications. Information for 1995-96 is not available.
<P>

<a name="90315w30.htm_para8">Of those patients seen in 1996-97, the dental officer had a fundamental disagreement with the treatment plan in 0.47 per cent. of cases and had a major disagreement in 4.72 per cent. of cases. For patients seen in 1997-98, there was a fundamental disagreement in 0.38 per cent. of cases and a major disagreement in 3.48 per cent. of cases. However, refusal to give approval takes place only after further consultation at the Dental Practice Board.
<P>

<a name="90315w30.htm_para9">In 1996-97 the quickest approval was made in 45 days, the average time taken was 85 days and the longest time taken was 138 days. In 1997-98 the quickest approval was made in 46 days, the average time taken was 97 days and the longest time taken was 124 days.

 Information on non-National Health Service dental earnings is not collected. However, an annual Inland Revenue Survey gives information on the total gross earnings (i.e. including both NHS and private work) of General Dental Service (GDS) dentists, allowing a comparison with total gross GDS earnings. This indicates that the percentage of GDS dentists' earnings made up of non-GDS work over the last five years has been in the order of:

<a name="90315w30.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 10,983 National Health Service general dental practitioners in England and Wales are already linked electronically to the Dental Practice Board (DPB). Grants of &#163;900 are made by the DPB, when dentists first establish electronic links to them, to assist with the purchase of suitable computer systems.
<P>

<a name="90315w30.htm_para11">The value of information management and technology for dentists is one of the issues that will be considered by the team appointed to carry out an evaluation of Personal Dental Services pilots.
