<a name="20108w01.html_para0">The Government published a draft Digital Television Action Plan on 12 October 2001, setting out a series of actions to be undertaken by Government and industry to achieve switchover from analogue to digital television. Further to this Action Plan, on 11 December, the Government published a consultation paper on planning the digital television spectrum. Nearly eight million UK households (about 30 per cent. of the total) have switched on to digital television since 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for what reason the Public Service Agreement target for Lottery distributing bodies to develop strategic plans does not apply to the Millennium Commission.  [22562]<P>
<P>

 The Office of Communications Bill was introduced to the House of Lords on 12 July 2001. The Bill allows for the establishment of the Office of Communications (OFCOM) which will prepare itself to take on the duties proposed to be conferred upon it later as the new single regulator for the media and communications sector. A draft Communications Bill, containing the Government's proposals for the regulatory framework which OFCOM will apply, is to be published in this Session of Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport whether residential homes have to purchase television licences for televisions that are watched by residents over the age of 75 years and other people.  [24226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Residents aged 75 or over living in residential homes are entitled to a free television licence to cover the installation or use of television in their private accommodation. Such licences do not extend to cover television sets in the communal parts of a residential home, which require a separate, full fee licence. However, we have received representations on this subject and our policy is currently under review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many people benefit from the &#163;5 concessionary television licence scheme; and, in the last year for which figures are available, how many people stopped being entitled to a reduced fee licence because the <i>(a)</i> social mix and <i>(b)</i> level of warden cover at their accommodation changed.  [24225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 At the end of October 2001, there were a total of 633,000 units of accommodation covered by the Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary television licence scheme, of which 200,000 were occupied by residents under 75, who pay a &#163;5 fee, and 433,000 by residents aged 75 or over, who pay no fee. An accurate breakdown of the number of people who have ceased to be entitled to the concession because of changes to the social mix or the level of warden cover is not currently available, but we have contacted the BBC to request the information required and I will write to the hon. Member as soon as it is available, placing copies of my letter in the Library.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> The Government have welcomed the publication of "Sea Changes" and we are working with the English Tourism Council (ETC) to take it forward. The ETC is consulting closely with the British Resorts Association and relevant local authority tourism officers.
<P>

<a name="20108w02.html_para0">The ETC does not have a specific budget for implementing the report since its role is to inform and help develop the strategies of public agencies and the private sector, predominantly at local and regional level. The Government have not set out specific priorities for action in relation to the report and have not made any assessment of the potential cost of implementation. We are awaiting a preparatory assessment from the ETC and will then be in a better position to consider how best an impact can be made.
<P>

<a name="20108w02.html_para1">We do not propose to establish a separate unit to co-ordinate the case for resorts within Government. This is already the responsibility of my Department and we have raised the profile of resort regeneration in discussions both at national level at the March 2001 inter-Ministerial Tourism Summit, shortly after "Sea Changes" was published, and in ministerial meetings with Regional Development Agency (RDA) chairmen since then. We have also ensured that the new draft corporate planning guidance for RDAs asks them to work with regional and local partners on sustainable tourism strategies which should include the promotion of coastal resort regeneration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for how long the PFI contract her Department holds with Royal Armouries (International) for the management of Leeds Royal Armouries exhibition runs; what the total cost of the project has been to her Department; what funding was required to rescue the project; what estimate she has made of the future costs of the project to her Department; what estimates she has made of the value of RAI's new contract; under what terms the nature of the initial contract was changed; and what assessment she has made of the performance of RAI.

entertainment and car parking. The responsibility for managing the museum and its retail outlets was transferred to the Royal Armouries in 1999.
<P>

<a name="20108w03.html_para0">The total cost of the project to build the Royal Armouries museum at Leeds was &#163;43 million. Over &#163;14 million of the construction cost was met by RAI. The Government contributed &#163;20 million via the Royal Armouries, and Leeds city council and Leeds Development Corporation together provided &#163;8.5 million.
<P>

<a name="20108w03.html_para1">As part of the renegotiation of the original PFI-type deal, RAI's outstanding debt of &#163;21 million was borne by the private sector. To cover the additional responsibilities assumed by the Royal Armouries my Department has provided additional grant of &#163;1 million a year since 1999. The future cost to my Department is &#163;1 million a year in additional grant. My Department has not provided any funding to RAI.
<P>

<a name="20108w03.html_para2">The value of RAI's new contract is a matter for RAI. Under the new arrangements agreed in July 1999 RAI retains responsibility for the repayment of its debt of &#163;21 million. RAI also retains responsibility for the provision of corporate entertainment and catering services for a period of 40 years and car parking for a period of 57 years, together with the income from those functions. The Royal Armouries took over responsibility for all other operations and retail outlets. The Armouries stands to receive 20 per cent. of RAI's turnover from corporate entertainment and catering activities once RAI has paid off its debt plus 20 per cent. of its car park income after 40 years.
<P>

<a name="20108w03.html_para3">The current agreement between RAI and the Royal Armouries sets out the standards of performance required. This is a matter between RAI and the Royal Armouries.

 Our Tanzania Programme supports the implementation of the Government of Tanzania's Poverty Reduction Strategy, in line with the Millennium Development Goals.

<P>

<a name="20108w03.html_para4">The Department for International Development assistance to Tanzania is now provided through a single medium term budget support instrument (about &#163;40 million a year), with a complementary programme of technical co-operation (circa &#163;30 million a year). This is designed to increase Government capacity to improve economic management and deliver public services, support private sector development and pro poor growth, and to help the Government improve their accountability to civil society.

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has received periodic reports of the deportation of small groups of Afghans over the past few months but does not have precise figures.

<a name="20108w04.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 During the late 1940s and early 1950s the Ministry of Supply undertook a series of major sea trials of the dissemination of biological warfare agents. It is believed that films, each consisting of several reels, were taken of the individual trials, including Operation Cauldron, which was conducted in 1952. Porton Down holds a videotape, entitled "Operation Cauldron&#151;1952", which contains approximately 20&#150;30 minutes of footage extracted from that shot during the trial. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 9 May 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 197W, in which I explained that the titles of the 1,200 films in the archive at Dstl Porton Down have not been catalogued and in many cases are not very informative. It would involve disproportionate cost to collate a list of films. Therefore we cannot say if reels of film containing footage of Operation Cauldron are held in the archive at Dstl Portdon Down.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) system which entered service in 1998 is the first, and currently only, cruise missile in service with UK armed forces. Delivery of the missiles commenced in 1997 and the cost of maintaining and servicing the arsenal in each of the financial years since then is as follows:

missile; what other anti-ship capability it will have; and what anti-ship capability <i>(a)</i> Type 23 frigates and <i>(b)</i> Type 45 destroyers will have.  [24024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I assume the hon. Member refers to the Sea Skua missile, currently fitted to the Royal Navy's Lynx helicopter. There are no plans to fit the Sea Skua to the Merlin helicopter. The helicopter has a state of the art, integrated mission system, and an extensive array of on-board sensors. These not only give Merlin an independent capability to search for, locate and attack submarine targets, but can also be used to detect ships and provide targeting information for attack by other units.
<P>

<a name="20108w05.html_para4">The Type 23 frigate's anti-ship capability is provided by the Harpoon anti-ship missile, the Sea Skua missile fitted to its Lynx helicopter, the 4.5" Mk8 gun, and twin 30mm guns. It is planned that the Type 45 destroyer's anti-ship capability will be provided by the Sea Skua missile, fitted to its Lynx helicopter, together with the ship's medium range gunnery system, the 4.5" Mk8 Mod 1 gun and twin 30mm guns. The Type 45 is being designed to facilitate the incremental incorporation of additional capabilities, and as such allows for the fitting of a surface to surface guided missile, should the requirement for one be demonstrated.

 The cost of research and development of the Assessment Phase of Astute Class was &#163;29 million. Subsequently the prime contract was placed in March 1997 for the design, build and initial support of three submarines. Unfortunately it is not possible to separate out the development costs in this phase, or the construction cost per boat, from the other costs in the overall price. This is because the contract is placed for a total price, with no itemisation against the categories of the hon. Member's request.

 The Army accepts applications from Commonwealth citizens, including those from Fiji, but does not actively recruit from these countries. However, in response to the large number of applications received from Fiji, the Army sent a selection team to that country in late 1999 at a cost of some &#163;97,000. These costs are not directly comparable with those for recruiting in the UK. The total budget for the UK recruiting operation in 1999&#150;2000 was some &#163;56.5 million.
<P>

<a name="20108w06.html_para0">We believe that the addition of the Fijians to its strength increases the diversity of the force, provides a positive image to other Fijians and other potential applicants from the Commonwealth, and further demonstrates that the Army is an equal opportunities employer. The selection visit to Fiji had the advantage of reducing nugatory costs to the individuals ensuring that all aspirants had the opportunity to apply.

 The Reactor Plant Safety Justifications for Royal Navy submarines aims to demonstrate, through detailed calculation and reasoned argument, that the risks of operation are acceptable and as low as reasonably practicable. The large suite of documentation that forms the safety case is structured around a detailed and comprehensive set of Safety Principles and Safety Criteria. These prescribe the aspects to be considered and include such items as: the basis of design; use of proven engineering practice and technology; system integrity; maintenance and testing; reliability; inspection and results; human and equipment failures; and operation in conditions where a fault has occurred. A range of different tests and inspections are used to certify key components of the reactor plant.

In order to create a better balance between 1 (UK) Armoured Division stationed in Germany and 3 (UK) Division based in the United Kingdom we decided to withdraw around 2,500 troops from Germany. Phase one of the withdrawal was completed at the end of 1999. The remaining elements will take some years to complete.

<a name="20108w07.html_para0">There are no immediate plans for troop reductions in Northern Ireland. The force levels within Northern Ireland are kept under constant review and are dependent on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's threat assessment and used for support. The Army's counter-terrorist and public order role in the Province will remain for as long as the police require military support to maintain law and order.

 On 1 July 2001, a two-year pilot project was initiated to provide Army radio broadcasting in Aldershot, Bulford/Tidworth, Catterick and Colchester. By 7 January 2002, all four garrison stations will be broadcasting full time and are funded to remain on air until 1 July 2003. The radio stations will be broadcast predominantly on AM with some trial broadcasts being made in FM in accordance with radio authority regulations.
<P>

<a name="20108w07.html_para1">Garrison Radio Ltd., the contracted radio service provider, is offering a comprehensive local communication and welfare radio service at the four locations. Gurkha language services are also broadcast in appropriate garrisons.
<P>

<a name="20108w07.html_para2">In addition to broadcasting around the clock, a variety of news and features packages concentrating on local garrison items are compiled on a daily and weekly basis and made available as an audio download package on the internet. All these news and features packages are accessible through the Army website at www.army.mod.uk.

 On 18 December 2001, I signed an inter-Governmental memorandum of Understanding to allow the A400M contract to be placed. The contract itself was signed on the same day by the Organisation for Joint Armaments Co-operation (OCCAR), on behalf of the partner nations, and by the contractor Airbus Military. It provides for the development and manufacture of 196 aircraft in a single launch order. The UK's share is 25 aircraft. OCCAR will manage the programme to standards agreed by the partner nations.

<a name="20108w07.html_para3">The A400M contract will enter into force once final Bundestag approval has been given to the German commitment. The agreement of other nations, including the UK, is subject to the German signature becoming effective.

 The most recent measurements of the international ranking of the Science and Engineering Base (SEB) in terms of quality, relevance and cost-effectiveness indicate that, the UK continues to maintain its position relative to other G7 nations. The details are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The quality of the science and engineering base is measured by the UK's world ranking in terms of citations of published papers. Over the period 1981&#150;2000 the UK received a 9.1 per cent. share of the citations in the international Science Citation Index, second only to the US. The UK was second in 'citation shares' for 15 out of 20 scientific fields with the lowest placing being fifth.
<P>
<BR>
One measure of relevance is the UK's world ranking in terms of the proportion of university research funding from non-governmental sources. For the latest year for which data are available (1997), the UK was again ranked first among the G7 countries.
<P>
<BR>
Cost-effectiveness is measured by the UK's world ranking in terms of the number of papers published per &#163;1 million of public expenditure on science. In 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1999, the UK was the leading country in the G7. For the latest year (2000) the UK was again ranked first.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20108w08.html_para1">These measures were put in place at the time of the Comprehensive Spending Review and were continued for the period of the 2000 Spending Review (2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04).
<P>

<a name="20108w08.html_para2">While the public service agreement targets described here provide a valuable indication of the strength of the UK science base relative to our competitors, other indications are also available. The results of the latest Research Assessment Exercise were published on 14 December and show that, since 1996 when the last study was carried out, many university research groups have significantly improved their performance.

This activity has increased significantly since 11 September. We consistently call for an end to state sponsorship and for firm action to root out terrorist networks on the part of Governments which unwillingly host terrorists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Ministers meet a variety of people to discuss a variety of issues including congestion charging. Any congestion charging scheme in London is a matter for the Mayor. The Government's involvement is with respect to exemptions policy and value for money in the use of the net proceeds.

<P>
<a name="20108w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Between May 2000 and 18 December 2001 we had received about 70 letters. However, the proposed congestion charging scheme for central London is a matter for the Mayor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's powers in relation to congestion charging in London extend to ensuring that the net revenues from any scheme are spent on value for money transport measures and to national exemptions policy.
<P>

<a name="20108w13.html_para0">I understand that the consultation period on the scheme does not close until the middle of January 2002 and that the Mayor is aiming to announce his decision in mid February. The Government will consider the final version of the spending plan once Transport for London has finished the consultation process.

We have no plans at present for any further England-wide concessions or exemptions.

 Information on allocations to individual authorities in years before 1990 is no longer held centrally. The table gives figures for Standard Spending Assessments (SSA) for the two authorities from 1990&#150;91 to 2001&#150;02, and the percentage increase in each year after adjusting for changes in function or funding responsibilities. Local government restructuring applied to Devon from 1998&#150;99 so it is not possible to calculate a meaningful increase for the county in that year.

 The Government recognise that motorcycles have a part to play in a national transport strategy. My Department is actively seeking to include them in all relevant transport planning and policy documents.
<P>

<a name="20108w13.html_para3">The Government's White Paper on the Future of Transport, "A New Deal for Transport: Better For Everyone", recognised that mopeds and motorcycles can provide an alternative means of transport for many trips. It acknowledged that where public transport is limited and walking unrealistic, motorcycling can provide an affordable alternative to the car, bring benefits to the individual and widen their employment opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20108w13.html_para4">Our Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans built on this. It stated that local authorities should take account of the contribution powered two wheelers can make in delivering integrated transport policies and should consider specific measures to assist motorcyclists in making integrated journeys.

<a name="20108w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of motorcyclists killed and seriously injured in accidents with cars rose from 4,195 in 1999 to 4,508 in 2000. We are seeking to address this at a local and national level. The Local Transport Plan process requires local authorities to produce a local road safety strategy. This should set out how authorities plan to tackle road traffic casualties in their area, including the current road accident casualty problem. Measures to be pursued will be for the local authority to determine in the light of local circumstances. The local safety strategy should also outline what education, training and publicity work will be undertaken by the authority.

<a name="20108w13.html_para6">At a national level our Road Safety Strategy includes a number of measures to improve motorcycle safety. We have already replaced the one-year ban for learners who do not pass the motorcycle test within two years with a further training requirement. We have introduced a training requirement for newly qualified drivers wishing to ride a moped and ended the exemption from the motorcycle theory test for those holding a full car licence. The theory test for drivers also now includes more questions about motorcyclists. We have also co-operated with industry in the production of codes of practice for motorcycle couriers and fast food delivery riders.
<P>

<a name="20108w13.html_para7">Other measures we are pursuing include issuing advice to car drivers and motorcyclists about the vulnerability of motorcyclists, improving training for all riders, establishing a register of accredited motorcycle instructors, and engineering and technical measures which may protect motorcyclists better.

 Figures for accidents associated with vehicles fitted with bull bars are not recorded separately. The Transport Research Laboratory carried out a special study of a sample of police reports of accidents involving bull bars and estimated that in 1994 there were around two additional deaths in Great Britain due to bull bars. However, TRL did not find any single case in the sample where a bull bar had definitely caused a death.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> The Coalfields Regeneration Trust is an independent, UK-wide, grant-making body launched in 1999 as part of the Government's response to the 1998 Coalfields Task Force report. The Task Force concluded that the problems of the coalfields were unique, due to a combination of factors that included concentrated joblessness, physical isolation, poor infrastructure and severe health problems. These factors, coupled with the speed of the collapse of the coal mining industry, meant that special measures were needed to bring about the physical, social, economic and environmental regeneration of these areas.
<P>

<a name="20108w15.html_para0">The Trust's remit is to support the range of community initiatives identified by the Task Force as being key to rebuilding healthy and prosperous communities. It also sponsors projects targeted on workers displaced from mining-related industries, who have been unemployed for a long time and who face particular disadvantages at getting back to work. In addition it has an important role to play in community capacity building, providing a forum for good regeneration practice to be exchanged across the coalfield communities.

 The Blue Badge scheme of parking concessions for disabled people is available only for people whose disability is long-term and substantial. Badges can be issued only for a minimum period of three years. Any stickers which local authorities issue for people with temporary disabilities are therefore outside the statutory scheme and no statistical records of their issue are kept by this Department. Extending the Blue Badge scheme to people with temporary disabilities is one of a number of possibilities currently being considered as part of a review of the scheme which the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) is co-ordinating on behalf of the Government.

changes he proposes in the borrowing arrangements for English local authorities to enable the construction of new council housing; and if he will make a statement.  [25233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w15.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The current arrangement whereby central Government approval is required for borrowing will be replaced, for local authorities in England, by a system where authorities are free to determine the amount of borrowing they undertake, subject to having the necessary resources to meet the costs of the borrowing. The change requires primary legislation and we are aiming to implement the new system by April 2004, or earlier if possible.
<P>

<a name="20108w15.html_para1">It is a matter for local authorities to decide how these and other capital resources are used, based on the needs of the area. However, we expect the provision of new social housing to be provided through Registered Social Landlords rather than by the council itself as this provides a greater number of units from the available resources and increases choice and competition between social sector landlords.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of causal links discovered in studies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere between the use of <i>(a)</i> cannabis, <i>(b)</i> alcohol, <i>(c)</i> amphetamines and <i>(d)</i> anti-histamines and the incidence of road accidents.  [24999]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The causal link between alcohol and road accidents has long been established through research and evidence. The impairing effects of drugs, whether medicinal or illegal, on road accidents are not so well understood. Research demonstrates that cannabis affects driving but the effects may not be as severe as for alcohol. Amphetamines act as a stimulant but their effect may be very unpredictable, and repeated use can lead to fatigue. Anti-histamines can cause sedation and thus driver drowsiness.
<P>

<a name="20108w15.html_para2">The issue for road safety is the impairment that drugs may cause to drivers. That is why the Department has supported the police in the training of officers to recognise the outward signs of drug consumption and in using field impairment tests to help them judge whether a driver may be impaired due to drugs.

<P>
<a name="20108w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In accordance with section 73 of the Transport Act 2000, the Civil Aviation Authority specifies the charges which are to be paid by users of air traffic services. These charges are published in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes, and are to be paid to Eurocontrol or to National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS), depending on where the flight to which they relate took place. The Eurocontrol route charges system, of which the UK is a member, exempts flights performed by aircraft of which the Maximum Take-Off Weight Authorised is less than two metric tonnes, but provides that flights made under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) shall be subject to charges. Member states of the Eurocontrol route charges system have discretion as to whether to exempt flights made under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and the UK does exempt these flights where they are undertaken by aircraft of which the maximum total weight authorised is 5.7 metric tonnes or less. This has been UK practice for many years.

 The Government have been keeping the blood alcohol content (BAC) limit under consideration but have not made any proposals to change it.

 Local authorities are responsible for the employment and conduct of their staff, including parking attendants whose sole role is to enforce parking restrictions in contrast to police traffic wardens who may undertake other traffic management duties as well. For authorities adopting decriminalised parking enforcement (DPE) powers under the Road Traffic Act 1991, Local Authority Circular 1/95 (Welsh Office Circular 26/95) "Guidance on Decriminalised Parking Enforcement Outside London" includes a section dealing with the duties, conduct and training of parking attendants. The employment by an authority adopting DPE powers of former police traffic wardens is a matter for settlement between the local authority, the police and the employees concerned and will be covered by Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations. Guidance on parking in London is now the responsibility of the Mayor.

<a name="20108w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Every principal local authority is under the duty to prepare a community strategy. The Government's statutory guidance on "Preparing Community Strategies" (DETR December 2000) explains that the timetable for the development of the community strategy and its contents are at the discretion of each local authority in consultation with its partners and local people. Through discussion with the local community, they will be best placed to prioritise local needs and devise the most effective means of delivering them. Accordingly, the Government will not be imposing a timetable for preparing strategies nor do the Government intend to vet them or require councils to amend them. Proposals for a revised Best Value Performance Indicator on community strategies for 2002&#150;03 were set out in a recent consultation paper "Best Value Performance Indicators 2002&#150;03: Consultation"&#151;DTLR November 2001. Local authorities' performance against these indicators are published. The Government will announce their conclusions on the consultation soon.

 The Railways Act 1993, as amended by the Transport Act 2000, requires the Strategic Rail Authority to make to the Secretary of State an annual report on its activities and the Secretary of State to lay a copy of every such report before Parliament. The Authority's first overall strategy, due to be published on 14 January 2002, will set out its future plans. A corporate plan for 2002&#150;3 will also be published in due course.

 The European Commission has established the European Rail Research Advisory Council to improve synergy between European Union national and private rail research, to serve better society's needs, to lead to sustainable transport and to strengthen the competitive leadership of the European rail industry. The first meeting of the council was held in Cologne on 26 November 2001. The United Kingdom's designated member is the Technical Director of the Strategic Rail Authority. In addition, Roger Goodall, Professor of Control Systems, Loughborough University has been nominated as one of the two Council members from academia.

<P>
<a name="20108w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The UK is one of 40 signatory states to COTIF&#151;the convention concerning international carriage by rail. Rail passengers and freight shippers therefore benefit from a uniform set of rules for international rail journeys, including conditions of carriage and compensation in the event of loss or damage. The UK is a member of the Administrative Committee of OTIF (the intergovernmental organisation comprising the COTIF signatory states) for the period 2001&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="20108w18.html_para0">A new protocol amending the COTIF convention was agreed by the member states in 1999. This protocol is not yet in force and cannot be until it has been ratified by two thirds of the member states. New primary legislation is needed before the UK can ratify this protocol and we expect to seek these powers in due course.

 Joint residence orders are rare because, if parents are able to agree a regime of shared care, a court order is unlikely to be necessary. However, in "Re: D (Shared Residence Order) 2000" the Court of Appeal decided that, in this case, it was in the child's best interests for the court to recognise the living arrangements brought about by a shared parenting regime. Although no formal assessment has been undertaken, the courts have found that shared residence arrangements can be problematic, especially if parents find it difficult to agree matters between themselves. Shared residence can sometimes be disruptive to children's educational and social development, particularly if parents live some distance apart.

<a name="20108w18.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Access to Justice Act 1999 brought about reform over a wide range of publicly funded services, amendments to the law of legal aid in Scotland, provision about appeals, courts, judges and court proceedings. The Act also amended the law concerning magistrates and magistrates courts proceedings, and made provision for immunity from action and costs and indemnities for certain officials exercising judicial functions. As such it is not possible to quantify the savings to public funds from its implementation.

 The table sets out the annual number of reported deaths from food poisoning per 100,000 people in the year 2000 for the United Kingdom and for the United States. The United Kingdom figure is based on the annual corrected notifications of deaths attributed to food poisoning organisms reported to the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales and the General Register Offices for Scotland and for Northern Ireland.

The UK and USA figures are not directly comparable because of differences in the surveillance systems.<P>

The figures for both the UK and US underestimate deaths associated with food poisoning. A larger number of deaths are categorised as infectious intestinal disease (IID) and a proportion of these will result from food poisoning. The UK figure for deaths for IID was 0.99 per 100,000 persons in 2000. Comparable figures for IID in the US are not available.<P>

<P>
<a name="20108w19.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The monthly payment statement which the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) sends to community pharmacies provides summary information on the number of prescriptions transferred from exempt to chargeable (and vice versa) and the reason in broad groups. It is not practicable for the PPA to provide routinely details of individual prescriptions switched. Community pharmacists can, however, ring the PPA's helpline to discuss forms that have been switched. In many cases this resolves the problem without any need for the pharmacist to inspect the forms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w19.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The fee paid to pharmacies in England and Wales for dispensing national health service prescriptions has been changed as a consequence of the recent decision to set the Global Sum for 2001&#150;02 at &#163;806.6 million (an increase of 3.7 per cent. over the previous year). The Global Sum is the amount to be paid to pharmacies overall for the NHS pharmaceutical services they provide each year. The dispensing fee is one of a number of fees and allowances by which the Global Sum is distributed between pharmacies. Such fees are reviewed each time the annual Global Sum is set. Our assessment of the effect of the settlement for this year is that it appropriately remunerates community pharmacies for the service they provide.

 We forecast that the number of national health service prescription items dispensed by community pharmacies in England and Wales in 2001&#150;02 will be 6 per cent. higher than in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20108w19.html_para8">The fees paid to pharmacy contractors vary according to the item prescribed. However, the majority of prescriptions attract a basic dispensing fee. From July 1999 to October 2001 that fee was 97.5p. From November 2001 to March 2002 it will be 87.4p. We therefore forecast that the average value of the basic dispensing fees paid to pharmacy contractors for prescriptions dispensed in 2001&#150;02 will be 93.2p, a reduction of 4.4 per cent. compared with 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20108w19.html_para9">The basic dispensing fee is one of a number of fees and allowances by which the global sum for community pharmacies is distributed between pharmacy contractors. The global sum is the amount to be paid to contractors overall in the year in question. The global sum for 2001&#150;02 for England and Wales is &#163;806.6 million, an increase of 3.7 per cent. over 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20108w19.html_para10">If remuneration is expressed as the global sum divided by the number of prescription items dispensed, then the remuneration per prescription in 2001&#150;02 is forecast to be 135.4p, a reduction of 2.2 per cent. compared with 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20108w19.html_para11">Actual payments will be different because there was an overpayment of &#163;8.1 million in respect of 2000&#150;01, which is to be recovered by reducing this year's payments. Taking that overpayment and recovery into account the actual payment per prescription item for 2001&#150;02 is forecast to be 134.1p, a reduction of 4 per cent. compared with the actual payment per prescription in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20108w19.html_para12">While we take information and arguments about pharmacy contractors' costs into account when setting remuneration, we have made no assessment of the cost to a pharmacy contractor of supplying each individual prescription.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The expert group that produced the Department's guidelines "Drug misuse and dependence&#151;guidelines on clinical management" (1999) reviewed the evidence for the use of naltrexone in drug treatment programmes for heroin addicts. The group concluded that because of the uncomfortable or severe opiate withdrawal symptoms if taken by an individual dependent on an opiate, naltrexone-assisted relapse prevention should be initiated only by specialists and specialised generalists experienced in this technique. More work needs to be undertaken before firm conclusions can be reached regarding how appropriate it is to use naltrexone within a community setting.

 There are two sources of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) that have been used for therapeutic purposes. Partially purified AAT may be manufactured from pooled human plasma. Recently, AAT has been synthesised with the use of recombinant technology.

<a name="20108w23.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Information on the levels of verbal and physical abuse by individual staff group is not collected centrally, but may be held at a local level by national health service employers. Data on violent incidents involving all staff in the NHS were not collected centrally for 1996&#150;97 or 1997&#150;98.
<P>

<a name="20108w23.html_para4">The Department conducted a survey of NHS trusts in England in 1998&#150;99. The survey found that, on average, seven violent incidents were recorded each month per 1,000 staff. This is equivalent to approximately 65,000 violent incidents against NHS trust staff each year. Details of the survey can be found in Health Service Circular 1999/229: "Managing Violence, Accidents and Sickness Absence in the NHS", a copy of which is in the Library.

<P>
<a name="20108w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department has received a number of representations from organisations with an interest in pharmacy.
<P>

<a name="20108w23.html_para6">We recognise that, in spite of increasing training places and introducing recruitment and retention initiatives, there have been problems in recruiting pharmacists particularly over the last year. This is a result of the switch from a three to a four-year undergraduate pharmacy course in 1997 and growing demand for pharmacists, particularly in primary care. Skill mix initiatives have increased the demand for other staff within pharmacy leading to shortages in some areas.
<P>

<a name="20108w23.html_para7">The increases in pharmacy student intakes&#151;27 per cent. more new students started training in 2000 than in 1993&#151;point to a significant medium term-growth in the pharmacy workforce despite the change to a four-year undergraduate course. Workforce modelling undertaken by the Department suggests that there will be a 12 per cent. increase in the pharmacy workforce across the national health service and private sector between 1998 and 2003.

 The European Commission sent their proposals to amend the European medicines legislation to the European Parliament and to the Council of Ministers on 26 November 2001, formally launching the legislative process. The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) will be leading for the United Kingdom Government in the forthcoming negotiations on the European Commission's proposals. The MCA is currently considering the implications of the European Commission's proposals, and is consulting other Government Departments with an interest in the proposal to amend Article 2.2 of the Human Medicines Code.

<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the extent to which the forthcoming EU Food Supplements Directive would <i>(a)</i> permit and <i>(b)</i> require the setting of maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals at or close to the upper safe level for such nutrients;  [21693]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the meaning and practical implications of the requirement in Article 5 of the proposed European Directive on Food Supplements to take account of specified factors.  [21721]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w23.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Article 5 of the Directive, which lists a number of matters which need to be considered when setting maximum limits, would permit but not require maximum limits to be set at levels close to the upper safe level. Upper safe levels are listed as the first consideration, but it is not clear to what extent other factors, like measures of supposed need, will influence the Commission's proposals. We currently have no plans to press for clarification of this point. The Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for negotiating this Directive on the Government's behalf, has sought clarification without success, and is now concentrating on

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w23.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for negotiating this Directive on the Government's behalf, has consulted widely on its likely impact. There would be labelling costs falling on manufacturers of all food supplements, but these would be substantially offset by a two-year transitional period. For the specialist food supplement sector and consumers of these products any additional impact would depend on future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and maximum limits.

 The risk assessments for vitamins and minerals being undertaken by the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals will be issued for public consultation in early 2002, with a view to publishing the final report in the spring. There is cross-membership between the Expert Group and the Scientific Committee on Food which has already received all papers prepared for consideration by the Expert Group. The European Commission, EU member states and the Scientific Committee on Food will be sent copies of the report at both stages. The final report will inform the United Kingdom position in respect of the EU Directive on Food Supplements.

[21691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w23.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Directive lists nutrients and nutrient sources permitted for use in food supplements; the lists currently include 28 nutrients and 112 nutrient sources. We are aware that many nutrients used in the United Kingdom are not on the lists and plan to allow additional substances to be used by all parties during the optional seven year transitional period which was written into the Directive at our request. We have no plans to prepare a list of these substances; manufacturers and retailers are understood to be compiling such lists and co-operating over submission of dossiers supporting addition of these substances to the 'permitted' lists. These substances would then be available for use throughout the European Union.

<P>
<UL>(2) when community health councils were given the information about Coughlan <i>v.</i> North Devon health authority, C.A. 1999 contained in circular HSC 1999/180: LAC (99) 30 of 11 August 1999;  [21395]

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> Guidance regarding continuing care "Ex parte Coughlan: Follow up action", Health Service Circular 1999/180: Local Authority Circular (99) 30, was issued on 11 August 1999. Further guidance "Continuing Care: NHS and Local Councils' responsibilities" HSC 2001/015:LAC (2001)18 was issued on 28 June 2001. Guidance on "Free Nursing Care in Nursing Homes" HSC 2001/17: LAC(2001)26 was issued on 25 September 2001. Copies of all sets of guidance were sent routinely to community health councils' chief officers. No other guidance or advice has been has been specifically issued to CHCs.
<P>

<a name="20108w24.html_para2">It is for individual health authorities to ensure that their criteria for continuing national health service health care comply with guidance issued by the Department and to obtain their own legal advice where necessary. Since August 1999, only two health authorities have sought the Department's advice on the issue of 'refunds' for self funders: West Surrey health authority and South Essex health authority.
<P>

<a name="20108w24.html_para3">The determinations of any individual's requirement for continuing NHS health care or free nursing care are made on the basis of an assessment to determine individual needs. The introduction of free nursing care may lead to the identification of individuals with exceptional health needs who may now qualify for continuing NHS health care.

<P>

<a name="20108w24.html_para4">Health authorities neither obtain consent in writing, nor do they pass confidential medical information to social services before 'withdrawing' continuing care; it is not envisaged, nor has it ever been brought to the Department's attention, that any health authority has behaved in the way described in the two questions. Once provided, continuing health care should continue to be provided unless and until the individual's healthcare needs change.

 The Department has for some time had a flexible working patterns policy and actively encourages and supports its staff and managers to work flexibly.

<P>

<a name="20108w24.html_para5">The Department recognises the advantages that home working offers such as retention of valued and skilled staff who have domestic commitments, and a saving on travelling time and costs, and provides appropriate information technology equipment and a supportive personnel and management structure to enable staff to work from home.

<a name="20108w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2001]:</i> Subject to parliamentary approval, the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Profession Bill will enable us to set up a patients forum in every national health service trust and primary care trust as independent statutory bodies. It is expected that the members of the 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 634W</I><P>
forums will be volunteers drawn from patients, carers, and from local voluntary organisations. As members of the patients forums, they will represent the views of local communities to trusts about the quality and configuration of health services; monitor the delivery of services from the patients perspective; and inspect every aspect of NHS care from the perspective of the patients experience of the service.
<P>

<a name="20108w24.html_para8">Voluntary participation in the patients forum is not intended as a means of producing financial savings. The main benefit to the NHS is that local people will be able to make a difference to the services provided and ensure that local services are more responsive to the needs of patients. The volunteers will benefit from knowing that they are making an important and worthwhile contribution to the service; they will also have the opportunity to acquire new skills which may benefit them in their employment or other aspects of their lives.

<P>
<a name="20108w25.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We have no plans to refer impotence treatments, including Viagra, to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. We recently announced that arrangements introduced in 1999 restricting the eligibility for these treatments on the national health service will continue. The extra cost of allowing unrestricted prescribing is likely to involve diversion of funds from other NHS priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the UK's progress towards meeting the EU's meat hygiene legislation with particular reference to the levels of <i>(a)</i> veterinary controls and <i>(b)</i> supervisory measures implemented.  [22669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w25.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In 1998, following infraction proceedings against the United Kingdom by the European Commission, we agreed to bring veterinary supervision levels in licensed meat plants in Great Britain into line with the requirements of European Union meat hygiene rules, namely the Fresh Meat (64/433/EEC) and Poultry Meat (71/118/EEC) Directives. It was not possible to secure immediate compliance largely because of a 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 638W</I><P>
shortage of veterinarians in Great Britain willing to undertake meat hygiene work. The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), which provides veterinary inspection and supervision services in GB on behalf of the Government, therefore had to put in place a concerted and long-term campaign to recruit and train the required additional veterinarians. The aim was to achieve full compliance by 1 April 2001. During the next three years the MHS increased veterinary supervision in plants in a risk-based and staged process with incremental increases being introduced as and when additional veterinary resources became available.
<P>

<a name="20108w25.html_para10">The MHS was well on course to meet the deadline when the foot and mouth outbreak occurred at the beginning of this year. This led to an unprecedented demand for veterinarians to assist in combating the disease and many practices which had contracted to supply additional resources to the MHS found themselves losing staff to the fight against the epidemic. These losses severely jeopardised the ability of the MHS to ensure full-time Official Veterinarian Surgeon supervision in all full-throughput slaughterhouses by the target date. Even so, the MHS was successful in arranging the required supervision in all but nine of the 305 full-throughput slaughterhouses operating in Great Britain as at 1 April 2001. Since then MHS has continued to introduce full-time supervision where possible, and full compliance was achieved in full-throughput slaughterhouses and cutting premises by November of this year. This achievement is due in no small part to the intensive and successful efforts of the MHS to recruit additional veterinarians.
<P>

<a name="20108w25.html_para11">The UK authorities have notified the Commission of this position. The extensive, prescriptive and detailed inspection and supervisory measures required by the Directives are enshrined in national legislation, namely the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (as amended) and the Poultry Meat, Farmed Game Bird Meat and Rabbit Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 1995 (as amended).

 As part of the judgment in this case, the court decided that the system used by the council in determining the question of deprivation under regulation 25 of the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 did not comply with article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court held that the system failed because the panel established under the social services complaints procedure did not amount to an independent review of the facts, and because there was no such review, judicial review was not an adequate means of appeal. But the judge made it clear that the statutory scheme was not incompatible with human rights.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> The Department is advised on matters of radiation risk by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). NRPB has not carried out any research specifically into illnesses caused by exposure to depleted uranium. However, NRPB has carried out research that is relevant to the assessment of the risks to health from such exposures. In particular NRPB has carried out extensive research into the distribution of uranium between body organs, its retention and excretion, following inhalation of a wide range of uranium compounds. It has also developed computer models that enable the concentration of uranium in the various organs and resulting radiation doses to be calculated. Depleted uranium is mildly radioactive, and NRPB's research programme on the effects of ionising radiation in general is therefore relevant to assessment of the radiological risks from exposure to depleted uranium.
<P>

<a name="20108w26.html_para6">NRPB staff have also contributed to studies of the risks to health from exposure to depleted uranium carried out by working groups set up by the European Commission, the Royal Society, and the World Health Organisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health with reference to Regulation 6(2)(a) of the NHS (General Medical Services Supplementary List) Regulations 2001 (SI No. 3740), whether it is his policy to require a general practitioner, in order to gain access to a health authority's supplementary list, to provide evidence that he or she has performed general medical services for three out of the last six months; and what assessment he has made of whether this would disadvantage doctors who have not worked for three out of six months previously owing to <i>(a)</i> ill health, <i>(b)</i> maternity or paternity leave and <i>(c)</i> other valid reasons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> The regulations are intended to ensure that general practitioners who work as non-principals (for example, locums, assistants and salaried general practitioners) are picked up by a supplementary list based in the area in which they intend to work. They get onto that list, in part, by either demonstrating that they have worked in the area or by showing that they intend to work in that area. These arrangements are therefore not discriminatory.

This advice was made available to health authorities on 30 November 2001 and explains that satisfactory evidence of an intention to work in a particular area could include membership of the local medical committee or a written commitment from the practitioner that he or she intends to work locally coupled with any other matter which links them with the area such as a home within the health authority's area.

 Families affected by the tragedy of cot death, also known as sudden infant death syndrome, receive help from a range of health and social care professionals. We are looking at ways in which a uniform approach to offering support, incorporating the best elements of current practice, can be further developed. As a part of this process we have invested &#163;28 million over the last three years to modernise pathology services, also we are committed to increasing the number of pathologists, including those within paediatric pathology.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many consultant surgeons he estimates will be practising in the NHS by June 2002;  [24719]

<a name="20108w31.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan sets a target of 7,500 additional consultants by 2004, over the 1999 baseline, needed to deliver the service targets set out in the Plan. The NHS is currently identifying locally what consultants it needs to deliver the NHS Plan by 2004. We anticipate that by 2002 there will be an increase of around 340 trained specialists in the surgical specialties, over the 2000 baseline.
<P>

<a name="20108w31.html_para3">The Department's demand analysis suggests that by 2009&#150;10 there could be a need for around 3,000 (headcount) additional consultant surgeons in the NHS in England, over the 2000 baseline. Around a further 1,320 trained specialists are expected to be available to take up surgical consultant posts by 2009&#150;10, over the 2000 baseline.
<P>

<a name="20108w31.html_para4">We continually review future requirements for trained specialists as part of the NHS's new multi-disciplinary work force planning processes. These will look at the requirements for doctors alongside other staff focusing on the potential for new ways of working and developing new roles.
<P>

<a name="20108w31.html_para5">Projections of need will change as modernisation of the work force progresses. Supply projections will also change as numbers in training are varied in response to identified need.

 The National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People and Care Homes for Younger Adults and Adult Placements were drafted by the Department. To aid the drafting of these standards, reference groups were set up which included representatives from the private, public and voluntary sectors, national organisations and service users. Both sets of standards were consulted upon publicly and we have listened to the representations made during consultation and made appropriate changes. No guidance under the Care Standards Act 2000, in relation to the accommodation of service users in care homes, has been drafted.

<P>
<a name="20108w32.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information in the form requested. Representations about the effect of Government policy on local authority run care homes are generally made by local authorities as part of the comments they make in their role as regulators, providers and commissioners of social care. Local authorities have been involved in the development of our modernisation agenda, particularly in the development of national minimum standards where they were one of the groups consulted before and during the various consultation exercises on the national standards. The formal consultation documents were sent to all local authorities.

<a name="20108w33.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 It has recently been estimated that in the United Kingdom some 180,000 people suffer sight loss due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is possible that gene therapy may indeed one day be used to halt or even prevent AMD. The results of a number of pre-clinical research studies have been published, and these studies do look promising. However, it is too early to say for certain whether these specific approaches will ultimately lead to cures for patients with AMD.
<P>

<a name="20108w33.html_para0">Here in the UK, before moving into clinic to test such approaches in human subjects, the approval of our national supervisory body, the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC) would be required. GTAC would base their decision as to the acceptability of any such trial on the medical and scientific merits of the research proposed and carefully weighing the potential benefits and risks to patients.

 The Stroke Standard in the National Service Framework for Older People, the service model it details for integrated stroke services and the milestones for action it sets should apply equally to all stroke patients, irrespective of age. Integrated stroke services will need to cover or link to prevention, acute care, rehabilitation and long-term support for stroke patients and their carers. April 2002 is the milestone for every general hospital which cares for people with stroke to have plans to introduce a specialised stroke service from 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are fully committed to diversity and equality of opportunity for all health service staff and patients and we are taking vigorous action to achieve this. There is no place for discrimination or harassment in the national health service on grounds of race or ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or age.
<P>

<a name="20108w34.html_para0">The Improving Working Lives (IWL) Standard establishes targets and measures for promoting real improvements in the working lives of NHS staff. It makes it clear that every member of staff is entitled to work in an organisation which can prove that it is investing in, and improving, diversity and tackling discrimination and harassment.
<P>

<a name="20108w34.html_para1">Activity to achieve this aim is occurring on a number of fronts. We have launched an equalities framework ('The Vital Connection') which incorporates clear requirements for the NHS in promoting equality and introduces a package of indicators, standards and monitoring arrangements to support progress and manage performance as part of human resources performance management. It includes specific measures on race and harassment.
<P>

<a name="20108w34.html_para2">In addition, the 'Positively Diverse' programme is developing the knowledge and capacity of NHS organisations to build and manage a diverse workforce. It provides the process for achieving the equalities-related aspects of IWL and the targets set by the Equalities Framework and supports NHS organisations in meeting the workforce challenges set by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="20108w34.html_para3">The programme is, at present, being extended to another 200 organisations. Work is also in hand to develop a mentoring and coaching scheme for black and minority ethnic staff; a trainers pack for working with race and racism and a personal work programme for examining individual attitudes towards race and culture. In addition, new guidance, aligned with the 'Zero Tolerance' campaign, on dealing with harassment from service users has been developed and will be launched in March.

<P>
<a name="20108w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The concordat has encouraged better use of spare capacity in the independent sector, which has allowed national health service patients to be treated more quickly.

<P>

<a name="20108w35.html_para0">According to data collected from independent healthcare providers by the Independent Healthcare Association, since November 2000 at least 75,000 patients have been treated in the independent sector, paid for by the NHS. This figure includes out-patient appointments, day cases and in-patient treatment. A breakdown by type of operation will shortly be placed in the Library. The IHA does not collect cost information.
<P>

<a name="20108w35.html_para1">The Department has recently surveyed health authorities and trusts on the amount of activity they are purchasing for NHS patients within the private sector and will make available key results in due course.

<a name="20108w35.html_para2">The challenge remains to put NHS use of private sector capacity on a planned footing. Some health authorities and primary care trusts have made particular progress on this front, but overall the picture is still generally one of "spot" purchasing.

<P>
<a name="20108w35.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have made it clear that the ratings are not primarily about the quality of clinical care. They do not mean that a poorly performing hospital has low standards, is unsafe or does not contain some very good clinical services. Staff are often doing a good job but the assessments show that organisational performance does need to improve.

<P>

<a name="20108w35.html_para5">Our new proposals on patient choice mean that from July 2002, if a patient with coronary heart disease has been on an in-patient waiting list for over six months, they will be able to seek swifter treatment in either the private sector, in another European Union country or in a different national health service hospital. This option is available regardless of a trust's performance rating and will be extended across England throughout 2002&#150;03.

 We welcome initiatives which aim to improve our knowledge and understanding of autism. Autism awareness year is seeking to raise awareness, through voluntary sector partnerships, of the issues surrounding autism and to influence and inspire action to facilitate the changes needed to services and attitudes to autism. I was delighted to accept an invitation to speak at an autism awareness year conference to be held on 14 February.
<P>

<a name="20108w35.html_para6">We will listen carefully to the messages which emerge from this and other current and recently completed initiatives in this field. These include the independent "National Initiative on Autism: Screening and Assessment" and the two reports commissioned by the Department of Health&#151;from Dr. Tony Holland on Asperger's Syndrome and from the Medical Research Council on the epidemiology and causes of autism.

 Regulations have been laid before the House to amend the National Health Service (Travelling Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations 1988 to permit NHS bodies to pay for the travel of NHS patients going overseas for treatment funded by the NHS. The NHS will meet the cost of the patient's travel from the point at which they begin their international journey (the airport, ferry port or international train station) to the foreign provider. Reimbursement of travel expenses between the patient's home to the airport, ferry port of international train station will be governed by the same rules that currently apply to payment of travelling expenses to hospitals in England. This change will ensure that patients treated overseas under the auspices of the NHS will not be disadvantaged by having to travel further for that treatment.

 The hospitals to be used for national health service patients in the three test bed sites in the south east region are being selected by local commissioners, with clinical input. A practising GP has also been involved in providing input to the development of the three projects. There will be a competitive tender exercise in the new year to select approved foreign providers; again, clinicians will be involved in the selection of the final list of approved providers.

 The Department has commissioned no research on the use of chemicals in fly spray products. All such pesticide products have to be approved by Ministers before they can be sold and used in the United Kingdom. It is the responsibility of industry to provide the data necessary to demonstrate fully the safety and efficacy of their products before approval can be granted.

 All pesticide products for use in agriculture and in the home have to be approved by Ministers before they can be sold and used in the United Kingdom. The products should always be used in accordance with label instructions specified as part of the approval.
<P>

<a name="20108w36.html_para1">The independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) advises Ministers on pesticide issues. A review of the safety of DDVP in non-agricultural pesticide products was carried out in 1994: the ACP concluded the chemical did not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans. A review of DDVP in pesticide products is currently being carried out, including a review of all data relating to possible mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, and I expect the ACP to make recommendations to Ministers concerning approval of these products early this year.

 The Department has not received advice about the recent study from Stockholm which concludes that ultrasound exposure in fetal life increases the risk of left handedness in males.

 The positive effect of the new deal is confirmed by independent research carried out by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. This found that, in the absence of new deal, long-term youth unemployment would be about twice as high as it now is.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para4">The number of 18 to 24-year-olds unemployed for six months or more has fallen by over 70 per cent. in the last four years. Some of this improvement reflects the delivery of a strong and stable economy, but the new deal has

 The intention is to offer participants a range of jobs from which to choose. Many employment placements will be with locally based intermediate labour market operators working mainly in the public and community sectors. Work in these areas will generally be of community benefit but in jobs which would otherwise not be economically viable. It is also hoped that the scheme will attract other employers. Clearly the range of jobs available will depend on the local labour market, but it is hoped that this will include opportunities in both the private and public sectors. Government Departments and the NHS will not be under any obligation to offer jobs to participants but will be free to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w37.html_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 We are giving people on benefits more choices and more help than ever before to move off welfare and into work, in return for greater responsibility to consider the help that is on offer. We recognise that some people will not be able to take advantage of initiatives to help them support themselves through work, so we are extending our support for them to ensure greater security.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para5">In April 2001 we introduced the Disability Income Guarantee (DIG). DIG provides an extra premium, paid with income related benefits, to severely disabled people on the lowest incomes. Nationally, we expect that DIG will help around 130,000 of the poorest severely disabled people under 60, and around 30,000 families with severely disabled children.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para6">Incapacity benefit helps people who satisfy the National Insurance contribution conditions and cannot be expected to work due to sickness or disability. In South Tyneside, which is composed of the parliamentary constituencies of South Shields and Jarrow, around 10,800 people are receiving incapacity benefit.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para7">Income support is also available to help those disabled people who are unable to work. In South Tyneside 5,600 people are receiving income support with either a disability premium or a severe disability premium. We have also increased the disabled child premium in the income related benefits by substantially more than the normal uprating. Since 1997 we have increased this from &#163;20.95 to &#163;30.00, and from April 2002 it will increase to &#163;35.50. There are 400 families in South Tyneside receiving the disabled child premium.

<a name="20108w37.html_para8">Disability living allowance helps those severely disabled people under the age of 65 with extra costs due to the effects of their disability and provides extra help for those disabled early in life. In South Tyneside 9,218 people receive disability living allowance. Attendance allowance helps disabled people over the age of 65 with extra care costs due to the effects of their disability. In South Tyneside 4,067 people receive attendance allowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the extent of delays in the payment of housing benefit; and if he will make a statement.  [17866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w37.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our housing policy statement "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&#151;The way forward for housing" (December 2000) recognised that the fundamental challenge facing housing benefit is its administration. Problems with administering housing benefit can result in unacceptable levels of fraud and error, as well as backlogs of delayed claims.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para9">Our immediate priority has therefore been to work in partnership with local authorities to improve standards of administration. For example, we have established the Help Team which offers practical advice and support to local authorities on ways to improve delivery. The team has already visited Hull, Lambeth, Bristol, Northampton, Derwentside and East Ayrshire. We have also set up a Help Fund to enable local authorities to formulate and implement improvement plans. In addition, we will introduce national performance standards to support the better administration of housing benefit from spring 2002.

 There will be a 5 per cent. increase in Verification Framework funding from 1 April 2002. This applies to both set-up and on-going funding and is double the increase for 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w37.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Verification Framework is designed to secure the gateway on to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit by defining the minimum standards for collecting evidence before a claim can be paid. As at 30 November 2001, 263 authorities have applied for or received funds to adopt the Framework. Of those 263 there are 240 authorities who are now fully compliant with the scheme.

<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para10">We continue to keep the Verification Framework under regular review. During the summer we worked in partnership with local authorities on proposals to simplify the Framework.
<P>

<a name="20108w37.html_para11">From April 2002 we will split the Verification Framework into three modules which can be introduced in stages.

 Prior to the introduction of Best Value Performance Indicators in April 2000, information was not collected from local authorities on the length of time taken to process Housing Benefit claims. Under Best Value, information on average processing times is collected from English local authorities by the Audit Commission on behalf of the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR). Final performance figures for 2000&#150;01 will be published by DTLR early in 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w37.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Since 1997 there has been a year on year reduction in the number of people claiming Housing Benefit. It is not possible to determine how much of this reduction, if any, is due to the introduction of the Verification Framework. The fall can be attributed to a variety of factors including lower unemployment, demographic changes and our initiatives to secure the gateway on to Housing Benefit. The Department is currently carrying out an assessment of the impact of the Verification Framework which may provide more information as to its impact on Housing Benefit caseloads.

 After six weeks of in-patient treatment in a national health service hospital people in receipt of housing benefit (HB) or council tax benefit (CTB), but who do not receive income support (IS), have their benefit reduced. This adjustment reflects the patient's lower day-to-day living expenses which result in more income being available to meet housing costs. At 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 688W</I><P>
this stage, no automatic reduction is applied to HB or CTB paid to people receiving privately funded hospital treatment.
<P>

<a name="20108w38.html_para8">People who receive HB or CTB and IS will have an analogous reduction applied to their IS entitlement after six weeks of in-patient treatment in a national health service hospital. Their HB or CTB entitlement will remain unchanged at this point unless they cease to be entitled to IS. Where IS entitlement does stop, people affected can reapply for HB or CTB at the reduced levels.
<P>

<a name="20108w38.html_para9">After 52 weeks, or earlier if the local authority decides that the person's absence from home is likely to be substantially more than 52 weeks or permanent, both HB and CTB are withdrawn for all hospital in-patients.

2. People are ILO unemployed if they are out of work, want a job, have actively sought work in the last four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks.<P>

3. Information is not available by month because seasonally adjusted information from the Labour Force Survey is only available once each year. Therefore, the table provides information on Great Britain and the south-west for the spring quarter of each year since 1998.<P>

4. Information before 1998 is not comparable due to changes in the health and disability questions asked in the LFS.<P>

 Over 11 million people received a winter fuel payment for winter 2000&#150;01, around 32,900 of whom were in the South Tyneside local authority area. Figures for this winter are expected to be similar.

<a name="20108w42.html_para0">The ABI has reported that over three-quarters of those employers required to do so had designated a stakeholder pension scheme for their staff by the end of October. We know that other designations were in progress at that time.
<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para1">We should also remember that stakeholder pensions have led to other improvements in pension provision. Charges on personal pensions have fallen as a result of stakeholder pensions, and employers have also widened their schemes to cover more of their work forces. This means more people are able to save for their retirement.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> The Department received 234 statements of complaint from the Parliamentary Ombudsman in the last financial year April 2000 to March 2001. The average length of time taken to respond to the statement of complaint is 25.51 working days.

<a name="20108w42.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 In line with the findings of the National Audit Office, the public sector comparator for PRIME estimated that the Department will save &#163;560 million over the life of the 20-year contract. This is some 22 per cent. less than it would have cost the Department had we continued with our previous estate management arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para2">In addition to this significant reduction in our running costs, the financial benefit of many innovative ideas in the PRIME contract such as the sharing of gains on disposal of properties and various contractor incentivisation and benefit sharing provisions, are now being realised. The first three full years of the contract with Land Securities Trillium has brought about the following returns:

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> There are clearly benefits to be gained by offering Freecall and Local Call Rate services to Benefits Agency customers, but this has to be weighed against the cost to provide such services.
<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para3">Where services are provided through a call centre, our policy is to offer telephone numbers which are chargeable at local call rates. This allows customers to be charged for the call at a local rate, regardless of the actual destination of that call within the UK. The Department meets the balance of the call cost. Further, where customers are likely to face significant difficulties in affording such charges, a Freecall number has indeed been provided. Customers are also able to ask for a call back from the Department rather than incurring personal call costs.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 702W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para4">The Department is currently modernising the delivery of its services to customers. Both Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions Organisation are in the process of assessing the best use of the telephone for customer contact. We are exploring the use of a single Local Call Rate number for initial contact with the Department. Calls could then be directed automatically to the most appropriate contact point, based on the originating dialling code. We are still in the early stages of this assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w42.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, has looked at issues affecting hospital in-patients including rules governing the downrating of benefits.
<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para5">This rule prevents double provision from public funds as the publicly funded NHS maintains people while they stay in hospital as well as providing free treatment. Social security maintenance benefits are also paid from state funds. They are therefore not paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day-to-day living expenses met through the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20108w42.html_para6">The double provision principle is a key cornerstone of the system of national insurance introduced over 50 years ago.

<a name="20108w43.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> We estimate that over a quarter of a million people have passed through the Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices during the first month of their operation. Risk assessments for each of the new Jobcentre Plus offices have been carried out and, following consultation with local trade union health and safety representatives, a series of extra security measures has been introduced. These include wide coverage by closed circuit television; training for staff in how to handle difficult situations; better management in each office to avoid difficult situations building up; panic alarms; and more visible and effective security guards. Additionally in each pathfinder area there are screened facilities to deal with individuals and parts of the business that pose a greater risk. These will, we believe, lead to fewer incidents of verbal and physical assaults on staff.

<P>
<a name="20108w43.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The Department does not itself administer schemes where funds are allocated by a competitive bidding process. It does submit bids for funds under schemes administered by the Treasury, such as the Invest to Save or Capital Modernisation Fund. The Department also uses the competitive bidding process to secure value for money in procuring goods and services from external suppliers. It is normal departmental policy to obtain competitive bids for all procurements valued at &#163;500 or more. This policy results in thousands of procurement exercises where funds are paid to successful suppliers. Listing these exercises would incur disproportionate cost.

 We have no plans to do so. Previous comparability arrangements for recognition of overseas teaching qualifications were withdrawn in 1989. These were replaced by mutual recognition arrangements with other countries in the European Economic Area coupled with an employment based training route which enables overseas-trained teachers from countries outside the European Economic Area to obtain qualified teacher status. These arrangements were augmented earlier this year to allow exceptional experienced overseas trained teachers to obtain qualified teacher status and an exemption from induction through a simultaneous assessment.

 The Government want to provide more opportunities for children and young people to have a bigger say about policies and services relevant to them. I value the UK Youth Parliament as one of the routes by which this can happen. The Government have given support to the UK Youth Parliament to help it establish itself. I have now asked the Children and Young People's Unit to explore with the UK Youth Parliament what more the Parliament can do to ensure that it acts as an effective voice for children and young people, as part of our drive to improve children and young people's participation right across Government and in their communities.

 On 2 November, I published "Learning to Listen: Core Principles for the Involvement of Children and Young People." It commits Government Departments to increase opportunities for children and young people to have a bigger say about policies and services relevant to them across government and in their communities. Youth councils provide one way to help achieve this. The funding we are making available through the new "Transforming Youth Work Development Fund" will provide additional resources to support the drive for increased participation, help to ensure there is enhanced youth work provision to underpin it, and contribute to our efforts to increase young people's engagement with local democracy.

 Legal remedies already exist to combat abuse by parents and others against teachers. These include injunctions, and prosecution for criminal damage, common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The Government have made a specific grant for school security available to all local education authorities in England since 1998. This could be used to support personal safety training for teachers and others to protect themselves from assaults. The Department has consulted on extending the use of parenting orders to situations where children manifest poor behaviour in school, and where parents need to play more of a role in setting boundaries for them. We are currently considering the responses. The relevant authorities in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible for drawing up their own education policies.

 Schools within Excellence in Cities areas and Excellence Clusters receive specific grant for the gifted and talented strand of those initiatives. Local education authorities and education action zones also receive specific funding for our national summer schools programme; otherwise, we look to schools and local education authorities to meet the costs of educating exceptionally able pupils from their general budgets. From next summer, the Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth will provide a range of opportunities for such pupils and their teachers. Several resources that benefit gifted and talented pupils more generally are already in place.

 The overall local government finance settlement for 2002&#150;03 is a good one for education: over &#163;1.3 billion extra in Education Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs); a further increase in Standards Fund grant of almost &#163;160 million; and an increase in the direct grant for schools of 2.75 per cent. In the context of this settlement, there is less need for special grant support from Government than there was in 2001&#150;02. I will be meeting a group of representatives of the F40 group in the spring to discuss the new funding system for 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what funds have been allocated for training qualified teachers to teach citizenship lessons in secondary schools;  [24267]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w47.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 A total of &#163;27 million was made available through the Standards Fund directly to schools to prepare for implementing Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) between 2000&#150;01 (&#163;12 million) and 2001&#150;02 (&#163;15 million). With local education authority matched funding, schools are able to spend this in the way that best meets their needs, including spending on teachers' professional development, for example on courses run by citizenship organisations.
<P>

<a name="20108w47.html_para2">167 teacher training places were made available by the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) at the beginning of the 2001&#150;02 academic year. Of this, 147 trainees are currently undertaking the one year programme to become citizenship teachers. On successfully completing their course, they will be able to take up a teaching post in September 2002. There are likely to be in excess of 150 trainee places available next year. Many existing teachers are, of course, already teaching aspects of citizenship through other subjects.

 The Department does not collect statistics on homework clubs in schools: setting these up is a matter for local decision. We do, however, encourage schools to provide opportunities for young people to enrich their learning through out-of-school-hours activities. "Extending Opportunity: a national framework for study support", published in 1998, set out the contribution homework clubs can make to a school's wider programme of out-of-school-hours learning activities. We also published Homework Guidelines, which require school homework policies to refer to any opportunities that exist for pupils to do homework, under supervision, at places other than home. The homework area on the Department's Standards website supplements the guidelines with examples of good practice and case studies.

<a name="20108w48.html_para0">As regards the former, local education authorities have to provide home-tuition in some circumstances to children of school compulsory age who by reason of illness, exclusion from school or otherwise are not receiving suitable education. Under the Financing of Maintained Schools Regulations 2001, LEAs are free to retain resources centrally for the education of those pupils who are educated otherwise than in a school. This may encompass those who are educated in a pupil referral unit, or at home. Guidance about transferring funding was issued in November 1999, entitled "School Inclusion: the LEA role in Pupil Support", supplement circular 11/99.
<P>

<a name="20108w48.html_para1">As regards the latter, there are no funds directly available from central Government and local education authorities are under no legal duty to provide financial support to parents who elect to home-educate their children. However, advice from the Department has been

compiled in a fact sheet sent on request, and some LEAs do provide free national curriculum materials and other support to parents. The level and extent of such support is decided locally, based on the authority's own policies and the needs of the child.

 All admission authorities for schools must consult annually over their proposed admission arrangements. After completion of this process, an admission authority may object to the independent schools adjudicator about another admission authority's determined arrangements. In considering any objection, the adjudicator must be mindful of whether the arrangements being objected to are lawful. Complaints about the lawfulness of admission arrangements may also be made to the Secretary of State who has powers, under section 497 of the Education Act 1996, to intervene if either a local education authority or governing body has acted, or is proposing to act, unlawfully.

 The Education Bill provides that a local education authority in England may, with the approval of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, publish a notice inviting proposals for the establishment of an additional secondary school. The need for new schools varies from year to year, but we estimate that in an average year the demand for additional secondary schools would not exceed single figures.

More generally, medical schools will&#151;with the rest of universities&#151;be subject from September 2002 to the provisions of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001.

This has been reinforced in the guidelines on Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which stress that recycling and composting must be at the heart of new applications for waste facilities. Incineration should only be considered where recycling is not feasible or not the best practicable environmental option.

 Sewerage undertakers have a duty under section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991 to drain their area effectually and this duty is enforceable by the Secretary of State or the Director General of Water Services. However, there can be practical or financial constraints. The duty in the 1991 Act is not, therefore, considered to be an absolute requirement on undertakers to prevent sewer flooding in all circumstances. Each undertaker is expected to set priorities for work which may be necessary. Ofwat and my officials are currently examining the causes of sewer flooding and possible remedies. Ofwat will publish a paper on the issue early in 2002.

 The emergency response to flooding, from whatever source, is led by local authorities in partnership with the emergency services and bodies that are responsible for the source of the flooding.
<P>

<a name="20108w49.html_para0">The Environment Agency has permissive powers to undertake flood defence measures in relation to main rivers and the sea. The Agency is also responsible for issuing flood warnings and has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood defence. Local authorities or, where they exist, internal drainage boards, have flood defence powers on ordinary watercourses.
<P>

<a name="20108w49.html_para1">Sewerage undertakers are generally responsible for dealing with flooding from sewerage systems while the relevant highways authority is responsible for road drainage systems. Flooding from groundwater can arise for disparate reasons and there is no single body responsible for such flooding.

 I understand that between September and mid-November 2000, the Environment Agency's Automatic Voice Messaging (AVM) system delivered messages to 85,715 locations with a success rate of between 75 and 80 per cent. This was a five-fold increase from the 15 per cent. success rate at the time when the agency became responsible for flood warnings in 1996.
<P>

<a name="20108w49.html_para5">Following the autumn 2000 floods, as part of its usual practice of monitoring its flood warning performance, the agency undertook 'post event' surveys in 13 areas where in excess of 100 properties had experienced flooding. A total of 1,493 interviews were conducted. Of those who had experienced flooding 60 per cent. received a warning prior to the event (91 per cent. of whom received more than two hours notice).
<P>

<a name="20108w49.html_para6">The agency offers the full Flood Warning Service which encompasses both direct methods (AVM, flood wardens, loud hailers, sirens) and indirect methods (broadcast media, Floodline service). Out of a total of 1.9 million properties situated in the natural floodplain of England and Wales, currently some 1.2 million properties receive the full Flood Warning Service. This represents an increase of 325,000 properties covered by the full Flood Warning Service since 2000.

<P>
<a name="20108w49.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government continue to maintain close links with the insurance industry to help ensure continued availability of affordable flood cover. There is an agreement among Association of British Insurers (ABI) member companies that they will continue to provide flood cover, except in exceptional circumstances, for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure, during 2001 and 2002. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement have been referred by DEFRA to the ABI for investigation. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. Also, the insurance industry is a competitive one and customers may need to shop around to obtain the best deal.
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I had previously met the ABI on 5 September to discuss our mutual aim of ensuring that affordable flood insurance cover continues to be generally available after

 The Environment Agency has permissive powers to undertake flood defence works on main rivers. On ordinary watercourses these powers reside with local authorities or, where they exist, with internal drainage boards.
<P>

<a name="20108w49.html_para7">There are no objective criteria for deciding whether a particular watercourse should be designated as main river or ordinary watercourse, although the rivers presenting the most significant flood risk will tend to be 'enmained'. The initiative for 'enmaining' rivers rests with the Environment Agency and their Regional and Local Flood Defence Committees.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the projects in her Department which have been considered as potential public-private partnerships since 1997 which have not been undertaken because the public sector comparator had a lower net present value than the public private partnership proposed; and if she will make a statement.  [13429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w50.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In our 1997 reforms of PFI, the Government abandoned the requirement to submit all capital projects to PFI testing. Accordingly, it will be concluded at a very early stage in the option appraisal process whether a PPP approach is likely to deliver value for money (vfm); where it is not, a public sector comparator (PSC) will not be constructed. Only when it is concluded, following careful consideration, that PPP is likely to offer value for money, will a PSC normally be developed.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para3">Against this background, and with the maturing of the PPP process and the PPP market, it is likely that a high proportion of projects which do embark on the PPP route will contract on that basis, with competition helping to secure value for money and the PSC acting as a quantitative aid to informing judgment.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para4">PPP deals continue to account for only a small proportion of the total sums invested to improve the delivery of public services. Public sector gross investment is projected to rise from &#163;19 billion in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;35.2 billion in 2003&#150;04. Over the same period, capital investment by the private sector through PFI will be about &#163;3 billion annually.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para5">From information held centrally the Department is not aware of any potential public private partnerships which have not been undertaken because the public sector comparator had a lower net present value than the public private partnership proposed.

<a name="20108w50.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2001]:</i> This scheme was launched on 12 September 2001 and has attracted a good level of interest from farmers. To date DEFRA has received 113 applications for planning consultancy advice, of which 62 have been approved so far. The cases approved have yet to result in any claims on public funds, which are only made once the consultant's work has been completed and the farmer satisfied with the service provided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w50.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 With regard to Free Planning Advice for farmers pursuing a viable diversification project, which was launched in September, to date we have received 373 applications; 237 of these have been approved; 97 are currently being processed.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para6">In addition, the Farm Business Advice Service, which was introduced in October 2000 under the Action Plan for Farming and consists of three days of free on-farm business advice, is available to help farmers take stock of their businesses and decide on the future direction&#151;whether it is improving their business, diversifying or leaving the industry. Since its launch, 7,613 farms have requested the service, 4,637 farms have received an initial diagnostic visit and 2,851 farms have received the full three-day service resulting in an Action Plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received about failures to pay slaughter premium on cattle slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak.  [14001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w50.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Slaughter premium is not payable on cattle slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak but if the market value for such animals would have been influenced by expectation of slaughter premium then the valuation for compensation should reflect this. Standard valuations, which operated between 22 March and 29 July, took account of slaughter premium.

[18046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w50.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No date has been set for disbanding the teams of blood testers for FMD in the south-west of England but as the threat from the disease diminishes there will be less need for testers.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para8">Under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 blood sampling for laboratory testing can be undertaken by paraprofessionals. The TB test can only be carried out by qualified veterinary surgeons who are accredited to the relevant LVI Panel. The number of blood samplers who can be diverted to TB skin testing is minimal. The only other resource that will be required for the restart of TB testing is a sufficient supply of Tuberculin to meet the projected future need.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons animals with foot and mouth disease anti-bodies and no other symptoms of the disease were slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak.  [24389]<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Foot and mouth disease (FMD) antibodies are not found in healthy livestock in FMD free countries. Their presence indicates that the animal has been exposed to the virus. Such exposed animals could be diseased and infectious or they could be convalescent. It is also possible that a carrier state may develop in some animals which have FMD antibodies whereby the animal can carry the virus for prolonged periods and could possibly cause a recrudescence of disease. This is particularly so in the case of sheep. It is therefore essential that animals with FMD antibodies are promptly culled as part of the control mechanisms in place to eradicate FMD.

<a name="20108w50.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Of the 132 premises in Worcestershire affected by Foot and Mouth disease, secondary cleansing and disinfection has been completed on 130. Significant work has been undertaken on the remaining two premises, but in both cases has been halted. No other premises in Worcestershire will require cleansing and disinfection.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para10">Nationally, the secondary cleansing and disinfection operation is well advanced with 88 per cent. of premises subject to secondary C and D now complete, a further 7 per cent. in progress and only 1 per cent. to start. 4 per cent. of premises will not undergo secondary C and D.

<a name="20108w50.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright has improved the speed of Foot and Mouth Disease diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction methods. This system involves the automated extraction of nucleic acid from tissues and robotic control of the reverse transcription reactions using a probe and primers capable of detecting all seven serotypes of Foot and Mouth Disease viral RNA. The results can be available in around four hours when fewer than 30 samples are tested. The sensitivity and specificity of the method is comparable with virus isolation in cell culture which takes several days.

<a name="20108w50.html_spnew21"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> There has been no change in the Government's policy on the collection of taxes due from businesses affected by foot and mouth disease. A total of &#163;202 million of payments of income tax, VAT and national insurance contributions (of which &#163;88 million relates to VAT) have been deferred by agreement beyond their due date without interest becoming payable. Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue continue to take a sympathetic approach, on a case-by-case basis, to recovery of the outstanding amounts.
<P>

<a name="20108w50.html_para14">No records are held centrally of any council tax payments that local authorities may have agreed to defer. Partial information is available on deferred business rate payments: a survey by the Local Government Association shows that 101 local authorities have deferred rate payments from nearly 6,000 businesses, and, based on information from 54 of those authorities, estimates the value of deferred payments in their areas at around &#163;2 million. To help authorities meet the demand to defer rate payments, the Government deferred 50 per cent. of all payments into the national rate pool from 151 rural authorities between April and August 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact on farm <i>(a)</i> cash flow and <i>(b)</i> livelihoods in the Macclesfield constituency of delays in the despatch of sheep annual premium to farmers who have had a partial contiguous cull of sheep as a result of foot and mouth disease; and if she will make a statement.  [15809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w51.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Sheep Annual Premium Scheme is fully funded by the European Community. In administering the scheme member states must ensure that the rules are strictly enforced to avoid disallowance of Community funding. We are conscious of the need to pay claims without undue delay, but this must be balanced with the need to safeguard taxpayers' money.
<P>

<a name="20108w51.html_para0">European Community rules for farmers affected by FMD require claims to be cross-checked against veterinary records to ensure that the animals culled were eligible for premium. The majority of FMD affected claims have been paid their first advance of the premium from late July as usual. There are some cases where we require further information from claimants on the number of eligible sheep retained, including those where only part of the flock has been culled due to FMD. None of these are in the Macclesfield area.

 Two independent health risk assessments have so far been carried out, one for the Environment Agency, and the other by consultants for the London borough of Barking and Dagenham.

 None.

When illegally imported meat is identified it is destroyed. It is not routinely tested for presence of disease agents. To our knowledge no imported meat infected with foot and mouth has ever been identified in the UK, including from countries where the disease is endemic.

I have begun the review process and I hope to shortly ask those involved with animals, including welfare and commercial interests, how they would like to improve the law.

<P>
<a name="20108w53.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am not aware of any proposals to change the temperature required for the pasteurisation of milk. However, in a recent consultation paper on their draft strategy for the control of "Mycobacterium avium" subspecies "paratuberculosis" in cow's milk the Food Standards Agency proposed that the pasteurisation time for milk should be increased from 15 to 25 seconds. I understand that most liquid milk production in the UK is already pasteurised for 25 seconds. Accordingly, I would expect this proposal to have little effect on the farmgate price of milk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what support her Department has given to <i>(a)</i> the development and <i>(b)</i> the dissemination of information on rhizomania-tolerant varieties of sugar beet.  [23062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w53.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 DEFRA and the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have spent over one million pounds on research into rhizomania. Much of this research has been into the biology of the organisms which cause and spread the disease, essential information for those developing tolerant varieties. Included in this work are projects more specifically related to the development of tolerant varieties including investigation of the biology and control of Plasmodiophoraceous virus vectors, an investigation of the significance of resistance-breaking Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus (BNYVV) pathotypes for the UK sugar beet industry, and a project which seeks to identify new sources of rhizomania resistance. Additionally, DEFRA has supported the use of new tolerant varieties by accepting an industry request to allow their use on outbreak farms, in fields in which the disease has not been found. However, the development and dissemination of information on new varieties is the task of the seeds industry. Given the widespread findings of the disease in many European countries, where it is managed through the use of tolerant varieties, inevitably much of this development work has been done in those countries.

has to link future claims for compensation for loss of livestock to the implementation of biosecurity recommendations.  [23631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w53.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Animal Health Bill provides for the payment of compensation following infection with foot and mouth disease to be linked to good practice in maintaining adequate levels of biosecurity on affected farms. All farmers will qualify for 75 per cent. of market value, with the payment of any additional amount being subject to an assessment of biosecurity and related matters. Under this adjusted compensation scheme farmers will be incentivised to maintain effective biosecurity. This will benefit responsible farmers and the wider community by helping to limit the spread of disease.
<P>

<a name="20108w53.html_para1">The Bill also provides powers to enable the extension of the provisions on adjusted compensation to other animal diseases, should we decide that it is necessary. This would be done by order, subject to affirmative resolution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her oral answer of 15 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961, on BSE, what peer reviews the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee has used of the research work of Professor Ebringer on BSE.  [23268]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w54.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee has invited Professor Ebringer to attend its next meeting in February 2002. The Committee, which comprises independent and eminent scientists in the field, will then review Professor Ebringer's work. Generally, research is not peer reviewed specifically for the purposes of aiding SEAC's deliberations. On this occasion, however, an independent scientist has been approached to review the work prior to SEAC's discussion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what is <i>(a)</i> the target reduction of annual incidence of BSE for 2001 and <i>(b)</i> the actual figure for 2001.  [24378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w54.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has a Public Service Agreement (PSA) target for this area; that is to reduce the annual incidence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) to less than 650 cases by 2001 and by 2004 be on track for fewer than 30 cases by 2006, a 99 per cent. reduction compared with 1997 when there were 4,312 cases.
<P>

<a name="20108w54.html_para4">The actual figure for 2001 is likely to be around 750 confirmed BSE cases in cattle presented as clinical suspects. Progress against the PSA target has been affected by movement restrictions introduced to deal with the foot and mouth disease outbreak. This has disrupted the slaughter of older cattle under the over-30-months scheme (OTMS) because available rendering capacity has been used to dispose of the carcases of animals arising from the control of foot and mouth disease. This, in turn, has increased the mean age of the cattle population and resulted in more cases than previously anticipated. Nevertheless, the outturn for 2001 still represents a reduction of more than 40 per cent. compared to 2000 (1,311 cases in cattle presented as clinical suspects), so that the epidemic continues rapidly to decline. There is no particular concern at present in relation to the 2004 and 2006 targets.

 Despite the reduction in abattoir numbers over recent years there remains considerable over- capacity in the slaughtering sector and a reasonable spread of abattoirs across the country. As we announced in the Rural White Paper last year, Agriculture Departments in England, Scotland and Wales have agreed to transfer &#163;8.7 million to the Food Standards Agency for the three financial years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04; this has enabled the FSA significantly to reduce inspection charges levied on many small and medium-sized meat plants. This will have positive benefits for small and medium-sized abattoirs. It is, however, too early to assess how the revised charging system will affect their profitability or future operation. The Policy Commission for Food and Farming will no doubt be considering the number and spread of abattoirs and we will consider carefully any recommendations in this area that it might make.

 In the UK, two bovine respiratory diseases are notifiable. These are contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and bovine tuberculosis. Regulations require that the incidence of these diseases is reported so that investigation and action can be implemented. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is not present in the UK and cattle imports are subject to international regulations designed to reduce the risk of importing this condition. Bovine tuberculosis is present in the UK and subject to regulation. Measures are in place to protect human health and to control the disease in cattle. These include requirements for notification, surveillance, slaughter with compensation, pasteurisation of milk and meat inspection. Other forms of bovine respiratory disease, including that caused by pasteurella haemolytica, are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and the appropriate control is a matter for the cattle owner and his or her veterinary surgeon.

 The Department is currently reviewing all aspects of electronic identification of livestock together with farming industry representatives. In addition, the European Commission is undertaking extensive field trials of various electronic devices and we are awaiting the results of those trials to see what EU-wide rules might be agreed. The introduction of electronic identification in England will need to take account of this work.

<P>
<a name="20108w56.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Rural Payments Agency has, since 20 August, been affected by industrial action. Several thousand days of processing time have been lost and this is impacting on its ability to process claims as quickly as it would normally do.
<P>

<a name="20108w56.html_para0">Most schemes are affected to some degree but the greatest impact has been on the Arable Area Payment Scheme (AAPS).
<P>

<a name="20108w56.html_para1">AAPS payments under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) are made between 16 November and 31 January following the harvest. For land growing non-food crops the final payment date is 31 March.
<P>

<a name="20108w56.html_para2">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is doing everything that it can to ensure that delays in making payments are kept to a minimum. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Encouraging overtime working
<P>
<BR>
Redeploying all RPA staff with relevant experience on to the AAPS
<P>

Increasing the number of staff authorising claims
<P>

Using validation reports to determine which claims can best be handled by less experienced staff so that better use is made of those with more experience

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> It is very unlikely that these minutes will be available before 16 January 2002. As indicated in an earlier answer, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate will have to seek the agreement of all former members of the Advisory Group on Veterinary Residues to their release. This is in accordance with Part II, Paragraph 14 a) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, Second Edition (1997).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on what date she expects the resumption of exports of British beef to France following the European Court of Justice ruling; what recent discussions she has had with her French counterpart about the arrangements for the lifting of the French ban on British beef; and what steps she is taking to claim compensation on behalf of British beef producers for the loss of export income during the period of the ban.  [25192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w58.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State expects the Commission to take further action against the French Government if they do not lift their ban within a reasonable timescale. My right hon. Friend made it clear at the Agriculture Council on 19 December 2001 that she expected the ban to be lifted as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para0">The UK Government cannot claim compensation as they have no direct commercial interest. However, we will give exporters seeking compensation full support, practical assistance and advice, although as a matter of policy the Government will not fund their costs nor provide detailed legal advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will make a statement on what basis kilowatt days will be established for individual fishing vessels, pursuant to the European Commission's proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of cod and hake stocks; and if <i>(a)</i> the declared engine power according to the Fishing Vessel Register and <i>(b)</i> the actual engine power will be used;  [25190]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on how an under-declaration of engine power will affect the United Kingdom position in respect of the list of vessels required under the EU Regulation for the recovery of cod and hake stocks; and if the UK would be penalised in a future fleet reduction programme in the event of the list being submitted to the Commission having included vessels with actual engine power found to be larger than that declared on the Fishing Vessel Register.  [25191]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w58.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This will depend on the form in which EU legislation for recovery of cod and hake stocks is adopted. The Council has not yet begun to consider the recently published Commission proposals for limiting fishing effort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture Council held in Brussels on 19 and 20 December; what the Government's position was on each issue discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [25104]<P>

<P>
<a name="20108w58.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture Council in Brussels on 19 December 2001. Agriculture Ministers of the devolved Administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland were also present.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para1"> The Council reached agreement on reform of the sheepmeat regime, including a number of measures for which the United Kingdom had pressed strongly. The changes will make substantial savings in the budget for the EU's current financial year. The main ones will fix permanent rates of premium and create national envelopes which can be directed towards national or regional priorities. Different approaches will be permitted in England and the devolved Administrations. I am delighted with this outcome which will give us some valuable flexibility in the operation of this importance regime.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para2"> The Council also agreed to introduce a stabiliser which will cap spending in the seeds sector. The new arrangements fully safeguard UK interests. A further amendment of the banana regime was also agreed, bringing to a close a long running dispute with certain of the EU's trading partners.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para3"> The presidency reported the successful outcome of the international conference on foot and mouth disease at which the United Kingdom had taken a prominent part.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para4"> The Council discussed a memorandum from certain member states on the oilseeds market. I endorsed the Commission's response, arguing that further encouragement of oilseed production in the EU would be costly, unnecessary and likely to produce tension with our trading partners.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para5"> The Council took note of progress on several dossiers under the Belgian presidency and exchanged views on a useful memorandum from the German Government on organic farming.

<a name="20108w58.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers in Brussels on 17&#150;18 December, together with Ross Finnie, Minister for Environment and Rural Development in the Scottish Executive and Mrs. Brid Rodgers, the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para6"> The Council agreed by qualified majority, with France voting against, on Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to apply in 2002 in EU waters and for EU vessels fishing in waters where catch limitations apply, together with a six-month extension of the controls on fleet capacity and grants. Details of the agreed UK quotas are provided in the table.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 774W</I><P>
 Following on from the advice of fisheries scientists at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) highlighting the poor state of a number of fish stocks, the Commission proposed large cuts in a wide range of TACs. I fully supported the need for large cuts where the science justified this, but argued in parallel to this that in many respects the Commission's proposals went further than science would justify.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para7"> Scientific assessment underpinned our whole approach towards stocks. We were careful both to respect scientific advice and have a sound scientific case where we disagreed with some of the Commissions's proposals.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para8"> The Commission was in particular too quick to propose large automatic cuts in relation to stocks associated and caught with depleted stocks and to cut TACs for some stocks because they appear to have been under-utilised by fishermen up to now. The former approach had led the Commission to propose, for example, further large cuts in the nephrops fisheries west of Scotland and in the Irish sea and North sea on the presumption that this would relieve pressure on depleted cod stocks: expert analysis that we have carried out on this proposition because of the importance of the nephrops fishery to UK fishermen showed conclusively that, to the contrary, the Commission's proposed cuts would have seriously penalised nephrops fishermen in order to bring benefits to cod stocks which would be minimal at best.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para9"> More generally, if implemented the proposals would have denied fishermen such benefits as the scientific advice showed could now be derived as a result of conservation measures already taken, and would have curtailed a wide range of fishing activity much more severely than could be rationally justified.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para10"> I am pleased to say that, after lengthy negotiations, we achieved an outcome which closely follows the scientific advice. This does not shirk severe measures where these are justified, but it does meet my criticisms of what the Commission proposed. Improvements of particular interest to UK fishermen include the abandonment of the unjustified further cuts proposed in the nephrops TACs, a 48 per cent. increase in the TAC for cod in the Irish sea (made possible by conservation measures previously taken there), and a valuable mitigation of the punitive cuts proposed by the commission in the TACs for monkfish.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para11"> The Council agreed a short, six-month, extension of the controls on fleet capacity and grants, raising the capacity penalty applied when vessel construction and modernisation grants are paid on vessels in fleet segments exceeding their Community limits. The Council and the Commission undertook to aim, in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, at an active fleet policy to achieve better balance between fishing effort and fisheries resources.
<P>

<a name="20108w58.html_para12"> The Council briefly noted, but did not discuss in any details, two areas of work that will command a lot of its attention in 2002&#151;the review of the Common Fisheries Policy and the long-term plans to be put in place for the recovery of depleted stocks. Clearly the second of these

items will be of particular importance in the context of ensuring the long-term sustainability of the fisheries concerned and of the industries that pursue them.

<P>
<a name="20108w59.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> Specialist detectives would develop the skills to work on the most complex investigations. They would be drawn from existing officers and those choosing to specialise as they join the service. The operational needs of police forces would determine what proportion of their detective officers would specialise in investigation. These officers would still work in other areas of policing, but would develop their investigative skills to a high standard through a career anchored in investigation. This would provide an experienced pool of officers from which Senior Investigation Officers could be drawn.
<P>

<a name="20108w59.html_para8">In the most specialised fields we plan to introduce specialist civilian investigators. Specialist civilian investigators will provide the depth of knowledge only a career specialist could bring to investigations into high-tech crime, cybercrime, fraud, money laundering and other complex areas of crime. The numbers recruited will depend on the operational needs of the police service. Some specialists might be shared between a number of forces. By providing the civilian investigators with certain police powers they will be able to function as full members of investigating teams.

 Our scheme to provide low-income pensioners with home security improvements only operates in those police Basic Command Unit (BCU) areas that had a burglary rate above the national average according to the recorded crime statistics published in January 2000.

<a name="20108w60.html_para9">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2001 British Crime Survey found that in England and Wales as a whole, victimisation for the violent crime in the survey which is comparable to recorded crime decreased by 19 per cent. between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas comparable violent crime recorded by the police increased by 9 per cent. Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of victimisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many speed cameras have been installed, and how much has been spent on <i>(a)</i> installing and <i>(b)</i> maintaining and replacing speed cameras in each year since 1995;  [23199]

<P>
(11) what the average cost is of <i>(a)</i> setting up and <i>(b)</i> maintaining a speed camera; and what percentage of the maintenance and set up costs of speed cameras is covered by revenue raised from fines and other charges, made through speed related offences.  [23053]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w60.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The number of speed cameras in police force areas is not recorded centrally. The Association of Chief Police Officers estimates that there are about 4,500 speed camera sites in England and Wales. The average cost of purchasing and installing a fixed site speed camera is in the region of &#163;30,000.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para11">From April 2000 eight partnerships, comprising local police forces, local authorities, highways authorities and magistrates courts, have been piloting a new 'netting off' scheme . This allows the fixed penalty revenue from speed and red-light cameras to be re-invested to fund camera enforcement. The money raised is used to meet all the costs of purchasing, installing, operating and maintaining cameras.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para12">Under the scheme, local magistrates courts within a partnership collect all fixed penalty notice and fine revenue from offenders. The element to be netted off goes 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 785W</I><P>
to the partnership's local authority, which acts as treasurer for the scheme, and distributes the funds to each of the partners on the basis of invoiced expenditure. Any revenue not used for camera enforcement goes to Her Majesty's Treasury. For areas outside the netting-off scheme all camera related costs are met by the police, local authorities and other agencies involved in the enforcement process. Proceeds go to Her Majesty's Treasury.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para13">The results of the netting-off scheme demonstrate its value. Evidence from the pilot areas shows that motorists are slowing down in all areas where speed cameras are located, and not just in the immediate vicinity of camera sites. The first year report of the scheme shows that across the eight pilot areas as a whole the number of people killed or seriously injured dropped by 18 per cent. compared to the average of the previous three years. On average, the number of people killed or seriously injured at the camera sites is down by 47 per cent., and the average speed is down by 5.6 miles per hour. On the basis of historical trend data, we estimate that there were 109 fewer people killed or seriously injured as a result of the increased camera enforcement, although we cannot break this down by type of road user. We estimate that &#163;27 million has been saved by the reduction of casualties and collisions at camera sites in the pilot areas when account is taken of ambulance and medical costs, lost output and the human costs of road accidents.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para14">In addition, the evidence suggests that police operational priorities have not been distorted in any way. Automatic road safety cameras do not need police attendance and act as a continuous deterrent. They free up police resources to deal with other crimes and to undertake other traffic law enforcement activities. In the pilot areas, wider criminal activity has also been detected by chasing up non-payers caught on camera. The Association of Chief Police Officers strongly supports the netting-off scheme.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para15">In August we announced the national roll-out of the netting-off scheme, and a further seven partnership areas joined the scheme in October 2001. A further 12 force areas have applied to join the scheme next year, and more are expected soon. All areas wishing to join the scheme are expected to do so over the next two to three years.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para16">We have made it clear that cameras will only be placed at sites where there is a proven history of speed-related injuries or at accident hotspots where excess speed is a problem. There will be a requirement that all cameras are properly sign-posted and sufficiently visible, with their deployment well publicised locally. Camera use will be monitored to ensure that they help to reduce accidents. Those that do not will be moved to a more appropriate location or removed altogether. We shall be issuing new guidance to local authorities and police forces operating speed cameras outside the netting-off scheme, so that the requirements for other cameras mirror the netting-off rules.
<P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para17"><P>

<a name="20108w60.html_para18">The number of fixed penalties over the last five years for speeding offences where cameras have provided the evidence is given in the table. Automatic camera devices provided evidence from 1995 to 1998 and all camera types for 1999. Data for 2000 are not yet available. From 1995 to 1999 the fixed penalty charge for speeding offences was &#163;40. All the money was paid to Her Majesty's Treasury.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the answer of 6 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 476W, on Downview Prison, what steps he will take to secure the immediate local transfer of male prisoners who are now in higher category prisons than Downview.  [23214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w61.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As stated in the previous answer, in preparation for the change of role of Downview to a women's prison, 340 male prisoners were moved from the establishment between 17 July 2001 and 1 September 2001. No prisoners were moved out of the South East and none had their security category increased as part of this process.
<P>

<a name="20108w61.html_para2">As far as possible prisoners were relocated to other category C training prisons/units or where appropriate were recategorised and transferred to an appropriate category D prison from Downview.
<P>

<a name="20108w61.html_para3">One hundred and forty Downview prisoners were temporarily accommodated at Wormwood Scrubs in a separate wing, supervised by former Downview staff, in category C conditions. The majority of these prisoners were moved to category C training prisons or recategorised and transferred to appropriate category D prisons. A small number, for whom Wormwood Scrubs is a convenient location, have remained there in long term category C conditions.

The risk is assessed to be low, but growing. It could change rapidly at any time and our response will need to adjust to remain proportionate.

Paragraph 12 of Article 1 of the Framework Decision provides that the two or more member states setting up a joint investigation team may enter into arrangements for persons other than the representatives of the competent authorities of these member states to take part in the activities of the team. These other persons may include, but are not limited to, officials of bodies set up pursuant to the Treaty on the European Union. Such bodies include Europol, OLAF which is the European Community's anti-fraud office and, when the relevant Council Decision comes into effect, Eurojust.

<a name="20108w61.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Yes. Private prisons in England and Wales are required to meet appropriate security standards. Prisons which hold category A prisoners must have some form of visitor recognition system in place, and it is considered good practice in lower category prisons. However, it is for local management to decide exactly which form of visitor recognition system they employ or, for prisons that do not have category A prisoners, how they manage this issue without using such technology.

 The Government believe that prison is right for dangerous, serious and some persistent offenders and that sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection, but no longer.
<P>

<a name="20108w62.html_para4">Home detention curfew plays an important role by enabling prisoners to be released from prison early, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to secure or resume employment or training as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20108w62.html_para5">The Government believe that community punishments can make a major impact and support their increased use, particularly for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling, or fraud. The Government's reform of the probation service, with its focus on reducing re-offending, means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment. Changes already introduced, for example the Drug Testing and Treatment Order and the ability of Courts to impose community punishment, rehabilitation orders and curfew orders as one sentence, should enable sentencers to consider a robust community sentence as an alternative to imprisonment.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to the answer of 9 December 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 323, in how many cases information has been passed by Inland Revenue staff to the National Minimum Wage Unit on non-compliant employers; and what the outcome of such investigations has been.

 Nearly 5,000 working families tax credit applications have been the subject of an employer inquiry by NMW staff. Non-compliance has been identified in just over a third of such cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There have been a number of representations on this issue. However, there has been no change to the VAT treatment of such services. If future changes to employment regulations have the effect of altering the VAT treatment, parallel changes will be made to ensure there is no increased VAT charge on managers' services in retirement accommodation.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the risk analysis system used by Customs and Excise for VAT control visiting is restricted to determining the <i>(a)</i> relative risk of different traders and <i>(b)</i> overall risk to the revenue.  [24545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Central risk analysis enables Customs to rank traders in order of relative risk, predict outcomes, and target resources to achieve greater compliance.

<P>

<a name="20108w63.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is not Customs policy that a business should receive a visit within the first three years of registering for VAT for that reason alone.
<P>

<a name="20108w63.html_para2">Currently all newly registered businesses are offered a programme of learning for VAT, including videos, seminars, meetings and visits.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Customs and Excise have no plans to issue an additional VAT payers charter. Their standards of service to VAT payers&#151;and all other business customers&#151;are already set out in the "Customs and Excise Charter", Notice 400 (most recent edition July 2001).

 The proposed modifications to the taper relief rules for business assets are not expected to give rise to the creation of schemes for converting income to capital gain to any significant extent because the effective capital gains tax rate of 10 per cent. will not be reached until the asset in question has been held for two years, and because there are rules already in place which are designed to ensure that income is charged to income tax.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 10 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 689W, on amateur sports clubs, what plans he has to provide funds to enable the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, to provide mandatory relief for community amateur sports clubs at the same level enjoyed by charities.  [25128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 On 30 November, the Charity Commission announced that it would recognise as charitable "the promotion of community participation in healthy recreation". Community amateur sports clubs that qualify for charitable status will be able to enjoy the tax relief that such status confers. This includes 80 per cent. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2002 : Column: 797W</I><P>
mandatory rate relief in England and Wales (fully centrally funded), with a further 20 per cent. available at the discretion of the local authority (75 per cent. centrally funded, with the local authority funding the remaining 25 per cent.). Any reduction in the total amount of business rates collected is automatically offset by an increase in total revenue support grant paid to local authorities.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many community amateur sports clubs have <i>(a)</i> a turnover of less than &#163;15,000 and <i>(b)</i> a rental income less than &#163;10,000.  [25020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The number of community amateur sports clubs across the UK with a turnover of less than &#163;15,000 and a rental income of less than &#163;10,000 will vary from year to year. It is the Government's intention to recognise the positive contribution that such clubs make to their local communities. On 30 November, a consultation documentation&#151;"Promoting Sport in the Community"&#151;was launched, seeking views from interested parties on the best way to support community amateur sports clubs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20108w63.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 A consultation document&#151;"Promoting Sport in the Community"&#151;was launched on 30 November, seeking views on the best way to support community amateur sports clubs.

<a name="20108w63.html_para5">On 30 November, the Charity Commission announced that it would recognise as charitable the promotion of community participation in healthy recreation by the provision of facilities for the playing of particular sports.

 The Treasury is in regular dialogue with the Performance and Innovation Unit, which is currently undertaking a wider review of the legal and regulatory framework for charities. The Treasury launched a consultation document&#151;"Promoting Sport in the Community"&#151;on 30 November, seeking views from interested parties before finalising decisions on the best way to support CASCs. The consultation document is separate from the work of the Performance and Innovation Unit, but will have regard to the conclusions of that separate review and in the course of deciding the best way forward, responses to the consultation will be shared with the Performance and Innovation Unit.

<P>
<P>

 A family's income tax liability is defined only for a complete fiscal year, and is based on the incomes and other circumstances of the adult(s) in that year. Working families tax credit (WFTC) awards can start throughout the year, are for 26 weeks, and the value of an award depends on the net weekly income of the family and other circumstances of the family measured at the time of the application. This means that the income tax liability of a WFTC recipient family cannot normally be determined from the data reported on the application form.

 The Chancellor receives numerous Budget representations, from a variety of sources. All taxes are kept under review and decisions are made as part of the normal Budget process. The expiry date for the tax relief provided by section 48 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 was extended by three years to 1 July 2005 by Section 72 of the Finance Act 2001.

 Pensioners currently face a variety of marginal deduction rates (MDRs), which range from 10 per cent. for those who are liable to pay tax at the lower rate only to 100 per cent. for those with incomes below the minimum income guarantee (MIG). Following the introduction of the pension credit (PC) in October 2003, pensioners will still face MDRs between 10 and 100 per cent. However, some 1.6 million pensioner households that currently face MDRs of 100 per cent., which will be eligible for the PC, will see their rate cut to 40 per cent. This is because pensioner households will receive 60 pence for every &#163;1 of income they have above

 The pay review bodies report to the Prime Minister and to departmental Ministers, and it is primarily for the relevant departmental Ministers to consider any recommendations. The regular annual reports from the Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) and the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) have already been completed and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced on 17 December the Government's acceptance of their recommendations. We are considering a special report on senior civil service pay from the Review Body on Senior Salaries (SSRB) and expect to publish the Report and announce the Government's response shortly. Other reports from the pay review bodies will be considered as they come forward.

 The Government do not have a specific policy on the proportion of their debt sold to the banking sector. Government debt is sold via auctions, which are open to all bidders via the gilt-edged market-makers. The Government do not influence the proportion of debt that is sold to a particular type of investor.

The main reasons for error were failing to correctly update benefits in kind in accordance with information provided by the employer and failing to restore the coding to a cumulative basis following a change of employment. We are seeking significant improvement in this area this year through our on-going quality assurance and quality control programme.

 The Government are committed to making tax law clearer and easier to use for taxpayers and their advisers. Through the work of the Tax Law Rewrite project they plan to rewrite direct tax legislation with a better structure and in simpler language. This will be achieved through a series of Bills and the first Bill covering the capital allowances code has already been enacted. The next Bill will rewrite the provisions for the taxation of employment income and pension income and taxable social security income to produce clearer and more accessible legislation.
