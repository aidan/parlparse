 Both Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation are effective methods for reducing Nitrogen Oxide (NOX) emissions from diesel vehicles. Exhaust Gas Recirculation is effective at low-medium engine load and can deliver moderate reductions in NOX emissions.

 Legislation to limit the emissions of pollutants from vehicles (including nitrogen oxide emissions) was first introduced in the 1970s. Particularly stringent standards, known colloquially as &#147;Euro 1&#148; were adopted in the early 1990s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70709w0001.htm_para9"><a name="07070914000126">Since then, successive standards have progressively tightened emissions limits with new vehicles currently having to meet Euro 4 standards. The Department for Transport has fully engaged with the European Commission, European Parliament, other member states and stakeholders in developing these standards.</p>

For this reason at the end of 2005 the European Commission published a proposal for tighter Euro 5 emissions standards for cars and vans. I am pleased to be able to state that, not only have these standards been recently adopted by the European Council and Parliament, but that the UK also successfully secured a further (Euro 6) round of standards which tighten diesel NOx limits by 68 per cent. compared to current Euro 4 standards. This will put the permitted levels for diesels close to the very low levels of petrol engined vehicles.</p>

 The UK continues to take very seriously the threat to elephant conservation posed by ivory poaching. In recent years the UK, along with EU partners, has supported the establishment of baseline data to monitor illegal killing and trade in elephants and their ivory by providing funds to support the MIKE and ETIS programmes under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). During the preparations for the 55<sup>(th)</sup> CITES Standing Committee on 2 June 2007, where approval of the stockpile sale was agreed in line with previously set criteria, the UK played an active role in considering the evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70709w0002.htm_para5"><a name="07070914000178">At the subsequent 14<sup>(th)</sup> Convention of the Parties to CITES which took place in the Hague in June, a longer term agreement was reached among African range states on ivory trade. Following a one-off sale of an amount of stockpiled ivory increased to take account of the passage of time, the proceeds of which are to be used for conservation purposes, it is now agreed that there will be a nine year resting period on any further sales of ivory. This will allow the effects of the one-off stockpile sale to be properly assessed. The agreement also includes the establishment of an African elephant Trust Fund to address elephant conservation issues across the continent. The UK fully supported this proposal when it was presented to the CITES Parties, and will be looking to monitor the reported impacts of the stockpiled ivory sales, and broader elephant conservation measures, particularly in its newly elected position as a member of the CITES Standing Committee.</p>

The first phase of the programme established the extent of loss of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon) from the water that passes through estuaries from the land to the sea. The programme established some general rules that could be applied in nutrient budgeting and how this knowledge could be used in the management of marine eutrophication. The second phase of the programme compared two sea areas in terms of the impact on aspects of marine biology associated with land based nutrient input. The programme established a basis for further understanding the need to manage nutrient inputs and the criteria that could be used to distinguish any undesirable disturbance resulting from anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. This knowledge has been deployed in support of assessments under the relevant EC directives and for the OSPAR Convention.</p>

The new standard will be an improvement tool for providers and will offer employers a single employer-verified badge to look for when sourcing workforce development provision. This will help employers to get best value for money from their investment in training by both reducing the time taken to source the highest quality provision and improving the quality of provision overall.</p>

 The Government are firmly committed to establishing 400 academies, There are no pre-determined targets relating to pupil places or their geographical distribution. The academies programme targets areas of inadequate educational attainment. Some academies are brand new schools in areas which need the extra places but most academies replace weak or under-performing schools.

 Together with any backlog maintenance, the asset management planning condition data supplied to the Department by local education authorities show future requirements over a five-year period. The backlog component is not specifically identified, but it is estimated that future requirements account for the majority of the costs shown in the data. All buildings suffer dilapidation and maintenance is regularly needed to counter this. It is not viable to eliminate future maintenance requirements, but the backlog is being tackled and the cost of urgent work has reduced by approximately 30 per cent. against the data received in 2001.</p>

The bulk of schools capital is allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including maintenance. While reducing maintenance requirements is a long-term aim, the primary objectives for funding are to raise educational standards and tackle local deprivation. A substantial proportion of capital funding is targeted at transformational programmes, such as Building Schools for the Future and the Primary Capital Programmes.

There was a material difference of opinion in the responses: the media supported the Government&#146;s proposal to allow the media into family courts as of right, but children and young people and the groups who support and protect them disagreed.

This is the most recent full year for which published data are available. All other date are taken from the Time Intervals Survey (TIS) in the magistrates courts. The TIS is a sample survey that produces estimates of the average time taken between stages of proceedings for defendants in completed criminal cases in magistrates' courts. More Information on TIS is available from the Ministry of Justice website.  2. All 'committals' statistics shown above include cases which were sent to the Crown Court for trial without committal proceedings, under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Ad 1998. The above figures relate to both adult and youth defendants, and include both summonsed and charged cases. This TIS data relates to indictable and triable either way cases only, and therefore excludes the small number of summary cases that are committed to the Crown Court However, these cases will be counted in the total number of cases per year.  3. &#147;First listing&#148; refers to the first listed hearing of the case in the magistrates courts Figures for adjournments relate to the whole duration of the case in the magistrates courts, and will therefore count adjournments to other hearings besides the committal hearing. Figures are not available on the number of adjournments by hearing type. The number of adjournments in any given case is defined as being one less than the number of times the case was listed. A listing refers to any occasion when the case was considered by the court. The average number of adjournments is the average across all cases, including those which were completed at first listing and where no adjournments occurred. The average length of adjournments is calculated by dividing the duration of a case (from first listing to completion) by the number of adjournments that occurred.<br>

 The Government have not made any estimation of election turnout rates among those eligible voters whose first language is not English. The Electoral Commission has the role of evaluating election turnout, and published its report &#145;Election 2005: Turnout. How many, who and why?&#146; in October 2005, That report indicated, based on research polls, that the turnout rate of BME groups was 47 per cent. (lower than the overall turnout of 61 per cent.). However,, this figure does not include any consideration of English as a second language, and the Commission has not included any research into this issue within its report. Such research would undoubtedly prove difficult to undertake, since it would not be clear from any direct recorded source whether an eligible voter uses another language, other than English, as his first language.</p>

This should benefit 40,000 parents with care and 55,000 children. It is essential that children can benefit from maintenance that parents provide. The White Paper makes clear that, from 2010-11, the Government will significantly increase the amount of maintenance that all parents with care on benefit can keep before it affects the level of benefit they receive. This timescale enables further analysis to be undertaken on the potential impact of different levels of disregard on child poverty, compliance rates and work incentives.</p>

 Any shortfall between the housing benefit received and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels, the accommodation choices made by tenants and the tenant's income. It is currently hard to predict each of these aspects up to the point of national roll-out of the local housing allowance. We will be monitoring shortfalls between the shared room rate and contractual rent as part of the two year review of the national roll-out of the local housing allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70709w0016.htm_para2"><a name="07070924002473">The shared room rate under the national roll-out of the local housing allowance covers a broader definition of what can be counted as shared accommodation than the single room rent restriction. Additionally, as the shared room rate will be set at the median of local market rents, this ensures that 50 per cent. of the shared properties on the Rent Officers' database will be affordable at the shared room rate. Since the rates are published, tenants will also be aware of their maximum housing benefit entitlement in advance and be able to make an informed decision about what accommodation they can afford.</p>

 The definition for broad rental market area (BRMA) is laid down in statute and it does not require rent officers to have any regard to rent levels.

The BRMA must contain a mix of property types held on a variety of tenancies.</p>

 We are aware that people with severe or specific learning difficulties are one of the groups least likely to move off state benefits and into sustained work. We recognise that part-time work can be important to well-being, to developing self worth, and a stepping-stone to sustained work and a life independent of the benefit system. That is why we already have the permitted work rules in the current incapacity benefits system which enable a person on incapacity benefit to work up to 16 hours and earn up to &#163;86 per week, for an initial period of up to 52 weeks, to allow engagement with the labour market. For people on income support the earnings disregard is currently &#163;20 per week.</p>

 The Families at Risk Review found that in 2005, around 2 per cent. of families in Britain experienced five or more disadvantages. For example, those with parents lacking any qualifications. This was based on analysis using the Families and Children Study (FACS), which is representative of families with children in Britain. At the local council level, the number of families with five or more disadvantages in the FACS is very small, and it is therefore not possible to accurately estimate how many families are at risk in Blackpool, South or indeed in any other specific areas. </p>

The activities they support include poultry and fish rearing, silk production, and carpet weaving. DFID has also provided &#163;3 million to support research into a range of legal livelihoods, including high value crops such as mint and saffron.</p>

All of these funds have been spent and accounted for. The ICRC has not requested further funding. In 2007 DFID is providing support to internally displaced people in Burma through a grant of &#163;400,000 to support community-based groups (mostly Christian and Buddhist networks) working inside Burma who are able to provide humanitarian assistance in the short term to IDPs who would otherwise receive no help.

 In January 2007 almost all children in affected areas apart from the North East are attending school. Attendance in the North and East is now severely affected by the security situation. Almost all families previously in camps now have access to sturdier transitional shelter. Of the families whose homes were affected, 72 per cent. are now back in their own houses following reconstruction and repair work. Over 75 per cent. of people who lost their main source of income have regained some source of income.</p>

Only with all public and private sector housing workers performing at full capacity would a 50,000 annual target be reached. According to Sri Lankan Government figures about 98 per cent. of the permanent housing requirement in the south has been fulfilled, although in the east of Sri Lanka there are still significant shortfalls.</p>

Lack of humanitarian space has made it difficult to ensure that assistance is delivered equitably and in a timely manner to affected communities. UK officials will continue to work closely with the Sri Lankan authorities, NGOs and UN. We see progress towards peace and reconciliation as essential to enabling and sustaining post tsunami recovery and broader development in Sri Lanka. We hope that all parties will renew efforts to make progress in this direction.</p>

The business case for the FiReControl project shows that the costs of delivering a control service under FiReControl should be substantially lower than at present.

 New planning policy (PPS25 Development and flood risk) published in December 2006 directs development away from areas at risk of flooding from all sources. Local planning authorities should undertake a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment in line with PPS25 policy to identify the risks from all forms of flooding (including surface water run-off). Where there are particular surface water drainage problems they should use the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform the development of surface water management plans, as part of their Local Development Frameworks, to manage the risks through development opportunities and avoid inappropriate development in those areas. Some of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pilot studies on integrated urban drainage are examining the consequences of new development for surface water run-off and the options available for mitigating these effects.</p>

 New planning policy (PPS25 Development and flood risk) published in December 2006 promotes the use of sustainable drainage systems and development of surface water management plans. Planning obligations (or &#145;s106 planning agreements&#146;) are mechanisms to allow developers and local planning authorities to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. Where the need to improve drainage to reduce the risk of flooding is a material consideration, a planning obligation may be an appropriate mechanism to secure the agreement of the developer to undertake the necessary drainage improvements. The construction and maintenance costs of surface water drainage systems serving a development should be fully funded by the developer, and a planning obligation may be appropriate to secure this.</p>

 Data collected by the Department centrally does not identify the value of units of dental activity or provide a basis for comparisons of such values between primary care trusts (PCTs). PCTs set contract values and service level requirements locally. Each contract specifies an annual contract value and the number of units of dental activity (which are a weighted measure of the courses of treatment given to national health service patients) to be provided over the courses of the year. This relationship between contract values and annual units of dental activity will vary because of a number of factors, including differences in treatment patterns and treatment needs in different areas, the contract values negotiated locally by PCTs and dental practices, and the degree to which PCTs and practices may have agreed service outputs that cannot be measured through patient courses of treatment.</p>

These were demand led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health services work they chose to undertake. PCTs were not given fixed GDS funding allocations. In a number of areas, Personal Dental Service (PDS) pilots were also established, where some former GDS dental practices and some directly managed dental services converted to locally commissioned arrangements to test new ways of working and new forms of contract remuneration. PDS pilots were introduced in 1998 and were funded by PCTs from supplementary allocations issued by the Department of Health.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 July 2007]:</i> Guidance on the management of patients with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections was drawn up by a joint working party of the British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the Hospital Infection Society and the Infection Control Nurses Association. It was published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March 2006<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="70709w0027.htm_para7"><a name="07071015000364">The guidance makes clear that patient isolation for those infected or colonised with MRSA will be dependent on the facilities available and the associated level of risk. Isolation should be in a designated closed area that should be clearly defined; in most facilities, this will be either single-room accommodation or cohort areas/bays with clinical hand-washing facilities. The guidance also states that consideration should be given to the provision of isolation wards to contain MRSA spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="70709w0027.htm_para8"><a name="07071015000365">In addition to the guidance referred to above, the Health Act 2006, Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Health Care Associated Infections, requires trusts to have policies on allocation of patients to isolation facilities based on local risk assessment.</p>

 All acute trusts were offered an allocation of &#163;300,000 under the Capital Challenge Fund in order to enable investment in tackling infections to be increased quickly. All applications for funding up to that level were approved in full. There was no need for additional factors, including rates of Clostridium difficile infection to be taken into account. For national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), the Capital Challenge Fund offered a potential addition of &#163;300,000 to public dividend capital. In order to receive the addition, NHSFTs had to meet the general rules for entitlement to public dividend capital.</p>

 Each asylum and human rights application made by an Iraqi national is, as with all other nationalities, considered individually against the background of current information from a wide range of well-recognised sources about the situation in Iraq. Those who are found not to be in need of any international protection and have no legal basis of stay in the UK may return voluntarily to any region of Iraq. Where an individual does not return voluntarily, removal may be enforced. Enforced removals will only be undertaken where we are satisfied the individual has no protection needs.

[147486]</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 July 2007]:</i> Data for the number of fatalities caused by knives and sharp instruments is not available at borough level. The following table gives figures for the Metropolitan and City of London police force areas. Figures for the number of serious injuries caused by knife attacks are not currently available. However, new data collection arrangements from April 2007 will provide more detailed statistics on knife related violence. The British Crime Survey reports that knife crime as a proportion of all violent crime is broadly stable at 6-7 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="70709w0034.htm_para4"><a name="07071015001830">There is, of course, grave concern at the recent tragic incidents involving young people and knife crime. Work on tackling knife crime is being taken forward through the Home Secretary's round table on guns, knives and gangs, which has developed an action plan focussing on the themes of policing, powers and prevention. Legislation has recently been tightened in relation to knives, with the doubling of the maximum sentence for possession of a bladed instrument in a public place without good reason from two to four years. In April, a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon (including a knife) was introduced; and in May school staff were given powers to search pupils for knives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="70709w0034.htm_para5"><a name="07071015001831">On 26 June, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers, we published guidance on tackling knife enabled crime, to provide police officers with a menu of options which they might use in their area. We also support police work to tackle knife crime such as Operation Blunt, run by the Metropolitan police, and Operation Shield, run by the British Transport Police, which uses search arches and other technology to search people travelling on the transport network with weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="70709w0034.htm_para6"><a name="07071015001832">We recognise that policing and legislation are only part of the picture, however, and are also supporting educational projects such as the Be Safe programme, which helps young people understand the risks and consequences of carrying knives, and the Damilola Taylor Trust's &#147;Respect Your Life, Not a Knife&#148; campaign, which is encouraging young people to pledge not to carry weapons. We are also supporting local community organisations working to tackle knife crime through our Connected Fund. The sixth round of the fund was recently completed, and funding is now being provided to more than 100 projects in England and Wales to support local work.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 2 July 2007]:</i> Russia is a key ally in global efforts to overcome terrorism. To that end, we frequently discuss our perception of the current threats and our activity to counteract those threats with our Russian colleagues in international fora such as the United Nations and the G8, among others. The terrorist threat and strategies to counter the threat were key issues of discussion at the G8 JHA ministerial meeting in Munich in May, when the then Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith and I represented the UK. My right hon. Friend, the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) also attended the G8 Heiligendamm Summit in early July together with Russia's President Putin and other leaders. G8 leaders agreed two counter terrorism statements at the Heiligendamm summit to increase cooperation in meeting the shared challenges of global terrorism.</p>

 The United Kingdom entered an immigration reservation when it ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1986, in order to ensure that the Convention would not impede immigration policies and procedures in operation at the time. However, preparatory work for the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 subsequently ensured that all policies and practices operated by the then immigration and nationality directorate were non-discriminatory on the grounds of sex. An Interdepartmental Review of International Human Rights Instruments was carried out in 2004 and concluded that the reservation for immigration purposes was no longer appropriate and, therefore, the United Kingdom should withdraw its immigration reservation on this Convention.</p>

 The UK supports the work that the United Nations is doing in improving standards of care for children in countries where care arrangements are non-existent or poor. In the UK our domestic laws honour the spirit of the Convention in relation to the standards of care and treatment available to children, including asylum-seeking children. The Government believe the reservation remains justified in order to maintain an effective immigration control. The Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges its signatories to put the 'best interests' of the child first in making decisions and there are a number of instances where this may prevent lawful immigration functions being carried out. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women obliges signatories to treat men and women equally which creates less of a concern for carrying out immigration functions.</p>

 Neither the Border and Immigration Agency nor the Independent Monitoring Board scrutinise or monitor the length of time taken for staff at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre to answer outside telephone calls. The operating contract for Yarl's Wood requires the contractor to install sufficient pay telephones to meet the reasonable demands of detainees and/or dependants.
