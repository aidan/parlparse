<P>
<a name="71128w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bermingham: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will make a statement about his proposals to restructure the Crown Prosecution Service. [18857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 My written answer on 21 May 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>73-74</i>, to my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears) outlined the plans drawn up at my request by the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to dividing England and Wales into 42 Areas, each having its own Chief Crown Prosecutor designated by 1 April 1998. These plans included establishing selection boards to advise the DPP in appointing CCPs. In order to facilitate speedy progress, this exercise was taken forward concurrently with the work of the independent Review of the Crown Prosecution Service which the Government had also decided to establish. The planning of the move to 42 Areas was to be informed by any views expressed by the Review Team led by Sir Iain Glidewell.
<P>

<a name="71128w01.html_para0">The selection boards have now been held but no appointments will be made as a result of this. This follows unanimous advice from the Review Team to me and the DPP to the effect that such appointments would be premature. They consider it essential that the eventual selection of Chief Crown Prosecutors should take full account of important recommendations they will wish to make about the character and responsibilities of those posts as well as the service as a whole. They have also made it clear that their eventual recommendations will maximise the opportunity to build on the move to 42 Areas and provide an improved infrastructure more suitable to a truly locally based service within a national framework. Consideration has been given to deferring appointments rather than abandoning the competition. This would have meant on any view a delay of at least five months. After consulting widely I concluded that such a period of uncertainty would be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="71128w01.html_para1">This decision has inevitable consequences for the overall programme and the move to 42 operational Areas cannot now take effect until 1 December 1998 at the earliest. The precise time scale will be dependent on the full recommendations of the Review Team which I now expect to receive early next year and the Government response to them. No further steps towards appointments will be taken pending receipt of that report and its consideration. I regret the further period of uncertainty which this decision creates for the candidates concerned and all CPS staff. I am, however, convinced that it is in the best overall and long-term interests of the Service to proceed in this way.

In the meanwhile, the Agency will be responsible for maintaining existing defences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We do not expect these proposals to have any significant net cost to local authorities. They are not about requiring local authorities or the police to deliver a new service; rather, they will simply require them to put crime prevention and community safety issues at the heart of delivery of existing services, where they have always belonged. Furthermore, effective and well-targeted crime-prevention strategies should generate significant savings for local authorities and the police, through reduced crime levels.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the key changes made in the strategic aims for the Prison Service in the 1997-98 Business Plan of the Prison Service from those set out in the previous corporate plan, indicating the reasons for each change. [16537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The previous Corporate Plan set out six strategic aims for 1996-99. The present Business Plan continues those aims for this year, 1997-98, with only minor amendments to three aims. The text of these are as follows, with the changes underlined:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 1</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Previous Corporate Plan: "To achieve unit cost reductions of 10.2 per cent.; and to contain capital spending by encouraging greater private sector involvement; while maintaining the balance between security, control, purposeful regimes and support for staff".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>28 Nov 1997 : Column: 670</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Current Business Plan: "To achieve unit cost reductions <i>of 5.3 per cent. in real terms over 1997-2000</i>: and to contain capital spending by encouraging private sector involvement <i>where appropriate</i>: while maintaining the balance between security, control, purposeful regimes, and support for staff<i></i>".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The reasons for these changes are first to reflect the new targets for unit cost reduction set by the 1996 Public Expenditure Settlement, and secondly to emphasise that private sector involvement should be sought not as an end in itself, but only where it is appropriate.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 2</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Previous Corporate Plan: "To sustain a balanced step improvement in performance on escapes, building on what we achieved in 1995-96; in particular, to complete the programme of work to enhance security for Category A and high profile Category B prisoners, and to achieve a significant reduction in escapes from escort".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Current Business Plan: "To sustain <i>the reduction in the escape rate already achieved</i>: and, in particular, to complete the programme of work to enhance security for Category A and high profile Category B prisoners, and to achieve a significant further reduction in escapes from escort<i></i>".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The reason for the change is that it would be odd to continue to refer back to 1995-96, particularly where there had been further improvement in performance since then.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 5</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Previous Corporate Plan: "To meet basic health care needs of the population, and to target particularly the transfer of mentally ill prisoners to hospital".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Current Business Plan: "To <i>maintain the primary (general practitioner level)</i> <i></i>health care needs of the population, referring prisoners to National Health Service specialists for treatment as appropriate and to target particularly the transfer of mentally ill prisoners to hospital<i></i>".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Business Plan states, the reason for the change was to describe policy more accurately.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Strategic aims 3, 4 and 6 remain unchanged as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 3</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To maintain control and a safe environment for staff and prisoners in the face of cost reductions and operational pressures; specifically, to carry through work on incentives, the drugs strategy and prevention of suicide.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 4</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To maintain balanced regimes which support control and include affordable, effective activities to reduce the risk of re-offending.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Strategic Aim 6</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To strengthen effectiveness of staff at all levels and specifically to increase the effectiveness of financial controls and systems.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list all new prison projects currently being assessed by his Department indicating the progress to date in the development of each establishment; and if he will make a statement. [18095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 At present, the Prison Service is actively considering four possible sites for the construction of new prisons. These are at: Ashworth (Maghull); Belmarsh (Woolwich); Winwick (near Warrington); and Peterborough. In the case of the latter, the Service's planning application was refused by Peterborough City Council on 19 November. Formal planning applications have yet to be prepared for the other three sites.

 The Government made a manifesto commitment to produce a national child care strategy which will help parents, especially women, to balance family and working life. Since 1 May, important steps have been taken across a number of Departments to carry forward this commitment, including this week's major announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer of a &#163;300 million investment in out-of-school child care over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="71128w02.html_para0">This initiative is intended to deliver an out-of-school club in every community across the UK. We have already announced in the Budget that the disregard for child care costs in Family Credit, Disability Working Allowance, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit will be increased from a maximum of &#163;60 to &#163;100 a week from June 1998, as well as a &#163;4 billion new deal package, including provision of work experience and training for young unemployed people who wish to work in child care and help for lone parents wanting to go back to work.
<P>

<a name="71128w02.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced this week that, to ensure that work pays for families with children, we will consider a working families tax credit, building on successful elements of family credit and involving better help through the tax system for child care costs.

It also stated (para. 9.28) that all departments would, as resources could be made available, review all material currently withheld for longer than 30 years to see whether its sensitivity had passed and to release it, if possible.

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1997]:</i> Article 116 of the Amsterdam Treaty is designed to provide a clear and specific legal basis for strengthened customs co-operation between member states on matters which already fall within Community competence, for example, in relation to administrative co-operation on customs duty issues. A variety of measures in this area have already been agreed under Article 100a of the Treaty of Rome. The new Article makes it clear that customs co-operation in relation to criminal matters, such as drug smuggling, remains a matter for the inter-governmental third pillar.

 I attended a meeting of the Budget Council yesterday to consider the Council's second reading of the 1998 EC draft budget. As a result, the level of payments in the draft budget has been reduced by approximately 1,1000 million ecu from the European Parliament's first reading. This represents an increase of approximately 1.4 per cent. over the 1997 EC budget, compared with 2.7 per cent. following the Parliament's first reading. The draft budget as amended will now be transmitted to the European Parliament, which will adopt the final budget for 1998 at its second reading in December.

<P>
<a name="71128w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The information that is readily available is held in a different form. In 1995-96, District Health Authorities and Family Health Services Authorities made provision of &#163;3.3 million in respect of early retirement and redundancy costs. In 1996-97, the new health Authorities made a further provision of &#163;1.9 million. These will have included (without distinction) costs of early retirements and dismissals on grounds of redundancy or in the interests of the efficiency of the service, but the bulk of these costs can probably be attributed to the reorganisation. Some further transitional costs may be incurred in 1997-98 and 1998-99, as health authorities were given 3 years from 1 April 1996 to reap the full savings. This was to avoid costs that too fast a transition to new staffing levels would have entailed.

 The full cost of bringing City Hall, Cardiff into a suitable condition for the Assembly was estimated at just over &#163;32 million on the basis of purchase at the District Valuer's market valuation of &#163;3.5 million. The minimum cost of adapting and equipping City Hall for a modern Assembly building would have been &#163;8.5 million taking account of the building's grade 2* listing.

 Clinical lead poisoning in children is now very rare, and is expected to decrease as old leaded paint becomes less common.

Recent surveys indicate that about 5 per cent. of children have blood lead levels in the range where there is persuasive evidence of subclinical harm to neuropsychological development. In nearly all such children, the estimated effect is a deficit of one to three IQ points. Exposure to lead will continue to decrease as a consequence of current and proposed measures.

 A detailed account of the methodology and main statistical assumptions underlying the latest household projections is set out in the annexes of "Projections of Households in England to 2016", published by The Stationery Office in March 1995. A copy of this publication is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71128w06.html_para11">A household was defined in the household projections, as in the 1981 and 1991 Censuses and official surveys, as one person living alone, or a group of people who share common housekeeping or a living room. People who rent a room or share a house will be regarded as part of the larger household or as a separate household depending on such housekeeping arrangements. Information on the numbers of separate households is obtained from the 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 1997 : Column: 689</I><P>
Censuses and (at national level) the Labour Force Survey. Additionally, estimates are made of concealed couples and concealed lone parents--those couples and lone parents who are part of another household--but these estimates do not form part of the total number of households. The incidence of cohabitation is taken into account in the compilation of the household projection by its separate categorisation in the underlying marital status projections, provided by the Government Actuary's Department. A detailed description of the treatment of the marital status projections and cohabitation is provided in Annexes D and G of the publication referred to above.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the estimated effect on aggregate local authority costs, in a full year, of <i>(a)</i> a rise in interest rates from 6 per cent. to 7.25 per cent. and <i>(b)</i> a rise in inflation from 2 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. [17968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I estimate that English local authorities currently hold about &#163;5 billion in variable rate debt, on which additional interest payments of about &#163;62 million would arise if interest rates rose by 1.25 per cent. generally.
<P>

<a name="71128w07.html_para0">Further, if authorities undertake new borrowing of &#163;2 billion a year, broadly in line with the issue of new credit approvals, then a 1.25 per cent. rise in interest rates would increase interest payments on this new borrowing by &#163;25 million.
<P>

<a name="71128w07.html_para1">Local authorities currently hold around &#163;10 billion in bank deposits and other short term investments and might therefore earn additional interest of up to &#163;125 million, if rates rose by 1.25 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71128w07.html_para2">The additional costs or income arising from the increase in interest rates will tend to be offset over time by compensating changes in Housing Revenue Account subsidy and Revenue Support Grant paid to local authorities by central government.
<P>

<a name="71128w07.html_para3">As far as the effect on local authority costs of a rise in inflation is concerned, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to him on 24 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>367-68.</i>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what would be the average effect on band D council tax of a national increase in local authority costs of &#163;300 million, assuming <i>(a)</i> that this cost is spent equally between authorities 



<P>
<P><I>28 Nov 1997 : Column: 690</I><P>
according to the number of dwellings chargeable for council tax, <i>(b)</i> that there is no increase in central Government grant and <i>(c)</i> that the average gearing ratio applies in council spending; [17958]
<P>
<UL>(2) what would be the effect on band D council tax for each local authority in England of a national increase in local authority costs of &#163;300 million in 1997-98, assuming <i>(a)</i> that this cost is spread equally between authorities according to the number of dwellings chargeable for council tax and <i>(b)</i> that there is no increase in central government grants. [17959]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 An increase of &#163;300 million in the amount required from council taxes for England is equivalent to an increase in the average band D council tax of &#163;18.37. I have today placed in the Library estimates of the effect on band D council taxes for each local authority area of an increase of &#163;300 million in the amount required nationally from council taxes, assuming that this amount is spread equally between billing authorities according to the estimated number of chargeable dwellings in each area.

 When development plans are being prepared, altered or replaced the Secretary of State has powers to direct local authorities to modify their plans and may call all or part of a plan in for his own determination. A direction will indicate the nature of the change required to be made to the plan, but does not otherwise specify the amendment to be made. The Secretary of State can amend a plan he has called in for his own determination; but no plans have been called in since 1 May 1997. Government Offices, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, are in regular contact with local authorities commenting on draft and deposited plans and proposed modifications. Information on all observations made in that context could be made available only at disproportionate cost.

 The assessment of the capacity of both terminals and runways is a complex matter, depending on factors such as the type and mix of traffic, the extent to which traffic is concentrated in peak times and the quality of service standards applied by each airport. It is for individual airport operators, in consultation with airport users, to monitor both the existing and expected future position, and in the light of that to bring forward investment proposals and take such other steps as may be necessary and desirable.

they obtain, and which therefore is available to the Department, does not cover medical cause because it is not possible routinely to establish any medical condition and its link to the accident. The Department has not felt it necessary to commission or to evaluate studies of the driving behaviour of insulin-dependent diabetics. There have been a number of studies by experts in the field on the consequences of insulin treatment. These have shown that insulin treatment leads to a significant risk of hypoglycaemia, which can lead to loss of consciousness, as well as other effects such as diminished judgment. It is well established that hypoglycaemia can occur without warning. The provisions on insulin-dependent diabetic drivers included in the Second EC Driver Licensing Directive, adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1991 (and coming into force in the United Kingdom in this respect on 1 January 1998), are based on these considerations. The view that the driving of the heavier vehicles by such drivers presents an unacceptable risk to other road users has been endorsed by the Secretary of State's Honorary Advisory Panel on Diabetes and Driving.

By specifically investing in both its people and its infrastructure, the Agency will be able to continue to provide the detailed technical expertise and physical force projection capabilities required to support operations such as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and the successful withdrawal from Hong Kong. Given all the pressures on the Agency, not least continual downward financial pressure, I believe these to be challenging but achievable.

 New Deal options are designed to help young people to find work and be better able to sustain employment. Young people who need support to find work after their option will receive intensive help through the New Deal follow-through strategy. The 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 We have consulted widely on the Environment Taskforce and Voluntary Sector options to ensure that they will provide New Deal participants with high-quality work experience placements. Young people on these options will undertake real work, improving their local communities and the environment, and will receive training towards approved qualifications and jobsearch help. They will also receive either a wage, or a grant of up to &#163;400 over the six months in addition to their benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures have been taken to ensure that employers taking on subsidised applicants through the New Deal are creating additional jobs. [18289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Employers will be asked to give an undertaking that they have not made an existing employee redundant to make way for a New Deal participant. If there is evidence to suggest that this has happened, it will be investigated.
<P>

<a name="71128w08.html_para1">It is not the principal purpose of the subsidy to create additional jobs. The main aim is to encourage employers to consider, when recruiting, people they would normally reject because of the time they have spent in unemployment. By doing this, the New Deal will help to create the conditions under which the economy can continue to grow and produce new jobs.
<P>

<a name="71128w08.html_para2">In addition, some employers may be motivated to increase their workforce, in answer to real business needs, by the availability of a subsidy which offsets initial costs of recruitment and training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the number of applicants who will enter <i>(a)</i> the subsidised employment option, <i>(b)</i> the full-time education or training option, <i>(c)</i> the voluntary sector option and <i>(d) </i>the Environmental Task Force option of the New Deal.[18287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w08.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 No such estimates have been made. We will however want as many young people as possible to be able to take a place in the Employment Option, and our planning assumption is that over 40 per cent. of those entering options will do so. It is a key principle of the design of the New Deal for 18-24 year olds that young people should be helped to choose the

option most appropriate for them. Each of the options is to provide high-quality opportunities for work, education and training.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Education Action Zones are a radical and important element in our plans to raise standards in schools, especially those in challenging circumstances. They will provide new exciting ways for schools and LEAs, and parents, business and community organisations, to work together to raise standards.
<P>

<a name="71128w09.html_para0">Action Zones will be in urban and rural areas where schools are in need of additional focused support and will exist for at least three years, and often longer. Each will be run with the help of a Forum which will set challenging targets and put forward ambitious, innovative plans for meeting them. Local partnerships will need to bid to be in the programme. We expect to create at least 25 zones during this parliament. We shall very shortly be publishing the School Standards and Framework Bill which will provide the statutory basis for Education Action Zones.

authorities flowing from the White Paper is to refocus their existing resources towards the delivery of higher standards of pupil achievement. The extent of the net costs or net savings will vary between authorities according to the extent that a given authority has already adjusted the balance of its support for schools in this direction in recent years. In accordance with the White Paper principle of intervention in inverse proportion to success, LEAs' plans should include a review of all existing activity to ensure that its work in support of raising standards is well targeted. The Government will ensure through the regular process of approving LEAs' Education Development Plans that the resources an LEA plans to commit are appropriate for the task.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will ascertain the number of classrooms of wooden construction currently in use in Leicestershire, indicating their location, the number of pupils currently educated in them and the date their safety was last checked. [18203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71128w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 It is for LEAs to determine how they provide the school places for pupils in their own area. I recognise that many LEAs do currently have to rely on classrooms of wooden construction which are at the end of, or beyond, their design life. The New Deal for Schools (NDS) will help LEAs to redress such problems. It provides for bids covering a variety of school building needs. Over 2,000 schools will benefit from the &#163;115 million which the Prime Minster announced would be spent in the current financial year. By the end of this Parliament we expect an additional &#163;2 billion to be spent as a result of the NDS.
