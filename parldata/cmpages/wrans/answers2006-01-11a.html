In addition, we are providing financial support as well as staff secondments to the IOM, the lead international agency managing shelter issues, as well as financial support to six non governmental organisations that are implementing shelter programmes. This support is helping relocated North West Frontier and Kashmir populations in camps at lower altitude as well as those villagers living in remote locations above 5,000 feet.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60111w04.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Accident and emergency ambulance services in Derry city are commissioned by the western health and social services board from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) on the basis of historical patterns of demand. Levels of cover therefore vary to meet demand but there are usually three to five vehicles on duty during the day and two to three at night crewed by a total complement of 46 operational staff.

<p>
<a name="60111w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">During the recent Christmas period, NIAS experienced an unusually high level of staff sickness absence. In addition to six Altnagelvin station staff already absent, a further seven reported sick at short notice. As a result, of 58 planned shifts over the period 24 to 29 December, it was possible to cover only 41. However, full cover was resumed on 30 December 2005 and was maintained over the rest of the period including new year&#039;s eve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60111w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">Immediate action taken to reduce the impact of the sickness absence included redeploying staff from other stations, offering overtime to ambulance staff throughout Northern Ireland, assigning day shift staff to night-time cover, redeploying rapid response vehicles and introducing additional non-emergency vehicles to minimise the need for emergency crews to undertake non- emergency work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60111w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_42">In the longer term NIAS plans to review its procedures for allocating leave and overtime, and shift rotas to ensure effective staff cover. NIAS will incorporate its findings into a review of its absence management procedures.

Member for Carshalton and Wallington on 11 July 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 759W, my officials have been working closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to ensure that information collected by Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technologies and retained by the Police is cognisant of the relevant data protection legislation. The specific ACPO guidance states:

This period of retention is to facilitate the searching of that data on a case-by-case basis, should a crime committed during the deployment come to light during that two-year period. It would be expected that after the initial 90 days period, the data will be &#039;partitioned&#039; for the rest of its retention period. In the period of 91 days to two years, the data will only be accessed for a justified policing need. Access to this data will be &#039;controlled and documented&#039; to ensure its compliance with the proportionality, justification and use. In exceptional circumstances there may be operational grounds to justify retention of ANPR data beyond the two-year period. Should this occur a record of the grounds should be retained&quot;.</p>

 Since 1 January 1999 the United Kingdom has been required to implement EU Directive 89/460/EC, which allows the use of road vehicles with 11.5 tonne axle loads and plated vehicle weights of 40 tonnes. These vehicles are more demanding in loading terms than a 44 tonne vehicle on six axles. The Directive applies to &quot;principal routes&quot; used in international traffic, and in the UK these have been assumed to be motorways, all purpose trunk roads and the primary route network.

<a name="60111w06.html_para2">
Under The Railway Bridges (Load Bearing Standards) Regulations (England and Wales) Order 1972 (SI 1705/1972) bridges carrying highways over railways are required to take a 24 tonne rigid lorry or a 32 tonne articulated lorry. So any strengthening to take 40 tonne (or 44 tonne) lorries is the sole responsibility of the relevant highway authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60111w06.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_58">When the Directive came into force, all bridges on the motorway and trunk road network were able to accommodate 40 tonne vehicles. In the six years from 2001&#150;02 to 2006&#150;07 &#163;205 million has been provided to strengthen bridges on the local authority primary route network to take 40 tonne lorries. In the same period &#163;703 million has been provided to strengthen local authority bridges not on the primary route network, but not all of these bridges are required to take the 40 tonne loading.

 We recognise the work of the Prince&#039;s Trust, particularly through their team programme, in helping hard to reach young people back into learning.

I have already met with the Prince&#039;s Trust to discuss these issues and will be meeting with them and the LSC to discuss progress shortly.

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">Firstly, you asked what representations she has received on the funding of Prince&#039;s Trust schemes by Learning and Skills Councils (LSC). The LSC has been working with the Trust for many years, supporting and funding the Team Programme through our local offices and colleges. As you may be aware, the LSC&#039;s funding priorities are decided at regional and local level, and the total amount of funding for the Team Programme therefore varies from region to region. The discussions between the LSC and our providers and the Prince&#039;s Trust are currently ongoing, with support already identified and finalised for this funding year in the majority of LSC regions. Across the LSC our funding support for this academic year will total approximately &#163;11 million, which I hope demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the Team Programme.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">We are working closely with The Prince&#039;s Trust to establish the contribution of the programme towards LSC priorities and to identify additional sources of funding, outside of the LSC. We have also created a task force between the LSC and the Prince&#039;s Trust who are working together to establish how our joint planning cycles can support this aim. Our shared ambition is for a secure future for the Team Programme that is not dependent on a single LSC funding source.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">In your further question to the Secretary of State you asked what assessment she has made of the effects of prioritising 14 to 19 education on the funding of Prince&#039;s Trust schemes in Greater Manchester. LSC Funding is currently channelled through a lead college out to other partners delivering Prince&#039;s Trust programmes across the LSC areas in the region. Each learner joins the Prince&#039;s Trust Team Programme through which they aim to achieve the customised City & Guilds Profile of Achievement.</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jan 2006 : Column 656W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">The LSC in Greater Manchester currently spends approximately &#163;265m on provision for young people, much of which supports learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our commitment to this group of learners remains a key priority for the LSC both locally and nationally. The Prince&#039;s Trust provision is one of the many routes we are supporting for young people, and the LSC has to make some difficult funding decisions this year in order to balance a range of priorities for the area. This has therefore affected the level of funding support available to the Prince&#039;s Trust provision.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">However, the funding earmarked for Prince&#039;s Trust in Greater Manchester for this year will total at least &#163;750,000, a considerable investment in the Team Programme. I understand my colleagues in the local office are working with key partners and providers to identify potential further funding to support this provision. We are also working closely with the Prince&#039;s Trust locally and nationally to ensure that we plan together effectively to meet our shared priorities.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. Due to the rounding methods used, figures may not always equal the sum of the parts. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in 5 have been rounded to the nearest 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

2. The detailed figures above have been compiled from unit statistics related to unit postcodes. For some units postcode information is either unavailable or inappropriate.<br>

3. Figures are for UK regular forces, both trained and untrained, located in the UK and overseas. They therefore exclude Gurkhas, full time reserve service personnel, the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists. Location statistics are not available for FTRS, the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and Mobilised Reservists.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Due to the rounding methods used, figures may not always equal the sum of the parts. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in 5 have been rounded to the nearest 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

2. The detailed figures above have been compiled from unit statistics related to unit postcodes. For some units postcode information is either unavailable or inappropriate.<br>

3. Figures are for UK regular forces, both trained and untrained, located in the UK. They therefore exclude Gurkhas, full-time reserve service personnel, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists. Location statistics are not available for FTRS, the home service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists.<br>

4. Figures do not include 90 personnel who have no location indicator, or 1,470 who are centrally administered.<br>

<p><a name="qn_84"><a name="60111w11.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will ensure that the review of the far eastern civilian prisoners of war compensation scheme announced on 12 December considers whether the bloodlink criterion amounts to racial discrimination. [39437]</p>




<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60111w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 The &quot;birthlink&quot; criterion is used to determine eligibility for the civilian element of the ex-gratia payment scheme for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees; it is based on the place of birth (in the UK) of the individual or one of his or her parents or grandparents and not on a specific racial or &quot;bloodlink&quot; criterion. The question of whether use of this criterion resulted in racial discrimination is currently the subject of appeals by both the Secretary of State and the claimant (Mrs. D Elias) against a High Court decision on a case brought by a former civilian internee. The outcome of the legal proceedings will determine whether use of the criterion amounts to racial discrimination. The review that I outlined in my statement on 12 December 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1119, will examine whether consistent eligibility criteria were used to determine eligibility for civilian internees; it will not address whether the scheme was discriminatory. The Department has accepted, however, that it should have reviewed the operation of the scheme under the terms of section 71 (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976; we are currently considering the appropriate timescale for undertaking this review but do not consider that it could sensibly be completed until the legal proceedings referred to above have been completed.

 The provision of &quot;safe houses&quot; for victims of trafficking is a long-standing concern of voluntary organisations and practitioners working in this field. A safe house for minors was set up by West Sussex social services in 1995 following a number of disappearances of West African girls in local authority care. Voluntary organisations welcomed the provision but unfortunately 50 percent. of the girls went missing, with fears that the safe house had been infiltrated by traffickers. West Sussex social services department took the decision to close the house and provide foster placements instead. A further safe house was set up by Integrated Care in West Sussex, but was closed shortly after it opened in early June 2005 following a lack of referrals by local authorities. It is recognised that child victims of trafficking will be in need of welfare services and protection under the provisions of Child Care Legislation.

<p><a name="st_152"><a name="60111w16.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), under the police incentivisation scheme the police service receive one-third of the total assets recovered over and above &#163;40 million in 2004&#150;05, increasing to one half in 2005&#150;06. The Government are spending more than the first &#163;40 million to support existing spending commitments in the asset recovery field. It was also agreed with ACPO that incentive payments would be based on each force&#039;s annual performance in the recovery of criminal assets. There are no plans to change this agreement. However, the Home Secretary announced last November that Home Office funding of &#163;2.6 million per year for financial investigators in police forces, which was due to end in March, would be extended for a further year. From 2006&#150;07 a new incentive scheme will operate under which all agencies involved in asset recovery, including the police service, will get back 50 per cent. of what they recover. There are at present no plans to increase this share.

Notes:<br>

1. These figures are as reported by Rossendale borough council on the revenue out-turn (RO) returns submitted to ODPM.<br>

2. Central Government funding is defined here as the sum of specific grants inside aggregate external finance (AEF) and formula grant (revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and police grant). Specific grants inside AEF are those revenue grants paid for councils&#039; core services (such as waste collection), excluding funding for local authorities&#039; housing management.<br>

3. The information provided excludes capital funding and funding for local authorities&#039; housing management responsibilities.<br>

4. The information excludes those grant programmes, such as European funding, where authorities are simply one of the recipients of funding paid towards an area.<br>

5. Comparisons across years may not be valid because the figures shown are not adjusted for changes in local authority responsibilities.<br>

<p>
<a name="60111w18.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_133">The increase in central Government funding in 2003&#150;04 is in part due to housing benefit and council tax benefit administration specific grant doubling from &#163;243,000 in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;493,000 in 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60111w18.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_134">The large increase in total central Government funding 2004&#150;05 is principally due to a &#163;2.2 million grant for a Housing Stock Options Appraisal Project.

<a name="60111w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_135">The decrease in formula grant between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 is due largely to the removal, with effect from 2004&#150;05, of local authorities&#039; responsibility for paying part of the costs of council tax benefit and housing benefit.

<br>

Notes:<br>

1. &#039;Referrals accepted for investigations&#039; exclude general Matching Service cases.<br>

2. The fraud database shows completed cases that commenced in the relevant period. Due to the time between commencement of investigation and completion of prosecution, some cases will be included data collated for earlier periods. All totals are therefore correct at the time when quoted but subject to adjustment at a later date.<br>

3. The significant reduction in 1998&#150;99 results from a changed definition of cases to be referred to investigation. Prior to this year any cases in error was referred. After that date any case in error where there was a suspicion of fraud was referred.<br>

4. The decline in referrals from 1999&#150;2000 reflects our success in reducing the level of fraud significantly over that period&#151;down by over 60 per cent. in IS/JSA.<br>

5. Sanctions include Administrative Penalties and Cautions. Administrative Penalties as an alternative to prosecution, were introduced by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act (1997) with effect from December 1998. Cautions were made available to local authorities as a sanction from the start of 2001&#150;02.<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive, as Stephen Geraghty is on leave I am replying on his behalf.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many cases are currently with the Child Support Agency&#039;s specialist enforcement teams; and what action he is taking to reduce that number.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">There are currently 15,784 cases with the Child Support Agency&#039;s specialist debt enforcement teams who are responsible for recovery of debt by means of civil debt recovery through the courts. It is expected that the number of cases referred to enforcement will increase over the short term as the Agency instigates enforcement action earlier in the process when lower amounts of debt have accrued.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">The enforcement teams are becoming much more successful in utilising their enforcement powers. This is being demonstrated by the significant improvement in the in-month cash collections achieved, rising from &#163;0.52m in January 2005 to &#163;1.42m in November 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">In addition, the enforcement teams are closely monitoring the times taken to drive cases forward for both old scheme cases and new scheme cases and these times are improving. This action is being taken to ensure that we reach agreement on payment in full, or a payment arrangement with the non-resident parent quickly and effectively, ensuring money is obtained for the parent with care.</p>

<sup>(19)</sup> Figures for the years 1997&#150;2002 relate to old scheme cases only, whereas those for 2004&#150;05 relate to overall performance across both old and new schemes. Robust information/information for new and old scheme cases on the new computer system is not available for the quarter ending August 2003.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 1,000 and percentages to the nearest whole per cent.<br>

2. Figures are given as at August in each year as this is the latest available period for which comparable old scheme figures are available in earlier years.<br>

3. The above includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

4. The proportion of compliant cases is calculated by expressing cases which are currently open and have paid any of the maintenance due via the collection service over the preceding quarter expressed as a percentage of all those (currently open) cases charged maintenance via the collection service (either regular maintenance and/or arrears) over the same quarter.<br>

5. The table excludes maintenance direct cases (of which there were 99,000 in August 2005), in which the CSA have carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent then pays his/her maintenance liability directly to the parent with care. As the CSA is no longer directly involved in the case, it is not possible to say how much, if any of the original CSA maintenance liability is being paid.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Parliamentary constituency caseloads are rounded to the nearest 100 therefore totals may not sum.<br>

2. Data for parliamentary constituency and wards are not released simultaneously. The data provided is the most recent for each.<br>

3. All benefit counts at ward level are rounded to a multiple of 5 to protect the confidentiality of the individual claimants.<br>

4. Pension credit (PC) replaced minimum income guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto pension credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

5. WPLS data are taken as at 31 May2005.<br>

6. These figures used for the parliamentary constituencies are early estimates.<br>

Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases and these figures become available three to four months after the early estimates.<br>

7. Couples may contain a number of partners who are less than the age of 60.<br>

8. The table includes clients who are in receipt of Guarantee Credit only and those who receive Guarantee Credit and Savings Credit.<br>

9. Parliamentary constituencies and wards are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant ONS postcode directory.<br>

10. All wards nest within the Vale of Clwyd parliamentary constituency apart from Llandyrnog which is partly with Clwyd West constituency, therefore the sum of the wards will not match the Vale of Clwyd parliamentary constituency value.<br>
