<p><a name="50208w01.html_spnew0"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The Big Lottery Fund was launched on 1 June 2004 following the administrative merger of the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and the Community Fund. The National Lottery Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish one new body, which will replace the two existing Funds and the Millennium Commission and have responsibility for distributing half the money for good causes from the National Lottery. The Big Lottery Fund will build on the achievements of NOF and the Community Fund, but will be a genuinely new body. There will be much more opportunity to involve the public in priority setting, getting local people actively involved in improving life in their communities.

 The impacts of free trade in agricultural products on biodiversity will be largely determined by the subsequent business decisions made by farmers. Prior to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, production decisions were influenced by the subsidy regime. To monitor and evaluate the impacts of changes in farmers&#039; production decisions, Defra will establish a range of improved monitoring processes including an &#039;observatory&#039; function. This will look at the environmental impacts of the reforms as a result of changes in farm practices and production levels. We have commissioned a scoping study to help us define this function and are currently considering options for delivering it.

<sup>(1)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak.<br>

<p><a name="50208w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. John Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent estimate she has made of how much the Common Agricultural Policy costs an average sized family in <i>(a)</i> increased food prices and <i>(b)</i> taxes.  [212133]</p>




<p><a name="50208w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) raises the price of agricultural products to consumers, though the specific effect will vary over time according to conditions in world markets and exchange rates. We can make an estimate of the cost of the CAP to consumers by comparing the domestic price of agricultural products with the world price. Our latest provisional estimate is for 2003 and this shows a cost to UK consumers in the range &#163;4.50 to &#163;5, per family of four, per week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w02.html_para0">
The UK does not contribute to individual EU budget categories, rather it contributes to the entire EU budget. In order to provide an indication of the cost to UK taxpayers we have calculated a notional UK contribution to expenditure on the CAP.

she has made of the economic effects on <i>(a)</i> UK consumers and <i>(b)</i> the UK economy of allowing free trade in agricultural products.  [212134]</p>




<p><a name="50208w02.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Allowing free trade in agricultural products would eliminate the costs to consumers of higher food prices generated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Our latest provisional estimate is for 2003 and this shows a cost to UK consumers in the range &#163;4.50 to &#163;5, per family of four, per week.

<p>
<a name="50208w02.html_para2">
Free trade in agricultural products would benefit the UK economy through a more efficient allocation of domestic resources. We have not made our own estimate of the magnitude of the effect; a number of such estimates have been published in academic journals. These estimated costs vary, according to the baseline and methodology used. A recent estimate (along with a review of previous studies) is contained in Philippidis, G., and Hubbard, L.J., (2001), &#039;The economic cost of the CAP revisited&#039;, &quot;Agricultural Economics&quot;, 25, 375&#150;385. This puts the economic cost of the CAP at around 0.2 per cent. of GDP for the EU and 0.5 per cent. for the UK. It should be noted that this estimate predates recent reforms, which will reduce the estimated economic costs of the CAP.

<p><a name="50208w08.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Government are committed to the development of extended schools to provide a range of enrichment activities and to support the Childcare Strategy. The Department for Education and Skills&#039; &quot;Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot; sets out the Government&#039;s expectation for all primary and secondary schools to offer a core set of extended services over time. The core offer for primary schools encompasses a wide range of study support and enrichment activities, parenting support, including family learning and swift referral to a wider range of specialised support services for pupils. Some schools will work with children&#039;s centres and other providers to make provision available for younger children. The Government&#039;s 10-Year Childcare Strategy sets out the expectation that by 2010 all parents with children aged 5&#150;11 will be offered the guarantee of affordable school based child care between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, all year round. By 2008, half of all parents of primary aged children will be able to access the child care offer. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para0">
The core offer for secondary schools includes study support and enrichment activities, widespread community use of school&#039;s facilities, family learning activities, swift and easy referral from every school to a wider range of specialised support services for pupils and a child care guarantee, or &#039;youth offer&#039; available between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools sites will be open year round and beyond the school day offering a range of interesting activities for young people. All schools will be doing so by 2010. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1384W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders. We will also be testing out demand for a formal child care guarantee that is 8 am to 6 pm particularly for children aged 11&#150;12.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para1">
Schools will need to adopt new and innovative approaches to recruiting and deploying staff to ensure there is a staffing structure appropriate to the extended services they wish to deliver. Schools should look at the expertise both within the school and locally to determine who can best deliver each aspect of extended services. This will include working effectively with other services and with the voluntary, private and community sectors. In some cases school staff, such as support staff and teaching assistants, will already have the relevant skills and experience and may want to help deliver some of the services such as child care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para2">
The Government will be producing a strategy for the children&#039;s workforce shortly, following up the vision in &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot;. This will include national and local action to ensure we can attract and retain the right people at all levels in this workforce, including those in extended schools. It will include simpler and more rewarding career pathways, alongside better workforce planning locally and more focused use of investment that is already being made to improve the knowledge and qualifications of people in different roles. We will also promote greater focus on good leadership, management and supervision. Remuneration levels will remain, for most of these workers, a matter between them and their employer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para3">
The Department have already committed around &#163;50 million over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05 for the development of extended schools, with the money targeting areas serving disadvantaged communities. Just under &#163;44 million of that &#163;50 million was paid via the Standards Fund (including &#163;2.8 million made available by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit and &#163;1.8 million from the Home Office) and &#163;6.8 million was paid through the Sure Start General Grant. In addition to this &#163;14 million from the Young People&#039;s Fund element of the Big Lottery Fund has been made available to 78 local authorities over three years from 2004&#150;05 to support the development of extended schools across their areas. In the financial year 2005&#150;06 my Department will make available just over &#163;107 million to support the development of extended services in both primary and secondary schools in all local authorities. In later years we will provide further sums including funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para4">
Funding to support the delivery of extended services, including the school age child care offer can be used flexibly by local authorities for both capital and revenue purposes to help overcome barriers that they may face in developing extended services. This can include minor capital works such as refurbishment of reception or play areas, and revenue funding, for example, to support a senior management post that might work across a cluster of schools to develop extended services. The funding is aimed at kick- starting the delivery of extended services but over time, these services should become self&#151;sustaining within existing funding strands or through charging. Schools can charge for some services such as community use of the schools premises 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1385W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and child care. In the case of school based child care, parents, who are eligible, can claim part of the cost through the child care element of the working tax credit. Some services such as study support and other curriculum-related enrichment services will be developed by schools making best use of their existing baselines. Other services such as health and social care should be supported by budgets that support those services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para5">
My Department is supporting local authorities to work with schools, local child care providers and local partners in delivering the extended schools programme in logistical ways too. In 2002, the DfES published extended schools guidance that provides information and advice on a range of legal, financial and practical issues. The Extended Schools Prospectus, trailed in the Prime Minister&#039;s speech to the Daycare Trust on 11 November, will set out the vision for extended schools to schools, local authorities and stakeholders in health, social care and the private and voluntary sectors. It will include a core document that will be supported by a number of on-line know how leaflets that draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services. These will include case studies, &#039;how to&#039; advice, &#039;hints and tips&#039; as well as emerging evidence of the impact on child outcomes. The prospectus and know how pack will be made available on the web, so that new issues can be addressed as they emerge. The prospectus will be launched shortly. The website www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools also features a number of case study examples of schools delivering extended services that schools and other interested parties might use to draw upon key lessons. The DfES has also appointed ContinYou to run The Extended Schools Support Service (TESSS) to support and advise schools and LEAs developing an extended schools approach, and which includes advice on developing links with the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para6">
My Department is very committed to research on extended services and child care in schools. We have in progress an evaluation looking at the impacts of full service extended schools on children, their families and communities; a nationally representative survey of schools to measure the prevalence and characteristics of extended services and child care; and an evaluation of an Extended Schools Childcare pilot. Initial findings from these projects will be published by the Department in summer 2005, autumn 2005 and spring 2006 respectively.

If they change their mind about the course they want to do, whether they will be charged higher variable fees will depend on whether the subject matter of the course to which they wish to change is largely the same as the course for which they originally applied.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assistance the UK will provide to the South East Asia region in establishing a tsunami early warning system.  [213280]</p>




<p><a name="50208w10.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 There is strong political will, both within the Indian Ocean region and internationally, to establish a tsunami Early Warning System in the Indian Ocean. This will involve countries in South East Asia and around the Indian Ocean working together to produce a workable and well co-ordinated system, building on those components already in place. The immediate need is for the countries in the region to determine the nature and organisation of the system they want.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para1">
A recent meeting organised by the Thai Government in Phuket reached a strong consensus on some important features of an early warning system for the region. It should: be designed and owned by countries in the region; build on mechanisms that already exist; and warn against multiple hazards, such as tropical storms and storm surges as well as tsunamis. It was also agreed that the UN should co-ordinate the development of the system and that investment should focus, not just on highly technical solutions, but on educating, and communicating any warning to, coastal communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para2">
The UK stands ready, if needed, to provide support to an early warning system once countries of the region have made progress on the design of a system. However, if there are other donors willing to provide all the finance needed&#151;as looks likely&#151;the UK is also willing to step aside and focus its resources on other equally important but less well funded measures to reduce the impact of disasters. Chief among these is the need to help developing countries of the region build on and enhance their own capacity to manage and reduce their risk to disasters.

<p><a name="50208w10.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Farmers have been badly affected by the tsunami and DFID is committed to rebuilding their livelihoods. Of the &#163;75 million allocation for emergency relief and first stage recovery, about 20 per cent. has been earmarked for immediate support to rebuilding farming and fishing communities&#039; livelihoods through relevant UN agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGO&#039;s). I am conscious of the need to build on local capacity through encouraging targeted regeneration of local agricultural systems. I recognise the need to reach as many affected people from the region as possible and to enable them to return to productive work.

<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para3">
In Indonesia, we shall provide funds through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to co-ordinate a broad-based livelihood recovery programme in rural areas of Aceh.

<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para4">
International NGO&#039;s are, on the whole, well funded, but we add support where there are clear needs. In southern India and Sri Lanka, for instance, we have recently approved five projects that will provide immediate support to affected communities totalling approximately &#163;1.8 million. These projects include livelihood recovery activities and focus on the needs of fishing communities, farmers, agricultural workers and other livelihood groups. One of these projects includes land reclamation and desalination activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para5">
As for our contribution to long-term recovery, we intend to respond to needs assessed by competent agencies and to fund requests by affected countries, in partnership with other donors, the UN and the International banks, namely the World Bank and Asian Development bank.

<p><a name="50208w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 It is important that countries have detailed action plans to address AIDS. DFID country offices make bilateral spending decisions based on countries&#039; articulated priorities as identified through national strategies and detailed action plans which include support to orphans and vulnerable children. These plans are being developed at national level (often with UNICEF support), to create a supportive environment for children&#039;s access to health and education, community services and basic needs.

<a name="50208w11.html_para3">
In responding to these action plans, DFID strongly supports the &quot;Three Ones&quot; approach: one strategic framework, one AIDS authority and one monitoring system. Thus DFID&#039;s own country assistance plans (CAPS) are designed to support the implementation of the &quot;Three Ones&quot;. All CAPS will reflect and report AIDS initiatives, indicating where more needs to be done. DFID will monitor all CAPS with reports going to the Management Board.

 The sustainable and integrated management of land and water resources is critical to combating increasing water shortages. The UK agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg the target for all countries to develop Integrated Water Resources Management and Water Efficiency plans by 2005, with support to be provided for developing countries.

DFID provides significant support to the Global Water Partnership (GWP), which is an umbrella organisation that supports development of national water resource management plans in key partner countries. GWP is also the key organisation coordinating policy and monitoring progress at the international level. A recent survey carried out by GWP has suggested that around 40 per cent. of countries have yet to make progress on developing Integrated Water Resources Management plans and only 20 per cent. of countries are likely to meet the 2005 target.

 An offender under current probation supervision is allocated an offender manager who is responsible for assessing the risk of harm posed by that individual.

Similarly with accommodation, local authorities are required to ensure that advice and information is made available about an individual&#039;s right to apply for housing, and to provide assistance where necessary. The probation service has a role in signposting offenders to local authority advice services, and can refer those who need additional housing support to local services run under the Supporting People Programme.

In addition, the National Policing Plan published in November 2004 explicitly highlighted the need for GOs, police and CDRPs to collaborate closely in agreeing measures to achieve PSA 1. The National Policing Plan 2005&#150;08 is available on the police reform website at www.policereform.gov.uk.

As key members of CDRPs it is for police authorities to ensure that police performance requirements and CDRP targets are directed at achieving reductions in crime and improvements in performance. Chris Fox, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, recently sent a letter to chief constables clarifying the links between the Police Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF) and the requirement for CDRPs to set challenging targets. Many CDRPs across the country have now agreed targets with their GO with which all CDRP members&#151;including the police&#151;are satisfied.

 As part of the Government&#039;s police reform programme, there are several programmes available to officers at the rank of inspector and above which enhance policing and leadership skills. These programmes promote ongoing development and present an integrated approach to police training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w20.html_para6">
The Core Leadership Development Programme (CLDP) is available to officers up to and including the rank of inspector. The emphasis of the programme is on personal and professional development of both leadership and management. The goal is to improve individual performance and ability to effectively deliver an improved service, both internally and within the community.

<p>
<a name="50208w20.html_para7">
The Senior Leadership Development Programme (SLDP) is aimed at commanders and their teams, for all types of command and management units&#151; operational or support. The programme provides further leadership development for police officers with independent command and management responsibilities, including those aspiring to join the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and looking to go to PNAC (the Police National Assessment Centre).

 The Code of Practice (Code B) for searches of premises by police officers and the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or premises, issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), deals with police powers to search premises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w20.html_para12">
Code B requires that police officers should consider if the necessary objectives of entry and search of premises can be met by less intrusive means. Officers should exercise their powers courteously and with respect for persons and property; and only use reasonable force when this is considered necessary and proportionate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w20.html_para13">
Code B recognises that on some occasions it may be necessary to enter premises at an unsociable hour where it is considered that access at any other time might frustrate the purpose of the search. Premises may be searched only to the extent necessary to achieve the object of the search, having regard to the size and nature of whatever is sought.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w20.html_para14">
The officer conducting the search under Code B is required, unless it is impracticable to do so, provide the occupier with a copy of a notice in a standard format. This notice, amongst other things, should summarising the authority under which the search is being made, details of compensation procedures, explain the rights of the occupier and the rights of the owner of any property seized.

 The rationale for a purchaser provider split is contained in Lord Carter&#039;s review of correctional services.

 Local probation areas have always liaised with local communities in order to identify work which can usefully be undertaken by offenders.

With the introduction of the new community order and the unpaid work requirement throughout the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the probation service is moving towards a much more structured approach to eliciting the views of local communities. In the course of February 2005, as part of a nationally co-ordinated &quot;Clean-Up&quot; campaign, residents in ten probation areas will be asked to vote on a number of possible projects to be undertaken in their locality. The work will then be undertaken in the order of priority identified by residents.

This desire to take greater account of the views of local people is reflected in the civil renewal strategy currently being developed by the National Offender Management Service.

It is crucial that offenders make a visible contribution that can be identified by those in the community who benefit from it.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on local authorities&#039; obligations to <i>(a)</i> assess the requirement for and <i>(b)</i> provide adequate local parking facilities for residents.  [214032]</p>




<p><a name="50208w24.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: &quot;Housing (PPG3)&quot; explains that local authorities requirements for car parking, especially off-street car parking, are a significant determinant of the amount of land needed for new housing. In the 1990s, car parking 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1442W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
standards for housing became increasingly demanding and were applied too rigidly, often as minimum standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para4">
With this in mind, PPG3 says that local authorities should have parking standards which allow for significantly lower levels of car parking provision where appropriate. For example, this could apply to developments:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">in locations like town centres where services are accessible by walking, cycling or public transport;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">which provide housing for older people, students and single people, all of whom are likely to have less demand for car parking than families; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">involving the conversion of housing or non-residential buildings where off-street parking is less likely to be successfully designed into the scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para5">
PPG3 advises that parking policies should be framed with good design in mind while recognising that car ownership varies with income, age, household type and location. The Planning for Housing statement of 17 July 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 53WS, explained that car parking standards should result in an average of 1.5 off-street car parking spaces per dwelling over an authority&#039;s area. As this is an average, this does not mean that the Government expects all dwellings in new developments to have 1.5 car parking spaces. Policies which would result in higher levels of off-street parking, especially in urban areas, should not be adopted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para6">
To help the development of appropriate standards, the Government are carrying out research to consider how varying levels of car parking can be achieved in ways consistent with their policies on sustainable residential environments. We aim to publish this research in summer 2005.

 The Stroud local plan sets out detailed planning policies and proposals for Stroud district for the period to 2011 and is being prepared in accordance with the adopted Gloucestershire structure plan second review which sets out broad, strategic planning policies for the county. That structure plan has been the subject of review and the structure plan third alteration, covering the period 1996&#150;2016, has reached an advanced stage. Regional planning guidance for the south-west (RPG10) was approved in 2001 and became the regional spatial strategy on commencement of the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. RPG10 covers the period 1996&#150;2016 and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a new regional spatial strategy (RSS) for the south west. The draft RSS will be submitted to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in December 2005, following which there will be extensive public consultation and an examination in public before an independent panel. We currently estimate that the RSS will be approved in mid 2007.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1445W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
published in our Departmental Annual Report. The Sustainable Communities Plan is a long-term programme of action, but progress to date has been excellent. Since 2002, the Government have increased house building by 10 per cent. delivered 43,589 affordable homes to rent and assisted over 11,000 key workers into home ownership. We have cut rough sleeping by 70 per cent. since 1998. Since 1997 we have made around 1 million social homes decent and increased grant to local authorities by 30 per cent. in real terms. We will build on this success through the measures outlined to the House by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 24 January.

 Coventry city council and Centro receive funding for transport schemes through the joint West Midlands Local Transport Plan (LTP). The most up to date information we have is taken from the LTP Annual Progress Report for 2003&#150;04. Excluding maintenance, the allocation to the West Midlands LTP for that year was &#163;51 million of which Coventry&#039;s share was &#163;5.251 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w26.html_para0">
The Annual Progress Report does not specify spending in particular areas but it shows that &#163;70,000 was spent specifically on miscellaneous facilities for the disabled across the city. Most of this would have involved the provision of facilities such as dropped kerbing. However, many other highway improvement and bus corridor schemes would routinely include provision for the disabled. For instance improvements to traffic signals, where these include works to pedestrian facilities, would also involve measures such as tactile paving and audible warnings.
</p>


<p>

Last year we gave approval to a &#163;28.8 million funding contribution to the Coventry Primelines major scheme, which aims to improve bus services throughout the city.

 Noise is continually monitored by BAA at 12 sites around the airport, including Dorney, to the south east of Maidenhead. Annual noise contours at Heathrow, which provide noise maps for a 16 hour day time period, are calibrated from mobile noise monitors and produced by the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s Environmental Research Consultancy Department on behalf of the Department. These are published annually on the Department&#039;s website. They show that Maidenhead lies beyond the 57dBA contour area normally considered to represent the onset of significant community annoyance.

<a name="50208w26.html_para4">
The Department and its predecessors have commissioned a range of studies over the years about the effects of noise on annoyance and sleep disturbance at various times of day and night. These include the large-scale &quot;Aircraft Noise Index Study&quot; (CAA DR Report 8402) in the early 1980s, which included fieldwork at Slough.

High Representative Solana welcomed the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), and the improving EU relationship with the African Union (AU). However, the Council expressed concern over the recent bombardment of several villages in Darfur by the Sudanese Air Force. The Council condemned these attacks. The Council reiterated its call to respect the ceasefire of N&#039;Djamena and the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. The Government welcome the signature of CPA. It is vital that the international community now supports the parties in implementing the terms of the agreement. The international community also needs to remain focused on Darfur, where both sides continue to violate the ceasefire. The Government believe that the EU should start actively to consider a range of possible targeted sanctions, which are balanced and effective.

The UK has been providing a wide ranging and integrated package of assistance to Nepal, partly through the Department for International Development programme and using funds from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). This assistance has ranged from development assistance aimed at tackling the underlying causes of poverty, social injustice and conflict in the country to the provision of non-lethal military assistance to the Royal Nepalese Army (UNA). The military assistance was particularly aimed at boosting the RNA&#039;s intelligence gathering capability and selective training, including on human rights. Money from the GCPP has also been used to fund the Peace Secretariat, a body of civil servants connected to the Prime Minister&#039;s Office and tasked with identifying political solutions to the conflict.

The Turkish Government passed a new Municipalities Law in December 2004 requiring municipalities to open shelters for women in communities of more than 50,000 people, and a package of constitutional amendments was passed in May 2004 that confirms equality between men and women.

The Turkish Government&#039;s commitment to address honour crimes and ensure the full protection of women&#039;s rights was demonstrated by their decision to co-table with the UK a successful resolution in the UN General Assembly on &#039;honour crimes&#039;.

According to Ka-Mer (Turkey&#039;s largest women&#039;s NGO) at least 200 females are murdered by their families in Turkey each year. Accurate official statistics do not exist, as police records do not show whether &#039;honour&#039; was a contributing factor in a murder.

 Together with the Food Standards Agency (FSA), I have been leading discussions with industry to identify and implement a range of proposals to increase opportunities for people to make healthy choices in what they eat. As outlined in the recent White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, these are aimed at increasing the availability of healthier food including reducing the levels of salt, added sugars and saturated fat in prepared and processed food and drink.

At a stakeholder event on salt in November 2003, I called for industry to submit plans to reduce salt in processed food. To date discussions have been held with, and commitments received to reduce salt from over 60 organisations.

<p>
<a name="50208w32.html_para4">
The FSA launched a high profile public health campaign in September 2004 to raise awareness of health issues surrounding high salt intakes. Initial evaluation of the campaign shows it has had a very positive impact; and research has shown an increase in consumers who are making an effort to cut how much salt they eat and change their shopping behaviour. The next stage of the campaign is currently being considered. The FSA also publishes regular surveys of the salt content of processed foods, which have included soup, pizza, sausages, and baked beans and pasta in tomato sauce.

 Recent research has been carried out by the European Food Safety Authority on the presence, consumption and the health effects of trans-unsaturated fatty acids (TFAs) in foods. It concluded that, given current dietary intake of TFAs in many countries including the United Kingdom, their potential to significantly increase heart disease risk is much lower than that of saturated fats.

From 2005, there will be a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancer patients, including brain cancer, which will ensure that those patients who were non-urgently referred but subsequently diagnosed with cancer receive prompt treatment. Progress towards this target is being achieved through increased investment, additional staffing levels, installing new and replacement radiotherapy and diagnostic facilities and streamlining care processes through the Cancer Services Collaborative&#151;Improvement Partnership.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will issue regional guidance on the structure and content of trust family and child care social work file records.  [214824]</p>




<p><a name="50208w37.html_spnew8"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Department has no plans to issue regional guidance on the structure and content of Trusts&#039; family and child care social work records. The Department provides, through the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and its associated regulations and guidance, a comprehensive framework for case recording purposes. In addition, a range of Standards developed by the Social Services Inspectorate also addresses case recording to ensure that well-structured case files and good recording practices are promoted.

It is important that social workers&#039; professional practice ensures that they record their involvement with children, their parents/carers and the multi-disciplinary team with which they work.

 The first thematic inspection by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate Northern Ireland (CJINI) is a review of the multi-agency procedures for the risk assessment and management of sex offenders in Northern Ireland. Included in the terms of reference for the inspection is an assessment of the potential implications of legislating to place the procedures on a statutory footing and extending them to include violent offenders. I will consider the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman in light of the findings in the Chief Inspector&#039;s report, which I understand will shortly to be submitted to the Secretary of State.
