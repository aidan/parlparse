To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place requiring farmers and growers spraying crops to inform the public about the type of chemicals being used.  [123002]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Statutory Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Pesticides on Farms and Holdings provides advice for farmers on best practice, including notifying the public of impending spray operations. There is also a legal obligation to notify others in the case of aerial spraying of pesticides and for the use of sulphuric acid as a pesticide. In addition to these safeguards Ministers are considering if further measures could be taken to make more information available to the public on pesticide spray operations.

<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government do not hold records on the numbers of greyhounds that retire each year from racing.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para0">Each racing greyhound is the property of an individual owner and so it is not possible to record what happens to the dogs once they retire.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para1">The racing industry and welfare organisations estimate that some 9,000 racing greyhounds retire each year. The Retired Greyhound Trust claims to re-home 1,400 per year. An undisclosed number will remain with their owners as pets.

<a name="30707w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Sharks</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_wqn4"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of shark <i>(a)</i> fishing and <i>(b)</i> finning on the world's population of sharks.  [122658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Current scientific knowledge indicates that many of the world's populations of sharks are under threat from fishing activities. The targeting of sharks for their fins alone adds to this threat. In view of concern over this threat to shark populations, this Department has been working to protect sharks at a national and international level. In addition to putting in place measures to protect the basking shark under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, we have secured strengthened protection for this species at an international level under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) produced in 1999 an International Plan of Action for the conservation and management of sharks, to which the European Commission signed up on behalf of the European Union. We have been pressing the Commission for action to follow this up and are pleased that work will begin shortly on the development and implementation of a Community Plan of Action.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para3">Discussions on a Commission regulation to restrict the practice of shark finning have recently concluded. While it was not possible to achieve the complete ban on this practice that we would have preferred, we were able to secure some important concessions, including additional control clauses and a commitment to a complete review of the regulation in the light of the development of the Community Plan of Action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to make available additional funding to the Environment Agency for the regulation of on-farm drum incinerators when the Agricultural Waste Regulations are introduced.  [122754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A draft of the Agricultural Waste Regulations will be issued for public consultation in the autumn with a view to their coming into force in early 2004. The main purpose of the Regulations is to apply the requirements of the Waste Framework Directive to agricultural waste. Incineration is subject to control under the Directive as a waste disposal operation. Provision has been made within the Corporate Planning 



<P>
<P><I>7 Jul 2003 : Column 561W</I><P>
process to meet the Environment Agency's costs, through charges and Grant-in-Aid, as a "competent authority" for the control of agricultural waste under the Directive. My Department has received no specific request from the Agency for funding for the regulation of on-farm drum incinerators.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to change the measurement criteria for aircraft noise in the UK to correspond to those of the World Health Organisation.  [123437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 WHO noise guideline figures are given in terms of equivalent continuous sound level (dBA Leq) and of the sound event peak (dBA Lmax). Leq is already the established metric for averaging aircraft noise, as recommended in the planning guidance note PPG 24. Lmax and SEL (which takes account of event duration as well as peak level) are also extensively used in describing individual noise events.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para4">In due course, noise contours will also be produced for aircraft noise and for other sources in accordance with the metrics, again based on Leq, prescribed by EU Directive 2002/49/EC.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> published in the last two years on the impact of different aircraft noise levels on those affected.  [123438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department for Transport commissioned a study into attitudes to noise from civil aircraft sources in England in November 2001; it is expected to report towards the end of next year.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para5">This major study was commissioned following three earlier, smaller-scale studies commissioned by DETR into the effects of noise specifically at night: "Adverse Effects of Night-Time Aircraft Noise" (CAA R&D 9964); "Aircraft noise and sleep&#151;1999 UK Trial Methodology Study" (Flindell <i>et al.</i>) and "Perceptions of Aircraft Noise, Sleep and Health" (Diamond <i>et al.</i>) all published during 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 10 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 736&#150;37W, on disabled parking permits, when he will take forward the recommendations received on the Blue Badge Scheme; and what enforcement measures he proposes to take.  [123818]




<P>
<P><I>7 Jul 2003 : Column 562W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We are committed to introducing a specific power for the police, traffic wardens and local authority parking enforcement officers to inspect badges. We are also looking at the feasibility of establishing a national database of badge holders; the introduction of smartcard technology; increasing penalties for abuse and misuse of the Scheme.
<P>

<a name="30707w01.html_para6">The power to inspect, and a number of other measures, will need to be introduced through primary legislation and we are looking for a suitable legislative opportunity to do so. Meanwhile, we are already working on the changes that require secondary legislation, taking forward a number of research projects and drafting new guidance for local authorities to accompany the changes. We aim to implement the changes at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 As there has been no changes to the PPP contract terms, which may alter the allocation of risk, there have been no changes in the risk profile.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for Network Rail. However, as my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State stated in responding to the adjournment debate of 3 June 2003 called by my hon. Friend, Network Rail's first priority is to operate a safe, reliable railway. Tree clearance plays an important part in achieving that objective and in addressing the significant impact upon train performance arising from leaf fall in the autumn. Network Rail must strike a balance between providing a safe, efficient, reliable and affordable rail network and meeting environmental and community concerns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are 164 coastal local authorities in the UK. Of these, only one does not have an oil spill contingency plan as yet. Of the 53 coastal local authorities who published contingency plans prior to the National Contingency Plan, all but one has either rewritten, or begun the process of reviewing/rewriting their plans.

<a name="30707w03.html_para13">3. An initiative to monitor both progress on achieving rigorous and transparent processes for NED appointments and progress on building more diverse boardrooms. I agree that it would be useful to monitor progress and disseminate best practice and we will be considering how best this should be done. But it is clear this is not the end of the story. We must see real results in broadening the talent pool of directors appointed to our boardrooms and we are also looking at what further work the government can do to help business achieve this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 In its first term (1997&#150;2001), the Government introduced a foundation of minimum standards in the workplace. Every employee now has, for example, the right to a minimum wage, paid holidays, rest breaks, time off for family emergencies, and a cap on the working week. Trade unions have the right to recognition by the employer where a majority of the workforce want it. Part-time workers have the same rights as their full-time colleagues.
<P>

<a name="30707w03.html_para14">In its second term, the Government are building on all these measures in their drive to raise productivity, including a range of changes to support families and to make work pay. The Government have improved existing maternity rights and introduced paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time. For example, the payment period of Statutory Maternity Pay and Maternity Allowance has been extended to 26 weeks. They have also introduced a right for working parents with children under six, or disabled children under 18, to request flexible working. This new right builds on existing best practice and further enforces our aim to promote greater dialogue in the workplace to find flexible solutions which suit both employers and employees.
<P>

<a name="30707w03.html_para15">Recently both Houses have passed regulations to tackle discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion or belief, which will take effect in December 2003.

<P>

<a name="30707w04.html_para6">In that report, the Commission recommended that they should be asked to consider the possible introduction of a minimum wage rate for 16 to 17-year-olds. The Government accepted this recommendation and has invited the Commission to look at this issue in parallel with a wider government review looking at education and training policy and the system of financial support for young people. The cost to employers will be one factor the Commission will wish to consider. The Commission have been asked to report by the end of February 2004 and we will of course consider their report very carefully.

<a name="30707w05.html_spnew0"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 We believe that the most effective way to discourage firms from moving abroad is to create the best environment for business success in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30707w05.html_para0">We assist firms in a variety of ways.
<P>

<a name="30707w05.html_para1">We provide practical advice and support to enable every company to be the best it can be. For example the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS), launched last year, provides expert advice and consultancy to help companies drive up their value added.

<P>

<a name="30707w05.html_para2">We support firms in the research and development activities that will keep them ahead of the competition. For example, an R&D tax credit for large and middle-sized companies was introduced this year to complement the tax credit for small and medium-sized companies introduced in budget 2000. In 2001&#150;02, the first year for which figures are available, somewhere in the region of 3,000 small and medium-sized companies made claims under the tax credit scheme.
<P>

<a name="30707w05.html_para3">Each year we invest around &#163;1 billion in support for the businesses that create Britain's wealth. We support the investment work of the regional development agencies for example through regional selective assistance through which we offer selective grants to firms investing in the assisted areas and creating or safeguarding jobs. In England in 2002&#150;03, &#163;934 million of business investment was secured as a result of 192 RSA grants totalling &#163;108 million. This is expected to create over 10,000 new jobs and safeguard a further 9,000. Financial assistance to companies in Wales is a devolved matter for the National Assembly for Wales. Data on financial assistance given under the Industrial Development Act 1982, including regional selective assistance, is contained in the Annual Report to Parliament for 2002&#150;03 which was laid on 26 June.

<P>

<a name="30707w05.html_para5">Ofgem have asked the Government to bring forward the legislation necessary to bring in BETTA because the new arrangements are in line with Ofgem's duties to protect the interests of customers by promoting competition where possible.

Our contacts with the DPRK government in the period leading up to these decisions convinced us that it made sense to encourage the DPRK's integration into the international community, rather than see it remain isolated. Our diplomatic relationship has allowed us to keep open channels of communication which enable us to address the DPRK authorities frequently and directly on issues of international concern, pre-eminently non-proliferation and human rights. But we have told North Korea that there can be no normal relationship until the nuclear issue has been resolved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his answer of 25 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 815W, on Zimbabwe, if the British Government will assume responsibility for paying the pensions while the situation exists; what help is available to those pensioners in the UK who are not in receipt of their pensions; and if he will make a statement.

 Responsibility for the payment of Zimbabwe Government pensions rests firmly with the Government of Zimbabwe. That has always been the case. We will continue to remind the Zimbabwe Government of its obligations to make these pension payments in full and on time. Zimbabwe pensioners in the UK whose incomes have fallen below a certain level and have few savings may qualify for income related entitlements, such as the minimum income guarantee. They should contact the minimum income guarantee scheme hotline on 0800 028 1111.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The majority of personnel deployed on Operation Telic benefited from the Operational Welfare Package (OWP), as opposed to LOA, and were also paid either the Longer Service Separated Allowance (LSSA) or in the case of Royal Navy personnel the Longer Service at Sea Bonus (LSSB). The current tiered rates of LSSA are Basic rate &#163;5.39, Middle rate &#163;8.43 and Higher rate &#163;11.49 per qualified person per day, taxable. The current tiered rates of LSSB are &#163;4.05, &#163;7.74 and &#163;10.32 per qualified person per day, taxable. LSSB has different qualifying criteria and hence the different tiered rates.
<P>

<a name="30707w08.html_para2">Full rates of LOA are not paid when personnel are in receipt of the OWP. However, those individuals deployed from permanent overseas bases which attract LOA (such as Germany) retained residual rates of LOA for their permanent duty station throughout the operational deployment.

 There have been no cases of cholera among United Kingdom personnel in Iraq. Diarrhoeal diseases have occurred at a level commensurate with a large-scale deployment to a country such as Iraq.

 Attitudinal research carried out by the Northern Ireland Office Statistics and Research Branch is routinely published in report or bulletin format. Publication is via the Northern Ireland Office Information Service and reports are also made available on the Northern Ireland Office and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency websites. This includes all research carried out by the Northern Ireland Office Statistics and Research Branch on behalf of the Criminal Justice Review. This approach is in keeping with National Statistics guidelines.

 Attitudinal research carried out by the Northern Ireland Office Statistics and Research Branch is routinely published via the Northern Ireland Office Information Service and is also made available on the Northern Ireland Office and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency websites. Access is therefore not restricted in any way. Pre-publication access is granted only for internal briefing purposes and in accordance with strict National Statistics guidelines. These guidelines promote equality of access but recognise the policy of having some privileged early access to support good Government and management. The Northern Ireland Office Statistics and Research Branch also widely disseminates hard copies of its research and statistical findings to groups and individuals with policy and professional interests. Each report is publicised as widely as possible through the media and routinely circulated to political parties, academics and libraries, including the Northern Ireland Assembly and House of Common Libraries. Free copies are available on request.

 Almost 1.4 million have been sold in their first two years on the market.

<a name="30707w13.html_para0">Stakeholder pensions impact on pension provision goes wider than its take-up. Charges on personal pensions have fallen by around a quarter since 1999 to around stakeholder pensions' 1 per cent. a year level. In addition, as an alternative to offering their staff access to a stakeholder pension scheme, some employers have widened access to their occupational pension schemes and others have set up group personal pension plans with an employer contribution. We recognise that more needs to be done to improve take-up of private pensions in general, including stakeholder pensions.
<P>

<a name="30707w13.html_para1">That is why we have set up an employer task force to develop and promote the employers' role in pension provision; established an independent pensions commission to report regularly to the Secretary of State on how the current voluntary approach to private pension provision is working; are developing an information pack for employers to make it clearer and easier for them to promote the benefits of their pension schemes; are framing initiatives to test the provision of advice and information at the workplace on saving for retirement; and have provided that members of money-purchase pension schemes receive annual illustrations, in today's prices, of what pension they might receive when they retire.

<P>

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. The estimates are for Great Britain only and are in cash terms rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<P>

2. The maximum rate payable of the basic State Pension is assumed to increase to 20 per cent. and 25 per cent., of average earnings, this corresponds to &#163;84.55 per week and &#163;105.70 per week in 2004&#150;05. All other payments are assumed to increase proportionately.<P>

3. Estimates of the value of the basic State Pension are based on the April 2002 New Earnings Survey projected forward to April 2004.<P>

4. The estimates of the gross cost are based on September 2002 State Pension administrative data, projected forward to 2004&#150;05.<P>

5. Estimates of savings in income-related benefits are based on the DWP Policy Simulation model for 2004&#150;05. The calculations assume that the start of the Savings Credit is increased in line with the new value of the basic State Pension.<P>

6. Estimates of tax yield are provided by the Inland Revenue and are based upon the Survey of Personal Incomes 2000&#150;01 projected forward to 2004&#150;05.<P>

7. To estimate the net cost, it is assumed that additional tax yield and savings in income related benefits and are channelled back into the basic State Pension.<P>

The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for evaluating the England Objective 3 and Great Britain Equal programmes.

<a name="30707w13.html_para6">The evaluation of England Objective 3 will include the issues of employment, skill development, the employment of women and information and communications technologies (ICT). It will be informed by monitoring data, surveys of former participants and companies, and specially commissioned research projects. The latter will include, for example, research into the programme's effectiveness in promoting equal opportunities and ICT training. The evaluation will not examine the benefits of ESF in terms of GDP. While there have been positive results, it is unlikely that the programme is large enough to have a measurable effect on GDP. The evaluation will, however, examine how the programme adds value to domestic programmes, for example, by looking at how it interacts with the New Deal. There is a separate evaluation of Equal, which is testing new ways of combating discrimination and inequality in the labour market.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. The PSR is not designed or intended to provide a comprehensive or continuous statistical record of the status of schemes. The PSR registers schemes for tracing purposes and collects the levy from pension schemes, including those in the process of winding up. New scheme data is being reported to the PSR on a continuous basis. Therefore, the figures are subject to continuous revision. Schemes have up to 12 months to notify of any change.<P>

2. A wound up scheme is one which has notified OPRA that it has completed winding up procedures.<P>

3. The data in the table relate to defined benefit and defined contribution private sector occupational pension schemes. In addition to data on occupational schemes, the Registry also collects data on personal pension and public sector schemes. These schemes, however, are not included in the table.<P>

4. The reason the figures for 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998 are so much larger than for other years is that from 1997, the rules governing which schemes had a levy liability were changed&#151;all schemes with two or more members became liable whereas previously, only schemes with two or more active members were liable. So, in 1997, the Pension Schemes Registry issued levy requests to a large number of schemes, only to discover that a number of them had already wound up. All these schemes were recorded as having completed wind up in 1997&#150;98 even if, in fact, they had wound up earlier. Therefore, we know these figures are inflated, but not by how much. This is because the figures were not collected for the purpose of recording the numbers of scheme wind ups.<P>

 Around 87 per cent. of our customers already have access to an account suitable for Direct Payment and there is now a wide range of easy to operate bank and building society accounts available. The availability of these accounts at the Post Office, and the Post Office card account will mean that there should only be a small number of people for whom direct payment will not be suitable.

<a name="30707w15.html_para5">Since then we have continued to issue mailings to recipients of these benefits and begun to issue mailings to people in receipt of weekly paid child benefit and those in receipt of pensions and some Jobcentre Plus benefits.

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is completed for all DWP regulatory proposals that have more than a negligible impact on businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. These RIAs follow the guidance, "Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment" (revised January 2003), and include details of arrangements for monitoring and reviewing policy proposals and their impact.

<P>

<a name="30707w15.html_para11">From this year, the National Audit Office (NAO) has a new role in independently evaluating a selection of RIAs. The Better Regulation Task Force put forward in its annual report (published in February 2003), suggestions of RIAs for the NAO to review.

 The funding of schools is a shared responsibility of central and local Government. In 2003&#150;04, there have been a number of very significant pressures on LEA and school spending. Nationally, the additional resources provided for education more than match those pressures. However, changes to the distribution formula for Education Formula Spending, together with the ending of a substantial body of ring-fenced grants from my Department's Standards Fund,

have meant that different LEAs and schools have received a wide range of year-on-year increases in overall support for education.
<P>

<a name="30707w19.html_para0">The department has taken steps through an additional grant of &#163;28 million to ensure that all LEAs have at least a minimum increase of 3.2 per cent. per pupil, in addition to taking account of the effect of the Standards Fund and teachers' pension changes. We have also provided a special grant costing &#163;11 million to 18 London LEAs to help them fund this year's increases in London weighting. The allocations of these grants are shown in the following table. In addition, LEAs and schools will be given the additional flexibility to use their devolved formula capital funding from the Department to support revenue expenditure. The decision to use a school's capital funding in this way will need to be made jointly by the school and its LEA, and should only be taken in those circumstances where failure to do so would lead to excessive instability within that school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what criteria the Department employs in assessing parental contributions under the Aided Pupils Scheme for musically gifted pupils at specialist schools; and how housing costs are allowed for.  [123441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Aided Pupil Scheme, part of the Music and Dance Scheme, is an annually assessed means-tested scheme that required parents to make a contribution towards fees according to their means. Gross income from all sources is assessed so that all parents are placed on a similar footing wherever they live. The amount (if any) parents pay is on a sliding scale linked to total income and the scales are constructed so that the least well-off families benefit most. No deductions are made in respect of outgoings such as mortgage repayments, pension contributions and the normal day to day costs of living when assessing a family's total gross income. The method of income assessment ensures that a proper balance is struck between the amount parents can realistically be expected to contribute and the amount of taxpayers' money that is provided for the scheme.

<P>

<a name="30707w20.html_para0">If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.
<P>

<a name="30707w20.html_para1">To help schools manage fire safety, the Department published "Managing School Facilities Guide 6, Fire Safety", in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risks of both accidental and malicious fires occurring, and advises on how to identify hazards and carry out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.
<P>

<a name="30707w20.html_para2">In addition, officials from the Department sit on the Arson in Schools Working Group, a group of experts representing the insurance industry, the fire and police services, local authorities and Government Departments. The group exists to research and promote ways of reducing malicious fires in schools. One of its outputs has been the publication of the guide "How to Combat Arson in Schools", copies of which have been sent to all schools in the UK.

Friend of 17 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 134, clarification is required to the answer which sated that the standard tuition fee contribution for full-time home and EU students of &#163;1,125 is estimated to raise around &#163;887 million for English institutions and around &#163;60 million for Welsh institutions. The reply does not make clear that the sum of &#163;456 million, given as the public contribution to fees in England for 2003&#150;04, includes public funding of approximately &#163;40 million allocated to support postgraduate study through the Research Councils. Correspondingly, the sum of &#163;31 million given as the public contribution to fees in Wales for 2003&#150;04, includes public funding of approximately &#163;3 million allocated to support postgraduate study through the Research Councils.

Copies of the tables have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Mandate is a central computer based record of information for almost all civil servants in the Home civil service. For some Departments and agencies, summary figures are provided in a manual return, which may not always be fully consistent with Mandate information, for example, because of minor differences in timing. Breakdowns by age are purely figures reported to Mandate. Departments and agencies are responsible for their own grading structures, but these have been allocated to broad responsibility levels to give a common basis for tabulation.

<P>
<a name="30707w21.html_spnew5"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office regulates the use of protected animals in any experimental or other scientific procedure that may have the effect of causing that animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. The Home Office does not regulate the use of animals in experiments or procedures not covered by the 1986 Act.
<P>

<a name="30707w21.html_para8">The 1986 Act provides a strong regulatory framework and an effective means by which to balance the need to protect animals from unnecessary suffering with the legitimate requirements of the scientific community (and the public) for medical and other essential research and safety testing. The system set up under the 1986 Act has proved flexible and responsive to changing circumstances and requirements, and its enabling provisions allow changes to be made quickly and easily by administrative means, or using secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="30707w21.html_para9">The Animal Procedures Committee (APC) review of the operation of the Act, published in its Annual Report for 1997, concluded that the Act provides a good framework for a well-regulated and responsible use of animals in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom. A number of recommendations arising from the APC review to enhance the effectiveness of the Act have subsequently been implemented and further improvements are continually being sought. The APC has also recently provided advice on the cost benefit assessment conducted under by section 5(4) of the 1986 Act, which we will consider carefully. Section 24 of the 1986 Act is also currently being reviewed. Proposals are also awaited from the European Commission for the revision of Directive 86/609/EEC, which the 1986 Act transposes into United Kingdom law. These may result in the need for the 1986 Act to be amended in due course. However, we have no immediate plans for legislative change.

 The information requested is not available through our formal statistical channels.

Statistics for 2003 will be published in the autumn of 2004.

The sentences in these three cases were a conditional discharge, a community punishment order and a fine, and a conditional discharge and a fine.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w23.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what additional responsibilities have been placed on police inspectors and chief inspectors by <i>(a)</i> legislation and <i>(b)</i> changes in policing methods since 1994.  [121320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In recent years the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and other legislation has been amended so that the minimum rank for taking a number of important policing decisions has been reduced from superintendent to inspector. These include taking fingerprints, intimate and non-intimate samples without consent, authorising intimate searches and delaying a detained person's right to let someone know they have been arrested.
<P>

<a name="30707w23.html_para1">New legislation has also given additional responsibilities to inspectors. For example, they are able to authorise the searching or examination of a detained person to ascertain their identity and to deny independent custody visitors access to a detained person. In certain circumstances they can authorise surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) and approve searches for criminal cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).
<P>

<a name="30707w23.html_para2">The way in which those powers are exercised, and the precise responsibilities given to officers at different ranks, depend on local decisions taken by individual chief constables and other police commanders. However, there has certainly been a very positive trend towards devolving decision making and responsibility from force headquarters to local managers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the progress of the Public Safety Radio Communications Project; and what assessment he has made of the impact of the operation of the system on the health of <i>(a)</i> the general public and <i>(b)</i> those using the system.  [121942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Public Safety Radio Communications Project is now known as Airwave and is currently being rolled out to all police forces in England, Wales and Scotland. The Airwave service is currently available to 14 forces and completion of the rollout is expected by mid-2005.
<P>

<a name="30707w24.html_para0">We have taken independent expert advice on the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology used by Airwave. The experts concluded that the specific features of TETRA were unlikely to pose a risk to the health of either the public or those using the system.

<a name="30707w24.html_para1">We have set up an extensive programme of work monitored by independent scientists to address remaining areas of uncertainty. This has confirmed that all Airwave equipment conforms to international health and safety regulations. No adverse health effects have been found so far. Regular updates are available on our website (http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html).

<a name="30707w24.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Andrew Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 4 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 462W, to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley), on TETRA, what funds have been allocated to the national health monitoring study of Airwave police users; and when he expects the study to report.  [121852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 &#163;5 million has been allocated for the national health monitoring study of Airwave police users. This work includes two components: a long-term study to follow-up over 100,000 Airwave police users over 15 years, and a shorter-term detailed study of a small group of police officers. The detailed study will report after three years. The long-term study is statistical in nature and many years of data will be required to produce reliable results. An interim report will be available once five full years of data have been collected, some seven years from the start of the work. Regular updates on progress will be available on our website http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html.

<P>
<a name="30707w24.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many masts each of the police constabularies have in their area for use by the new TETRA system; how many new masts are required by each constabulary to ensure full service for the system; and what the anticipated date is by which each constabulary will have full coverage.  [122147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Airwave is the new TETRA radio system for police forces in England, Wales and Scotland. The network is the responsibility of Airwave 02, the Private Finance Initiative partner for Airwave. It is estimated that around 3,000 masts will be required to provide coverage for Airwave across the country. Final figures for the number of new masts in each constabulary will not be available until the end of the rollout, as adjustments will continue to be made across the system in order to optimise coverage. Airwave is currently available to 14 forces and the rollout is expected to be complete by mid-2005.

<a name="30707w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Data on the number of cases of serious injury involving victims of (i) robbery and (ii) burglary are not held centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to include a sunset clause in all new legislation unless a specific case can be made to exclude a sunset clause.  [120840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w24.html_spnew7"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 The subject matter of much Home Office legislation is such that a sunset clause would be inappropriate. For example, the criminal law, rules on citizenship and immigration, the regulation of the police and the prisons are all topics on which it is unrealistic to believe that the controls can simply be abandoned. A sunset clause would just necessitate further legislation. Such a clause is included, however, in exceptional cases (such as in respect of some of the powers in the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001).

 Liberating the Talents provides a new framework for nursing in primary care to support the delivery of the NHS Plan. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to determine how they wish to implement the recommendations locally. PCTs are being supported by the Department to take forward Liberating the Talents through a range of work programmes. Workshops have been held in 26 of the 28 strategic health authorities for 290 PCTs, core elements of the framework have been included in the new general medical services contract and a guide one stablishing nurses with special interests has been published. The NHS University is piloting a learning programme to support nurses to provide first contact care, a new model of nurse-led managed care for patients at risk is being piloted in ten PCTs and we have set upinitiatives to support recruitment and retention of nurses in primary care.

Since 2001, the Economic and Social Research Council has funded a &#163;45,000 research project on screening and interventions for inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity in school age children. These problems are associated with ADHD but are not by themselves definitive indicators of the disorder.<P>

<P>
<a name="30707w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Pain management is an important component of care. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report on pain services, published in April 2000, highlighted variations in access to pain services throughout the country. It made recommendations to national health service acute trusts and commissioners on how pain services should be delivered in order to reduce variations to access. It recommended that primary care trust commissioners should review local provision of pain services, looking particularly at the provision of more specialised treatments on a networked basis. In this review, account should be taken of the needs of both adults and children, and include patients with acute pain resulting from sudden illness or accident, as well as post-operative pain and chronic pain. Trusts should also agree with commissioners the services and resources which are appropriate to meet local needs.
<P>

<a name="30707w26.html_para1">The Department of Health does not collect information on those trusts which do not provide a chronic pain service. The CSAG report showed that, in April 2000, chronic pain services existed in 215 acute NHS trusts, which amounts to 86 per cent. of acute trusts in the United Kingdom.

[122952]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w26.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 It will be for the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) to determine what constitutes a reasonable time under clause 82 (formerly 85) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill. The purpose of this clause is to allow the CSCI to conduct an inspection of a premise at any time of the full 24-hour day so long as it is justifiable given the needs of the inspection. Whether it would be reasonable to give advance notice of an individual inspection would be a decision that the CSCI would have to make in the light of the particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30707w26.html_para6">CSCI would be able to enter premises that it reasonably believed were being used in connection with the provision of English local authority social services. It is not proposed that the Bill will define the term "reasonably believed". Essentially, CSCI will have to establish that, at the time of entry to the premises, they genuinely believed on reasonable grounds that the premises were being used to provide local authority social services. CSCI's power and authority to inspect is derived from clause 82 of the Bill. Clause 82(3) of the Bill, requires a person proposing to exercise rights of inspection to produce a duly authenticated document showing their right to inspect. This will be proof of their identity and position within CSCI.

<a name="30707w29.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what considerations led him to stipulate &#163;1 as being the appropriate fee to register as a member of a public benefit corporation.  [123577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill requires that a person may not be a member of a public benefit corporation unless he has agreed to pay a sum not exceeding &#163;1. The requirement to agree to make a nominal payment to become a member of a public benefit corporation is not a membership fee but represents a commitment to the national health service foundation trust.

<P>
<a name="30707w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the expected cost is of maintaining a register of members of public benefit corporations.  [123578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30707w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton:  </B> 
The costs of maintaining a register of members will vary depending upon the size of the membership of a public benefit corporation. The new arrangements build on existing arrangements for patient and public involvement&#151;much of the activity is not entirely new and will not therefore generate new costs.

 We are not aware of having received any representations from the medical profession on this subject.
