 The current system of local authority industrial pollution regulation began in 1991. DEFRA's annual research expenditure on this system varies annually, but on average is around &#163;40,000 a year. Consultations are undertaken periodically, including an annual consultation on the level of fees and charges payable by regulated businesses. In the last six months, separate consultations have been undertaken on a better regulation review of the system, and on the principles to underpin the forthcoming review of statutory guidance notes on pollution standards. Separate data are not held which distinguishes the cost of these consultations from that of managing the system as a whole.</p>

 While large energy companies continue to be able to access the capital markets for investment purposes, some smaller energy firms have found debt financing harder to come by due to current financial conditions, potentially leading to postponement and delay in some investments. The Government are working closely with such companies to ensure that they make the best of the financing opportunities available to them while these firms may also be eligible for the Government's recently announced schemes to restore the flow of credit to businesses (Working Capital Scheme, Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme and the Capital for Enterprise Fund).</p>

 For an average consumer using 3,300 kWh of electricity and 18,000 kWh of gas per year and paying their bills on receipt (standard credit), the average annual saving from switching would have been &#163;73 at average 2008 prices. If this average consumer also switched to paying their bill by direct debit, the saving would increase to &#163;131 at 2008 prices.

 The UK sees diversity of both sources and routes of gas as vital for the EU's security of supply. Recent events have underlined the importance to the EU of being supplied with gas from a wide range of countries. The development of a southern corridor, with the aim of bringing gas through Turkey to the EU from the Caspian region, and in the longer term from the Middle East, is crucial to that end. The UK therefore strongly supports the efforts of the European Commission and fellow EU member states to develop a southern corridor and is actively engaged in these efforts.</p>

In addition to pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), imported by tanker from countries such as Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Algeria, can also play an important role in diversifying gas supply to the UK and other EU member states.</p>

 The question that was estimated to be in excess of the disproportionate cost threshold was tabled in March 2008 by Baroness Stern (HL2252). It asked how many new imprisonable offences have been created since May 1997. The information was collated manually across the whole of Government therefore my noble Friend Lord Hunt gave an undertaking to write to Baroness Stern in his answer of 24 April 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column WA314, when the information was available. My noble Friend Lord Bach wrote to Baroness Stern on 24 November with a full response. A copy of the letter was also placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

However, the definition is not designed to provide a reliable measure of the level of youth offending over time, and it will give a misleading picture of the true trend if used for this purpose.</p>

Youth sentencing is therefore now more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997. As the PYO definition relies on repeat sentencing occasions, a side-effect of the Government&#146;s success in bringing much swifter justice to young repeat offenders is that more of them end up being defined as PYOs.</p>

 The UK Government remain committed to helping the DRC Government to hold local elections as soon as feasible and preferably in advance of the national elections in 2011. As the largest bilateral donor supporting the election processes, we are now working to ensure effective future elections by strengthening the Independent Elections Commission, through a grant of &#163;14.5 million to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This will help fund administrative structures; including the establishment of local liaison offices throughout the country and revision of the electoral roll&#151;developing it in a way that can be regularly updated for any future elections.</p>

The promotion of transparency, competition and financial literacy, is very important and in the long run can have a bearing on the level of interest. This is why DFID has recently launched the &#163;4 million Financial Education Fund (FEF), to back the best ideas to help raise financial literacy among poor consumers and small businesses in Africa. The FEF will operate across Africa. In its first round of calls for projects, FEF has received 110 concept notes that are under review.</p>

 Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of HIV prevalence in the world. Although the rate has fallen to 15.6 per cent. of adults aged 15 to 54 years, it remains the main cause of illness and early death. Of those infected, 56 per cent. are women. Because most people in Zimbabwe, as in other highly affected countries, do not know their HIV status, it is difficult to calculate the number of households with at least one HIV positive member. However, households that are affected often experience multiple infections (in one or both parents and possibly in their young children) making HIV catastrophic for the welfare of all members. Although there are no reliable statistics, as many as one in eight households may be affected in some way by HIV/AIDS.</p>

 Information on the closure, merger or opening of particular university departments is not routinely collected by the Department although we are aware that Reading university has recently proposed to close its social work department in order to strengthen other areas. Nationally, 100 higher education institutions teach social work as a major subject for nearly 60,000 students. While institutions will continue to be responsible for deciding for themselves which subjects to teach, we are committed across Government to strengthening the capacity of the social care work force to respond effectively to the challenges they face.</p>

 Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

The test includes as expenditure a range of standard allowances and premiums based on housing benefit and income support regulations. This model not only ensures that the grant goes to those least able to contribute to the cost of the works but also to help ensure that applicants are treated consistently. The Department does not hold records of individuals&#146; contributions. The following link provides greater detail on the means test.</p>

 The small business rate relief scheme is a self-financing scheme, funded by a supplement paid by businesses that do not meet the eligibility criteria. The level of the supplement in 2009-10 was calculated using information supplied by local authorities from their national non-domestic rates returns submitted to the Department about the cost of the small business rate relief scheme in previous years. A further estimate was made about the cost of the amendment to the scheme which comes into effect on 1 April 2009, allowing occupants of new properties that join the rating list during the financial year to claim relief. The value of the supplement is based on these estimates and a forecast of the number and aggregate value of properties that are able to fund the scheme.</p>

 X-Factor is comprehensively reviewed, usually every five years, by the independent Armed Forces' Pay Review Body (AFPRB) which assesses both MOD and independent civilian evidence. The last review of X-Factor was carried out in 2007 to inform the 2008 AFPRB report. In the report, the AFPRB noted that all the evidence was unanimous and emphatic that X-Factor is an important part of the overall remuneration package for the armed forces. As a result of the evidence gathered, the AFPRB judged that an increase in the level of X-Factor from 13 per cent. to 14 per cent. of base pay was warranted, together with a change to the tapering arrangements for Lieutenant Colonels and equivalent and above. The Government accepted this recommendation which was implemented in full from 1 April 2008. The AFPRB is scheduled to review X-Factor again in 2012 for its 2013 report.</p>

 None. HM Treasury is contributing &#163;500 million from the Reserve towards the protected mobility package, and the remainder will be funded by the MOD.

<p><a name="stpa_620"><a name="90226w0039.htm_para0"><a name="09022675001115">The equipment failure reporting system (EFRS) is the mandated system for equipment users to report failures, such as accidental damage, maintenance related failures and breakdowns, or the failure of an item fitted to the vehicle. It does not incorporate the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what might later prove to have been a problem caused by operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor do these data record the severity of a failure which might have no discernible impact on operational capability or safety. It is not possible using EFRs to distinguish how many of the EFRs in the &#145;Others' section were as a result of training, and some of the EFRs raised in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been during in theatre training rather than during the conduct of operations.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence records instances of heat illness as part of its monitoring of climatic injury. Heat illness has traditionally been divided into heat exhaustion and heat stroke, but in practice it is difficult to define the division between the two. Heat illness is therefore used to cover the full continuum of illness ranging from mild symptoms such as muscular weakness, headache and excess fatigue to more serious outcomes such as collapse or coma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="90226w0039.htm_para14"><a name="09022676000049">Nevertheless, in relation to education law, the regulatory framework applied to academies is lighter touch than the framework applied to maintained schools. This is because we wish to give academies flexibility in the way they are run in many areas&#151;e.g. curriculum content and delivery (although, since 2007 all new academies have to follow the national curriculum for English, Maths, Science and ICT), organisation of the school day, pay and conditions of teachers&#151;in order to help break through entrenched educational failure and low aspiration. Through offering innovative solutions towards tackling educational under-achievement academies are making significant strides towards improving the attainment of children within our most educationally disadvantaged communities. In 2008, the 36 academies which have been open long enough to have results in both 2007 and 2008 have seen an increase of 11.5 per cent. in the number of pupils at the end of key stage 4 gaining five or more A*-C grades at GCSE and equivalent.

 If a sponsor wishes to withdraw involvement, for whatever reason, once an academy has been opened then the academy trust and DCSF would agree the best way forward. The prime consideration would be the needs of the pupils at the academy.</p>

More recent academies have sponsorship in the form of contribution to endowment funds. The income from these funds is intended to be used to enhance students' opportunities and widen the academy's role in its community, but does not contribute to the recurrent costs of providing education. Therefore any shortfall in sponsorship contributions, whilst regrettable, does not produce any need for additional support of the academy concerned.</p>

 After careful consideration of the House of Lords judgment in Wright, the Government remain satisfied that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Act 2006 is compatible with human rights and in particular with Articles 6 and 8 of the ECHR. The scheme under the SVG Act does not include the feature of provisional listing, which was the focus of the challenge in the Wright case. In particular, whenever the ISA is exercising its discretion to place someone on a barred list, including under the SVG Act 2006 (Transitory Provisions Order) 2009 (SI 2009/12), which came into force on 20 January 2009, it must first invite their representations and also must send the individual the information on which it intends to rely. This is provided for in paragraphs 3(2), 5(2), 9(2), 11(2) and 16(1) of Schedule 3 to the Act. It would only be where a person had committed an offence which, by its nature, indicated that they posed an immediate risk of harm to the vulnerable (prescribed in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (Prescribed Criteria and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2009, S.I. 2009/37) that they would be barred before being given the right to make representations. This is provided for in paragraphs 1,2,7 and 8 of Schedule 3 to the Act (the offences prescribed under paragraph 1 include the rape of a child, for example). The judgment in Wright acknowledged that an &#147;ex parte&#148; procedure could be justified in such circumstances.</p>

 It is for the new local authorities in Cheshire and Bedfordshire to ensure that they deliver effective services for children, young people and families. The Government have always made clear that it is crucial that the transition to the new local authority structures should avoid disruption to children's services, including child protection services in particular. Specialist safeguarding advisers in the relevant Government Offices have been closely involved in monitoring and supporting the process of transition in both areas.

Where there is not, the teacher assessments are equally likely to be higher or lower than the performance test level achieved. When interpreting these data, it should be borne in mind that national curriculum test and teacher assessment data will not always correlate. This is because tests provide a snapshot of attainment at the end of the key stage whereas teacher assessment takes into account evidence of attainment in a variety of contexts (such as discussion and observation), throughout the year. Both are vital to ensure rounded, and validated, assessments can be made about each child's performance.</p>

 For funding additional school places the Department relied on authorities&#146; own pupil projections for its estimates of the number of children entering primary schools in each local authority area in 2000-01, 2005-06 and 2010-11. Officials are reviewing emerging pupil number trends to inform the spending review period 2011-12 onwards.</p>

These are linked to ONS (Office for National Statistics) data, which take account of projected population increases. The Department&#146;s local authority level projections were used to provide individual indicative allocations and Guaranteed Units of Funding (GUF) at the start of the current CSR period for 2008-11. These indicative allocations become finalised once the latest pupil numbers are known. There are currently no LA level projections formulated for this purpose beyond the current CSR period.</p>

However, for information, Tables A-E list all of the Pupil Referral Units which have been judged outstanding since September 2005 and all those judged excellent or very good between September 2003 and July 2005.

However, the Government have set mandatory nutritional standards for school food. Ofsted does not inspect whether a school is meeting all of the standards but, as part of their regular inspections, expect schools to present evidence about their general approach to food and healthy eating (the &#145;whole school&#146; approach) and will report on any issues which arise out of self-assessment or as a result of their inspection visit. This contributes to the judgement which Ofsted makes on the extent to which learners adopt healthy lifestyles.</p>

 The current review of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) is investigating how best to provide funding for additional educational needs (AEN), including deprivation. As part of the research to inform the review we have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to investigate the different types of AEN in terms of level of incidence and severity, the best measures for identifying pupils likely to under-achieve, and the potential role of financial incentives in tackling deprivation.

 1. Budget share plus grants allocated to schools is the combination of the schools individual budget share plus any revenue grants allocated to the school at the start of the financial year. This does not include any capital funding allocated to schools.<br>
 2. The amount of money allocated to a school depends very much on the individual local authorities&#146; own policy for funding their schools. Different authorities retain varying amounts of funding centrally to spend on behalf of their schools while others chose to give schools more autonomy over how they spend their money by devolving more funding to the individual school.<br>
 3. The pupil numbers used to calculate the per pupil amounts are as reported by the local authority on their Section 52 Budget Statement (Table 2) comprising of the full-time equivalent number pupils registered at the school used for the initial determination of the school&#146;s budget share under the local authority&#146;s allocation formula.<br>
 4. Included are all local authority maintained primary and secondary schools who are reported by their LA as being open for the entire final year (schools that are reported as either opening or closing during the financial year have been removed). Figures for secondary schools include any LSC funding and LSC pupils for schools with 6th forms.<br>
 5. For the purposes of this PQ, a small primary school is defined as having fewer than 100 pupils and a small secondary school is defined as having fewer than 600 pupils.<br>
 6. Total budgeted share plus grants figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000. Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>
 7. 2008-09 figures are subject to change by the local authority.<br>

 Public service agreement 11 of October 2007 set out the Government&#146;s commitment to narrow the gap in educational achievement between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers. It did not specify principles of validated good practice in schools and child care settings. The Children&#146;s Plan set out the Government&#146;s policies to extend and mainstream best practice across the whole child care and education system, including through the self-evaluation and Ofsted inspection frameworks. &#147;The Children&#146;s Plan - One Year On&#148;, published in December 2008, reported on progress since then in enabling all children and young people to succeed, and set out priorities for 2009.</p>

 The Government are aware that the changes to surface water charges can lead to increased charges for some schools, depending on their site and how much they use the public drainage system for rainwater disposal. Schools and local authorities should work together if this proves to be the case and take steps to improve natural drainage at schools if necessary.</p>
