<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90317w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Jury service is based on the principle of random selection and therefore it is possible for a person to be called more than once after a period of time. There are no plans to reform the legislation that governs the selection process. Occasionally representations are made by an individual to the Court Service about repeated calls for jury service, and these are referred to the local Crown Court for consideration.

 The Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests published in October 1997 set out some of the benefits of monetary union. These include reduced transaction costs, the elimination of exchange rate uncertainty on trade and investment in the euro area and increased price transparency. The Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests concluded that membership of a successful single currency could enhance competition and improve prospects for trade and investment.

 Considerable work continues to be undertaken within the OECD to ensure that export credit agencies operate on the basis of a level playing field. The imminent introduction on 1 April this year of the OECD premia regime is the latest example of this work. The G8 recognises that the OECD is often the appropriate forum for export credit issues and for this reason has in the past encourage the OECD to seek a common standard on several export credit matters, including the environment and productive expenditure for highly indebted poor countries. We will continue within the G8 to support the work of the OECD Export Credits Group towards developing common standards for export credit agencies.

<P>
<a name="90317w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In summary, the findings of the European Commission on Human Rights were as follows:
<P>

<a name="90317w04.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On Article 3 ('Production of torture') the Commission found no violation in relation to the trial.
<P>
<BR>
On Article 6(1) ('Right to a fair trial') the Commission found violation by 14 votes to 5 in relation to the trial.
<P>
<BR>
On Article 14 ('Prohibition of discrimination') the Commission found no separate issue because of the violation on Article 6 above.
<P>
<BR>
On Article 3 the Commission found no violation in relation to the sentence.
<P>
<BR>
On Article 5(1) ('Right to liberty and security') the Commission found no violation in relation to the sentence.

<BR>
On Article 6(1) the Commission found violation by 18 votes to 1 in relation to the tariff.
<P>
<BR>
On Article 5(4) the Commission found violation by 18 votes to 1 in relation to the tariff and review of detention.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90317w04.htm_para3">The Government welcome the fact that the Commission found that neither the trial nor the sentencing process were in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention which deals with inhuman and degrading treatment.
<P>

<a name="90317w04.htm_para4">The areas where the Commission did find against the United Kingdom Government do raise a range of serious and quite complex issues. The Government have decided to refer the Commission's finding themselves to the European Court of Human Rights. The European Commission has also referred these matters to the European Court.
<P>

<a name="90317w04.htm_para5">The European Court of Human Rights will now rehear all the issues covered by the Commission. This will give the Government an opportunity to state their position on all these issues. The Government will continue to contest these applications very strongly.

 The National Radiological Protection Board, working under contract to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions carried out surveys into the radiological impact of the transport of radioactive materials by all modes. In the last survey covering rail transport (Radiation Exposure from the Normal Transport of Radioactive Materials within the United Kingdom, 1991 Review, by R. Gelder, National Radiological Protection Board Report NRPB-R255, ISBN 0 85951 351 3) the scenario of a householder living 100 metres from a marshalling yard where fuel flasks may be held for several hours, was assessed to give rise to a maximum dose of 6 microSievert. The maximum dose to persons living closer (50 metres) to a railway line with passing traffic (where exposure times would be very much shorter) was assessed to be very much lower. For comparison, the average annual dose in the UK owing to natural background radiation is about 2000 microSievert.
<P>

<a name="90317w04.htm_para7">The international safety levels for the transport of radioactive materials by rail are in the Regulations concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (RID) (ISBN 0-11-552032-5). They require that the radiation level from trains carrying radioactive material during normal operations is limited to a maximum of 2 milliSievert/h at any point on the wagon outer surfaces, or the vertical planes projected from the outer edges of open wagons and to 0.1 milliSievert/h at a distance of 2 metres from those surfaces. The maximum levels for non-fixed contamination on the surface of fuel flasks or rail wagons is 4 Bequerels/cm <sup>2</sup>  for beta, gamma and low toxicity alpha emitters and 0.4 Bequerels/cm <sup>2</sup>  for alpha emitters.

 The road traffic problem caused by summer tourism in the North West is highly localised in nature and is primarily a matter for the local highway authorities concerned. Officials from my Department have been working with key partners in Cumbria to enhance and accelerate the existing Lake District Transport Package which has received TPP funding since 1998. The resultant Transport Strategy will act as a pilot for other National Parks.
<P>

<a name="90317w05.htm_para0">The strategy, among other things, aims to reduce traffic and offer alternative modes of transport to the car while maintaining a sustainable tourist industry.

 The Government's view is that their plans for creating a new statutory right on foot to open countryside are compatible with their obligations under the European Convention on human rights. In deciding that there will be no general right to compensation, the Government have taken into account the limited nature of the new right of access; its application only to land which is undeveloped and not used for intensive agricultural purposes; the continued ability of landowners to develop and use their land after the introduction of the right; and the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 1999 : Column: 670</I><P>
extensive provision made for closure of land for land management and other reasons. A cost benefit study for the Government, undertaken by independent consultants, supports the view that landowners will not suffer significant losses or costs as a result of a new right of access such as would warrant the provision of compensation.

In December 1998 we issued a consultation paper "A New Financial Framework for Local Authority Housing: Resource Accounting in the Housing Revenue Account" seeking views on proposals for fundamental changes in the system. These changes would include ending the practice of offsetting assumed surpluses on an Authority's Housing Revenue Account against rent rebate subsidy.

 No civil servants in my Department have been asked to waive their rights. Employers of the Department are highly dedicated to the work and inclined to work long hours. We have decided to tackle instances of work overload through measures such as job re-structuring and work re-prioritisation rather than by the continuing acceptance of a long hours culture. Managers at all levels have been asked to ensure that staff are not put under pressure to work hours in excess of those permitted by the Directive or to waive their rights.

 Guidance on the provision of paediatric occupational therapy services is contained in "Child Health in the Community--A Guide to Good Practice", published in 1996.

 The Medicines Control Agency receives almost all its income from licensing and associated fees. The balance of its income derives from charges for associated services for which statutory fees are not levied.

 We will be taking all available steps to secure extension of the EP franchise to Gibraltar, in the light of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights. However, this can be done only by amending the 1976 EC Act on Direct Elections. This will require the agreement of all Member States. HMG will seek such an amendment in the current negotiations in Brussels on establishing Common Principles for EP elections.

 No UN forces are specifically assigned to preventing the export of oil from Iraq. It is for individual member states to implement UN sanctions. A Multinational Interdiction Force, to which the UK regularly contributes maritime assets, patrols the Gulf to reduce the volume of illegal trade with Iraq, particularly oil, the most lucrative source of income for the Iraqi regime. We regularly make representations to Iraq's neighbours on the importance of preventing such a trade.

<a name="90317w09.htm_para8">The Environment Agency has declared that, because the levels of radioactivity are not a danger to human health or the environment, it has decided not to stop the discharges. It also stated that the radiation dose from tritium in this groundwater at the point of entry into the Aldermaston stream is about 100 times less than the annual European radiation dose limit and 200 times less than natural background radiation. The stream flows into the River Kennet. I understand that samples taken downstream at Padworth bridge indicate that by that point, the levels are close to the limits of detection.

<P>
<a name="90317w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The current estimated cost of procurement of Nimrod MRA4 is &#163;2.4 billion (at September 1998 economic conditions), an increase of 0.5 per cent. since the contract was placed in December 1996. When the contract was placed, BAe undertook to meet an ISD of April 2003. Resource and technical difficulties with the early phases of the programme at BAe mean that the company does not now expect the aircraft to enter service with the RAF before early 2005. The precise slippage is still the subject of negotiations between MOD and BAe.

 Details of staff who have voluntarily agreed that the maximum 48 hour working week need not apply in their case are not held centrally and the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Department has issued guidance that such opt-outs should be agreed by line managers only in exceptional circumstances. The vast majority of staff will therefore be unaffected by this aspect of the regulations. As normal working hours for MOD civil servants are well within the 48 hour ceiling, the costs of compliance with the Directive are negligible.

 Two RAF special storage areas were closed in 1998 because they were no longer needed following the withdrawal of the WE177 nuclear weapon.

Of these, we estimate around a third of students, from lower income families, will not be expected to contribute anything towards the costs of their tuition, and from those students who will be asked to contribute, universities and colleges in England and Wales are expected to receive income of &#163;130 million and &#163;8 million respectively.

(5) = less than 2.5 per cent.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates requested have been made using the PENSIM model. Due to the number of assumptions used in PENSIM, and the uncertainty surrounding estimates so far into the future, these estimates should be considered as broad brush. In particular, PENSIM uses data from a number of different sources. As a result, changes over an interval as short as five years may be due to a change in the composition of the data set used to make projections. Therefore the results presented in the table should be treated with some caution and used to identify long-term trends rather than changes over short periods.<P>

2. All figures are rounded to the nearest 5 per cent.<P>

3. Average earnings are assumed to grow 1.5 per cent. faster than prices.<P>

4. 20 per cent. of average earnings, in 1998 prices, for 2000 is &#163;79.22 and 30 per cent. is &#163;118.84.<P>

5. The return on investments is assumed to be 2 per cent. greater than the rise in average earnings.<P>

6. The answer is based on the current system of retirement pensions--it does not include the effects of the proposed State Second Pension which the Government are currently consulting on.<P>

7. It is assumed that the Minimum Income Guarantee will be uprated broadly in line with earnings.<P>

8. Part <i>(b)</i> is answered by deducting Income Support and Housing Benefit from pensioners' income. This is because the PENSIM model does not calculate other means-tested benefits.<P>

9. A pensioner unit is defined as a single (non-cohabiting) person over State pension age or a couple (married or cohabiting) where the man, defined as the head, is over State pension age.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. 1994-95 is the earliest year for which the FRS based HBAI series is available. 1996-97 is the latest year for which information is available.<P>

2. For the purposes of this analysis, 'benefits' were taken to be:<P>

Family Credit, Income Support, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Social Fund (all components), State Retirement Pensions, Jobseeker's Allowance/Unemployment Benefit, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Disability Working Allowance, Invalid Care Allowance, War Pensions, Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, Child Benefit, One Parent Benefit, Windows Benefit, Guardians Allowance, Maternity Allowance, Statutory Sick Pay, Statutory Maternity Benefits, Back to Work Bonuses, Income from Government Training Schemes.<P>

3. For the purposes of this analysis, 'main source of income' is defined as being the largest of the three sources of income outlined in the table.<P>

4. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income which is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

5. It is standard HBAI practice to give results for income both before and after housing costs, in order to allow for the effect of variations in housing costs between households. In this case, the results are only quoted before housing costs, as they were invariant to the use of the two different income measures.<P>

All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which are based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland. <P>

 The UK operation of the Anglo-French electricity interconnector is a commercial matter for the National Grid Company. It is normal operational procedure for the National Grid Company to assess continually the risk to electricity supplies in England and Wales which might arise from any credible instantaneous loss of power generation. As part of this procedure, the National Grid Company constantly monitors all credible losses and schedules sufficient reserve capacity to respond to them. In this context the Anglo-French Interconnector is assessed alongside generators in England and Wales. The capacity of the interconnector is 2 X 1,000 MW circuits, the installed generating capacity in England and Wales is more than 65,000 MW and the typical peak demand over New Years Eve is likely to be in the order of 37,000 MW.
<P>

<a name="90317w13.htm_para0">Northern Ireland Electricity expect to provide a normal service to their customers over the period of the millennium and do not envisage any disruption being caused by a failure of the interconnector with the Republic of Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90317w14.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government are committed to a new and strong drive to develop renewable sources of energy and has undertaken a review of the status and prospects for renewables, including offshore wind energy. As a first step towards that policy the fifth and largest Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO-5) Order of 1,177 MW was announced on 24 September 1998.
<P>

<a name="90317w14.htm_para0">For the future the Government have been reviewing what would be necessary and practicable to achieve 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity needs from renewables by 2010, and what contribution new and renewable energy technologies might make to future greenhouse gas commitments.
<P>

<a name="90317w14.htm_para1">To achieve 10 per cent. electricity from renewables would require 3-4 Gigawatts (DNC) of additional renewable capacity over and above that in place or likely to be commissioned from existing NFFO arrangements. It would require the use not only of technologies which have formed the mainstay of NFFO to date, such as waste, including landfill gas and onshore wind but also a significant contribution from offshore wind and energy crops.
<P>

<a name="90317w14.htm_para2">The Government will shortly be publishing a consultation document on the status and prospects for renewables. A co-ordinated strategy would need to be agreed between Government and industry to cover the medium-term future with a view also to the longer term. 



<P>
<P><I>17 Mar 1999 : Column: 701</I><P>
Such a strategy is expected to arise from the renewables consultation document. It would need to take account of the European White Paper on renewables.
<P>

<a name="90317w14.htm_para3">As for offshore wind, I have already consulted interested parties on the most suitable arrangements for incorporating the development of offshore wind energy into the NFFO process and the results of my consultation will be incorporated into the co-ordinated strategy arising from the renewables consultation document.
<P>

<a name="90317w14.htm_para4">In the meantime, my Department's New and Renewable Energy Programme continues to support preparatory work on offshore wind, including monitoring the development of the first offshore wind NFFO project, at Blyth, and encouraging UK manufacturing industry to seize the commercial opportunities within the offshore wind arena. We have already awarded contracts to two offshore wind projects under NFFO-4. These are located at Gunfleet Sand, near Clacton, Essex, comprising 12.8 MW contracted capacity and the other at Blyth, Northumberland comprising 0.72 MW contracted capacity. Total DTI expenditure on wind energy projects in 1997-98 was &#163;1.5 million.

<a name="90317w15.htm_para2">Many people choose to use the services of a formation agent or other professional intermediary to carry out the incorporation for them. In such cases the total cost can vary considerably depending on the intermediary used and the nature of the service provided. Such additional costs are subject to normal market force.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> There is no need to require employers to provide their workers with a national minimum wage statement. The Government have begun major campaigns in the press, and on television and radio, to make sure everyone knows about the minimum wage. We have also produced both a detailed guide to the national minimum wage, and short guides for employers and workers. In addition national minimum wage telephone helplines have been established to answer questions and issue the guidance booklets.

 Further to the answer given by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) to the hon. Member on 25 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>142</i>, further details on progress improving the arrangements for the sharing of export licensing information were set out in the Department of Trade and Industry's Supplementary Memorandum to the Trade and Industry Committee's inquiry on Strategic Export Controls (HC65, pages 75-76). As noted in the memorandum, in addition to sharing information on licence applications, there is also a need to share information on licences issued and applications refused, and DTI's Export Control Organisation is working with HMC&E to examine the feasibility of making such information available electronically to Customs officials who have responsibility for enforcing export controls at the point of export. While the Export Control Organisation maintains records of licence applications, it does not compile records of licensed exports.

 I very much welcome the improvement in performance of executive agencies as highlighted in the 1998 Next Steps Report. It is essential, however, that this improvement is built upon. With the introduction of Public Service Agreements, agencies will have an important role to play in helping Ministers deliver the Government's new priorities and objectives. I have encouraged colleagues to ensure that agencies' targets for the coming year reflect this contribution to broader goals.

The guide was widely discussed with other Government Departments before issue. We subsequently published a further, more general guide to consulting users of public services. Ministers have also been involved in various discussions on the People's Panel.

 The Duchy's role in developing employment opportunities in its rural areas falls under three headings: first, supporting its tenants in country areas who in turn create employment; secondly, by encouraging the re-use (for employment or residential purposes) of out dated agricultural buildings, and thirdly, by employing its own staff of contractors for the maintenance of properties and for the management of its woodlands.

<a name="90317w16.htm_para0">My officials in the Better Regulation Unit have published new guidance to help departments to apply the Task Force's principles of good regulation and to assess the impact of regulatory proposals. When we consider regulating we will consult widely, and listen to those affected to ensure a balanced approach. No regulatory proposal which has an impact on businesses, charities or voluntary bodies should be considered by the Government without a thorough assessment of the risks, costs and benefits, a clear analysis of who will be affected and an explanation of why non-regulatory action would be insufficient. This guidance has been welcomed by the Prime Minister and commended to all Ministers and officials.
