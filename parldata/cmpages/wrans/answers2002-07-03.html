<P>
<a name="20703w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> No. Such correspondence is covered by the exemptions set out in Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which cover third party commercial confidences and information given in confidence. This is in line with the practice observed by previous Governments. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already placed in the Library of the House an exchange of correspondence between herself and Sir Rodney Walker, the then chairman of Wembley National Stadium Ltd., in answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen) on 14 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 597&#150;98W. This exchange contained an explanation of the Government's commitment to the project for the benefit of WNSL's then bankers and others who were or might become involved in the Football Association's project. Given it was essentially a public commitment, my right hon. Friend considered it important that Parliament should see its contents. This was done with the consent of Wembley National Stadium Ltd.

 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> Over the last 10 years English Heritage has grant-aided 295 properties in London. Of these 166 were administered under the Historic Buildings and Monuments Act 1953. These grants are conditional on the provision of public

<P>

<a name="20703w01.html_para3">Grants to the remaining 129 properties were administered under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Local Government Act 1985 for exterior work and essential structural repairs. These grants were to Grade II listed buildings or buildings in conservation areas. There is no automatic access requirement, although some of these properties are open to the public.
<P>

<a name="20703w01.html_para4">Since 1994 the Heritage lottery fund has made 238 awards to historic buildings in London. Public access is an important consideration in awarding grants. The Heritage lottery fund recognises the central role of access in achieving its overall aim to use heritage funding to improve people's quality of life. The organisation is committed to developing the widest possible constituency for heritage, and to promoting access, equality of opportunity and inclusion in all activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the latest estimate is of the cost of the Trident Acquisition Programme; and if he will make a statement.  [67206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year rate (the hybrid) estimate, is now &#163;9,800 million. Since the 2001 estimate and leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&#163;11 million), there has been a real cost increase of &#163;25 million. This increase derives principally from additional costs associated with dockyard projects and with missiles and related equipment, offset by a reduced acquisition cost for the four submarines. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 2001 represented over 98 per cent. of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;14,376 million.
<P>

<a name="20703w02.html_para3">The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &#163;3.7 billion at current prices.
<P>

<a name="20703w02.html_para4">The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the performance of the SA80A2 rifle in Afghanistan; and what faults have been reported.  [66017]<P>

<a name="20703w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The SA80-A2 is operating in a very difficult environment in Afghanistan with both dusty conditions and extremes of temperature. To date, three formal equipment failure reports have been filed from Afghanistan; this under a 100 per cent. fault reporting regime. In an operational environment any concerns are treated very seriously and a specialist team on the ground in Afghanistan is investigating these reports as a matter of urgency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the daily average number of RAF aircraft movements was for each RAF base in the United Kingdom over the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [65200]<P>

 The information in the format requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The table details the daily average number of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft movements over the last five years at current RAF stations. A number of the movements may have been aircraft belonging to the other services. At RAF Brize Norton, RAF Lyneham, RAF Northolt and RAF St. Mawgan, commercial aircraft movements are also included.

 A draft contract for the development and production of the Meteor missile was sent to our partner nations at the end of April following the conclusion of negotiations with the prime contractor MBDA. A revised and final draft contract was passed to our partners earlier this month. We very much hope that all partner nations will confirm within the next few weeks that they are content for the contract to be signed. Germany will need also to sign the Meteor Memorandum of Understanding, which has already been signed by the other five partner nations.
<P>

<a name="20703w03.html_para0">Although negotiation of the Meteor contract has taken longer than expected, we assess that Meteor can achieve its planned in-service date with the RAF if the contract is awarded in the near future.

 As I made clear in my answer on 28 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1451&#150;52W to the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), the Harrier GR7 is being upgraded to GR9 standard as this best meets our capability requirements. The Ministry of Defence has not conducted a formal evaluation of the capabilities offered by the Harrier II plus programme, but understands that the main capability difference between the Harrier GR9 and the Harrier II plus is in the latter's nose- mounted radar.
<P>

<a name="20703w03.html_para12">While it would, in theory, be possible to mount a radar in the nose of the GR9, we currently have no requirement to do so. Therefore, no detailed work has been undertaken by the MOD into the practicality and cost-effectiveness of such a modification.
<P>

<a name="20703w03.html_para13">Such a programme would be at least as complex, lengthy and costly as the Sea Harrier Blue Vixen/ AMRAAM update in the mid-90s. Given the likely considerable cost, time scale and technical risk involved, and the planned entry into service of the Future Joint Combat Aircraft in 2012, the benefits of integrating a radar on to the GR9 Harrier would be of limited duration and utility. Such a programme would also delay the integration of the smart weapons on to the Harrier GR9 required to enable it to continue to conduct its primary role of the delivery of offensive air power from land and sea.

 Defence Munition (DM) Dean Hill's primary task is (and has been) the storage of munitions.

 The Army Training and Recruiting Agency's (ATRA) secondary health care initiative was formally introduced on 1 April 2001 and the Budgetary sum allocated for the financial year 2001&#150;02 was &#163;1.3 million. Personnel eligible for treatment under the scheme are ATRA trainers or trainees who are referred by their unit general practitioner for investigation, opinion and/or treatment for a condition which is preventing them from continuing with their employment/training. Personnel are referred only when waiting lists at the local Ministry of Defence hospital unit or NHS hospital are deemed excessive. The vast majority of these are Army personnel; a small number of RN and RAF personnel might have been included who were posted to ATRA units, either as trainers or trainees, but these cannot be readily identified. Records held do not allow for numbers treated per month to be easily identified, as an individual may well be treated over a period and therefore feature in more than one month's figures. The costs per month since inception are as follows:

The Grant contributes 7/8ths of the cost of a pilgrimage organised by Remembrance Travel and to date has benefited over 4,000 widows. The scheme has recently been extended to 31 March 2005.

 The CPS is responsible for the payment of fees to counsel agents engaged to prosecute in magistrates courts. Counsel agents attend magistrates courts to undertake routine prosecution work to supplement advocacy by CPS prosecutors. This work is paid for from the cash limited administrative costs budget. In some cases, where specialist advocacy is required, or exceptional preparation time is needed or a case is likely to be lengthy, a special fee is negotiated with counsel and paid from the non-cash limited prosecution costs provision.

<a name="20703w05.html_para2">In their quarterly report to the Law Officers for July to September 2001, HM CPS Inspectorate commented on the inappropriate attribution of costs to the non-cash limited prosecution costs provision by some areas.

<a name="20703w07.html_para4">All local authorities will benefit from recent changes to housing benefit subsidy levels, worth up to &#163;10 million, which provide an incentive to lease private sector homes as a better quality alternative to B&B hotels.

Regional B&B 'Good Practice' seminars have been held and examples of good practice have been shared through a newsletter and are posted on the ODPM website.

 HM Treasury, HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue have introduced 44 statutory instruments; removed none and introduced 22 amendment instruments since 1 January 2002. Many of the instruments concerned were of a routine nature, for example approving annual fee increases.

<a name="20703w08.html_para4">The HMSO SI Registrar Siregistrar@cabinet- office.x.gsi.gov.uk can provide a list of statutory instruments which have been issued by individual Government Departments. SIs which have been originated by Departments but eventually made by the Privy Council are only listed under the Privy Council Office.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proportion of <i>(a)</i> paper and <i>(b)</i> other goods purchased by his Department was recycled paper in each year since 1997; what the annual total cost of these purchases was; what plans there are to increase these proportions; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="20703w08.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Treasury in all cases purchases on a best value for money basis. Until recently the cost and quality of recycled paper did not provide this compared to virgin paper from sustainable sources and therefore only limited amounts were purchased.
<P>

<a name="20703w08.html_para7">Recycled paper appears to have improved in both quality and price. It is now the intention of the Department to look again at this issue. If recycled paper currently offers best value for money overall, Treasury will purchase this as the main source of its paper.

 Under the Postal Services Act (2000), the Postal Services Commission (known as Postcomm) was created, as an independent regulatory authority for the licensing of postal services. Postcomm administers a licensed area, broadly equivalent to the former Post Office statutory monopoly for letters weighing less than 350g and costing less than &#163;1. In March 2001, Postcomm granted Consignia a licence to provide services in the licensed area.
<P>

<a name="20703w09.html_para6">Under the Act, it is for Postcomm to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators, subject to its primary responsibility to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at a uniform tariff. Under its statutory powers Postcomm may introduce competition by issuing licenses or by recommending "further exemptions" or reductions to the licensed area.
<P>

<a name="20703w09.html_para7">In April 2001, Postcomm initially established an interim licensing policy pending a wideranging consultation exercise on how to introduce competition into the market. Postcomm has issued 10 other licences for niche services under this policy. Following the conclusion of its consultation Postcomm announced its decision on competition on 29 May 2002. The effect of that decision is to extend Postcomm's licensing policy to open the postal market to competition in three stages over four years. The first stage to open one third of the market will take effect from January 2003 with increased opportunities for competition in the licensed area and progression to full market opening by 1 April 2007.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what provision has been made for the evacuation of Mersea Island in the event of an emergency at Bradwell Power Station; and what estimate has been made about how long this would take.  [64959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 As with all UK civil nuclear sites, well developed and regularly tested arrangements for responding to an emergency at Bradwell Power Station are in place as part of the licensing requirements imposed by HSE's nuclear installations inspectorate. Detailed emergency plans are prepared for an area within the 2.4 km detailed emergency planning zone for Bradwell. Mersea Island is outside the detailed emergency planning zone for Bradwell; the boundary of this zone is defined in relation to the most significant release of radiation from an accident which can be seen through reasonably foreseeable scenarios and is derived from the safety case established for the site. Beyond this, plans must be capable of being extended to deal with larger, less likely events. This principle of extendibility is an important part of civil nuclear emergency response arrangements. Use is made of the general plans prepared by the police, local authority and other agencies for a wide range of events. These do not provide for the detailed estimation of evacuation times which would need to take into account the circumstances at the time: ie time of day, prevailing weather conditions and the state of the tide.
<P>

<a name="20703w10.html_para2">Bradwell Power Station ceased generating electricity on 31 March 2002 and will be decommissioned over the next few years. This process will reduce the radiological hazard.

 The operation of a nuclear power station is a matter for the relevant operator, subject to meeting the necessary regulatory requirements. The Government have already announced that, through the proposed Liabilities Management Authority, it will take on direct financial responsibility for the decommissioning and clean-up of BNFL's Magnox stations. Financial responsibility for the decommissioning of private sector nuclear power stations and the management of spent fuel and all associated wastes and materials is a matter for the operator concerned.

 If the liabilities of any company exceed its assets, it is a matter for the directors of that company to decide whether the company should continue trading. In addition, in the case of a nuclear power company operating on sites licensed under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear installations inspectorate would continue to monitor closely the company's activities to ensure it continued to maintain its safety performance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20703w11.html_para0">In accordance with Directive 94/63/EC Stage I, petrol vapour recovery has been rolled out in the UK over the past seven years. The final stage in the implementation of the Directive is 31 December 2004. The controls will then apply to all petrol stations in the UK with an annual throughput greater than 100m <sup>3</sup> . In 1998 it was estimated that this derogation would exempt approximately 136 sites in the UK. However, the total number of petrol stations in the UK since 1998 has decreased, from 13,758 to 13,043 in 2000. As petrol station closures often have a disproportionate impact on the smaller sites, it is likely that the number of petrol stations covered by the derogation has decreased since the data were gathered.
<P>

<a name="20703w11.html_para1">The directive also contains an option for member states to exempt larger sites, those with an annual throughput of less than 500m <sup>3</sup> , if located in an area where vapour emissions are unlikely to contribute significantly to environmental or health problems. My Department and the devolved Administrations are currently looking at applying the derogation in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport at what <i>(a)</i> height, <i>(b)</i> latitude and <i>(c)</i> longitude the KLM Fokker 70 aircraft was flying on 19 June when the MoD ordered a ceasefire during a live firing exercise on Salisbury Plain below it; and if he will make a statement.  [65197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I am advised by National Air Traffic Services (NATS) that the KLM Fokker 70 aircraft, en route from Amsterdam to Bristol on 19 June, was at a height of 17,000 feet, and was at latitude 51o 17' north and longitude 001o 51' west when the incident occurred. NATS has assured us that at no time was safety compromised or the aircraft in danger. Nevertheless, NATS are carrying out a full investigation into the incident as are the Civil Aviation Authority, the Government's safety regulator, in order to establish what happened and what lessons may be learned for the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport at what time on 19 June National Air Traffic Services at Swanwick was first informed that a KLM Fokker 70 aircraft flying from Amsterdam to Bristol was passing over a live Army artillery exercise on Salisbury Plain; and what action they took.  [65198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The incident occurred at 10:30 hrs BST on 19 June. The Fokker 70 was detected by the MOD's Boscombe radar. On detection, Boscombe immediately invoked the Clear Range Procedure to ensure that activity in the Danger Area ceased before the aircraft penetrated the airspace, and informed NATS. As the aircraft was approaching its Bristol destination, and firing in the Danger Areas had been suspended, NATS permitted the aircraft to complete its journey. NATS subsequently initiated a full investigation into the incident which is also being examined by the CAA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Civil/military co-ordination is well established in the UK: major military flying and artillery firing exercises at Army ranges such as those on the Salisbury Plain are pre-planned with involvement from National Air Traffic Services. Such exercises are notified to airspace users by means of Airspace Co-ordination Notices issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA also convey information about the activation

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) for what reason a 95 per cent. public sector guarantee was given to the London Underground PPP; who will finance this guarantee, if invoked; and whether the guarantee constitutes a form of state aid to the PPP;  [65487]

<P>
<a name="20703w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Negotiation of the contracts is a matter for London Underground. However, in general, it is common for the terms of a contract to change as a result of negotiation. Office of Government Commerce guidance states that the principle governing risk transfer is not to transfer all possible risks, but rather to allocate risk to whomever from the public or private sector is able to manage it at least cost. London Transport has sought to act in line with this guidance in the course of its negotiations with bidders for the London Underground PPPs.
<P>

<a name="20703w13.html_para6">I understand the contracts provide that, in certain circumstances where a private sector infrastructure company persistently breaches the contract and no alternative contractor can be found, London Underground can take control of the infrastructure company at a price that allows for 95 per cent. of approved third-party bank and bond debt to be repaid. None of the finance provided by the shareholders would be repaid. London Transport considers these contract provisions to be in line with its aim of optimising value for money overall, balancing the cost of raising finance against the need to provide the private sector

with a strong incentive to meet contractual obligations to improve performance. London Underground's obligations under the PPP contracts will initially be backed by a guarantee from London Regional Transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that fishing for tuna does not endanger the lives of other sea creatures.  [60781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 During the United Kingdom's Presidency of the EU in 1998 we achieved the adoption of a ban on the use of drift nets in the tuna fishery. The ban came into effect on 1 January of this year. We look carefully at information relating to cetacean by catch in various fisheries. Research sponsored by DEFRA into the new designs of trawl nets to allow the escape of marine mammals may have benefits for the tuna trawl fishery in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which organisations which were in receipt of a grant from her in 1997&#150;98 no longer are; what the annual saving is; which organisations which were not in receipt of a grant in 1997&#150;98 now are; and what the annual cost is.  [61394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The aggregate figure for government grants to private organisations and individuals was &#163;28.6 billion in 2000&#150;01 (the last year for which full outturn data is available) compared with &#163;24.8 billion in 1997&#150;98. This includes Lottery grants, but excludes social security payments classified as grants in the national accounts.

[61718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The mandate of the Advisory Committee on Livestock Products is set out in Commission Decision 98/235/EC. The UK is not formally represented on the Committee; members are directly appointed by the Commission, drawn from across the EU, on the basis of their socioeconomic interests.
<P>

<a name="20703w15.html_para0">The Commission, together with member states, is currently conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of comitology committees into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to 'simplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission'. As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February (Com (2001) 783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government has encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be available through its website.

<P>
<a name="20703w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The 'Noise Incidence Study' (NIS) and 'Noise Attitudes Survey' (NAS), are the latest in a time-series of data on the levels of noise, and people's perception of noise.
<P>

<a name="20703w15.html_para1">The key finding from NIS is that the average noise levels measured during the daytime and evening have decreased to some extent.
<P>

<a name="20703w15.html_para2">The environmental (road, rail and air traffic) noise issues identified within NIS and NAS, will be addressed during the development of the National Ambient Noise Strategy currently being developed. Moreover, the highlighted problem of neighbour noise will be jointly targeted with the planned amendments to the Noise Act 1996, which will make it easier for councils to use additional powers to control domestic noise, and with the 'Neighbour Noise Communications Plan'. This will involve the characterisation of both noisemakers and noise sufferers so that a hard-hitting publicity campaign can communicate both how to deal with noise nuisance, and how to avoid creating it.

 The next meeting of the Committee on Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora is on 30 July 2002. The Scottish Executive is not represented on the Committee, or the related Scientific Review Group, as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is not a devolved matter. The July meeting will focus on agreeing a common position on proposals for the next Conference of CITES Parties, which takes place in Santiago, Chile in November. We are currently seeking views from our overseas territories and other interested parties on the merits of these proposals.
<P>

<a name="20703w15.html_para5">The next Scientific Review Group meeting is on 5 September 2002. The UK is represented on the Committee by scientific advisers from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (fauna) and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (flora). The Scientific Review Group was set up to examine scientific questions relating to the implementation of CITES within the EU. The meeting in September is likely to focus on preparations for the next CITES Conference.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what her policy is on the Commission's proposal that there should be a 40 per cent. cut in the EU fishing fleet;  [64538]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will release the funds available from the EU for compensating UK fishermen when they are forced to reduce their effort through tie-ups and a reduction in days at sea.  [64503]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We recognise that EU fleets are too large and that what is needed is a permanent reduction in tonnage. We therefore believe that where further cuts are needed, the priority must be to decommission vessels rather than to tie them up temporarily. If we return to present levels of fishing effort once stocks have recovered, we will simply recreate current problems of overfishing.
<P>

<a name="20703w16.html_para0">We have not yet however had the opportunity to question the Commission about the detail of their calculations. Nonetheless, they have made clear that they do not seek to impose cuts in fleet capacity on Member States. Their figures which detail fleet cuts by Member States are to be taken as purely illustrative. It will be for Member States to decide what measures to introduce in response to the decisions taken by the Council on reducing fishing effort. The scale of decommissioning will also depend on the decisions taken by fishermen in the light of the impact of these measures. Fisheries Departments in the UK have however already been running decommissioning schemes this year and we would want these taken account of in any necessary reductions which are ultimately agreed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to prevent the over-exploitation of fisheries in international waters and in the waters of third countries outside the EU where EU vessels are fishing.  [64507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We shall press for the EU to adopt a more sustainable and responsible approach to international fisheries as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy. In particular we shall be seeking improvements to the way the EU negotiates fishing agreements with third countries, in order to ensure the sustainable management of stocks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she intends to take to prevent the killing of dolphins and porpoises as a by-catch in UK waters.  [64510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Dolphin and porpoise by-catch around the UK occurs in waters where vessels from other member states fish extensively, so action is required at EU level to resolve the problem. This is why I have been pressing the Commission to take action on this issue, particularly now that observations we have commissioned have demonstrated a dolphin by-catch problem in the pair trawl fishery for bass off south-west England. I was pleased to see recently that the Commission proposals for the reform of the CFP refer to the introduction by the end of 2002 of measures to reduce cetacean by-catch. We shall be looking for positive action on this in the course of the reform negotiations: we also intend to continue funding trials of adaptations to fishing gear that could reduce dolphin and porpoise by-catch.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her policy that no public aid will be used for building new vessels and modernising existing ones other than in the case of safety improvements and quality production.  [64504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is already Government policy that grants should not be paid for building new vessels or for modernisation that increases fishing effort. In the UK vessel grants are only paid for the adoption of sustainable catching methods and improvements to the quality of fish on board and working conditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK welcomes the importance placed on improving the quality of scientific advice for fisheries management in the Commission's recent communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy. In particular, we look forward to seeing the detailed action plan due to be published before the end of 2002. At this stage the proposal to develop a European Centre for Fisheries Assessment and Management is a long-term aim, one of many ideas to be explored during the course of the review. We feel confident, however, that the UK's fisheries scientists will continue to play a leading role in improving the quality of scientific advice available to fisheries managers.

<P>
<a name="20703w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2002]:</i> Government guidance on local authority waste targets and how they should plan to achieve them is set out in 'Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies', published by DETR in March 2001. However, it is for local authorities to decide on the nature and timing of any waste disposal contracts. I would expect such contracts to be designed to provide sufficient flexibility to be able to take account of, and respond to, changed circumstances during the lifetime of the contracts, including any future statutory performance standards or new opportunities for increasing recycling and composting. The Government have issued no specific guidance on future targets in the context of the current review of its waste strategy or the revision of the Packaging Directive.

<P>
<a name="20703w17.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> the Association for Communities in Rural England and <i>(b)</i> rural community councils on the subject of the impact of disability legislation on village halls.  [65027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w17.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I have not been asked for such discussions. I am sure that individual rural community councils and their Association, with which I have regular contact, are well aware of the legislation which was put in place some seven years ago. The direct responsibility will be with the owners of specific facilities which will include independent village hall committees or, in some cases, parish or town councils or local authorities.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on what help is being made available to village hall committees to cope with the implications of new disability legislation.  [65026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w17.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The relevant legislation is not new and it is some seven years since the passage of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Time was allowed for organisations to meet the requirements of the Act.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para4">Since December 1996 it has been unlawful for service providers to treat disabled people less favourably for a reason related to their disability. And from 1 October 1999 service providers have been required to make reasonable adjustments to account for disabled people's needs such as providing extra help or changing the way they provide their services.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para5">From 2004 organisations such as village halls will have to make "reasonable adjustments" to ensure access for disabled people. In any proceedings under the Act, the costs and practicability of any adjustments would be considered in relation to a service provider's ability to pay. The extent to which the adjustment actually improves access to the service and the importance of the service to disabled people would also be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para6">A large number of village halls in England already have access and facilities for disabled people although there are older halls that fall short of the requirements of the Act.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para7">There are a number of funds which can assist where appropriate, in addition to the community's own resources, fund raising and any assistance from the parish or town council. Local authorities that can help will include district, county and unitary authorities, depending on the arrangements in a particular locality. The Countryside Agency's Village Hall Loan Fund, administered by Action with Communities in Rural England can provide loans towards improvements for village halls. Loans are available over a period of up to five or eight years but may be longer in special cases where the need for an extended period is substantiated.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para8">The Countryside Agency also can offer assistance to village halls through the community service grants scheme delivered through the Vital Villages programme. 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2002 : Column 377W</I><P>
It can help fund an alteration/extension of a village hall or other community building where this provides a new or extended service to the community.
<P>

<a name="20703w17.html_para9">Other sources of public funding include regional development agencies, the Community Fund and the Sports Council. Many organisations achieve the necessary improvements through a mixture of funds including fund raising, commercial or personal sponsorship, parish council and local authority funding and contributions from other public funds as a result of expanding the activities available if improvements expand the suitability and use of the facilities, for instance for sport, or education or training for young people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Asbestos Prohibitions Regulations 1985 were amended in 1999 to ban the marketing, supply and use of chrysotile from 24 November 1999, with a few limited exceptions where there is no substitute material. Directive 1999/77/EC requires the marketing, supply and use of chrysotile to be completely banned from 1 January 2005. Therefore all derogations/exemptions issued for chrysotile under the 1985 Regulations will cease to apply from that date, apart from a general exemption for research and analysis for all types of asbestos. This Department's policy on the use of chrysotile is in accordance with these legal requirements.

 The UK completed ratification of the Kyoto Protocol with all other EU member states on 31 May. In order for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force, it must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including developed countries accounting for at least 55 per cent. of this industrialised group's emissions in 1990. We hope it will enter into force as soon as possible although in practice this is now unlikely before early 2003. The UK remains committed to the Kyoto Protocol as the framework for taking forward global action to tackle climate change. Our target under Kyoto is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. UK emissions were returned to 1990 levels by 2000 and we are well on course to meet our Kyoto target.

 A partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) was published in the consultation document "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive?" in December 2001. This estimated the net annual cost to the agricultural industry of applying action programme measures as &#163;32 million for the whole country approach and &#163;23 million for the discrete area nitrate vulnerable zone approach.
<P>

<a name="20703w19.html_para0">As the Secretary of State announced on 27 June, the Government have decided to pursue the discrete area nitrate vulnerable zone approach. Since the consultation we have refined the map to identify more precisely the land draining into each nitrate-polluted or eutrophic water. We also published a revised regulatory impact assessment, which reworked the implementation costs for

 The Cabinet Office has no plans to evaluate the impact of 'How to Consult Your Users'. Improving service delivery and policy making through consultation with users continues to be an important priority for the Government. The Office for Public Services Reform works with and encourages Government Departments and public agencies to conduct and act upon customer satisfaction surveys to ensure that the voice of the customer is central to service delivery. The Centre for Management and Policy Studies is also developing a 'consultation toolkit' to help policy makers across Government to consult more effectively on policy. The impact of the Code of Practice on Written Consultation will be evaluated from the end of this year.

Fighting organised crime will be a long and hard struggle. This year, as it was last year, the priority areas for concerted multi-agency effort are extortion, drugs, oils-related fraud, tobacco and alcohol duty evasion and money laundering. In addition, we have added two new strategic priority areas: the trade in counterfeit goods, as this has an on-going potential to affect investment in Northern Ireland; and armed robbery, which is on the increase here, while declining elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

 The FCO continues to work on the implementation of its diversity strategy, "Investing for Tomorrow", a copy of which is in the Library of the House. The strategy was refreshed earlier this year and incorporates duties under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. My right hon.

<a name="20703w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 This Department has taken a close interest in the use made by the Zimbabwe Republic Police of Land Rovers partly funded by HMG. Prior to the general elections in early 2000, we registered our strong concern with the Zimbabwean Home Minister that they were being used for political ends. The lack of a satisfactory response led to the decision taken by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development, to suspend further deliveries in May 2000.

 We share my hon. Friends' concerns over the recent communal violence and deaths in Gujarat. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has been in regular contact with the Governnment of India on the situation in Gujarat, including during his most recent visit to India on 29 May, when he raised this with Mr. Advani, the then Indian Minister for Home Affairs. He raised the case of the four British nationals who were attacked by a mob on 28 February and urged that those responsible be brought to justice. The Government of India have themselves strongly condemned the violence in Gujarat, and have given assurances, which we welcome, that they will take action to bring to justice perpetrators of all the killings and violence. My right hon. Friend has also met the

<a name="20703w22.html_spnew4"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The administrative borders between Poland and Germany were drawn up as part of the Potsdam Agreement in 1945 pending a final delimitation of borders at a peace settlement. No peace settlement was ever concluded. The borders between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany were confirmed by the 1990 Treaty of Final Settlement with Respect to Germany signed by the Allied powers and the then two German states. They were confirmed in bilateral treaties agreed by Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany in November 1990 and June 1991.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July. 2002]:</i> The Secret Intelligence Service carries out its functions under the Intelligence Services Act 1994 under my authority. The Act provides for the Chief of SIS to be appointed by the Secretary of State and imposes a duty on the Chief to ensure that there are arrangements, which I approve, for securing that no information is obtained by SIS except so far as is necessary for the proper discharge of its functions. I can foresee no circumstances in which information could be withheld from Ministers given these statutory responsibilities.

<a name="20703w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]:</i> In so far as the agencies for which I have responsibility undertake interception activities, this is consistent with the requirements of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994. It is not government policy to comment on any intelligence arrangements that might exist between the UK and other countries.

[65651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is a long-standing practice of this Government and previous Administrations not to comment on the activities of the intelligence services. The interception of communications is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner. GCHQ, like any other Government agency empowered to apply for a warrant under the Act, may intercept "external communications" (as defined by the Act) if the conditions required for the issuing of a warrant set out in Sections 5, 8 and 15 and 16 are met.

 On 18 June some KANU MPs called for extension of the current Parliament to allow time for the constitutional review to be completed and for the new constitution to be passed into law before the next general election. An extension would require Parliament to pass a constitutional amendment. To date Parliament has not debated the issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what agreements there are with other states regarding international child abduction by a parent.  [66261]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction seeks to return children who have been abducted abroad to their country of habitual residence, where issues of custody and contact can be resolved through the courts. There are prescribed criteria and processes for returning children under this convention. The Hague Convention is in force between the UK and 54 other countries world wide. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is exploring the possibility of establishing bi-lateral agreements with countries that are not members of the Hague Convention.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Member states of the European Union and the United States are all Parties to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. The Lord Chancellor's Department is the lead Department for cases of child abduction to and from Hague Convention countries. In March 2001, the Special Commission of the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction formally met, as it does every four years. The purpose of the Special Commission is to discuss the operation of the Convention. Representatives from the US attended the Commission, as did all EU member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assistance his Department provides in cases of abduction of a child by one of the parents from the UK to another country.  [66259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Hague Convention is the international instrument covering cases of child abduction. Cases of child abduction involving countries which are party to the Hague Convention are dealt with by the Lord Chancellor's Department in England and Wales. The Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Courts Service deal with their own cases. The FCO can become involved in Hague Convention cases where diplomatic intervention may be of assistance to families.
<P>

<a name="20703w23.html_para0">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the lead Department for cases in countries which are not Party to the Hague Convention. In non-Hague Convention cases, there is no prescribed formula to facilitate the return of an abducted child. Therefore, parents must initiate proceedings in the local courts (and often also in the UK courts) for the return of their child. Consular staff, both in London and at our embassies and high commissions overseas, are able to assist parents in this procedure by, for example, helping them find a local lawyer, arranging welfare visits and attending court hearings as the legal process progresses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20703w23.html_para1">The new protocol on fisheries between the EU and Senegal was initialled by both parties on 25 June. The details of this protocol will not be known until the Commission has made its presentation to member states at the External Fisheries working group in Brussels on 3 and 4 of July, when we shall examine them carefully. We wish to ensure that such agreements take proper account of environmental and developmental concerns, an issue which we have raised before and which we intend to pursue as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the status is of those members of the Convention on the Future of Europe who were appointed by Governments which have subsequently lost office; and if he will list the members of the Convention who were appointed as <i>(a)</i> representatives of 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2002 : Column 400W</I><P>
Governments which have subsequently lost office and <i>(b)</i> representatives of national parliaments who have lost their seats since the Convention's membership was first established, in respect of both (i) the member states and (ii) candidate countries.  [66093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w23.html_spnew5"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 Representatives appointed to the Convention by the governments of Member States and Accession Countries do not have to be members of their governments. It is therefore up to each government whether to keep or replace its representative. There have been four changes of government (France, Portugal, the Netherlands and Hungary) and six elections since the inauguration of the Convention.
<P>

<a name="20703w23.html_para2">The French and Dutch government representatives have so far remained unchanged. Prof Ernani Lopes has succeeded Joao Vallera as the Portuguese government representative, and Laszlo Kovacs has succeeded Janos Martonyi as Hungarian government representative. One parliamentary representative to the Convention has lost his seat, Alain Barrau. It is not yet clear what decision the French Parliament will take.

 The new calculation will allow for 100 per cent. of any contributions to an Inland Revenue approved occupational, or personal pension scheme. The Inland Revenue sets limits on the percentage of income that can be contributed to a pension scheme; these depend on the contributor's earnings and the date they joined the scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2002]:</i> Table A shows the proportion of pension income coming from the state and private sources in each year from 1997&#150;98 to 1999&#150;2000. State pension income corresponds to benefit income as defined in the PI Series. Private pension income corresponds to the sum of occupational pension income and investment income in the PI Series. The percentage figures in Table 1 are derived directly from the average gross income totals in Table 1 of the PI Series (1999&#150;2000).

<P>
<a name="20703w24.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We recognise that direct payments of housing benefit to registered social landlords can be both efficient and convenient. However, it has often been argued that routinely paying benefit to the landlord rather than to the tenant whose entitlement it is, can inhibit tenants' choice and discourage personal responsibility. Therefore, although there are no immediate plans to change the current system, it is an issue that we will continue to keep under close review.

 There are no current plans to do so. However we have taken steps to increase both financial and training flexibilities for employers within the New Deal for Young People. Employers, especially small businesses, taking part in the programme have welcomed this increased flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20703w24.html_para9">Employers have a direct input into the programme through the National Employment Panel. This group (formerly known as the New Deal Task Force) was formed in 1997 to ensure that employers, and other key customers, have a strong and permanent voice within the Department.

<a name="20703w24.html_para10">This co-operative approach has contributed to the success of the New Deal. Nearly 95,000 employers have signed up, half of whom have never participated in an employment programme before. Many more have taken on New Dealers without formally signing up for the programme, and still more have helped to support New Deal in other ways by providing training or advice on the design of the programme.

 The mandate for the Committee for the European Refugee Fund is set out in the Council Decision 2000/596/EC, OJL 252, 6.10.2000, that adopted the programme, and is available in the Library. The Committee meets three times a year on average.
<P>

<a name="20703w25.html_para4">The United Kingdom (UK) representation usually consists of a member of the UK representation to the European Union plus a Home Office official from the Refugee Integration Unit. The Commission refunds travel and subsistence costs for one official from the UK for each Committee meeting. Up to three additional representatives can attend, and their expenses are met from the Home Office subsistence allowance. The purpose of the Committee is to monitor the implementation of the European Refugee Fund across the member states.
<P>

<a name="20703w25.html_para5">The Council decision contains a reporting mechanism under which the Commission evaluates the implementation of the European Refugee Fund and submits a report to the Council and European Parliament.

 The full national asylum support service support package is broadly equivalent to income support. Support for asylum seekers can include fully furnished accommodation.

 36 areas provided bail information schemes to courts in 2001&#150;02, although schemes in some areas will have been targeted at specific courts or court sittings and some courts within those areas will not have benefited from access to a scheme. The National Probation Directorate is currently considering how the overall scope of bail information schemes can be extended to provide courts with greater access to a scheme and to further develop the effectiveness of the bail information process. Work to identify qualitative performance measures will begin later this year.

<P>
<a name="20703w27.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment his Department has made of the likely future level of scientific procedures on animals;  [65081]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) what estimate his Department has made from applications for licences to perform scientific procedures on animals of the level of duplication in such procedures;  [65082]

<P>
(4) what targets his Department has set for reducing the number of scientific procedures performed on animals.  [65079]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is strictly regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is widely regarded as the most rigorous piece of legislation of its type in the world. It offers a high level of protection to animals while recognising the need to use animals in research. It also requires the latest ideas and technology to be taken into account when deciding whether the use of animals is justified.
<P>

<a name="20703w27.html_para3">The licensing system is demand led and the 1986 Act provides no mechanism by which to set absolute limits on the number of animals used. The Act requires that project proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that licences are only granted where the benefits outweigh the costs and where there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed, or refine the procedures to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="20703w27.html_para4">The number of animal procedures carried out reflects the state of science and industry in the United Kingdom and developments in science rather than being an indicator of the effectiveness of the 1986 Act. The Home Office will, however, continue to implement its overall strategy to minimise the numbers of animals used by the rigorous application of the 3Rs.
<P>

<a name="20703w27.html_para5">It is not possible to predict accurately the amount of scientific research and regulatory testing using animals which is likely to take place in future. However, there are indications that in most areas use of conventional animals will continue to decline, but that new molecular biology techniques are opening up new areas of genetic research which will lead to an increase in the use of genetically modified (GM) animals. In addition, new regulatory requirements, for example, the proposed European Union Chemicals Strategy, have the potential to increase the use of animals for human health and safety purposes.
<P>

<a name="20703w27.html_para6">There is no information readily available to indicate the reduction in scientific procedures using animals achieved through sharing of information. The Government believe, however, that sharing of scientific research data is self-evidently in the interests of refining ad avoiding duplication of procedures, and remains committed to promoting such sharing by any practical means. To this end, in August 2000, we announced an inter-departmental concordat on data sharing. The concordat commits United 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2002 : Column 432W</I><P>
Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests. Progress in implementing the concordat is currently under review.
<P>

<a name="20703w27.html_para7">A programme of work involving the use of animals would not be licensed under the 1986 Act if it were known that it would entail unnecessary duplication of earlier work. Apart from some cases where there is need for deliberate replication of earlier work, in order to validate the original findings, we have no evidence that duplication of animal use takes place.

 We have given the courts new secure remand and tagging powers for 12 to 16-year-olds who repeatedly offend on bail. Both started in the 10 street crime priority areas on 22 April. Tagging started in the rest of the country on 1 June 2002 and secure remands will start there on 16 September 2002.

 The Director of High Security Prisons has instructed the governor of Belmarsh, as well as the governors of the other high security prisons, to review the operation of their key management systems including the recently introduced key fob alarm system so as to ensure they prevent the removal of any keys from their prisons. Governors have been asked to report any possible deficiencies in the system, in order to enable required remedial action to be taken as soon as possible.

 The Lord Chancellor wrote to all youth panel chairs in May 1997, encouraging them to scrutinise all request for adjournment by questioning and probing the reasons advanced in support. In response to the call from Government to speed up case management in our courts the Magistrates' Association produced a training course on effective case management entitled "Can We Get On Please". The Youth Court Bench Book issued in September last year to all youth justices includes a section on case management, an adjournment guide and check list.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Decision 183 of the Administrative Commission on social security for migrant workers concerned the interpretation of the provisions of Regulation (EEC) 1408&#150;71 relating to maternity care. Its effect is that health care services required in connection with pregnancy or childbirth shall be regarded as an immediately necessary benefit, provided on the basis of EU Form E111, during a temporary stay in another member state. This applies up to the beginning of the 38 week of pregnancy, provided that the reasons for the

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w30.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is not available in this format as compliance is measured on a trust by trust basis rather than on an individual ward level.
<P>

<a name="20703w30.html_para13">The reasons for measuring at the trust level is because hospital wards generally care for both men and women. To provide the required levels of privacy and dignity for patients, wards are split into single sex bays, or single rooms, or otherwise configured to provide adequate segregation of gender. It is the responsibility of each National Health Service trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements.
<P>

<a name="20703w30.html_para14">The Department has set three objectives which trusts must meet to be deemed compliant. These objectives refer to single sex accommodation and not single sex wards.

<P>
<a name="20703w31.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 All local councils with social services responsibilities have received a share of this grant to improve services for those discharged from hospital. In 2001&#150;2 and 2002&#150;3 we have targeted extra resources on those councils with particularly severe problems in providing the range of services needed, and they have had more challenging targets for reducing delayed discharge. This approach has delivered over 1,000 hospital beds no longer occupied by people awaiting discharge by March 2002.
<P>

<a name="20703w31.html_para0">For the future we intend to legislate to make councils responsible for meeting the costs to the national health service of delayed discharges where councils' intervention could prevent the delay, drawing on the experience of similar approaches in Scandinavia. Local councils that meet their responsibilities in reducing delayed discharges will not be disadvantaged. They will have the money to pay for patients in the NHS if they are delayed inappropriately or in the community if they are discharged appropriately.

 The thirty-two primary care trusts in London along with their social services departments and partner agencies are responsible for planning and commissioning intermediate care services. The local implementation teams for the older peoples national service framework are overseeing this process.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the timescale is of the rehabilitation service review at Ashworth Hospital.  [64620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w31.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The rehabilitation service review was completed in November 2000 and its recommendations have been implemented in stages. The final stage, which brought the terms and conditions of the lecturers in the patient education department into line with the National Health Service, was implemented in December 2001.

<P>
<a name="20703w32.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the cost of allowing the purchase of the prescription pre-payment certificate on a monthly basis at one twelfth of the annual cost; and if he will make a statement.  [64594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 If prescription pre-payment certificates were available on a monthly basis at one twelfth of the current annual cost, the monthly rate would be little more than a single prescription charge, which would be attractive to people on all levels of income. In addition to the costs of collecting the payments and pursuing payment from patients who defaulted on their payments, there would be a considerable loss of charge income and a risk of very significant additional costs to the drugs bill. There would also be additional workloads for doctors if people who currently pay individual prescription charges sought prescriptions for medicines which they currently purchase.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w32.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the cost of including prescription pre-payment certificates within the scope of the health benefits low income scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [64595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The cost would depend on the extent of the reduction in the pre-payment certificate (PPC) fee offered through the national health service low income scheme and the number of people who currently purchase PPCs who sought and were entitled to help in this way. Additionally, there could be a loss of charge income and significant additional costs to the drugs bill if people who currently pay individual charges obtained a PPC via this route for prescriptions for medicines and other items which they currently purchase.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 As a result of wide ranging exemption arrangements in England, around 50 per cent. of the population do not pay prescription charges and around 85 per cent. of prescription items are dispensed free of charge. Financial assistance in paying for medication is available to recipients of income support, income based jobseeker's allowance, many recipients of working families' tax credit and disabled person's tax credit and people who hold a national health scheme low income scheme exemption certificate for full help.

 Nominations for membership of the external reference group (ERG) have been received from a wide range of stakeholders. We will consider these before appointing the group later this year. The multi- disciplinary nature of ERGs is the key to developing national service frameworks that deliver realistic improvements in services so members of the group are expected to be drawn from health and social care professionals and managers, service users and carers, voluntary organisations and representatives from other partner agencies.

 Following up its 2000 report 'Fully Equipped', the Audit Commission published 'Fully Equipped 2002' on 27 June 2002. The latter recognises the steps the Government took in response to the first. As an initial response to the new report, I am asking the national support team for the integration of community equipment services to review its action plan in the light of the Commission's recommendations and to produce commissioning guidelines for community equipment services by the autumn. Since the first report was issued the process of modernising hearing aid services has progressed to the point that about a third of the country will be benefiting from a modernised service, including the provision of digital hearing aids, by the end of this financial year. Work is also underway to spread good practice across the country's wheelchair services.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> Ministers last met to discuss child and adolescent mental health services at a bi-lateral ministerial meeting on 6 February. The main focus of provision is the ongoing programme to improve the availability and quality of child and adolescent mental health services in accordance with the national development strategy, backed by &#163;85 million of targeted funding, 1999- 2002. The aim is for all local services to be able to respond appropriately to the range of mental health demands from young people, including those arising within the youth justice system, for example through the work of youth offending teams. Good progress is also being made to provide (by means of conversion of an existing facility) a new 24-bedded unit for young people with severe mental health problems requiring treatment in conditions of security. This is part of new arrangements for the national commissioning of adolescent forensic mental health services, including also central revenue support for the two existing national health service units and the assessment of further requirements for secure places. Mental health provision for young offenders will also be considered under the relevant strand of the planned children's national service framework on which work has recently started.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> The mental health care group work force team has set up a sub-group on recruitment and retention. The purpose of the sub-group is to encourage more people to work in mental health.
<P>

<a name="20703w34.html_para1">We also encourage medical staff to develop more rounded experience, and include an element of psychiatry in their training. Psychiatry is already a core part of the training of trainee doctors. The requirements for the new social work qualification, being introduced in 2003, requires students to undertake specific learning and assessment in a number of key areas including mental health.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]:</i> The franchise plan for Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals National Health Service Trust does not make any commitment to extra staff and beds. The plan makes proposals for improving recruitment at the trust to ensure existing vacancies are filled. It also states that a review of the provision of services between the two sites will take place to ensure resources are used effectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20703w34.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]:</i> The merger of Ashford and St. Peter's hospitals in 1998 to create the Ashford and St. Peter's hospitals national health service trust provided an opportunity to review clinical service provision between the two hospitals. This was necessary to ensure the safe delivery of services in the light of internal and external priorities, such as junior doctors' hours, increasing sub-specialisation and clinical governance. For this reason the decision was taken, after public consultation, to treat all surgical and trauma emergencies at St. Peter's hospital and maintain an emergency unit at Ashford hospital. This came into effect on 2 October 2000.
