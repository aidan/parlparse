<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission (1) whether all statutory health and safety standards are applied throughout the Parliamentary Estate; and whether all manual workers on the Parliamentary Estate have been fully trained in health and safety legislation;  [121592]
<P>
<UL>(2) when the last full health and safety audit of the Parliamentary Estate was carried out; where hon. Members may inspect it; and when the next audit is due.  [121593]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew0"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the regulations made under it do not in terms apply to the House. The Commission nevertheless attaches great importance to applying both the spirit and practice of the legislation. The House employs qualified health and safety specialists, and seeks to ensure full compliance with the law and industry best practice. All directly-employed works manual staff are required to undertake wide-ranging health and safety training including manual handling, risk assessment, control of substances hazardous to health and emergency first aid training. Contractors' staff are required to be competent individuals, who must work in accordance with a health and safety action plan. This plan is based on a formal risk assessment which is carried out for each project.
<P>

<a name="30630w01.html_para0">Statutory health and safety standards are met through a 10-year rolling programme which includes cyclical maintenance, inspections, surveys and audits. Health and safety audits using the RoSPA Quality Safety Audit method were carried out in the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate and in the Refreshment Department in 2001. Currently an audit of the Serjeant's Departmental Safety Action Plan is being carried out. Copies of these audits are available for inspection from the Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service in 7 Millbank.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the responses the Government has received to The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: Northern Ireland consultation document.  [121925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We have received approximately 300 responses to the consultation concerning Northern Ireland and about 140,000 responses from across the 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 2003 : Column 2W</I><P>
UK. We will analyse all responses carefully and set out our conclusions in the Air Transport White Paper later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action he has taken to implement the principle enunciated in the 1998 Transport White Paper that aviation should meet the external, including environmental, costs it imposes.  [122775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Following the announcement made in the 2002 Pre-Budget Report, the Government has issued a discussion document and held a series of workshops with stakeholders to consider the most effective economic instruments for ensuring that aviation meets its external costs, including environmental costs. The Government will set out its views in the forthcoming Air Transport White Paper. The Government strongly supports further action at the international level to tackle the contribution of aircraft emissions to climate change, and we are working within ICAO and the EU to achieve this. At the local level differential charges related to aircraft noise already exists at BAA's London airports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what responsibility Metronet had for the recent replacement of bolts and brackets on Central Line trains; how much they received; and what the total programme cost.  [121886]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The bulk of the modification work was carried out by Infraco BCV, when it was a wholly owned subsidiary of London Underground Ltd. (LUL). Its ownership transferred to Metronet on 4 April 2003. Metronet Rail BCV will be paid for completing the remaining modification work, with the costs involved subject to discussion between LUL and Metronet. LUL report that, due to the intensive workload and the focus on reinstating a safe train service, the final costs are still being calculated.

<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The current driving licence application form has been subject to detailed research to ensure ease of completion. Time to complete the form will depend on individual circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30630w01.html_para1">In 2002&#150;03 the DVLA's targets required that 95 per cent. of applications for normal vocational and first driving licences should be delivered to the driver within eight working days and 95 per cent. of other licence types within 10 working days. These targets were met in full for the six million photocard licences issued.
<P>

<a name="30630w01.html_para2">Targets for 2003&#150;04 have been tightened to require 98 per cent. of licences to be issued within the same timescale.
<P>

<a name="30630w01.html_para3">Applications requiring background checks into health or identity can take longer. Customers can expect to receive licences within 15 working days.

<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment he has made of the potential impact of proposals under consideration by the Council of Ministers to increase the limits on flying hours;  [121846]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the effects of pilot fatigue on aircraft accidents.  [121847]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has reviewed the European Parliament's proposed flight time limitations (FTL) requirements. They advise me that, while the requirements are not totally acceptable, with suitable amendment they could form a baseline European FTL requirement which could be supplemented by additional requirements in each member state. We recognise the need for FTL requirements to be harmonised at a European level and should the proposal come before the Council we will work constructively with other member states to ensure that it is appropriately amended. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will not endorse the proposal if any of the limits are significantly different to those set by the CAA in CAP 371, which are in line with scientific advice that the CAA has received over the years.
<P>

<a name="30630w01.html_para4">The CAA reviews all fatal accidents to large aircraft, both within the UK and abroad. Causal factors, contributory factors and consequences are analysed. In analysis of over 900 fatal accidents, crew fatigue has been identified as a possible secondary causal factor in 20 cases. None of these involved a UK registered or operated aircraft.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps are being taken to ensure that pollution on the London Underground does not exceed statutory levels.  [122184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 London Underground Ltd. (LUL) has consulted the Government's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) on this issue. COMEAP's advice is that statutory levels do not apply to the Underground. Nevertheless I understand from LUL that dust levels are many times lower than the statutory occupational exposure limits for various forms of dust, set by the Health and Safety Executive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what his policy is on the use of self-employed transport managers under <i>(a)</i> the Goods Vehicle Licensing of Operators Act 1995 and <i>(b)</i> EU directive 96/26.  [122313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 and Directive 96/26/EC require the holders of Standard National and International goods vehicle operators' licences to be professionally competent or to have a transport manager. A transport manager is an individual who is in, or who is engaged to be in, the employment of the licence holder and who has continuous and effective responsibility for the management of the transport operations. Transport managers must be professionally competent and of good repute.
<P>

<a name="30630w02.html_para0">The statutorily independent Traffic Commissioners are solely responsible for administering the goods operator licensing system. It is for them to decide if a nominated transport manager meets the requirements of the law, based on the individual circumstances of each operator.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what facilities are available at Stansted airport for the assistance and support of <i>(a)</i> disabled and <i>(b)</i> elderly members of the public; what information about such facilities is disseminated, and to whom; and what plans there are to improve assistance to disabled and elderly people at Stansted airport.  [121833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Facilities and procedures at United Kingdom airports for assisting travellers with special needs should comply with the standards set in my Department's Code of Practice on Access to Air Travel for Disabled People, published in March. I have asked BAA plc to write to my hon. and learned Friend with details of the facilities available at Stansted.
<P>

<a name="30630w02.html_para1">Information on facilities at Stansted can be obtained from the BAA Stansted website, the main airport telephone number and staff on duty at the airport. The Uttlesford District Council Access Group offers advice to travellers through its regular newsletters, and carries out an annual audit of the airport's special needs facilities, in addition to BAA's own internal access audit. I understand that all new facilities at BAA airports are designed in accordance with standards which take into account travellers with special needs.

<P>
<a name="30630w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Tunnel Cleaning Train (TCT) was taken out of service last autumn, due to safety issues related to its age. The TCT has been problematic ever since it was introduced, because it was built using old (1938) rolling stock. Tube lines are now responsible for this train and are considering options for its repair or replacement or alternative ways of cleaning the tunnels. In the meantime, I understand that manual cleaning using standard industrial vacuum cleaners continues, that dust levels in the tunnels and stations are monitored, and that they have not changed as a result of the TCT not being in use.

 DVLA expects to handle some 40 million application forms for vehicle excise duty in 2003&#150;04. Around 30 million of those require only the applicant to indicate the period of licence, sign and date the form and take minimal time to complete. A different form is required where there has been a recent change of circumstance and completion is estimated to take several minutes.

The purpose is to deliver broad generic capabilities which allow the UK to respond effectively to a wide range of disruptive challenges.
<P>

<a name="30630w03.html_para2">The Home Office assumed responsibility for the initial assessment of the mass fatalities resilience work in late 2002. Prior to this, work was carried out on fatalities but was judged not to necessitate a specific project and was incorporated in other resilience work. All expenditure in 2002&#150;03 is therefore additional. In 2002&#150;03 &#163;15,000 has been used researching the preparedness of the emergency services. &#163;65,000 has been provided for work on a temporary facility (organised by GOLondon) at Northolt Airport and is to be spent in 2003&#150;04. Further to this spending any additional money for the current financial year will not be known until the completion of the initial assessment work. The central expenditure excludes all the related work under way in local authorities.

<P>

<a name="30630w05.html_para0">The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) is committed to tackling the problem of work-related violence. In March 2000 HSC embarked on a three year programme to help employers, including those in the public sector, to tackle this problem, with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of violence at work. So far the programme has resulted in the publication of

<P><I>30 Jun 2003 : Column 16W</I><P>
new guidance specifically aimed at small businesses; the development of new National Occupational Standards on work-related violence; a programme of inspections in the health care sector; and new research to establish good practice for lone workers, including those in the public sector.

<P>
<a name="30630w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) must be completed for all policy proposals that have a potential impact on businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. It includes details of the arrangements for monitoring and evaluating policy proposals.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30630w05.html_para3">From this year the National Audit Office (NAO) has a new role in independently evaluating a selection of RIAs.

<P>

<a name="30630w05.html_para4">The NAO review will focus on the quality of analysis in the RIAs and the thoroughness with which the RIAs have been undertaken. The findings and recommendations of best practice will be fed back to departments. It will play a valuable part in driving up standards of RIAs.

 Only one of the Home Office sponsored bodies, the Security Industry Authority, has a specific reference to sustainable development built into the Board's Code of Practice. However, the remits of most of the other bodies do make a positive contribution towards the social progress element of sustainable development. Agencies and Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are also required to either follow the Department's Greening Operations Policy or to develop their own.

<a name="30630w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The EU Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism, which was agreed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of December 2001, requires all member states to introduce rigorous common terrorist offences and penalties. As a result, specific anti-terrorism legislation has to be introduced in those EU member states that did not have such measures in place. The United Kingdom, which already has specific strong counter-terrorism legislation, fully supported the framework decision. We believe it is vital to ensure that the EU has a co-ordinated, robust response to terrorism.

 Ministers recently met and talked with over 2000 primary headteachers at conferences across the country. They shared our ambitions for raising standards but asked us to consider how we could help to motivate them and their staff to achieve improved pupil performance.
<P>

<a name="30630w06.html_para0">We agree with them that primary schools should have targets which are not only stretching, but realistic and signed up to by everyone in the school. Targets in literacy and numeracy provide a clear focus for what we need to achieve. All children who have the potential to do so should achieve Level 4 in English and maths at age 11. Our document 'Excellence and Enjoyment: a strategy for primary schools' published in May announced that in future schools will be empowered to set their own challenging but appropriate targets for individual pupils at age 11.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The introduction of teacher training bursaries from September 2000 played a major part in reversing an eight-year trend of declining recruitment to courses of initial teacher training at institutions in England. Since 1999/2000, the number of entrants to courses leading to the Postgraduate Certificate in Education has increased by 34 per cent. to 23,441, a record level. In the same period, the numbers of science and mathematics graduates entering teacher training have risen by 21 per cent. and 38 per cent. respectively. Figures published on 4 June by the Graduate teacher Training Registry showed applications from graduates to train as teachers in 2003/04 running 16 per cent. above their level at the same time last year. My right hon. Friend has no present plans to extend eligibility for the training bursaries.

 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]:</i> 'Young Voices' is not a Connexions produced publication. It is an independent magazine and is an off-shoot of 'The Voice', a magazine targeted at members of the black community.

<a name="30630w06.html_para1">'The Voice' and 'Young Voices' are published by Vee Tee Ay (Media Resources) Co Ltd. 'The Voice' is an independent, weekly publication established in 1992. It has an audited publication of c. 34,000, and a cover price of &#163;0.75.

 Comparable UN estimates for forest cover in Africa are available for 1990 and 2000. Forest cover fell from almost 24 per cent. of total land surface to just under 22 per cent., a net loss of 0.8 per cent. or 5.2 million ha a year (a loss roughly equivalent to the size of France annually). There were particularly high rates of loss of mangrove forests and in Cote d'Ivoire and Congo of natural forest.
<P>

<a name="30630w06.html_para3">Estimates of forest cover are available for 1980 and 1975 (25 per cent. in 1980 and between 17 per cent. and 33 per cent. of land area in 1975), but are not truly comparable as <i>(a)</i> they are based on different definitions of forest cover and <i>(b)</i> the assessment methods used in 1975 were neither accurate nor complete.
<P>

<a name="30630w06.html_para4">Deforestation between 1990 and 2000 was higher in Africa than in Asia. This is because 62 per cent. of Asia forest cover is now plantation, and this has compensated for loss of natural forest, whereas in Africa only 4 per cent. is plantation.
<P>

<a name="30630w06.html_para5">While "deforestation rate" is one official indicator for measuring success or failure of Millennium Development Goal 7 it is an imperfect one that hides differential impacts on poor people and does not capture the underlying causes of reducing forest cover&#151;population growth, trade (including trade in illegal timber), macro-economic policies, weak governance, unclear access rights and conflict.

<P>
<a name="30630w06.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We recognise that there is a risk to the fish stocks of African coastal states and that the activities of European fishing vessels, supported by EC negotiated access agreements, could be contributing to this.

 Kenya is a major supplier of cut flowers both to the UK and European markets. Exporting firms operate under Codes of Practice or Standards agreed with buyers from these markets.

 A number of means already exist to facilitate effective co-operation between the sports administrators of the four home nations. At ministerial level, there is the Sports Cabinet, which is responsible for identifying strategic priorities and brings together Sports Ministers from the four parts of the UK and others closely involved in the development of UK sport. The membership comprises the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who chairs it, and the Home Country Ministers with responsibility for sport. I represent England. The Chairs of the Home Country Sports Councils also attend in the capacity as observers to hear discussions where appropriate. The Cabinet meets on average twice a year.
<P>

<a name="30630w09.html_para6">The Chairs of the Home Country Sports Councils are also Council members of UK Sport. UK Sport takes the lead in co-ordinating activities between home country sports councils and sport administrators working in high performance sport. UK Sport hosts regular meetings of the Chief Officers' Group, lead officers in performance, modernisation and on issues of ethics and equity. In addition, UK Sport has convened a 'Performance Forum', involving home country sports councils, the sports institutes from the home countries and representatives of national governing bodies of sport. This complements the work of the 'leadership group' which includes the directors and chairs of the four home country sports institutes, alongside representatives of UK Sport and which was established to help co-ordinate work across the UK Sports Institute network.

<P>
<a name="30630w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Army Training and Recruiting Agency's (ATRA) secondary healthcare initiative was formally introduced on 1 April 2001 and remains in operation. Personnel eligible for treatment under the scheme are ATRA trainers or trainees referred by their unit General Practitioner for investigation, opinion and/or treatment for a condition which is preventing them from continuing with their employment or training. Personnel are referred only when lengthy waiting times occur at the local Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit or 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 2003 : Column 39W</I><P>
NHS hospital. The initiative has proved successful in reducing the average waiting time for both consultation and treatment, enabling trainers and trainees to return to work or training more quickly. The scheme is kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="30630w11.html_para0">The Waiting List Initiative and the Rapid Treatment Initiative were schemes run by the then Defence Secondary Care Agency in 2000&#150;01 and January 2002 respectively. Some 2000 referrals were made under the two schemes, which were successful in treating personnel more quickly than would otherwise have been possible and in returning many of them to full fitness. Experience gained from these two initiatives will be relevant to further fast-track treatment initiatives in the future.

<a name="30630w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Exercise Dimming Sun 03 was a joint UK/US Grade A defence nuclear accident response exercise. It is not possible to disaggregate the costs of the exercise as the majority lie where they fall, and are not charged specifically to an exercise budget as participants are carrying out duties to which they are already assigned in their command structure. The exercise took place in Norfolk over the period 16 to 20 June 2003, and was co-sponsored by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and the United States Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Exercise play was also conducted at the MOD Headquarters Nuclear Accident Response Organisation in London, the US Embassy in London and by US Government officials in Washington. The exercise scenario simulated the crash in Norfolk of a US Air Force aircraft, carrying a cargo of unarmed nuclear weapons. UK and US units participated in the exercise and responded to the incident, as well as other Government Departments, agencies, civil emergency services and local authorities. A copy of the All Agency Report on this exercise will be placed in the Library of the House as soon as it is completed. It will not be posted on the Departmental web site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It was decided to purchase Sonar 2087 in order to protect against modern, quieter nuclear and conventionally powered submarines. The system is designed to detect, classify, localise and track a hostile submarine while remaining outside its firing range. The number of ship sets to be purchased takes into account such considerations as the threat assessment, budgetary priorities and platform availability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his Answer of 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 292W, on Heathrow, (1) what assessment has been made of the future status of RAF Northolt if flying activity there were to cease; [122166]

<P>
<a name="30630w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As no decision has yet been made on the possibility of a third runway at Heathrow, it would be premature to assess the future status of RAF Northolt or the alternative airfields that might be available if flying activity were to cease there.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w12.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Randall: </B>

<a name="30630w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 RAF Northolt is home to 32 (The Royal) Squadron, part of the Ministry of Defence Communications Fleet, which is established for the support of military and Government communications tasks in times of crisis and war. It provides a rapid and secure method of transport for key personnel in pursuit of urgent defence tasks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Given the size of the Defence estate and the number of buildings and other facilities on it, it is difficult to define what constitutes "refurbishment". Work on buildings can range from minor modifications and maintenance, to the complete restoration of listed buildings, and the maintenance of machinery such as lifts. While information on individual contracts is available, it is currently not held centrally or on a consistent basis could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The proposed changes would not affect claims from those currently eligible under the War Pension Scheme, or from those whose conditions arose before the introduction of the new scheme. The review team's evaluation of the changes proposed for the new scheme looked at the combined effect on a future cohort of claimants of those changes (including arrangements for time-limits and review for deterioration, as well as standard of proof) as against the combined provisions of the two existing schemes&#151;the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. Its primary concern was whether, overall, the new arrangements would ensure eligibility for those claimants whose conditions might reasonably be regarded as attributable to service and whether the level of provision was appropriate to the pain and suffering incurred and to the expected effect on earnings capacity. It also looked at the overall budgetary implications for the Department. It did not consider the specific effect on numbers of the change to standard of proof. The important issue was the overall effect for those with a reasonable claim rather than the effect of one isolated aspect. The review team's conclusions were that its proposals would provide fairer, more comprehensible and administratively more simple arrangements with a better focus on those whose earning capacity has been significantly affected. As indicated, decisions on claims would be subject to an independent tribunal. The review team expects its proposals to be broadly cost neutral.

 The Government is not convinced that removing stamp duty for first-time buyers is the best way to assist those on the bottom rung of the housing ladder. Indeed it might actually fuel house price inflation and make property less affordable for first-time buyers. Continuing stability through the Government's policies, and in particular, continuing low interest rates, have been effective in helping people to be able to afford their own home. As such there are no plans to remove stamp duty for first-time buyers.

With the introduction of the Renewables Obligation, it is important that electricity consumers are given clear information about "green" electricity schemes. Both the industry regulator, Ofgem, and Energywatch, the statutory consumer body for the industry, have parts to play in this area. In April 2002, Ofgem issued guidance for those offering green tariffs, aimed to ensure that they genuinely involve the purchase of renewable energy beyond what suppliers would purchase in any case to meet the requirements of the Renewables Obligation.

The OGC's 'gateway process' offers a highly relevant straightforward way to ensure that government clients are helped through the procurement process at all stages and that the principles of Rethinking Construction underpin this. The Forum congratulates OGC for taking the lead in this way."

<i>Note:</i><P>

1. The basic state pension is uprated annually each April based on the increase in the retail price index from September to September. The real value of the basic state pension has been calculated using the increase in the retail price index from April to April. This inevitably means that the percentage change shows small increases and reductions that would not otherwise appear if the same RPI period is used for both figures. These small variations do not affect pensioner living standards as any differences in inflation are automatically adjusted in the following year's uprating.<P>

2. Information about pensioner incomes is taken from the pensioner income series 2001&#150;02, table 1(ii), page 32. This series is designed to provide a broad overall picture of patterns and trends in pensioners' income, and is not appropriate for measuring year-on-year changes because such comparisons are not statistically reliable<P>

3. Pensioner incomes prior to 1994 are not available on a consistent basis<P>

4. Pensioner incomes shown are mean net income of single pensioners and pensioner couples before housing costs in April 2003&#150;04 price terms<P>

 The Education and Library Boards support pupils with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a range of methods. Provision may include classroom assistance, support from ASD Advisory Officers or peripatetic teachers. This teaching provision may include aspects of Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), along with other interventions, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Children and those with related Communications Handicaps (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).

<a name="30630w23.html_para5">It is not, therefore, possible to quantify the number of children with an ASD who have been taught using ABA techniques in any given Education and Library Board area.

In the SELB there have been two cases where an ABA Programme has been requested but other ASD-specific provision has been made, tailored to the individual needs of the child. In the BELB area, offers of financial support towards the cost of an ABA Programme have been made in another three cases. In one case this offer has been rejected, in the other two, negotiations are ongoing.

<a name="30630w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Juvenile Justice Centre at Lisnevin, Millisle, County Down will close by the end of August 2003 following the transfer of the children during that month to the newly refurbished accommodation in Bangor. Ultimately, the closure of Lisnevin is dependent on ensuring the provision of safe and secure accommodation, and appropriate facilities and staffing levels at the centre in Bangor. While this has taken longer than originally anticipated because of the complexity of the refurbishment exercise, the additional time is being used to good effect in ensuring that these necessary arrangements are in place.
<P>

<a name="30630w25.html_para1">Since November 2000, there have been 695 admissions to Lisnevin.

 Physical Education is compulsory within the Northern Ireland curriculum for all pupils from age 4 to 16 and this shows the degree of importance which is attached to the subject. It is essential that pupils develop an understanding of the importance of physical activity to a healthy lifestyle in later life. Schools themselves determine how much time is devoted to PE in the curriculum, but they have been encouraged to give pupils at least two hours PE per week. The PE Programme of Study is also flexible enough to enable teachers to adjust the activities available to cater for developing the particular sporting interests of all pupils and so make the subject enjoyable for them. The Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) is currently carrying out a review of the curriculum, and PE is being considered as part of this review.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much council tax was uncollected for the London boroughs at the latest date for which figures are available on <i>(a)</i> a cash basis and <i>(b)</i> a percentage basis.  [121778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Reliable figures for uncollected council taxes are not currently available for London boroughs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that council tax arrears for England as a whole totalled &#163;1.5 billion at 31 March this year. This represents about 1.4 per cent. of the sum of the amounts due for each financial year since the tax was introduced in 1993.
<P>

<a name="30630w27.html_para1">Figures for 2002&#150;03 council taxes that had not been collected by 31 March 2003 are, however, available at an individual local authority level. Amounts uncollected by London boroughs by 31 March 2003 totalled &#163;127 million, or 6.0 per cent. of the amounts due.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is already a discount disregard for a person who goes into a care home or hospital and is not expected to return to the home which was their sole or main residence. In addition Clause 77 of the Local Government Bill will provide a new discretionary power for billing authorities to reduce the amount of council tax payable in particular cases or for a class of case. This could include offering the current 25 per cent. single person discount to couples where one of them was unable to live in the home due to illness or other reasons.

 Withholding of all or part of the council tax due is unlawful and could affect authorities' revenue flows which could in due course lead to higher council tax bills, a reduction in services or both. The Office of the Deputy of Prime Minister has received a few letters from members of the public indicating that they are refusing to pay all or part of this year's council tax. Records of correspondence received do not differentiate such cases from other correspondence on council tax. A precise figure could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 Housing associations are independent organisations whose boards are responsible for ensuring that their organisations are financially strong and flexible enough to operate in different markets and meet the needs of tenants.

<P>

<a name="30630w28.html_para1">Housing associations may themselves come to the conclusion that merger or rationalisation of their operations is in their organisation's and their tenants' interests. A number of them have already done this or are doing so, particularly where the effectiveness of neighbourhood management is inhibited by the presence of a large number of social landlords. The Housing Corporation, as regulator of housing associations, encourages and enables those who wish to pursue this route to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w28.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The regulation of housing associations is the responsibility of the Housing Corporation, an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Housing Corporation's regulatory code sets out minimum requirements for housing associations across a range of functions, including the management of properties. The Housing Corporation's regulation teams are responsible for ensuring these requirements are met and, where possible, exceeded.
<P>

<a name="30630w28.html_para2">The Housing Corporation introduced inspection as an important part of its range of regulatory activities in 2002. In April 2003, inspection of housing associations was transferred to a single social housing inspectorate at the Audit Commission, which was already responsible for the inspection of local authority housing services. The Housing Inspectorate is working with the Housing Corporation to drive up standards of service to tenants of housing associations.
<P>

<a name="30630w28.html_para3">There is a annual programme of inspections which is published by the Audit Commission.
<P>

<a name="30630w28.html_para4">Where the Audit Commission finds that standards of service to housing association tenants do not meet those set out in the Housing Corporation's Regulatory Code, the Corporation ensures that associations take action to bring about improvements, including using its statutory powers if necessary.

 There is no statutory requirement for local authorities to offer surplus land or property back to the original owner when a project is cancelled. They are, however, commended to follow the Crichel Down Rules which are non-statutory guidance primarily addressed to Government Departments, which specify that land that has been acquired compulsorily or under threat of compulsion and is no longer needed by the acquiring body should be offered back to the original owner at its current market value.

 Additional internal retail floorspace does not normally require planning permission as it is not regarded as development. Where a maximum floorspace is specified in a planning permission, the provision of additional floorspace, even as a mezzanine floor, is likely to require consent, and, if built without consent, could result in enforcement action for its removal. The forthcoming revised PPG6 ("Town Centres and Retail Developments") will provide advice to local planning authorities on this matter. There are no plans to amend planning law to this effect.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what factors underlay his decision to extend the right to buy discount repayment period to five years.  [122326]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w29.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Government's draft Housing Bill, published on 31 March 2003, proposes that the period during which people who have bought their homes under the Right to Buy scheme may be required to repay their discount if they choose to resell should be extended from three years to five years, and that the amount to be repaid should be linked to the resale value of the property less the value of any improvements made by the owner after exercising his Right to Buy.
<P>

<a name="30630w29.html_para6">The Government are concerned that the Right to Buy rules are being exploited by companies seeking to redirect public subsidy for their own profit, and that this is adversely affecting the availability of affordable housing in some areas. There is strong evidence that some companies offer tenants financial help to buy their homes on condition that they resell them to the company after the three-year discount repayment period has ended ('deferred resale' arrangements). The companies thus acquire former social homes at substantially less than their market value, and rent them out. This means that homes formerly available at subsidised social rents then command substantially higher market rents, reducing the availability of affordable housing. Research by Heriot-Watt University, published in May 2003, has demonstrated that such exploitation is prevalent in Inner London, where around 2,000 ex-council homes are now privately rented. The aim of the measures in the Housing Bill is therefore to make deferred resale arrangements less financially attractive.

 In December 2001 we published the findings of research into the opportunities and demand for water-based sport and recreation.

The associated Environmental Impact Assessment accordingly considered its potential effects on marine mammals in the conditions in which it might be used, rather than in the specific context of UK territorial waters. The assessment, which we are updating continuously as necessary, indicates that the sonar has the potential to be harmful to marine mammals. It forms the basis for the development of a range of operating measures to minimise the danger of such impact.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, what assessment the Lord Chancellor has made of the need to review legal aid for personal injury claims where a provider of legal services on a contingent fee basis has gone out of business through insolvency.  [121285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 No assessment has been made. The Access to Justice Act 1999 removed negligently caused personal injury claims from the scope of legal aid. This was done because of the availability of conditional fee agreements (CFAs) and meant that the limited public funds available for legal aid could be better targeted on priority areas of law. CFAs have proved successful as a means of bringing personal injury actions, and this remains the case. The demise of one provider would not prevent people with genuine claims obtaining access to justice. They can do so either by approaching solicitors' firms who deal with such claims or accident intermediaries. The Government believe the personal injury market is able to absorb the loss of individual organisations because there is a strong network of CFA providers.

 A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) must be completed for all policy proposals that have a potential impact on businesses, charities or the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="30630w32.html_para5">Information on the number of RIAs that have been reviewed in respect of the Department in the last year is not held and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30630w32.html_para6">From this year the National Audit Office (NAO) has a new role independently to evaluate a selection of RIAs. In their Annual Report, published in February 2003, the Better Regulation Task Force put forward suggestions of RIAs for the NAO to review.
<P>

<a name="30630w32.html_para7">The NAO review will focus on the quality of analysis in the RIAs and the thoroughness with which the RIAs have been undertaken. The findings and recommendations of best practice will be fed back to departments. It will play a valuable part in driving up standards of RIAs.

To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs if he will make it his policy to include a sunset clause in all new legislation unless a specific case can be made to exclude a sunset clause.  [120834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The revised RIA guidance, "Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment", was published on 28 January 2003. It advises policy officials to consider time limits or sunset provision at an early stage of policy development and gives specific examples of where such provisions may be appropriate. The Department for Constitutional Affairs actively promotes the better regulation agenda and the use of sunset provision where they are appropriate.

 The Lord Chancellor acts as Visitor to a number of universities. In some cases he is acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen; in others by virtue of his office.
<P>

<a name="30630w33.html_para0">The Visitor may participate in ceremonial occasions and may be called upon to give advice where a university expresses doubt as to its powers under its charter and statutes. However, the most important duty of the Visitor is to determine all disputes arising between the university and its members, other than those concerning the employment or appointment, or termination of employment or appointment, of a member of the academic staff.
<P>

<a name="30630w33.html_para1">No changes have been made to the arrangements for carrying out the Lord Chancellor's duties as Visitor. However, the Government's White Paper "The Future of Higher Education" proposed that an independent adjudicator should be established by legislation to

<a name="30630w33.html_para2">In the year preceding CAFCASS's launch, a total of &#163;10.2 million was spent on set up costs of the new organisation; this included capital expenditure of &#163;7.7 million. Over &#163;5 million of this total was spent on an IT service.

<a name="30630w33.html_para3">CAFCASS has over 100 stand-alone legacy case recording systems, inherited from the three different services unified under CAFCASS. On the legacy systems, each case data item is only entered into one of these systems; no interface exists from these to other systems such as management information or financial systems.
<P>

<a name="30630w33.html_para4">The original project for a case management system was suspended as it was deemed to be too high risk. CAFCASS is now planning a simpler and more cost effective case recording system and this has been independently verified as a more effective approach.
<P>

<a name="30630w33.html_para5">CAFCASS are currently tendering for a supplier to provide the new integrated case recording system. Until that process is completed CAFCASS will not be able to assess the full costs. However, it is expected that the costs will, over a three-year period, be less than the costs of maintaining the existing legacy systems. A user group as been set up to review requirements and supplier proposals prior to selection of the successful tender. CAFCASS hopes to pilot the system later this year and introduce it from 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the finding of the recent NAO report "A Safer Place to Work" that there is a significant disparity between the number of accidents logged in NHS trust accident and emergency reporting systems and the figures provided by trusts to the Department of Health.

 The National Audit Office (NAO) reported a 36 per cent. difference between data provided to the Department of Health by national health service trusts human resources departments and that from the health and safety leads.
<P>

<a name="30630w34.html_para0">NHS trusts accident and reporting systems are generally managed by human resources departments and are primarily concerned with data collection on accidents in relation to sickness absence. Trusts' health and safety leads collect data that are reportable under the "Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations" (RIDDOR) and "The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health" (COSHH) which require accidents to be reported only if they result in three days or more absence from work. The Department believes that this accounts for much of the difference in figures reported to the NAO.

The figures for 2002&#150;03 were 40 CT scanners (17 additional and 23 replacement), 11 MRI scanners (seven additional and four replacement) and 17 linear accelerators (four additional and 13 replacement). The aim of this investment is to increase capacity in diagnostic services and begin to tackle inequalities in access to radiotherapy services. Each scanner will provide improved access to diagnostic imaging services to all patients, though the impact of the extra capacity in terms of waiting times will depend on local circumstances. The investment in linear accelerators will make available to patients the latest treatment technology.

 14 regional Civil Contingencies Reaction Forces (CCRFs), 500 strong and drawn from the Armed Forces Reserve, are currently being formed by the Ministry of Defence. Formation of these units was an important conclusion of the work undertaken last year on "A New Chapter of the Strategic Defence Review" (cm 5566, dated July 2002). The CCRFs are expected to be fully ready by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="30630w35.html_para3">The Department of Health, along with many other Departments and agencies, worked with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on the development of the New Chapter. Once formed, the CCRFs could be made available to provide support to the national health service, during an emergency, under normal crisis management arrangements. They would remain under military command, but would work under the supervision of the police and other civil agencies, including, if appropriate, Department of Health and NHS officials.
<P>

<a name="30630w35.html_para4">The CCRFs will be able to apply general military skills in response to a crisis. Their role would vary according to the nature of the emergency, but might include, for example, management of displaced persons, limited first aid, temporary accommodation management and manning of water and feeding points. To ensure that the NHS response to a crisis is not adversely affected by the mobilisation of the MOD's response, the MOD has adopted a policy of not recruiting doctors, nurses, and paramedics, who are part of the Armed Forces Reserve, into the CCRFs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many drug rehabilitation centres there were in <i>(a)</i> 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 2002; what funding they received; and what measures have been taken since 1997 to improve drug rehabilitation rates.  [121128]<P>

<P>
<a name="30630w36.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 For the purposes of this answer, drug rehabilitation centres are referred to as drug treatment services.
<P>

<a name="30630w36.html_para3">Drugscope's "Drug Problems: where to get help" (2002), estimates that there are around 715 drug treatment services in England, an increase of over one-third since 1997.
<P>

<a name="30630w36.html_para4">The National Treatment Agency oversees the pooled drug treatment budget, which was first introduced in 2001&#150;02. Prior to this, mainstream health funds were spent on drug treatment, so it is not possible to provide figures. The pooled budget stands at &#163;236 million this year, an increase of 23 per cent. on last year's allocation of &#163;195 million. This money is allocated to drug action teams, who make the decisions on how funding is spent at a local level. Thus, it is not possible to identify exactly how much money was spent on drug rehabilitation centres specifically.
<P>

<a name="30630w36.html_para5">We are not only committed to increasing the numbers entering treatment, but to ensuring that we increase the numbers of drug misusers sustained and completing treatment programmes.

<a name="30630w36.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04, the pooled drug treatment budget stands at &#163;236 million, an average increase of 23 per cent. on last year's allocation of &#163;195 million. This money is allocated to drug action teams, which make the decisions on how funding is spent at a local level. As services are commissioned from both the statutory and voluntary sector, it is not possible to identify exactly how much is spent on voluntary drug support groups.

 The Department published its consultation document, "Hepatitis C Strategy for England", in August 2002, with proposals to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C. The strategy was developed with a multi-disciplinary steering group, membership of which included a range of health care professionals, academics who were experts in this field, and stakeholder voluntary organisation representatives. In developing the strategy, we took account of how other countries have tackled issues relating to hepatitis C.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate his Department has made of the cost to the NHS in 2002&#150;03 of treating illnesses that were a result of substandard housing.  [121106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w38.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The causes of illness associated with substandard housing can be complex and multi-factoral and it is not possible to disentangle the possible contributory role of housing conditions from other potential contributing factors such as poverty, working conditions and behavioural aspects. Therefore it would not be feasible to produce accurate figures representing the costs to the national health service of illness resulting from substandard housing.
<P>

<a name="30630w38.html_para1">Nevertheless, links have been established between cold, damp housing and increased ill health and the physiological effects of cold are well documented. The Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy and specific initiatives such as the 'Warm Front' and the review of the housing fitness standard all contribute to tackling substandard housing.
<P>

<a name="30630w38.html_para2">Research is in hand, supported by the Department of Health, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to study the impact of fuel poverty interventions on health.

 Contact with bidding consortia was conducted according to rules set down by NHS Estates, which prohibits unchaperoned meetings between the Inventures management team and bidders.

<P>

<a name="30630w38.html_para3">Receipts from subsequent sales of properties will belong to the company owning the properties and not the company employing Inventures, thus preventing the Inventures senior management from benefiting financially.

 Negotiations are on-going with the preferred partner with regard to the terms and conditions of the staff of Inventures. In accordance with Cabinet Office guidance, employees will be offered access to a scheme certified by the Government Actuary Department as broadly comparable with their current scheme. Staff will then have the option either to transfer their accrued rights or alternatively freeze their rights in the old scheme and enter the new scheme as a new joiner following the transfer.

 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2003]:</i> The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary and secondary care. NICE is due to publish the guideline in 2004. In January 2003, the Respiratory Alliance published their guidance, "Bridging the Gap", which aims to help primary care trusts to commission and deliver high quality allergy and respiratory care. Local British Lung Foundation "Breathe Easy" groups often reinforce pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para0">Information is not held centrally regarding the proportion of people with COPD who can access pulmonary rehabilitation. However, a recent survey by the British Lung Foundation and the British Thoracic Society found that 160 out of 266 hospitals across the country provide some form of pulmonary rehabilitation to lung patients. A wide range of patients can benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation. These include those with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, or lung tumours. Most pulmonary rehabilitation programs include medical management, education, emotional support, exercise, breathing retraining, and nutritional counselling. The objective is to help people gain the highest level of function and independence possible, and to improve overall quality of life.

This amounts to the largest sustained increase in funding of any five-year period in the history of the national health service. Over the years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, these plans mean that expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent. a year over and above inflation&#151;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent. in real terms.

 The current United Kingdom policy is not to offer single measles and mumps vaccines, because this exposes children to a greater risk of disease due to the longer course of vaccination required. Single vaccines leave children at risk of diseases that have serious complications for no benefit and the Government do not endorse this. There is very considerable evidence for the safety of MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation (WHO) stated:

<BR>

<P>
<a name="30630w39.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the publication today of a report for consultation by the Government's chief medical officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, outlining proposals for reform of the national health service clinical negligence system.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para4">The report, entitled "Making Amends; a consultation paper setting out proposals for reforming the approach to clinical negligence in the NHS", has been prepared against a background of the rising cost of claims for clinical negligence, which have drawn much media attention. In line with our wider drive to put patients at the heart of the NHS and patient safety at the top of its agenda, Sir Liam proposes that a less adversarial system 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 2003 : Column 159W</I><P>
should be available. Injured patients would no longer have to resort to lengthy and costly court action under the tort law. It would allow the NHS to be pro-active in responding to sub-standard care. There would be clear links to NHS quality initiatives to improve the patient's experience of the NHS as well as an incentive to drive up standards and so reduce injuries in the first place.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para5">The chief medical officer proposes a NHS redress scheme which would offer redress for injuries, in all senses of that word. The scheme would provide people who were injured with an explanation of what went wrong, the necessary apologies, treatment for that injury and support for patients and their families, as well as some financial compensation in appropriate cases. It is proposed that families of neurologically impaired babies would also be eligible for the NHS redress scheme if the impairment was birth related and fulfilled other eligibility criteria.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para6">Although a person's right to pursue a formal claim in the court would remain, patients would no longer have to resort to the law as the only way of resolving a dispute with the NHS. Proposed improvements to the legal aid system would mean that use of the NHS scheme would be taken into account if a claimant applied for legal aid after rejecting a fair package of redress under the NHS scheme. At present, over 70 per cent. of clinical negligence cases are legally aided, meaning the taxpayer often foots the bill through the legal aid budget if the NHS wins a case or the NHS budget if it loses.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para7">For too long, we have had a disjointed approach to clinical negligence in the NHS. There are often no clear links between complaints procedures and the systems to deal with clinical negligence claims at a local level. There is little consideration of the wider issues raised by complaints and clinical negligence claims&#151;and settlements&#151;locally and nationally. Finally, there are no reliable systems of ensuring that mistakes made in one organisation are not repeated in another.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para8">The proposed NHS redress scheme would link to the NHS complaints procedure and the new independent inspection structures being taken forward through the Health and Social Care Reform Bill presently before the House.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para9">The report emphasises the importance of building a NHS that is better at addressing injuries resulting from poor quality treatment. As well as the NHS redress scheme, it recommends that the NHS should improve rehabilitation services and that in cases of clinical negligence the costs of future care should be considered on an NHS-provided rather than a privately-provided basis. This is a long-term measure and it will take time to establish the necessary specialist NHS capacity. However, the Department will be exploring taking this forward through the long-term care national service framework, as it makes sense that those injured by the NHS should be able to get the care that they need from the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para10">Sir Liam's review has been wide-ranging and he proposes radical reform of the present lengthy, complicated and overly adversarial court-based system. The existing system is slow and often does not provide injured patients with the response to their injuries that they seek. The new system will be more responsive to the 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 2003 : Column 160W</I><P>
needs of patients for redress, and of the NHS for mechanisms that help it learn from mistakes. I believe it is possible to have a system that responds to patients' needs, that supports clinicians to deliver the very best quality care, and that is a driver for the NHS to learn from mistakes to continue to improve the quality of care it delivers.
<P>

<a name="30630w39.html_para11">There will now be a consultation period until 17 October. Following considerations of the issues raised and of the views of respondents on the specific questions asked, the Department expects to set out the next steps to reform the clinical negligence system in the autumn.

<i>[holding answer 12 June 2003]:</i> Figures on obesity levels in men for the United Kingdom are not available. However, in line with other countries, the levels of obesity in men have risen in England over the last five years, with the Health Survey for England showing that in 2001&#150;01, 21 per cent. of men were obese, compared with 16.4 per cent. in 1996. Regional information has not been collected over the past five years, but analyses of the Health Survey for England 2003 showed that in the West Midlands, 23.1 per cent. of men were obese in 2001.

<P>
<a name="30630w40.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 While there are no specific plans to increase access to occupational health for those suffering from mental health problems, the Government is currently exploring a number of ways to improve access to vocational rehabilitation for all workers through Welfare to Work. NHS Plus, launched in November 2001, is currently providing access to local occupational health services to small and medium sized businesses through 107 providers (National Health Service trusts) across the United Kingdom, while the new Job Retention and Rehabilitation pilots, launched on 1 April 2003, and the Incapacity Benefit reforms, announced in the Government's Green Paper, "Pathways to Work", in November 2002, are offering work-focused interventions for those with health problems, including mental health conditions.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para0">In addition, "Making It Happen: A guide to delivering mental health promotion", published by the Department of Health in 2001, contains a section dealing with mental health promotion in the workplace, the National Institute for Mental Health in England is currently preparing a resource on mental health and employment for people with mental health problems for publication in the autumn and the Health and Safety Executive is about to launch an occupational health support pilot scheme for the construction industry.

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]:</i> In our response to the Independent Working Group's Report on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in January 2002, we endorsed their view that there should be no doubt this is a chronic illness and that health and social care professionals should recognise it as such.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para5">We have had discussions with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the conclusions of the report.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para6">We also asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to develop a research strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on chronic fatigue syndrome CFS/ME.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para7">The MRC published their research strategy for (CFS/ME) on 1 May 2003. The strategy will enable researchers and funders to develop research proposals on all aspects of this illness. It was developed by an independent research advisory group in response to a request from the Chief Medical Officer, and was informed by contributions from patients, carers, charities, researchers and clinicians via a consultation exercise in summer 2002.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para8">The MRC has announced two initiatives in response to the strategy. One is a notice to the research community welcoming high quality proposals across the entire spectrum of CFS/ME research. The other is a scientific meeting to discuss the potential to use existing UK resources and infrastructures to undertake epidemiological studies in this country. In addition, the MRC has just announced funding (15 May 2003) for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment. These complementary trials will assess a variety of treatments, and in doing so, will both help address important issues for those with CFS/ME.

<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para9">The first trial known as PACE ("Pacing, Activity and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy: A Randomised Evaluation) will make the first assessment of a treatment choice popular with patients called 'Pacing'. The second trial, known as FINE, ("Fatigue Intervention by Nurses Evaluation") will test two different treatments that are particularly suited to helping reach those who are too ill to attend a specialist clinic as patients will be treated by nurses in their own homes.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para10">On May 12 2003, we announced that funding of &#163;8.5 million would be provided to develop services for people with CFS/ME. In July 2003, health organisations will be invited to bid for development funds to set up centres of expertise to develop clinical care, support clinical research and expand education and training programmes for health care professionals and to establish satellite community multidisciplinary teams. The first phase of development will commence in April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what funding was available for <i>(a)</i> capital and <i>(b)</i> running costs for neonatal intensive care services in the last two years; and what funding will be made available in the current year to enable the service to implement the recommendations of the neonatal intensive care services review;  [121546]
<P>
<UL>(2) what expenditure for <i>(a)</i> capital and <i>(b)</i> running costs (i) was available prior to the statement made in the Department's March 2003 report on Neonatal Intensive Care Services and (ii) was promised in that statement as purely additional sums.  [121547]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30630w40.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Historically, capital and revenue funding for neonatal intensive care (NIC) has been sourced from health authority base-line allocations, without segregation from funding the generality of health services. However, we have provided additional funds in recognition of the growing potential and availability of advanced levels of intervention, expertise and technological support for pre-term and sick babies, which increasingly saves the lives of even the most vulnerable, but leads to the need for greater levels of support within neonatal units.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para11">We approved additional funding in 2000 specifically to improve the NIC services. There were three elements: &#163;5 million revenue funding, &#163;6.5 million capital funding for new and replacement equipment and &#163;10.5 million funding for intensive care training for nurses, including neonatal intensive care education packages.
<P>

<a name="30630w40.html_para12">Further to this we have taken advice from a NIC services review, the background to which and report is available at www.doh.gov.uk/nsf/neonatal.htm and we have set up a full consultation into improving NIC services. The consultation period concludes on 11 July, following which, and to help NIC services implement the outcome, there will be additional &#163;20 million capital funding this year and &#163;12 million additional revenue funding, increasing to &#163;20 million in subsequent years.

 The Department does not collect information on the number of beds in national health service hospitals used wholly or partly for the treatment of private patients. Information on the number of beds in dedicated private patient units in NHS hospitals is collated by Laing and Buisson Ltd. and published in Laing's Healthcare Market Review 2002&#150;03. It is for the NHS trust responsible for the management of each hospital to decide the extent to which private patient services are provided in that hospital, but the national health service and Community Care Act 1990 provides that trusts may not offer private patient services if they would to any significant extent interfere with the performance by the trust of its NHS obligations.

 The Department has issued a wide range of guidance on violence towards staff, staff accidents and also management of sickness absence in the national health service that should be followed by NHS trusts. The Department will reinforce this message in new guidance to be produced in the autumn of 2003. The National Audit Office (NAO) report, "A Safer Place to Work&#151;Improving the Management of Health and Safety risks to staff in NHS Trusts", shows that the guidance is working, as the number of serious accidents reported by NHS trusts to the Health and Safety Executive have decreased by 25 per cent., over the last five years.
<P>

<a name="30630w41.html_para5">From 1 April 2003, the Counter Fraud and Security Management Service will take over lead responsibility for tackling violence against NHS staff and will be leading a programme of work in 2003&#150;04 to consider how best to implement the recommendations contained in the NAO's recent report. These include

 Action to address obesity in England is being taken forward through the national service frameworks (NSFs) for coronary heart disease, older people and diabetes. The forthcoming NSF for children will address the health and social care needs of all children and will include the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30630w42.html_para1">Effective prevention and management of obesity requires an integrated, cross-Government approach, working with a range of partners on programmes to tackle obesity, improve diet and increase physical activity levels.
<P>

<a name="30630w42.html_para2">The Department of Health is leading the development of a comprehensive food and health action plan, working across Government and with the food industry and other stakeholders to establish a coherent and effective programme of activities on nutrition in order to achieve a healthier diet. The joint Department for Culture, Media and Sport/Strategy Unit Report, "Game Plan", set out a new target of 70 per cent. of the population to be active by 2020. In order to deliver this target, a central Department of Health/DCMS-led sport and physical activity board is being set up.
<P>

<a name="30630w42.html_para3">At present, guidance is available to tackle obesity, including guidance issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on drugs and surgery and a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems to promote physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30630w42.html_para4">NICE has been asked to develop guidance on identification, prevention and management of obesity and maintenance of weight reduction. The Health Development Agency is also setting out the evidence base for effective interventions on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and the maintenance of weight loss.
<P>

<a name="30630w42.html_para5">The national health service priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06 includes targets on reducing CHD and diabetes. One of these targets requires practice-based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking, to cover the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30.

We are on track to announce as planned a balanced package of proposals, which we believe is the most effective means of promoting change to open up the market and improve quality and access without diminishing the crucial role that pharmacies play, especially in poorer and rural areas. Decisions on the package are being made collectively.

 The South East Public Health Observatory prepared a report for internal use by the Department of Health in March 2002 to review the capacity and progress of primary care trusts (PCTs) and other health bodies to meet the information collections defined by milestone 3 of chapter one of the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD). It was never intended that this report would be published.
<P>

<a name="30630w43.html_para2">The Department of Health considered the recommendations of the report and this influenced the document, "National Service Frameworks: A practical aid to implementation in primary care", which was published in August 2002 as a series of topic leaflets to support general practices and primary care trusts (PCTs). The topic leaflet, "Health Prevention and Improvement", also captures information on effective

There will be one PCT-led pilot in each of the regions in England, based in neighbourhood renewal areas.

<P>

<a name="30630w43.html_para4">Under "Shifting the Balance of Power", performance management of PCTs in accordance with local priorities is largely the responsibility of strategic health authorities. Local strategies and policies to increase physical activity will be included in the Commission for Health Improvement/Audit Commission joint national study into the implementation of the NSF for CHD. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the Department of Health to propose an additional assessment of the promotion of physical activity by primary care trusts.

 I have received a large number of representations about funding for Rainbows Children's Hospice as part of a campaign being run by the Leicester Mercury newspaper.

<i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]:</i> Government advice is that people limit their intake of vitamin B6 from dietary supplements to no more than 10 mg per day unless acting on the advice of their general practitioner or health professional.

<i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]:</i> Food supplements, like other foods, are not required to demonstrate their efficacy before marketing, nor are they subject to prior approval unless they are genetically modified or are 'novel'. Therefore, the Food Standards Agency does not hold detailed information about food supplements on the United Kingdom market.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which of the publications listed on page 92 and discussed on pages 85 to 89 of the report, Safe Upper Levels for Vitamins and Minerals, by the expert group on vitamins and minerals, published in May, led the group to the safe upper level for vitamin B6 of 10 mg a day for a 60 kg adult.

 The expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM) reviewed over 200 pieces of information on vitamin B6 and based their safe upper level of 10 mg. per day vitamin B6 on the study by Phillips <i>et al</i> (1978) in dogs. This level was determined to represent a clear safe upper level, with no adverse effects being anticipated over a lifetime's exposure. The derivation of the safe upper level for vitamin B6 is described on pages 90&#150;91 of the EVM Report, which is available in the Library.
