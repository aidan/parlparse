 In response to the Modernisation Committee&#039;s recommendations, the Commission authorised the recruitment of dedicated outreach officers, two of whom were recruited to start work in the education unit in September 2005. Since their appointment they have been meeting other organisations involved in promoting and teaching citizenship to identify how Parliament can most effectively contribute to the teaching of political literacy. Over the coming months they will be travelling to local education authorities and schools around the country to gather ideas on how the services of the education unit can be delivered to young people who are currently unable to visit Parliament. This fieldwork, along with a draft outreach strategy, will be completed before the summer recess.

Room A in 1 Parliament street has been equipped for presentations to school groups, in addition to the use of the Macmillan Room in Portcullis House, while an allocation of tickets in the public gallery has increased the opportunity for visiting groups to see the work of the House. To enable the unit to increase the number of school parties it can support on a daily basis, a new visits officer was appointed earlier this month with a second due to start in April. These changes will allow a further 20,000 young people each year to visit and learn more about the work of Parliament.

The House authorised the Commission to take forward work on a guide for new voters in January 2005. Since then qualitative research with groups of young people has been undertaken by an external agency in order to find out what kind of guide would be most effective. Following a competitive exercise an external creative agency was then appointed to produce the guide. Draft versions of the guide are going to be presented to groups of young people&#151;again, by an external agency with expertise in the field&#151;to test their effectiveness and see how they can be improved. A revised draft guide will be produced in the light of that research and will be made available to the Modernisation and Administration Committees for comments. The Commission hopes to agree a final version of the guide soon, so that from the second half of 2006 the guide can thereafter be sent to young people on or around their eighteenth birthday. The guide is intended to encourage more new voters to make sure they are registered to vote and to use their votes in the next general election.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to tackle acid rain.  [43703]</p>








<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60124w03.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Acid rain is the term given to precipitation which has been made acidic by airborne pollutants. It causes acidification of sensitive ecosystems, such as certain soils and freshwaters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w03.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_5">Acid rain is a transboundary phenomenon, so the best way to tackle it is through international action. The UK has played a major role in the development of a succession of Protocols under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe&#039;s Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution to reduce the emissions that lead to acid rain. These emissions are also controlled through the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_6">Much progress has been made over the last few decades in reducing the emissions that lead to acid rain, and progress continues: between 1990 and 2002, emissions of sulphur dioxide decreased by 73 per cent. and emissions of nitrogen oxides by 43 per cent. Emissions of ammonia reduced by 17 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w03.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_7">The Government support an extensive research programme to examine and understand the effects of acid rain on the environment, and there is now evidence of the beginnings of recovery in some of the most acid sensitive sites in the UK. But more remains to be done, and the Government continue to work in both the UNECE and the EU to ensure the next generation of international agreements will deliver further improvements in line with the principles of sustainable development.

 On 13 December 2005 the UK presidency achieved political agreement on the proposed Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH). Based on the agreed text, substances imported in articles (i.e. finished products) only require registration if the substances are intended to be released from articles and where they are present above one tonne. Otherwise importers need to notify the authorities only if the article contains a substance of very high concern. The agency may request the registration of any substance in an article if it poses a risk to human health or the environment. The UK Government will appoint a competent authority 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1957W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
who will be responsible for the monitoring and enforcement of these provisions in conjunction with other UK bodies as appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">All substances manufactured or imported into the EU above one tonne will have to register with the European Chemicals Agency. The registration of a substance involves the submission of a technical dossier of information about the chemical including a testing package. The testing requirements are outlined in Annexes IV to IX of the regulation. To avoid duplicate testing and minimise the cost to industry, sharing of animal test data is mandatory. To simplify the system, the sharing of non animal data has been made mandatory if requested by a potential registrant. Reduced registration requirements apply to substances manufactured below 10 tonnes. Only substances meeting one of the criteria in Annex Ic need to provide the full testing package outlined in Annex V of the regulation. It will be up to companies to identify whether a substance meets these criteria. A key part of the REACH proposal is that the onus is placed on industry (not the European Chemicals Agency or national Government) to identify the appropriate registration requirements and any additional testing that is required. Guidance will be available and a national help desk will be set up to assist industry in meeting these requirements. In addition, the UK competent authority could, under contract to the agency, conduct dossier evaluations to assess the testing proposals submitted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w06.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_41">For substances supplied in quantities over 10 tonnes, the registration package also requires the submission of a chemical safety report.

A further impact assessment was carried out in 2005, which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2006 : Column 1958W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="60124w06.html_para9">

 There have been no estimates made of the number of animals required for testing per year across the EU when the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation comes into force, not least since it is not possible to predict in advance the precise timing of any testing carried out by or for registrants. The total number of additional test animals needed as a consequence of the introduction of the regulation has been estimated by the Commission at &#163;3.9 million based on the Commission&#039;s original proposal. The text of the Political Agreement of December 2005 goes further still in minimising the amount of animal testing required, for example through the incorporation of One Substance, One Regulation&quot; (OSOR), a UK proposal with strong rules on the mandatory sharing of animal test data by companies.

The independent review of admissions to higher education (HE) chaired by Professor Steven Schwartz recommended in 2004 a research study to assess the idea of a national test of potential for HE.

The Sutton Trust, NFER and the College Board in America which owns the SAT, are also making significant contributions.

SSCs are led by employers and work to reduce skills gaps and shortages; improve productivity, business and public service performance, increase opportunities to boost the skills and productivity of everyone in the sector&#039;s workforce and improve learning supply including apprenticeships, higher education and National Occupational Standards (NOS).

Note:<br>

1. Figures on UK education spend for the years shown were obtained from the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses.<br>

2. The GDP figures used are the latest available and were updated at the end of December 2005.<br>

3. The international definition of education expenditure used to produce the figures for the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses has changed overtime; therefore, the figure for 1979&#150;80 is not directly comparable with the other years. The figures for 1987&#150;88, 1997&#150;98 and 2004&#150;05 have been produced to the same definition and so are comparable.<br>

<a name="stpa_87">The figures for percentage of GDP spent on education remain the same whether cash or 2004&#150;05 prices are used. This is because the same price deflator is used for education spend and GDP when calculating real terms figures.

 We have no plans to do so. The Government announced in November 2005 that a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) will be introduced from 1 April 2008. The RTFO will require all suppliers of transport fuels in the UK to ensure that 5 per cent. of their total fuel sales come from renewable sources by 2010 in order to help meet our climate change objectives. In practice this is likely to mean that the vast majority of UK filling stations will be selling biofuel blends by 2010.

ORR will use this in the course of the Access Charge Review to establish the specific outputs that Network Rail has to deliver as well as the income it requires for this.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 19 December 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 2318&#150;19W, on road improvement costs, what proportion of the overrun for the targeted programme of improvements can be ascribed to <i>(a)</i> underestimates, <i>(b)</i> fraud, <i>(c)</i> inflation in the construction industry and <i>(d)</i> other factors.

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="60124w16.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The targeted programme of improvements (TPI) table placed in the House Library in December 2005 compares the approved full out-turn cost against the scheme cost submitted for TPI entry approval. Since April 2003 the TPI entry cost has been reported on the basis of full projected out-turn, making allowance for identified risks, inflation up to scheme completion, non-recoverable VAT and for &#039;optimism bias&#039; in line with revised Treasury guidance issued in April 2003. Before then, only net scheme costs, exclusive of VAT, projected inflation and &#039;optimism bias&#039; were reported at TPI entry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60124w16.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_121">This is why as stated in the footnote to the answer of 19 December 2005, the two sets of figures in the table are not directly comparable for the 43 schemes that entered the TPI prior to April 2003. For these schemes, about &#163;0.6 billion (39 per cent.) of the &#163;1.54 billion variance against the cost reported at TPI entry is attributable to the absence of VAT, projected inflation at 2.5 per cent. and &#039;optimism bias&#039;. The remainder of the variance can be attributed to underestimates in the scope of schemes and the impact of inflation. Scheme budgets have assumed that construction inflation would run at 2.5 per cent. per year. The latest indications suggest that a higher allowance may be more appropriate and more research is under way in that area. As far as the Highways Agency is aware fraud has played no factor in any requirement for budget increases.

<a name="60124w16.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_122">For the 39 schemes that entered the TPI since April 2003, the two sets of figures are directly comparable and only two schemes have approved budgets that have increased since TPI entry. These increases (&#163;61 million) can be attributed to a combination of underestimates (&#163;26 million) and higher construction inflation (&#163;35 million). Again, none of these increases can be attributed to fraud.

The introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection in 1978 together with women&#039;s increased labour market participation mean that women are building up better basic state pension records.

 No analysis is currently possible on the direct association between the maintenance of family ties during custody and reconviction rates as statistical information is not routinely collected on the family ties of prisoners.

<a name="stpa_186">However, the Government recognise the importance of family ties to prisoners and the Resettlement Survey 2003 indicated that over a third (37 per cent.) of prisoners who had at least one visit from family members or a partner reported having employment, training or education (ETE) arranged on release compared with 16 percent of those not receiving any visits. ETE is an important factor in successful resettlement and reducing reoffending.

The findings from this survey (and equivalent surveys for 2001 and 2004) form the basis of a reconviction study which is currently being undertaken.

 Information is not held centrally on average time taken to identify successful candidates for vacant posts in the Department and information varies across the Department. Within the public sector some recruitment responsibilities are devolved to the various business areas. The Home Department operates a number of different arrangements for filling vacancies each with unique features. Time scales for filling a vacancy can vary considerably depending on the approach taken, the post to be filled and local circumstances.

 The Immobilise Phone Crime campaign was launched in March 2003, to publicise that stolen phones could now be blocked across all UK networks. This was a key step in tackling mobile phone theft, as it removed the incentive to steal a mobile phone because it could now be rendered useless.

The targeted nature of the Immobilise campaign, and the link between mobile phones and robbery would indicate that the campaign may have contributed to this reduction.

<sup>(21)</sup> As of April 2000, the Metropolitan police force was reduced in size by a transfer of responsibility for policing some areas to the surrounding forces, including Essex. These changes need to be borne in mind when comparing figures before and after April 2000.<br>

Consideration of release cannot take place until the prisoner has served the minimum period of imprisonment deemed necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence (the tariff&quot;). The responsibility for the release of lifers now lies with the independent Parole Board. If the lifer is not released at the tariff expiry point, the Parole Board will consider the

<sup>(24)</sup> As cancer survival varies with age at diagnosis, the relative rates for all ages (15 to 99) have been age-standardised to control for changes in the age profile of cancer patients over time, thus making them comparable with previously published figures.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> Aged 15 to 99 years.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> Cancers registered in 1998&#150;2001 are defined by codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD10).

 The most relevant measure of the UK trade in goods and services balance for comparative purposes is not the absolute figure, but the trade balance as a percentage of GDP. As quarterly figures can be volatile, it is more informative to look at annual figures. In 2004, the UK trade balance was in deficit at 3.3 per cent. of GDP, compared to 4.1 per cent. of GDP in 1989. The current account deficit was 2.0 per cent. of GDP over the same period, less than half the peak of 5.1 per cent. of GDP in 1989, and is readily financeable.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning what estimate he has made of the additional transport costs which may be incurred by jobseekers as a result of the Jobcentre Plus office closure programme; and the steps he has taken to help jobseekers in rural areas with additional transport costs so incurred. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79">We do not maintain a central record of actual additional costs incurred by jobseekers as a result of changes in the configuration of our office network. This is because any changes in transport costs will vary between individual jobseekers and individual locations. Furthermore the levels of Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance already take account of the costs of transport for jobsearch-related activities (which includes the requirement to attend our offices on a regular, usually fortnightly, basis).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80">However, in developing the plans for their Districts, each District Manager took account of the availability, frequency and costs of transport links to our offices. In the case of jobseekers in rural areas, it is open for Managers to make arrangements for jobseekers to sign on by post, rather than attend the office in person. The general rule for allowing postal signing is where:</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81">a. a customer lives more than one hour, door to door, by public transport (in either direction) from the nearest Jobcentre Plus office or Jobcentre; or</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82">b. attendance would result in an absence from home in excess of 4 hours; or</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">c. the customer has a mental or physical disability which restricts their mobility.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84">Jobcentre Plus Business Managers may also use some discretion in offering the postal facility to other customers, even if their journey is possible within the time limits stated above, For example, if the customer would have to use a form of transport which they could not be expected to use on a fortnightly basis, such as an Intercity train, a ferry or a plane.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">Occasionally customers are asked to attend a Jobcentre Plus Office or Jobcentre on a day when they are not usually due to attend to sign on (to see an Adviser for example). In these cases travel expenses are classed as additional and are reimbursed.</p>

 The seventh annual &#039;Opportunity for all&#039; report (Cm 6673) sets out the Government&#039;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and reports progress against a range of indicators. Our current approach is to present a range of low income thresholds (50, 60 and 70 per cent.). This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.

 The opportunity to work is vitally important in tackling poverty, supporting inclusion and ensuring economic prosperity for both the individual and society. The right to work is as important as the right to equal treatment or access to services. For too many people on incapacity benefit have been denied this right, written off as incapable of work and locked into lifelong dependency on benefits.

<a name="60124w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_242">We know that the vast majority of people on incapacity benefit have genuine health problems or disabilities. But we also know that a large proportion of these people want to work. In the early stages of an incapacity benefit claim 80&#150;90 per cent. of people expect to get back to work and around 1 million disabled benefit claimants want to work. So we want to ensure that they are given the opportunity to do so. Our task is to break down the barriers that incapacity benefit recipients face and give them the support they need, so that they can get a job and enjoy all the benefits that work can bring.

 The UK National Screening Committee has stated that there is no justification for universal (population) screening for Diabetes in the United Kingdom. However there is some support for screening population subgroups that are at a higher risk of undiagnosed diabetes and coronary heart disease. Further work is required in this area and a number of pilot projects are under way elsewhere in the UK, which would influence any decisions to introduce such screening programmes in Northern Ireland. The majority of early identification of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes will take place in primary care and there are regular reviews of patients with diabetes. This would include screening and investigation of the complications which may arise from diabetes.

 There have been significant changes in PIRA activity, including in the area of criminality, since the July statement.

<a name="60124w45.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_306"><i>(a)</i> It is not possible to state with accuracy the number of people smuggled illegally into Northern Ireland over each of the last five years. The nature of facilitation is such that many of those who have been facilitated may state if encountered that they entered by themselves on a false passport or stowed away without assistance, or similar response. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is often not possible to disprove the subject&#039;s claimed method of entry.

<p>
<a name="60124w45.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_307"><i>(b)</i> The Police Service of Northern Ireland has conducted a number of inquiries into suggestions of people-trafficking to Northern Ireland for the purposes of prostitution. There is presently no evidence to suggest that this is taking place in Northern Ireland. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is acutely aware of the problems experienced in other jurisdictions and they continue to monitor the situation closely.

 No. Although there will be no &#039;up front&#039; charge for meter installation, the cost of supplying and installing domestic water meters will be included in the metered tariff and will, therefore, be borne by metered water customers. This is similar to practice in England and Wales.
