<a name="91215w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Crausby: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what extra measures he proposes in order to achieve reductions in drink driving offences over the Christmas and new year holiday period.  [101664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My noble Friend Lord Whitty launched the Government's Christmas and new year anti-drink-drive publicity campaign on 1 December. The campaign is designed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries resulting from drink-driving especially during the coming holiday period, and also throughout the year. It has a particular significance this year because of the additional celebrations to mark the Millennium. The campaign emphasises the importance of planning ahead to ensure a safe journey home from festive celebrations. It also reinforces our message that drivers can still be well over the legal blood alcohol limit the following day after consuming alcohol and therefore should exercise particular caution in deciding when to resume driving. Nearly one in 10 of positive breath tests at the scene of an accident results from tests taken between 6am and 1pm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the compliance rate of utilities in using permanent reinstatement materials as set out in the statutory code of practice under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.  [102119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Research carried out for the Department by the Transport Research Laboratory, covering a period up to early 1998, showed that there was room for improvement in utilities' standards of compliance with the statutory code of practice on reinstatement (the reinstatement specification). Street works and the reinstatements after works are subject to inspection by street authorities (normally the local highway authorities), who have powers under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 to ensure compliance with the specification.
<P>

<a name="91215w01.html_para0">The research is contributing to the revision of the specification, a new edition of which we expect to be published next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ban the use of jet-skis in environmentally sensitive areas.  [102169]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Some environmentally sensitive areas already have local byelaws imposing strict speed limits, which result in the exclusion of jet-skis. We expect local authorities--who are responsible for making most local byelaws--to continue to judge each case on its merits.
<P>

<a name="91215w01.html_para1">Last year's report of the Review of Byelaw Powers for the Coast recommended that local authorities should be given more general powers to regulate activities on the coast which affect the wider environment, such as the use of personal watercraft. We have given a long-term commitment to introduce legislation to take forward those recommendations in the Review which require changes to the law. In the meantime, we have published a voluntary code of best and safe practice for leisure craft users, and we are exploring options for a voluntary boat registration and identification scheme, which would include jet-skis.

<a name="91215w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Sea Rescues and Emergencies Database</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance he has given on the collation of data for the Sea Rescues and Emergencies Database.  [102561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Sea Rescues and Emergencies Database (SEAREM) is owned, administered and funded by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) who are a registered charity and are independent of Government.
<P>

<a name="91215w01.html_para2">The only Government contribution towards SEAREM is in the form of data supplied by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA), an executive agency of the Ministry of Defence. Guidance for the making of data contributions has, therefore, been issued to these agencies from the RNLI.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the inclusion of rescues by local authority lifeguards within the Sea Rescues and Emergencies Database.  [102563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Local Authority lifeguards make no direct contribution to the Sea Rescues and Emergencies Database (SEAREM), as they do not have access to the database. If local authority lifeguards wish to provide data to the SEAREM database they do so through either the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) of the Surf Life Saving Association (SLSA) who, as direct contributors, are able to access SEAREM database.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons <i>(a)</i> time savings to road users are incorporated in net present value calculations of the benefits of road capital schemes and <i>(b)</i> time savings to rail users are excluded from rail investment appraisals.  [102597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Road and rail investment schemes are appraised against the Government's five over-arching criteria as set out in the Integrated Transport White Paper: "environment, safety, economy, accessibility and integration". Time savings are included under the economy criterion for both road and rail appraisals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in which negotiations about new air services between London and the United States <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> other Ministers in his Department have been involved since 1997; and what criteria determined the level of ministerial involvement in each case.  [102779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Negotiations between the UK and other countries are conducted by officials after consultation with Ministers. The level of ministerial involvement in any instance is determined having regard to the circumstances of the case. In the case of negotiations with the United States, Ministers have taken a close interest.

<a name="91215w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Airlines</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he received from British Airways and Virgin Atlantic prior to the granting of a slot to United Airlines to operate an air service between Boston and Heathrow; and if he will make a statement.  [102780]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Both airlines submitted views on the legal question of whether the application by United Airlines for a permit to operate a service between Boston and London had to be regarded as an entitlement under the terms of Bermuda II. These views were taken into account in reaching the decision to issue a permit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the decisions by the United States Administration and Her Majesty's Government to allow <i>(a)</i> British Airways to commence a service between Denver and Gatwick and <i>(b)</i> US Airways to commence a service between Charlotte and Gatwick were taken (i) jointly or (ii) separately.  [102797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The entitlement to operate these services derives from the Air Services Agreement between the UK and the US, commonly referred to as Bermuda II. The UK issued a permit for the US Airways Charlotte service in April 1998. The US was slow to issue a permit for the BA Denver service, and did not do so until July 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he held with the US Secretary of Transportation before agreeing to grant a slot to United Airlines to operate an air service between Boston and Heathrow; and if he will make a statement.  [102782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 No discussions were held with the US Department of Transportation before a permit was issued to United Airlines to operate a service between Boston and London. The Government takes no part in the allocation of slots at slot-constrained UK airports; these are allocated by Airport Co-ordination Ltd.

 DETR Ministers have received a number of briefings from HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) on its investigation into the falsification of quality assurance data for fuel manufactured in the MOX demonstration facility at BNFL's Sellafield plant. This investigation has concluded that the automated 100 per cent. check on pellet diameters should provide high confidence that all of the MOX fuel which has been delivered from Sellafield to Japan will be safe in use. A copy of the letter that NII sent to the Japanese Embassy advising them of this conclusion has been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="91215w02.html_para4">The figures for 1998 are based on single night street counts and were published as part of my answer of 19 May 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 355-62W, which gave an estimate of the number of people sleeping rough across England. This estimate formed a baseline figure for the Government's target to reduce rough sleeping in England by two thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="91215w02.html_para5">The figures for 1999 are being published today as part of the breakdown of the latest national estimate, showing the position as at June 1999. This shows that the number of people sleeping rough in England, on any one night, fell from 1,850 in June 1998 to 1,633 in June 1999. Copies of the full breakdown are available from the Library. Responsibility for the Rough Sleepers Initiative in Scotland is a devolved matter. I understand, however, that no comparable figures are available for Glasgow. A single night street count in central Glasgow in 1997 found 53 people sleeping rough. No counts have been undertaken since.

<a name="91215w02.html_para6">Responsibility for rough sleeping in Wales is also a devolved matter. I understand, however, that an independent report has recently been prepared for the National Assembly for Wales and local authorities in Wales on the incidence of rough sleeping in Wales and its causes, and to advise on effective strategies for assisting rough sleepers. According to this independent report, single night street counts in September 1997 found 12 people sleeping rough in Cardiff city centre, and in September 1998 found 20 people.

 We expect to provide around &#163;92,000 in bilateral development technical assistance to Montenegro in the 1999-2000 financial year. This is mainly in support of privatisation programmes and public administration reform. Work was disrupted by the Kosovo crisis, during which we provided around &#163;650,000 in emergency humanitarian assistance.

<a name="91215w03.html_para0">For 2000-01, we are considering renewed activities in economic reform, support to civil society and public administration reform. The level of support has yet to be determined.

<a name="91215w03.html_para1">The European Commission has committed about 56 million euro to Montenegro since April 1998 for public administration reform, private sector development, agriculture, budgetary support and humanitarian aid. The UK share of this is some 17 per cent.

<P>
<a name="91215w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 Following the devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 2 December 1999, the Assembly took on responsibility for all the Northern Ireland Civil Service Departments. The Secretary of State's responsibility is now limited to the Northern Ireland Office, and the following information relates to that Department only.
<P>

<a name="91215w03.html_para2">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which came into force in 1996, removed the requirement for individuals with disabilities to register as disabled and, as a result, such information is no longer held on staff in the Northern Ireland Office. Individuals may, however, provide information regarding their disabilities on a voluntary basis. Statistics based on this information indicate that 4.04 per cent. of staff in the Northern Ireland Office have declared that they have a disability under the Act.
<P>

<a name="91215w03.html_para3">The Northern Ireland Office is an Equal Opportunities employer and has a number of policies in place relating to the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities. Where open recruitment competitions are advertised, disabled people are among those under-represented groups who are encouraged to submit applications. The NIO also sponsors a number of people with disabilities to provide them with work in the Department under the Training and Employment Agency's Employment Support Scheme.
<P>

<a name="91215w03.html_para4">The NIO has a dedicated Disabled Person's Liaison Officer whose role is to provide assistance and advice to staff and managers on what reasonable adjustments can be made to enable staff with disabilities to do their jobs. Consideration is also being given to joining the Positive about Disabled People "Two Ticks" scheme to indicate the NIO's commitment to people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="91215w03.html_para5">Since 1997 the Northern Ireland Office has funded a bursary for staff with disabilities. This provides the bursary holder with a two year programme of training and mentoring to enable them to develop the competencies needed to gain promotion. Two members of NIO staff are currently benefiting from the scheme.

 There are no statutory provisions prohibiting top-up payments. The provision of advice on and selling of endowment policies is regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Policyholders are encouraged to seek independent financial advice before deciding on options to meet projected shortfalls in maturity.

<a name="91215w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 As at 1 October 1999, 111 staff (2 per cent.) had declared themselves as disabled in a voluntary survey. The FCO is committed to the employment of people with disabilities. In September 1998 the Department qualified for the Employment Service Two ticks symbol "Positive about disabled people". Under this scheme the Department guarantees an interview to anybody with a disability where the application meets the minimum criteria for the post. Particular arrangements are put into place for tests and interviews when requested by the candidate. Reasonable adjustments are made to the working environment for new entrants with disabilities. The FCO has appointed a Disabled Persons Officer to deal with disability issues within the Office.

 The countries that have applied for membership of the EU are listed in the table. Accession negotiations started in March 1998 with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. Accession negotiations will begin in February 2000 with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia. The Helsinki European Council on 10-11 December 1999 recognised that Turkey is a candidate for membership. Norway put its application on hold in 1994 after a referendum rejected membership. Switzerland suspended its application in 1993. In 1987, the Council of Ministers did not accede to an application from Morocco. No other country has signalled an intention to apply for membership within the next 12 months. This Government strongly support EU enlargement.

 As I announced on 4 February, my right hon.

In the meantime the home remains open. I have asked English Heritage to bring forward proposals for the use of the accommodation currently occupied by the convalescent home.

Once budgets are delegated to schools, schools' governing bodies may take decisions on precisely how to deploy the resources available for the benefit of individual pupils. Where extra resources are required to enable a school to make the provision specified in a statement of special educational need for an individual child, the local education authority may provide support from a central resource; devolve funds for that specific child; or in some cases, the schools' delegated budget will already include funds to meet the needs of pupils with statements of special education need.

 The administration of the Teachers' Pensions Scheme has been carried out under contract by Capita Business Services since October 1996. Details of the average time taken for the complete processing of ill-health retirement applications are not recorded, but a Statement of Service Requirements (SOSR) attached to the contract has specific targets with regard to ill-health applications. The performance of the scheme administrator is given in the following table. These targets reflect the stages in the process where responsibility for the action rests with the administrator and not with a third party. The number of years for which the information is available reflects the periodic updating of the SOSR.

This is a reasonable step rather than each TEC seeking separate advice with the additional costs that would entail. However, we would not expect TECs/CCTEs to use public funds to contest the distribution of reserves and assets.

<a name="91215w07.html_para0">Section 1 of the Interception of Communications Act 1985 makes it an offence to intercept a communication in the course of its transmission by post or by means of a public telecommunications system. It therefore provides privacy protection for electronic mail (e-mail) when it is carried on the network of a public telecommunications operator (PTO), but not when it passes over networks which are not operated by a PTO. We recognise the need to extend legal protection to all communications on non-PTO networks. In June 1999, the Home Office published a consultation paper, "Interception of Communications in the UK", which contains the Government's proposals for legislation in this area. I will carry these proposals forward in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill which was announced in the Queen's Speech.

 In 1997-98 the Presenting Officer Unit (POU) piloted new working procedures designed to increase flexibility and productivity which included identifying non-complex cases in which the absence of a Presenting Officer would not affect the outcome of the appeal. A total of 126 appeal cases were heard without a Home Office representative being present. In 1998-99 the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) significantly

<P><I>15 Dec 1999 : Column: 210W</I><P>

The IAA was informed in 6,230 cases, 11 per cent. of the total listed for hearing, that there would be no Home Office representative: no information is available as to how many of these cases proceeded to a hearing. In the current financial year the IAA has been informed in 610 cases, 3 per cent. of total listed, that there would be no Home Office representative.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The total programme cost for the 12 currently planned Type 45 warships including their missiles is approximately &#163;6Bn. This includes approximately &#163;1.2Bn for the development, design and build of the first of class ship and &#163;1Bn for the development and initial production of the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS). The balance of &#163;3.8Bn contains funding for further missile procurement, allows for the incremental acquisition of the combat system. The ship design will incorporate significant growth margins to allow for this incremental capability development. A typical cost per ship is thus difficult to asses but the average is expected to be within a target cost of about &#163;270M, excluding missiles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked what assessment had been made of the effect of the collapse of the Common New Generation (CNGF) Programme. The tri-national project office, before it closed on 29 October 1999, provided an assessment of the lessons learned to each of the three partner nations. These reported lessons are being carefully considered and we will be compiling our own UK national lessons learned paper in order to ensure that they are applied appropriately to other collaborative projects. At this stage, I would assess the key lessons to be:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. The operational requirement should be agreed in detail, and be confirmed as affordable against agreed budgets. This information (on requirement and cost) should be communicated to Industry at an early stage to avoid over-ambitious performance specifications being set at the outset that have subsequently to be adjusted (with consequent delay) as financial realities are brought to bear;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. early in the programme, a credible industrial organisation must be established which meets the requirements of industry and of all particular governments. For the UK, this means the appointment of an effective prime contractor not a joint venture company;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. work share arrangements should not be allowed to distort industrial management of the programme. The involvement of trans-national companies and OCCAR are likely to be helpful in ensuring work share issues are resolved efficiently and economically.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Applying these principles proved intractable in the context of HORIZON but was possible with the PAAMS Anti-Air Warfare missile component of the CNGF programme and you will be aware that a Development and Production contract for PAAMS was successfully placed last August on behalf of the three nations.

 We recognise the importance of Service personnel away from home being able to keep in touch, particularly during holiday periods. To this end, all personnel deployed on eligible operations are given 20 minutes worth of free welfare telephone calls home each week. In the past, this facility has been provided using a mix of private and military services, and, whenever operational constraints have allowed, has also been made available to personnel to allow them to make additional telephone calls home at their own expense. All personnel deployed away from home over the Christmas and New Year period will have access to this minimum level of service, either as their primary means of calling home or as a fallback when other systems are not working.

Internally, ethnic minority representation goals have been set and specific recruitment goals are being developed for recruiting areas which take account of relocations and re-organisations, and the representation of the ethnic minorities among the working population in catchment communities. Work is also underway, in conjunction with the Services, to improve the MOD's image as an equal opportunities employer in respect of both civilian staff and Armed Forces personnel.

 I am please to announce that, following a competition and subject to the negotiation of satisfactory terms and conditions, we have decided to award a contract to Royal Ordnance for the development and initial production of 120mm training ammunition for the Challenger 2 tank. This is good news for the company and will provide the Army with training ammunition to match Challenger 2's excellent performance and capability.
<P>

<a name="91215w09.html_para1">In addition, discussions between MOD and Royal Ordnance on a possible Partnering Arrangement are progressing very well. We signed a Partnering Principles document on 8 October, which defined our mutual objectives, including the achievement of improved value for money for the MOD as customer, and profitability for the company. Negotiations are continuing and I hope to be able to make an announcement shortly. In the event that an agreement is reached, the intention is that CHARM 3 Training Round would be included within the scope of any such Agreement.

Sir Richard and his colleagues will be leading these changes with the full support of the Government and, I hope, the House. I would like to pay tribute to the quality of the Civil Service. I believe that a sign of this quality is the fact that the Service has recognised for itself the need for further improvement and is now driving forward such an ambitious programme of reform.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91215w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Glenthorne Youth Treatment Centre in Birmingham has made an important and valued contribution to the treatment and care of some of the most difficult and disturbed young people with whom the child care system has had to deal, and has been influential in the lives of many young people.
<P>

<a name="91215w10.html_para6">When the Centre opened in 1978, except for St. Charles the other Youth Treatment Centre in Essex, which has since closed, there were no comparable facilities for accommodating and treating such difficult and disturbed young people. Since then, however, local authorities have developed their own secure accommodation and have become skilled and experienced in dealing with many young people needing secure care. The Department of Health has undertaken a major building and refurbishment programme in recent years to strengthen the range and geographical spread of local authority accommodation by providing an additional 170 places for young people. There will be funding in the coming year to continue this programme of upgrading and refurbishment.
<P>

<a name="91215w10.html_para7">From April 2000, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales will become responsible for commissioning and purchasing places in the secure juvenile estate for remanded and sentenced young people. The Board has decided that it does not wish to use the Glenthorne Centre for this purpose. As up to half the young people accommodated in the Centre at any one time are placed there by the Prison Service it would be extremely difficult to continue to run the Centre as a viable unit without these placements. There are also good child care practice issues to be considered. Because of the growth in experience and provision in the wider child care field, these young people can now be cared for in a number of appropriate locations and need not be labelled as "the worst in the country" by virtue of being placed in only one facility. For these reasons, I therefore intend to consult the staff and their representatives about the future of the unit, including its possible closure. The consultation period will last three months, at the end of which I will make my final decision on the future of the Centre.

 The Social Exclusion Unit's report on Rough Sleeping sets the target of reducing the number of those who sleep rough by two thirds by 2002. The Rough Sleepers Unit in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is responsible for action to meet this target and they have today published an implementation strategy for England.

On the basis of capacity and cost considerations, the IB has determined that rendering should be the primary disposal route for OTMS animals. IB has contracted meat and bone meal incineration capacity to meet its needs for the foreseeable future. Direct carcase incineration will continue to play an important part in the scheme, in particular for casualty animals slaughtered on-farm.

These have been superseded by more comprehensive targets, published on 19 November, which will take effect from 1 April 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1999]:</i> In reaching a decision not to run an early retirement scheme, account has been taken of the results of consultation, an economic appraisal, and the scope for restructuring provided by other instruments under the Rural Development Regulation and elsewhere. The consultation showed that views were mixed on the benefits of a scheme. While it could contribute to restructuring, the cost would outweigh that benefit. A scheme would also be very complex and costly to administer and would be very difficult to target only to those most in need.
