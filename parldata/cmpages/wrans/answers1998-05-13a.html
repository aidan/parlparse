<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 I have had a number of recent representations raising various issues relating to the effect on religious organisations, and particularly the Church of England, of the Human Rights Bill. A delegation representing the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church and the Free Churches met the Home Secretary before Easter to explain their position.

[41169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Department has undertaken a review of the reports prepared for the shipping and aviation industry assessing the likely employment and economic effects of the abolition of intra-EC duty free sales in 1999. A copy has been placed in the Library today.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We will read the report of the World Trade Organisation Panel on this case very carefully when it is made available to World Trade Organisation members who are not parties to the dispute in a few weeks' time. It would be premature to draw conclusions before knowing the full detail of the Panel's judgment. The Government will be able to comment once we have the papers and have assessed them.

[41556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 None. However, the Civil Aviation Authority has already inspected on our behalf aircraft operated by airlines based in Bangladesh. In addition, Bangladesh has applied for an assessment under the International Civil Aviation Organisation's safety oversight assessment programme. We will review the position once that assessment has been carried out.

<a name="80513w01.html_para2">Planning, design, and implementation of park and ride schemes are functions of local authorities. My Department's role is to fund those initiatives where authorities are able to demonstrate, in their annual Transport Policies and Programme submissions, that their proposals meet the criteria the Department has prescribed.

 The Country Landowners Association is taking action under its Access 2000 initiative to improve the quality, diversity and quantity of managed public access and recreation in the countryside. The CLA has employed an Access Adviser to assist them with the practical aspects of this initiative. The Countryside Commission is helping to meet the costs of the Access Adviser. To date, the Commission has paid approximately &#163;17,000 and is committed to a maximum contribution of &#163;68,500 over the three years to April 2000.
<P>

<a name="80513w02.html_para1">The work of the Adviser involves seeking voluntary improvements in the public access available over rural private land in England, and includes the production of guidance on making local access assessments. The Commission receives progress reports from the CLA and I shall be asking the Commission to seek up-to-date information from the CLA on the other points my hon. Friend raises and to write to him with the information available. A copy of the Commission's letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

The estimates in the Table are those reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on the basis of the guidelines recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Final data for 1997 are not yet available but provisional estimates show that emissions last year were about 155 million tonnes, a decrease of some 4% from 1996. Differences between years are affected by outside temperature and this is the main reason for the increase between 1995 and 1996 and the subsequent decrease to 1997. Changes in economic activity, types of fuel used, the structure of the economy, and energy efficiency also affect emissions from year to year. Estimates on the IPCC basis are not available for years before 1990. Comparable data are available for earlier years on the basis used for reporting emissions to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and these show that in 1988, 1989 and 1990 emissions changed by 0.0, -2.6 and +2.1 million tonnes of carbon, or 0%, -1.6% and +1.3% respectively.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the likely increase in the United Kingdom's carbon dioxide emissions in <i>(a)</i> quantity and <i>(b)</i> percentage terms over the 10 years from the beginning of 1998.  [41381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 UK projections of carbon dioxide emissions are under review, but the existing estimates based on Energy Paper 65 suggest that, without the introduction of further policies, emissions in 2008 would be about 9 million tonnes of carbon, or about 6%, higher than in 1998. The increase above the 1990 baseline would be about 0.2%. Actual emissions in any year will be affected by external factors including the fluctuation in outside temperature. We are currently looking at policies and measures to meet our legally binding commitment following the Kyoto agreement, and our domestic aim to reduce emissions by 20% below the 1990 level. We shall be consulting on this over the summer.

In addition, the Benefits Agency and the London Borough of Lewisham are developing a project which will test better exchange of information and improved advice and service to customers. We want to know what customers and staff think about this new way of delivering services and we will be listening carefully to what they tell us.

<P>
<a name="80513w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Under section 2 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959, it is a criminal offence to publish or possess for gain an obscene article. A person publishes an article if he distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives or lends it, or offers it, or electronically transmits it. Material sent via fax machines comes within the scope of the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The principal control on obscene material is the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Under this Act, it is an offence to publish an obscene article, that is, an article which, in the view of the court, tends to 'deprave and corrupt' those likely to see, read or hear it. It is the responsibility of the police to decide whether there are sufficient grounds to launch a criminal investigation and that of the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute those alleged to be responsible for the publication.
<P>

<a name="80513w03.html_para4">Under the Telecommunications Act 1984, anyone running a telecommunications system in the United Kingdom is required to do so under licence. These licences contain measures aimed at limiting the nuisance caused by unsolicited telephone and fax calls, by requiring callers to cease this practice on receipt of a written request from the recipient. OFTEL are responsible for enforcing these rules and ultimately the Director General has power to deprive persistent offenders of the right to operate their telephone system.
<P>

<a name="80513w03.html_para5">The Government have also recently published a consultation paper on implementation of the European Union Telecoms Data Protection Directive, which seeks to address the question of additional measures to protect businesses and residential consumers from unwelcome faxes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The British Crime Survey (BCS) gives estimates of drug use amongst people aged 16 to 24 living in private households in England and Wales. The most recent estimates are from the 1996 survey, when 39 per cent. of people in this age group said they had used cannabis at some time, 26 per cent. said they had used it in the last year and 16 per cent. in the last month. The proportion admitting to heroin use were: 1.0 per cent. in life-time, 0.4 per cent. in last year and 0.1 per cent. in the last month.




<P>
<P><I>13 May 1998 : Column: 127</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80513w03.html_para6">The estimates of heroin use--especially use in the last month--should be treated with great caution, partly because they are subject to very large sampling error, and partly because a household survey such as the BCS is likely to under-represent current heroin users.
<P>

<a name="80513w03.html_para7">Because the findings are subject to sampling error, estimates of the number of people using drugs can be said, with a certain degree of statistical confidence, to fall within a range. The table gives this range, together with the mid-point estimate. The estimates for cannabis use are fairly precise, while those for heroin are not.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make arrangements to pay interest on outstanding claims under the compensation scheme for both high and small calibre pistols.  [41798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. During the Parliamentary consideration of the compensation schemes last year, the principle of paying interest to claimants was expressly rejected. There is no reason to change that position.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what reviews he is currently conducting on the <i>(a)</i> health and <i>(b)</i> environmental implications of the firing of depleted uranium shells at (i) Kirkcudbright test range at Dundrennan, (ii) Eskmeals in Cumbria and (iii) in Iraq, by British forces.  [40633]<P>

<P>
<a name="80513w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Comprehensive environmental sampling programmes are in place at both Eskmeals and Kirkcudbright ranges where depleted uranium ammunition is fired. To date, calculated public radiation doses from all direct and indirect routes have been trivial, representing much less than 1 per cent. of the national annual radiation dose limit for members of the public. These monitoring programmes will continue until such time as the Environmental Agency considers that no further monitoring is necessary. The monitoring data is provided to the relevant local councils and environmental agencies.

knowledge, no specific UK studies have been conducted into the potential environmental effects of depleted uranium contamination on the battlefield. The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency has, however, undertaken an assessment of the health effects on personnel exposed to depleted uranium under battlefield conditions. A summary of this report, 'Radiological and Chemical Hazards of Depleted Uranium', has already been placed in the Library of the House. This report concluded that there was no indication that any UK troops had been subjected to harmful over-exposure to depleted uranium during the Gulf War.

<P>
<a name="80513w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 The Government do not accept that there is a constitutional bar that outweighs the economic tests as the decisive reason why we might join EMU. The constitutional issue is a factor in the decision, but it is not an overriding one. Rather it signifies that in order for monetary union to be right for Britain the economic benefits should be clear and unambiguous.

<a name="80513w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 May 1998]:</i> The UK Government supported the Commission recommendation on membership of the single currency on 1 January 1999 on the basis of the considerable progress made towards economic convergence on the basis of the Treaty criteria; the framework for stability and discipline provided by the Stability and Growth pact; the progress made by high-debt countries in reducing their debt-GDP ratios in recent years and their commitments to reducing them in the future; and the declaration issued by Finance Ministers on 1 May reaffirming the commitment to fiscal discipline, economic reform and job creation. The UK Government agreed with other Member States that in light of the above the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency had been achieved for all 11 candidates.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what is the estimated budget for <i>(a)</i> the New Deal and <i>(b)</i> Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils in 1998-99; and if he will make a statement on the (i) actual and (ii) percentage change in these figures relative to those in 1997-98.  [41175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The budget for the New Deal in Wales in 1998-99 will depend on the take-up of the various New Deal programmes. The Employment Service, which has responsibility for the New Deal, currently anticipates that expenditure will be in the range of &#163;25-&#163;30 million. 



<P>
<P><I>13 May 1998 : Column: 133</I><P>
The budget for Wales in 1997-98 is not comparable with this figure as it comprised only the 3-month Pathfinder for the New Deal for 18-24 year olds in South-West Wales.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para0">Provision for programmes delivered through TECs in 1998-99 is &#163;104.4 million. This compares with an equivalent figure of &#163;110.6 million last year--a reduction of &#163;6.2 million, or 5.6 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 In January, the Government announced that they would be undertaking a comprehensive review of waste management policy with a view to preparing a statutory waste strategy. A consultation paper will be issued shortly. Developing the strategy will offer the opportunity to consider all the various waste management options, including recycling, in the context of sustainable waste management.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para1">Also, in March this year, the Government issued revised guidance to local authorities on preparing and revising local authority recycling strategies and recycling plans. The guidance incorporates advice on a wide range of recycling issues and will assist local authorities in developing effective plans for their areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what percentage of the capitation money available to the Health Service in Wales was allocated to the North Wales Health Authority in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99; and what proportion of the change in the total funding available to the North Wales Health Authority between those years was accounted for by the change in capitation finance.  [41100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 In 1997-98, the North Wales Health Authority discretionary Hospital, Community and Family Health Services allocation, was &#163;314.410 million which represented 22.926 per cent. of the Wales total. In 1998-99 the corresponding figures were &#163;322.950 million and 22.910 per cent. This represents a year-on-year cash change of &#163;8.540 million, net of a &#163;0.226 million capitation effect. This represented 2.6 per cent. of the cash change.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para2">This net cash change does not represent the 1998-99 cash increase allocated to North Wales Health Authority which, on the start position for 1997-98 (adjusted for recurrent changes and repatriations), was &#163;12.520 million or 4.0 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how he proposes to eliminate skills shortages in skilled manufacturing industry in Wales.  [41492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 A wide range of action is in hand to tackle skill shortages in manufacturing industry, most notably the "Action Plan for Manufacturing Training in Wales" which has been drawn up by the Council of Welsh TECs with the support of the Welsh Development Agency, the Development Board for Rural Wales, the Funding Councils, the WLGA, the CBI and the TUC. An additional &#163;3.5 million has been made available in 1998-99 for the FEFCW, working closely with the TECs, to meet locally identified skill needs and to support training in key advanced skills directly relevant to realising the Action Plan.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para3">The Education and Training Action Group is also looking at the priority skill needs which exist in Wales and how the education and training system might adapt to meet these.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with dairy producers concerning the price of milk; and if he will make a statement.  [41490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I am conscious, through discussions with the farming unions and directly with dairy producers, that farm gate milk prices have fallen compared to last year. The latest available information suggests that in March this year, producers received on average 19.72 pence per litre. This was nearly 4 pence per litre down on the same period the previous year. This is mainly due to the effects of the strong pound which has reduced farm profitability across a range of sectors and mirrors the occasions in the past when sterling was weak and farming profitability often improved. However, the Government appreciate the present difficulties in the dairy sector and we are keeping the situation as it develops under close review.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para4">In part, low prices are due also to the apparent lack of demand for milk for manufacturing. I am aware that farmers have concerns about the rules governing the selling system which they believe to be contributing to the low milk price they currently receive. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is currently investigating the supply of raw milk in Great Britain following a referral by the Office of Fair Trading. The Government welcome this investigation which will examine all aspects of the current selling system.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 An assessment of the importance of hill farming to the rural economy is contained in a report on "LFA Policy in Wales: A Review of the Socio-Economic and Environmental Effects of the HLCA Scheme" commissioned by the Welsh Office and published by the Welsh Institute of Rural Studies on 20 April 1998. The sheep and cattle sectors predominate in the less favoured areas of Wales and the report states that using 1991 estimates for every on-farm job in the sheep sector there are 0.36 jobs in other industries in Wales. The comparable figure in the cattle sector is 0.35 jobs.

 The New Deal for People with Disabilities will help people with a disability or long-term illness who want to work to do so.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para5">&#163;195 million has been set aside across the UK to develop a range of initiatives to help those currently dependent on benefits to return to work; those in work to remain in work; and to help carers balance any responsibilities with work, or to take up work when their caring responsibilities come to an end.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para6">The programme of help will include innovative projects which will test ways to help people move into work and remain in work; an information campaign; research into current and developing provision and benefit changes to remove disincentives to work.
<P>

<a name="80513w05.html_para7">Central to this will be personal advice to help disabled people and those with long-standing illness to identify and overcome barriers to work. This approach will enable tailored plans to be developed for each individual who participates under the New Deal. This Personal Adviser Service will be piloted from October 1998 in a number of areas. I am delighted that one of these pilots will be in Wales (covering Merthyr, Aberdare, Blackwood, Caerphilly and Ebbw Vale).

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 1998]:</i> No detailed assessment has been made of the potential for extracting plutonium from exported MOX fuel for use in the production of nuclear weapons. I understand, however, that it is technically difficult to produce nuclear weapons using the reactor grade plutonium contained in MOX fuel. The potential for theft or diversion of plutonium, including that in MOX fuel, is fully taken into account in the application of internationally agreed safeguards and security measures. Plutonium, including that in MOX fuel, is exported only to countries that have provided the necessary assurances in relation to physical protection, safeguards and peaceful use.

 We have received many disturbing reports about disappearances, detentions and clashes between the Indonesian security forces and students. HM Ambassador in Jakarta has raised our concerns with the Indonesian authorities together with colleagues from the EU Troika. We have called on the Indonesian authorities to exercise maximum restraint in protecting and restoring public order; to uphold democratic rights such as freedom of expression and assembly; and to ensure that universally accepted human rights are not violated.

 Significant cross-border co-operation already exists in the areas of rail and road developments, tourism, trade and energy. It offers mutual advantage and real economic benefits to both Northern Ireland and the Republic. Cross-border trade in particular has grown

 Prospects for economic development in Northern Ireland are very encouraging. The number of people in employment is the highest on record. Unemployment has fallen to well below the EU average.

 Government agencies and the private sector have been co-operating with their counterparts for a number of years on a wide range of economic activities including infrastructure, tourism, trade and energy issues.

 The Parades Commission has the statutory responsibility of encouraging and facilitating local accommodation on contentious parades and, where this is not possible, making legally binding determinations on such parades.

 Preliminary results from work conducted in 1997 off Start Bay and Salcombe indicate that in areas open to scallop dredging or other bottom fishing the seabed has a relatively uniform topography inhabited by animals able to withstand bottom fishing disturbance.

The inspections also look at compliance with the Voluntary Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs and Cats in Quarantine Premises in respect of those premises that have agreed to abide by the Code.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80513w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1997]:</i> National Health Service trusts are placed on a red light status when the NHS Executive has concerns over their financial performance. The assessment is based on current and forecast financial positions and is subject to change throughout the year.
<P>

<a name="80513w10.html_para2">Information for 1996-97 Quarter 4 has previously been placed in the Library but is included here for completeness. The analysis of red lights by region is provided for Quarter 4 1995-96, Quarter 4 1996-97 and Quarter 3 1997-98 in a table, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80513w10.html_para3">The criteria used for allocating red lights in 1995-96 and 1996-97 have been the subject of a previous reply I gave the right hon. Member for Flyde (Mr. Jack) on 31 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>617</i>. The criteria for 1997-98 have been changed to promote consistency and objectivity across the NHS. The financial criteria used for red lights in 1997-98 is an adjusted income and expenditure deficit of more than the lower of &#163;1 million or 1 per cent. of turnover. Adjustments are made to the reported surplus or deficit to remove items which are not within the control of the trust management. These include clinical negligence provisions, early retirement provisions and compensating adjustments for losses on the disposal of assets. Where year to date performance indicates that trusts are likely to breach the criteria by the year end, regional offices light to the trust.
<P>

<a name="80513w10.html_para4">The assignment of red lights in 1997-98 is more mechanistic than in previous years. This has resulted in red lights being assigned because a trust has breached the financial criteria although the NHS Executive regional office may be satisfied that the trust has sound finances, a recovery plan is in place to deliver breakeven and it is delivering the expected benefits. This will generally result in more red lights reported in 1997-98 and as a comparison, an estimate of the number of red lights at Quarter 3 under the old criteria would be around 50 instead of the 74 under the new criteria.
