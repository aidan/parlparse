<p><a name="41206w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Burns: </b> 
 To ask the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission what qualifications the Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service has to fulfil his duties as Chief Executive.  [201811]</p>




<p><a name="41206w01.html_spnew0"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b> 
 The Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service holds that post by virtue of his appointment as Clerk of the House of Commons. This arrangement was endorsed by the external reviews of the management of the House of Commons carried out in 1990 by Sir Robin Ibbs and in 1999 by Mr. Michael Braithwaite. I refer the hon. Member in particular to paragraphs 15.38 to 15.42 and Annex G of the Braithwaite Report (HC 745, 1998&#150;99), which set out the rationale for that arrangement.

 The payment window for the Arable Area Payment Scheme 2004 main payments opened on 16 November 2004 and closes on 31 January 2005.

<p><a name="41206w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s Activity Baseline Review has identified the bee health programme as an area where 20 per cent. savings (equivalent to &#163;250,000 p.a.) could be realised from 2008. We expect to make these savings through a reduced programme of expenditure with the Central Science Laboratory&#039;s National Bee Unit, which implements the programme in England.

We have discussed these proposals with beekeeping organisations, who have registered a number of concerns. We will take these concerns into account in developing and implementing the proposals.

<p><a name="41206w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There has been a 42.7 per cent. reduction in methane emissions in the UK between 1990 and 2002, the most recent year for which data is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w01.html_para2">
Methane is one of the greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Following the decision of Russian to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol it is due to come into force on 16 February 2005. The UK remains on course to achieve its Kyoto target to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. Provisional estimates suggest that in 2003 greenhouse gas emissions were about 14 per cent. below the baseline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w01.html_para3">
A review of the Climate Change Programme was launched on 15 September. The review will evaluate the success of the existing policy measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and will examine the scope for further reductions in the future.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the volumes of methane likely to be released following the effects of climate change in polar regions; and what assessment she has made of the effect that the release of such methane will have on climate change. [200704]</p>




<p><a name="41206w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are currently large uncertainties in the estimates of present-day natural methane fluxes. There are also large uncertainties in the projections of changes in these fluxes under climate change, due both to the responses of methane emissions to warming and the changes in wetland area under climate change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w01.html_para4">
However, modelling studies performed by the Hadley Centre for the UK Climate Prediction programme funded by Defra indication that methane emissions from wetlands north of 45&#176;N will approximately double by 2100 relative to the present day, from 50 to 95 Terragrams per year. It is estimated that this will contribute an additional 1 per cent. to global warming over the 21st Century.
</p>


<p>

It should be noted that this does not consider the potential release of methane from ocean hydrates, which has not yet been quantified, but is the subject of research within the Climate Prediction Programme.

As an interim measure I understand that Wycombe district council and Buckinghamshire county council have agreed that if another flood event occurs (of a magnitude that puts the properties in Firview Close at risk of flooding), they will make arrangements for an emergency headwall to be constructed across the highway ditch with the aim of protecting the properties from river flooding.

I have not seen a copy of this feasibility study. However, I understand that the EA&#039;s preferred option is for a flood bund around the properties in Ferry Lane on both the east and west side of the road including the Abbey. I understand, however, the priority score for the proposal is relatively low and construction is therefore unlikely to progress in the near future.

<p><a name="41206w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I understand the upstream catchment currently supports significant storage of water within the confines of the natural floodplain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w02.html_para4">
The Environment Agency has a statutory duty to maintain water levels of the Thames within a range of +6&quot; to -3&quot; of Standard Head Water Level, marked at the head of each lock. To achieve this, the weir associated with each lock is operated to regulate the amount of flow through it, which will either raise or lower the water level of the reach above the weir. In this way the rate of flow of the river may rise or fall although the level of the river may remain much the same.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w02.html_para5">
After rain, as river flows increase, weir gates are opened to prevent, or to minimise as far as possible, rises in water level. Water is not deliberately held back. When very high flows are experienced, they may exceed the capacity of the river channel at which point it overtops its banks even though the weir may be fully open.

For those sites that choose to be designated as hazardous waste landfills, operators had to apply to the Environment Agency for a permit that contained the operating conditions for the site.

 UNICEF, along with five other NGOs, undertook a study of the needs of Iraqi children made vulnerable by war and its aftermath during the summer of 2003. This study informed decisions on UNICEF project priorities (see below). UNICEF is also continuing its pre-war efforts of assisting children in particular vulnerable situations, such as children living and working on the street, orphaned or disabled children, and children in conflict with the law.

DFID support to the children of Iraq is currently channelled through two main mechanisms. The first is a Civil Service Fund (CSF&#151;&#163;5 million over two years), which is focused on strengthening the capacity of Iraqi civil society organisations (CSO) to better address the needs of the poor and vulnerable groups, especially women and young people. The second is the multi-donor trust fund managed by the United Nations, part of which supports the activities carried out by UNICEF to help vulnerable groups.

<i>[holding answer 29 November 2004]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills has launched the following programmes since 1997 to help young people through offers of advice, support and positive activities, all of which remain in operation: Connexions; Get REAL; Millennium Volunteers; Positive Activities for Young People; the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy; and Transforming Youth Work.

<p>
<a name="41206w07.html_para5">
An important aspect of the Government&#039;s strategy is to involve local people in running activities for young people in their area. The Local Network Fund is

</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w07.html_para6">
The Government made an assessment of services for children, young people and families in the Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; published in September 2003. It concluded that, while much progress has been made, there was scope for services to work together more effectively to help every child and young person achieve better outcomes. This view was supported in consultation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w07.html_para7">
The Government have now legislated through the Children Act 2004 to make changes that will lead to local services working together through children&#039;s trust arrangements to improve outcomes for all children and young people. These reforms will span the front line staff providing integrated services, through the processes that support them, to the plans that set their direction and the governance arrangements that sustain them. The Act is the legislative spine for a wider programme of change: we will shortly publish &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot; setting out the national framework for local change programmes that will turn the Act into reality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w07.html_para8">
The Government remain fully committed to helping all children and young people achieve the best possible outcomes and especially to be healthy, to stay safe, to enjoy and achieve, to make a positive contribution to society, and to achieve economic well-being. That is why we have enshrined these outcomes in the Children Act 2004. A more detailed assessment of programmes and initiatives for young people is being undertaken in the course of developing the Youth Green Paper, which is due to be published in the new year.

<sup>(2)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> Financial data is collected at local authority level and not constituency level and as such figures provided are for Nottinghamshire LEA.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place in Nottinghamshire during 1998 where pre-LGR Nottinghamshire was split into Nottinghamshire LEA and City of Nottingham LEA from 1998&#150;99 onwards.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> The 2002&#150;03 calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately 70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately 50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded from school based expenditure, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(7)</sup> To calculate school based expenditure per pupil, the pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>





<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(9)</sup> To calculate combined LEA and school based expenditure per pupil, the pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included for 1999&#150;2000 onwards. For 1995&#150;96 onwards other LEA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census.<br>

<sup>(10)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> School based expenditure in nursery schools was not recorded in 2002&#150;03.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup>           <br>

<sup>(13)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Equals zero or less than 0.5 per cent.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The sum of the percentages may not equal 100 due to rounding.<br>

2. Teachers may also teach subjects other than PE.<br>

3. The degree category includes higher degrees but exclude BEds.<br>





4. Where a teacher has more than one post A level qualification in PE, the qualification level is determined by the highest level reading from left (Degree) to right (Other Qualification). For example, teachers shown under PGCE have a PGCE but not a degree or BEd in PE, while those with a PGCE and a degree are shown only under Degree.<br>

 The UK&#039;s proposal is that the IFF will be a temporary financing framework specifically designed to raise and allocate money needed to meet the MDGs by 2015.

Participating donors will therefore control the IFF&#039;s mandate on poverty reduction and its accountability.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many customers benefited following the ruling by the Financial Ombudsman Service in the lead cases involving dual interest rates by mortgage lenders; what the total amount involved was; and whether this is the largest sum awarded to customers following a ruling on a particular issue.  [201598]</p>




<p><a name="41206w13.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Financial Ombudsman Service tell me that they first started to receive complaints about dual variable interest rates, in 2001. The Financial Ombudsman Service continued to receive these types of complaints until early 2004. In total, the Financial Ombudsman Service has received 7,256 such complaints. Of the 7,256 complaints received, the Financial Ombudsman Service upheld approximately half of them in favour of the consumer. Where the Financial Ombudsman Service upheld cases, the remedy was to require the lenders concerned to recalculate borrowers&#039; mortgage rates, based on the lower standard rate. In some cases, the remedy also took into account any early repayment charge that a borrower may have paid. The Financial Ombudsman Service does not have a record of the monetary value of these awards.

<p><a name="41206w15.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 It is clear that this is an important challenge for the whole of the UK and I welcome Sir Michael&#039;s recommendations. Although his report does not specifically apply to Northern Ireland, we recognise 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Dec 2004 : Column 327W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
its importance and we have therefore taken the initiative across Government as a whole to ensure they are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland. As a key partner in this critical work, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has established an internal working party to explore the implementation of the Bichard recommendations in the Northern Ireland policing context. The working party comprises operational detectives, staff with particular experience in child protection issues and the investigation of sexual offences, as well as officers with expertise in IT systems and data protection legislation. In addition, a core of staff is working full-time on this project under the direction of the working party.

 Although neither the Bichard report nor the Kelly report apply explicitly to this jurisdiction, it is clear that both contain vital lessons for Northern Ireland. The Government welcome the important protections for children and vulnerable adults contained within the recommendations of these reports, and recognises that it is critical that they should be given the appropriate effect in Northern Ireland. We are therefore taking positive steps to ensure that Northern Ireland benefits from these new measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w15.html_para2">
Urgent work is being taken forward across Government to implement the recommendations of the Bichard Report. In Northern Ireland, a range of organisations are working in partnership to achieve this, including: the Department of Health; Social Services and Public Safety; the Department of Education; the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers; the Police Service of Northern Ireland; the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Northern Ireland Office. A key part of this work will be supporting the implementation of the Kelly Report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w15.html_para3">
In addition, we are also working closely with colleagues in the Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills, and others to ensure that work in Northern Ireland is effectively coordinated with the wider UK implementation programme. In driving this work forward, however, it will clearly be crucial to take the particular needs of Northern Ireland into account.

To ensure fair and equitable arrangements, the fees will be in graduated bands based on the non-domestic rateable value of the premises concerned. Most sports and community clubs will fall at the lower end of these variable fee levels. The draft fees for the new licensing regime were published on 4 November and are open to consultation until 23 December. We have invited comments from sports and community clubs as part of that consultation and will carefully consider all responses before the fee levels are finalised.

<p><a name="41206w19.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The Government have not yet decided whether the United Kingdom requires its own missile defence, and has not received a request from the US to base interceptors in the UK as part of the US missile defence system. It would therefore be premature to consider specific military sites for basing interceptors, or any other part of a missile defence system for the UK. Contacts with the US, including Lieutenant General Obering and other US officials, cover a wide range of issues related to missile defence but do not involve discussions about specific sites.

Notes:<br>

1. Eligibility for NHS sight tests was extended to patients aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. PCTs took over responsibilities from HAs in October 2002.<br>

2. Sight tests can not be equated to the numbers of patients. Although most people do not come back for a sight test within the year, some patients suffering from medical conditions are advised to have re-examinations sooner. However, some patients aged 60 and over will be eligible for sight tests for other reasons as well, for example, on income grounds. The classification for such patients will depend on the patient and the practitioner.<br>

 It is not possible to generate reliable estimates on numbers of undiagnosed active tuberculosis cases in England. Most undiagnosed cases present to the health service at some point during their illness. Delays to diagnosis will result in either recovery, eventual presentation to health services with advanced disease or death.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w26.html_para0">
The number of active tuberculosis cases who recover is unknown and numbers of cases who present with advanced disease are not routinely collected. The number of cases of tuberculosis diagnosed on post-mortem is collected by the Health Protection Agency&#039;s (HPA) enhanced tuberculosis surveillance system. This data represents the number of tuberculosis cases per annum who are found to have tuberculosis at post mortem. Tuberculosis is however not necessarily the cause of death or a contributory factor to death. In a large proportion of these cases, tuberculosis is likely to be an incidental finding.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) groundwater protection code on filling stations contains advice on decommissioning underground storage tanks, and the Environment Agency has powers to enforce the code. In general, the agency expects risks to groundwater from decommissioned tanks to be lower than from active tanks since, at worst, only residual fuel would be likely to remain. The Environment Agency&#039;s risk-based approach to groundwater protection and improvement will be taken forward under the Water Framework Directive.

We have well established processes in place to notify the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate where it becomes apparent that an individual requesting a NINO has immigration restrictions. This process protects the benefit systems from undue loss when a person&#039;s immigration status excludes the right to access public funds and provides the Immigration Service with up to date information on the individual.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will strengthen the powers of the pensions ombudsman to take action against providers of pension schemes when he finds evidence of malpractice or poor service; and if he will make a statement.  [202751]</p>




<p><a name="41206w31.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The pensions ombudsman is an independent statutory commissioner. His powers are quite wide ranging. He can investigate complaints of injustice caused by maladministration and disputes of fact or law brought by members of occupational pension schemes, and their spouses and dependants, against trustees, managers or administrators of those schemes or employers. He may direct any person responsible for the management of the scheme to take or refrain from taking such steps as are specified in his determination. His determination is final and binding and is enforceable in a county court as if it was a judgement or order of the court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w31.html_para2">
The pensions ombudsman can also investigate complaints of injustice from members of personal pension schemes, who have suffered as a result of maladministration carried out by people responsible for provisions in the scheme&#039;s administration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w31.html_para3">
The Pensions Act 2004 further strengthens the pensions ombudsman&#039;s powers by ensuring that where the management or administration of the scheme is outsourced, those with such responsibility should be subject to the pensions ombudsman&#039;s jurisdiction. This provision will come into force shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41206w31.html_para4">
This will enable him to deal with complaints or disputes relating to &quot;one off&quot; acts of administration. An example of this would be an insurance company carrying out a single act, e.g. calculating a transfer value for an insurance policy.

<p>
<a name="41206w31.html_para5">
<i>Letter from David Anderson to Sir Archy Kirkwood, dated 6 December 2004:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the Social Fund delivery in Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders Jobcentre Plus district. This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">It may be helpful if I first explain that Jobcentre Plus Direct uses an advanced call centre telephony system to support the customer services delivered by Jobcentre Plus Direct Contact Centres. These services, which include first customer contact in making claims for working age benefits, do not include the administration of the Social Fund. The administration of the Social Fund is currently delivered from within the district field network, using standard telephony, which is available in almost all Jobcentre Plus local offices. The telephony used to deliver the Social Fund is not part of the Customer Management System IT project.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I am in a position to provide the statistical information you request only for the periods 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05. This is partly because of the district restructuring which occurred in April 2004 and merged the former separate Edinburgh and Lothian and Borders districts and makes earlier data comparison invalid, and also our staff information database which would have confirmed staffing levels only came into operation in April 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">By way of background, Crisis Loan applications by telephone was introduced in Bathgate Jobcentre Plus office on 18 November 2002 and subsequently rolled out to the remainder of the old Lothian and Borders district by August 2004. In what is now the new restructured district, crisis loan applications by telephone have been in operation for approximately one year.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Dec 2004 : Column 380W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Turning to your specific questions, firstly, during the operational year 2003&#150;2004, 59.9 full time equivalent staff were engaged in the administration of Social Fund and this figure has been increased to 61.4 for 2004/05. I regret I am unable to estimate the potential number of Social Fund customers, this is because applications are open to non-Jobcentre Plus customers. However, the actual number of Social Fund Claims received claims received in 2003&#150;04 was 89278, and this year to date, we have received 52172. I am also pleased to say that additional staff are currently working on Crisis Loans in the District to help deal with this volume of activity. In terms of a staff to claims ratio, I regret that data is not available which would fully reflect all aspects of Social Fund activity, for example appeals or abortive claims. I should like to mention that Crisis Loan productivity in Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders District is the highest in Scotland, and above the Jobcentre Plus national average.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There are currently 9 telephone lines available within Bathgate Jobcentre Plus office to deal with Crisis Loan applications. The average time taken for the end to end process from the point of call receipt is between 30 to 45 minutes. Unfortunately due to the nature of the telecommunication system in place, I am not able to answer your other call-type questions.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Finally, during 2003/04, 30 formal complaints were received through our official channels. This number has fallen to 17 complaints this year to date. Unfortunately, at present, I am unable to provide figures for complaints received direct to the district. I will, however, forward this information to you as soon as it is available.</p>

<p><a name="41206w32.html_spnew4"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 Evidence of climate effects from increased ozone concentrations in the atmosphere is well established and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from aircraft are an ozone precursor. The Government have supported several research projects aimed at improving the level of scientific understanding of aircraft NOx effects and the sensitivity to where aircraft fly, most recently the collaborative EC TRADE-OFF project. Around airports, aircraft are one of many contributors to NOx concentrations. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)&#151;formed by NOx&#151;is a target pollutant in the UK Air Quality Strategy and health-based limit values become mandatory in 2010. The Government presses for technology advances and tighter standards that will reduce aircraft source emissions. A 12 per cent. tightening of the international standard for aircraft emissions of NOx for new aircraft types from 2008 was agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation recently. This will be incorporated into UK regulations.

 The Secure Stations scheme is designed to improve and standardise good security practices at overground and underground stations.

 Investigation of all deaths in custody (whether apparently self-inflicted or otherwise) became the responsibility of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman on 1 April 2004.

Three reports into apparently self-inflicted deaths in prisons have been through all their stages and submitted to the respective Coroner. Nine reports into other deaths have also been completed and a further 10 are drafts upon which the relevant service is commenting in line with the Ombudsman&#039;s reporting procedure.

 It is estimated that 10 per cent. of male prisoners and a third of female prisoners report having suffered sexual abuse at some time in their lives. This is based on figures from Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Prisons&#039; (HMCIP) thematic reviews and an Office for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Dec 2004 : Column 394W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

Many factors prevent the disclosure of sexual abuse and it is the least reported of all forms of abuse. Disclosure of sexual abuse is recorded on individual records but not routinely collected.

<p><a name="41206w36.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The steps taken to provide support-based treatment for prisoners who were sexually abused prior to imprisonment vary between prison establishments, reflecting local circumstances. Prison psychologists, for example, may be able to offer one-to-one help in some cases although any sort of psychological or therapeutic work done with victims of sexual abuse is a long process. Help may have to be limited to information and advice, or referring victims to appropriate agencies in their local communities on release. Some prison programmes, such as anger management, may address the impact of abuse indirectly. Prisoners who have a history of sexual abuse are at a greater risk of suicide or self-harm and guidance to staff on managing prisoners who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.

<a name="41206w36.html_para4">
The Women&#039;s Team at Prison Service Headquarters is currently working with a small group of local practitioners (including prison staff and voluntary agencies) to develop Good Practice Principles so that they can achieve consistency in the standard of support offered to women prisoners who report they have suffered abuse. This work will be completed by late 2005 and will draw on a published literature review by Carol-Ann Hooper (2003), University of York on &quot;Abuse, Interventions and Women in Prison&quot;.
