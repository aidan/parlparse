 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on waiting times for cancer treatment.  [182203]</p>








<p><a name="40706w01.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce cancer waiting times. Our ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer than one month from urgent referral to the start of treatment except for clinical reasons or because of patient choice. We hope to achieve this goal by 2008.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what conclusions have been reached on the efficacy of leucodepletion in preventing vCJD infections through blood transfusions.  [163477]</p>








<p><a name="40706w01.html_spnew11"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Expert advice is that, if variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is transmissible through blood, there is a possibility that white blood cells may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vCJD. As a precautionary measure, leucodepletion of all blood components was implemented in October 1999. If there is any infectivity in the blood of vCJD patients, even without leucodepletion, it is too low to measure by the methods currently available.
</p>






<a name="40706w01.html_sbhd12"><h3 align=center>Brain Tumours</h3>





<p><a name="40706w01.html_wqn12"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research his Department has undertaken into brain tumours in the last five years, with particular reference to childhood brain tumours.  [181364]</p>








<p><a name="40706w01.html_spnew12"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 29 June 2004]:</i> The Department is providing funding for a specialised research network on paediatric oncology. The network is led by the United Kingdom children&#039;s cancer study group (UKCCSG). The UKCCSG is currently running sixteen trials on brain and nervous system tumours in children. These trials are being run through the national cancer research network, which is funded by the Department. Details can be found at www.ncrn.org.uk. In addition, the Department funds the UK childhood cancer research group at the University of Oxford, which is responsible for the national registry of childhood tumours including brain tumours.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2004 : Column 608W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w01.html_para4">
The Department is also directly funding various research projects that are relevant to brain tumours including:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">a study at the University of Birmingham&#039;s institute of child health into the relationship between molecular genetic abnormalities and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy biochemical profiles in childhood brain tumours;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext">research on the risk of brain tumours in relation to the use of mobile phones.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w01.html_para5">
The national health service research and development programme on new and emerging applications of technology has funded a project on &quot;Robotic Instrumentation Applied to Novel Therapy for Brain Disorders&quot; and is currently funding another project entitled &quot;Diffusion tensor imaging: a potential tool for improved definition of brain tumour margins and targeted therapy&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w01.html_para6">
The majority of funds for research and development in the NHS are allocated to and managed by NHS organisations. Details of individual projects, including several relevant to childhood brain tumours, can be found on the national research register at www. dh.gov.uk/research.


</p>







<p><a name="40706w01.html_wqn13"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department is taking to increase and improve the training available to <i>(a)</i> general practitioners, <i>(b)</i> nurses, <i>(c)</i> junior doctors, <i>(d)</i> therapists and <i>(e)</i> opticians regarding the symptoms of different forms of brain tumours.  [181320]</p>









<p><a name="40706w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 It is not practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe exactly the content of training that any individual doctor, nurse, therapist or optician will receive. These are matters for the relevant independent regulators, competent authorities or professional bodies. Additionally it is the duty of all health professionals to keep up to date in the sphere of their own practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w01.html_para7">
The Department issued &quot;Referral guidelines for suspected cancer&quot; in 2000 to help general practitioners to identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer and who therefore require urgent assessment by a specialist. These guidelines include a section on brain tumours. The guidelines are currently being updated by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and are due to be published next year.

<p><a name="40706w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 &quot;The New NHS&quot;, published in 1997, set out a vision for the national health service and for primary care trusts (PCTs) as a key driver to improve health and make the NHS modern and dependable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w02.html_para2">
This was followed by two key guidance documents: &quot;Primary Care Trusts: Establishing Better Services&quot; and &quot;Primary Care Trusts: Establishment, the Preparatory Period and Their Function&quot;. Since then, a number of guidance documents have been issued on PCT establishment, functions, membership, governance, commissioning, finance and services. These documents do not specifically give guidance on the services offered at community hospitals.

</p>



<p>(2) what steps have been taken to ensure that all surgeons practicing cosmetic surgery have a cosmetic surgery qualification; and if he will make a statement.  [181204]</p>









<p><a name="40706w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 In order to practise surgery of any kind as an independent practitioner all doctors must be appropriately registered and qualified, in accordance with the National Health Service (Appointment of Consultants) Regulations 1996 when working in the NHS, and the Care Standards Act 2000 when working in the independent sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w02.html_para5">
There is no recognised specialist qualification in cosmetic surgery. It forms part of the approved training in plastic surgery. The decision on whether to accept a new specialist qualification rests with the Secretary of State. In making that decision, he will consult and be advised by the specialist training authority of the medical royal colleges, which is responsible for approving the curriculum of any course of training leading to the award of a certificate of completion of specialist training, which is the normal route for entry to the specialist register.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what Government policy is regarding an enhanced role for the European Union in health care.  [179119]</p>








<p><a name="40706w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The organisation and delivery of health services and medical care and definition of health policy is a matter for member states. This position was confirmed by the 25 European Union member states during the recent intergovernmental conference. However, there are situations where information sharing and increased cooperation between member states on healthcare is beneficial. Where this is appropriate we will support such measures.

<p><a name="40706w02.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 We considered that a technology appraisal in this area might identify benefits to patients and reduce pressures on the national health service. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is also developing a clinical guideline in this area.

 The national health service has a responsibility to ensure that patients are discharged safely.

<p><a name="40706w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Hospital functions directly accountable to modern matrons vary within organisations according to local management arrangements. However, the principles underpinning the role hold across all trusts. Their purpose is to lead clinical care in areas such as infection control and patient nutrition, driving up standards in all departments. Modern matrons have the authority to ensure high standards are set and maintained, and act as a visible presence for patients and relatives.

<p><a name="40706w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 There is no cost to the national health service where postgraduate medical trainees decide to go abroad for part of their training. A centrally held budget, the multi-professional education and training levy, pays the salary replacement costs of postgraduate medical and dental trainees working in the NHS in England, but not while they are working abroad. Such trainees will usually seek financial assistance from charitable trusts or other organisations or may be in salaried employment in a hospital or research institution abroad.

The 15-month window is intended to ensure that annual reviews take place in line with expert advice on best practice, but to allow a little extra time in case the patient is unable to attend their first review appointment. This is an upper limit. General practitioners will make clinical decisions about the frequency of medication reviews according to the differing needs of each individual patient.

<i>[holding answer 28 June 2004]:</i> As part of the review of the Department&#039;s arm&#039;s length bodies the Department&#039;s commercial directorate was commissioned to review the national health service supply chain, which is delivered through the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) and NHS Logistics Authority. The review has identified scope for considerable savings through strengthening the national procurement functions, accelerating the implementation of collaborative trust procurement and streamlining logistics and distribution throughout the NHS supply chain. The review was undertaken in consultation with management and staff and has led to the new supply chain excellence programme.
</p>


<p>

 In 1983, the Black advisory group was commissioned by the Government to investigate reports of a high incidence of leukaemia occurring in young people living in the village of Seascale, three kilometres from the Sellafield nuclear site and the suggestion that there might be an association between the leukaemia incidence and the radioactive discharges from Sellafield. The advisory group confirmed that there was a higher incidence of leukaemia in young people resident in the area but also concluded that the estimated radiation dose from the Sellafield discharges and other sources, received by the local population, could not account for the observed leukaemia incidence on the basis of knowledge available at that time. The uncertainties in the available data led the advisory group to make recommendations for further research.. The committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (COMARE) was established in November 1985 in response to the final recommendation of the report of the independent advisory group chaired by Sir Douglas Black (Black, 1984). Its terms of reference are to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;assess and advise Government and the Devolved Authorities on the health effects of natural and man-made radiation in the environment and to assess the adequacy of the available data and the need for further research&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>

Since that time, COMARE has produced eight reports concerning possible health effects from exposure to environmental radiation.

 Lack of clear and accurate information for young people about sexual health is one of the key factors contributing to the high rates of unintended teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. The teenage pregnancy strategy produces materials for young people through the &quot;RU Thinking&quot;? information campaign, to enable them to make informed, responsible choices. These materials are tested with young people and parents and are available for local teenage pregnancy strategies to disseminate in relevant community settings for young people. The choice of the most appropriate venues to reach young people is for local discretion, and no information is held centrally on this.

1. In 2001, the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) was introduced for all official statistics and surveys. It replaces Social Class based on occupation and Socio-Economic Group (SEG). There is no longer a manual/non-manual split in the NS-SEC, however, the old socio-economic groupings have been recreated in order to continue monitoring the Cancer Plan target.<br>

2. In 2000, the decision was made to weight the data to compensate for under representation of people in some groups. The table shows weighted and unweighted data for 1998 to give an 



indication of the effect of weighting. Caution should be exercised when comparing weighted data for 2000 onwards with unweighted data for previous years.<br>

 The regulations to bring the selling of insurance into the scope of FSA regulation implement the European Union&#039;s Insurance Mediation Directive. The Directive requires the UK to regulate everyone who sells general insurance. This includes those firms where the selling of insurance is an &quot;incidental&quot; part of the firm&#039;s business. The Government have no discretion to exclude insurance in particular sectors, such as the property and construction sector from regulation. The only exclusions the Directive permits are limited to

<p>
<a name="40706w06.html_para2">
The Government have consulted widely on the regulatory regime, publishing a public consultation document including draft regulations and a draft regulatory impact assessment in October 2002. Following analysis of the responses to the consultation, Parliament approved legislation on 24 June 2003. The activities to be regulated are: introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance; assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and concluding contracts of insurance. In drawing up its rules for insurance mediation, the FSA has carried out extensive public consultations and cost benefit analyses on its rules. Further information is available from the FSA&#039;s website, www.fsa.gov.uk.

<a name="40706w06.html_para3">
In implementing the Directive, the Government have sought to work closely with interested parties to develop an approach which is proportionate and which meets our obligations under European law. In drawing up its rules, the FSA has carried out public consultations and cost benefit analyses. Both the FSA and the Government have been careful to take account of the impact on small businesses. For example the FSA sets fees according to the volume of business that a firm undertakes, with application fees being lowest for the smallest firms.

My officials met with representatives from the RICS to discuss these concerns and we are carefully considering the issues raised.

FSA consultation papers are publicly available on the FSA website and hard copies are available on request from the FSA. The FSA have ensured that all consultation publications on the regulation of mortgage firms and insurance intermediaries, including CP174, have been supported with an introductory &#039;newsletter&#039;. Copies of the newsletters were mailed via relevant current voluntary regulators, trade associations and insurance product providers to approximately 28,500 intermediaries and potentially affected firms. The FSA also held several seminars, at no cost to attendees, around the UK which included an overview of our consultation and a questions and answer session.

The diversity of interest and needs among the Mortgage and General Insurance population means that trade associations and other industry groups&#039; role in developing the awareness of their members is critical, which is why the FSA have worked closely with such groups. The FSA has made contact with every group it has identified as affected by regulation. For more than a year, the FSA have been running an extensive communications strategy for firms incorporating press and media work, advertising, direct mail, a website, speaking programme, industry training, trade association liaison and production of a suite of guidance materials.

Ad hoc testing can be instigated at any time by the DVM in order to check the status of entire herds following, for instance, confirmation of TB in contiguous cattle herds, culture positive RTA badger carcases, suspected cases of TB found during routine meat inspection or where TB is traced back from cattle movements into a herd where TB has been confirmed.</p>

 It has been a legal requirement in the UK since 1977 for labels giving fuel economy information to be fixed to all new cars on display in showrooms. More recently, requirements for the labelling of passenger cars were introduced into UK law in the form of regulations implementing EU Directive 1999/94/EC. These regulations require a label to be displayed on all new car models in showrooms, listing their CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions performance and fuel consumption. Manufacturers must also include these same figure in all printed adverts, brochures and manuals.

The European Commission is currently in the process of reviewing Directive 1000/94/EC. As part of this review, it has commissioned consultants to evaluate the effectiveness of the Directive&#039;s current provisions. This review may conclude that the Directive should be amended to require the labels to have an A-G style format, similar to that already used in labels on some electrical goods. The UK has made clear to the European Commission that it would favour such an approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w07.html_para4">
In parallel, the UK Government has asked the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP) to develop a proposal for a voluntary UK car labelling scheme, with an A-G style energy efficiency format. The Government hopes that the Partnership will reach agreement on the scope and format of such a label later this year. This would allow a new A-G style energy efficiency label for passenger cars to be introduced in the UK on a voluntary basis during 2005, as an interim measure in advance of any similar mandatory EU label.

 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds including the cormorant. This Act implements the EC Wild Birds Directive in Great Britain. There are no plans to review the protected status of the cormorant.

<p>
<a name="40706w08.html_para0">
However, we have accepted for some time that cormorants can and do cause damage to certain fisheries. For this reason the Department issues individual licences under Section 16 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to allow cormorants to be killed or taken as an aid to scaring. It is our firm intention, and the legislation requires, that licences will not be issued to applicants who have not tried all reasonable non-lethal methods (such as refuges) to resolve problems. However, despite seeking alternative solutions, problems do persist in certain areas which is why we are actively considering measures that could help fishery owners and angling clubs deal with the increasing problem of predation by cormorants.

IPPC will ensure that the environmental impacts of these farms are assessed and minimised. New farms must apply for a PPC permit before they can carry out their operations and existing farms must apply for a permit by 31 January 2007.

<p>
<a name="40706w08.html_para4">
Regulators are required by statute to recover their costs from the operators they regulate. In England and Wales, the Environment Agency has made a particular effort to lower the cost of regulation through the development of an &#039;off the shelf&#039; permit for farmers, provided that they can comply with &quot;Standard Farming Installation Rules&quot;. In the period 2004&#150;05, the standard fee for a PPC permit application is 3,024. Once a permit is issued, the Environment Agency will charge an annual subsistence fee to cover the costs incurred in assessing compliance and maintaining the permit. These fees are 2,095 for a standard permit holder or 2,626 for the largest farms (more than 400,000 poultry, 20,000 production pigs, or 7,500 sows). For the purposes of the permit application, some farmers may decide to employ consultants to help them to complete the necessary records, audits and plans. The Standard Farming Rules, which were developed in consultation with industry, are based on &quot;Best Available Techniques&quot; (BAT) that aims to balance the cost to the operator against the benefits to the environment. Some of these techniques may be expensive, particularly for those older farms that have suffered from lack of capital investment in recent years. The changes will be sought through improvement conditions established on a farm-by-farm basis, at timescales agreed between the Environment Agency and the farmer.

Data collected by the LSC in the Staff Individualised Record (SIR) show that in 2002/03 there were just over 134,000 teaching staff, of which about 84,000 had a recognised teaching qualification.

<p><a name="40706w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Teacher Training Agency is funded to support local education authority-based recruitment managers who can provide a co-ordinated local approach to vacancy filling for schools facing the greatest recruitment and retention problems. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s housing support schemes have helped teachers living in some high property cost areas. All schools must meet salary costs from the budget allocated by their local education authority, but the school funding system includes a factor to reflect the higher costs of recruitment and retention in some areas. The statutory pay arrangements give significant discretion to schools to make pay decisions to address any local recruitment and retention difficulties.

<i>[holding answer 22 June 2004]:</i> The available data show that in 2003&#150;04 Brent allocated &#163;2,772,000 to transport of pupil to special schools.

We have, however, given popular and successful schools a presumption that they can expand, whether there are surplus places in the area or not. Surplus places may represent a poor use of resources, particularly where schools perform poorly. One consideration for LEAs is whether the resources used to fund empty places would be better deployed to fund further places in popular and successful schools.

 Good, experienced teachers have been able to cross the performance threshold since September 2000 and the cost of this is fully funded by central Government. Such teachers may also make further progress along the upper pay scale, should their performance merit it.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will commission a joint review with the Attorney-General&#039;s office of the reasons why no prosecutions for bribery of a foreign public official have been brought under <i>(a)</i> the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and <i>(b)</i> other legislation dealing with corruption offences since 1989.  [181836]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2004 : Column 656W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40706w15.html_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 No. The legislation on bribery is contained in the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889&#150;1916, which were amended by the 2001 Act. Home Office figures show that over the 10 years, 1993&#150;2002, the average annual number of prosecutions for all types of bribery under these Acts, whether in the public or private sector, was 21. We do not keep a record of the persons bribed. While there has been only one reported Appeal Court case concerning a prosecution for bribery of a foreign public official (Raud, 1989 Crim LR 809), in the period it is not necessarily the most recent case of its kind. Also, cases involving bribery may give rise to other charges. The prosecution of the bribery of foreign public officials has to be viewed in this context.

 Both the DTI and Ofgem have been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at improving the position of smaller generators.

<p>
<a name="40706w19.html_para5">
With regard to the Balancing and Settlement Code, Ofgem has considered and approved a number of modifications. For example, a revision of the definition of the System Buy and Sell Prices has significantly reduced the spread of imbalance prices and thus the risk to which smaller generators in particular are exposed. Modifications have also been made to National Grid Transco&#039;s charging methodology, which now allows &quot;embedded benefits&quot; to be paid directly to generators in certain circumstances, which again will particularly benefit smaller generators. In this area, it is primarily the role of the Balancing and Settlement Code Panel to assess the impact of measures, and for industry participants to bring forward modifications to the code if they are considered unsatisfactory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w19.html_para6">
In the context of the future British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements, the DTI and Ofgem have recognised the special position of smaller generators through the provision of a discount for small transmission-connected generators in Scotland.

More generally, the Distribution Commercial Forum, which is facilitated by Ofgem, is responsible for assisting industry participants in improving the governance framework of the existing distribution connection and use of system arrangements. The Distribution Generation Working Group&#151;jointly chaired by Ofgem and DTI&#151;is looking at ways in which the barriers to the connection of smaller-scale generation can be removed, and their contribution to the system in terms of losses, contribution to security and other embedded benefits can be fully recognised.

<p><a name="40706w19.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Department does not make estimates of gas import needs for individual sectors such as power stations.

This report suggests that perhaps 40 per cent. of our gas needs will be imported by 2010 and 80 per cent. or more by 2020. But the actual extent of import dependency is inevitably uncertain. In its recently published 17th report (&quot;Gas: Liberalised Markets and Security of Supply&quot;, HL Paper 105), the House of Lords European Union Committee has asserted that the UK will be importing around 50 per cent. of its gas requirements by 2010 and around 70 per cent. in 2020.

 Since the Department&#039;s Regulatory Impact Assessment of 21 June 2002, the Government have taken a number of initiatives to bear down on the problem of abandoned vehicles.

<p><a name="40706w20.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 In the following table are some statistics, which show that in some degrees which require Science and Maths A levels such as medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, more women than men are studying, and becoming qualified in these subjects. However these statistics also highlight that there is still significant female under-representation in vital SET courses such as the Physical Sciences, Engineering and IT.

<a name="40706w20.html_para0">
Overall the number of female science, engineering and technology (SET) graduates is increasing. However, only one in every three SET graduates in 2002 were women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40706w20.html_para1">
More men apply for, accept and obtain higher education qualifications in SET and SET-related subjects than women but as the statistics show, the picture is very different depending on the precise nature of the subject.

<p>
<a name="40706w20.html_para2">
The work being done in schools and further education colleges to enthuse young girls to take up these subjects is the beginning of the process to encourage girls and women to take SET degrees, especially in those areas where there is a definite gender imbalance. As part of the Government&#039;s new strategy <sup>1</sup> , a new UK Resource Centre for Women in SET aimed at working with employers, professional bodies and individuals in SET will be launched on 16 September 2004. The Government have allocated &#163;800,000 per annum for three years to set up and operate the new Centre and an additional &#163;500,000 per annum of the development of a dedicated returners package. The Resource Centre will hold pump-priming funds that will be used to fund innovative or proven projects, including &#163;200,000 separately provided by DfES to the Centre for schemes in higher education institutions to put support measures in place that aid the retention and progression of women science undergraduates into the science labour force.

Space heating and hot water account for 80 per cent. of energy use in households, and over half of energy use in the service sector.

 The land referred to belongs to the Department of the Environment (DOE). It was purchased in 1987 to facilitate a Roads Scheme. On completion of the scheme a considerable area was undeveloped and surplus to requirements. The Belfast Regeneration Office (BRO) took the lands for a social development project, but their remit changed and the project did not proceed. At the time of devolution, it was agreed that DOE would retain the land and the Environment and Heritage Service was assigned responsibility for it while BRO continued to act for the Department in taking forward the disposal. In line with procedures for the disposal of surplus land, expressions of interest were sought. The application from Habinteg Housing Association, supported by the Department for Social Development, was accepted subject to planning permission being secured.

The proposal, comprising two planning applications that were both accompanied by an Environmental Statement, is still under consideration by Planning Service. The land in question is not classified as a protected landscape. It is currently identified as open space in Belfast Urban Area Plan (2001) and the Lisburn Area Plan (2001). However, although Planning Policy Statement 8 affords protection to existing or proposed open space, the policy does also allow for the loss of open space in specific circumstances. Issues such as open space, biodiversity, wildlife and the Ulster Way will all be carefully considered as part of the planning process, which includes consultation with relevant bodies.

by the Department of the Environment. This is considered necessary, in the interests of public safety, to ensure that all operational arrangements required for the effective operation and enforcement of the legislation are in place and to allow for the preparation of guidance and standards for prospective licence holders. I expect it to take three months for this work to be completed and the licence provisions brought into operation. Thereafter, existing owners will have a further period of 90 days to apply for a licence, during which time they may continue to keep the animal.
