 The Department's 1998 research study, &#147;Key research on easier home buying and selling&#148;, reported that 28 per cent. of transactions fail between offer acceptance and completion, or the equivalent of 467,000 failures at current transaction rates. The tracking surveys in the 1998 study also recorded details, where known, of the costs incurred by people whose purchase or sale had fallen through. The research found that the average cost of a failed transaction was &#163;906 (&#163;680 for buyers and &#163;206 for sellers). Over a thousand respondents provided these details. However to take account of the relatively small sample size, the estimate of the total cost of transaction failure was adjusted downwards.

When reaching that decision, the decision maker must be satisfied that the customer or their representative has failed to disclose or has misrepresented a material fact, including a change in their circumstances. Where an overpayment has arisen as a result of a customer's misrepresentation or failure to disclose, Section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 allows the recovery of that overpayment.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i> Notes:</i><i> </i>1. Projections of numbers receiving pension credit in the future are subject to a range of uncertainties and a number of factors including policies on uprating different benefits and assumptions on rates of take-up. The assumptions applied here are consistent with those that underpin published long-run expenditure projections, and are applied to projections of the number of pensioner households estimated to be eligible for pension credit. 2. Care should be taken when interpreting these projections. In particular data deficiencies make it difficult to be confident in the split between the number of people who may be in receipt of only  the guarantee credit and those who may be in receipt of both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. Also the projections are sensitive to the assumed take-up rates (the same assumptions on the rate of take-up are applied to the current and reform projections).  3. Estimates of the proportion of pensioners eligible for pension credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models.  4. The projections of the number of pensioners eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.  5. The projections of the number of male pensioners currently aged over 65 years who may be eligible for pension credit in 2010 have been derived from projections of the proportion of males aged 69+ in 2010 who may be eligible and projections of the number of males aged 69+ in Great Britain in 2010. A similar procedure was followed in estimating the number who may be eligible in 2012 and the number of females currently aged over 60 years who may be eligible in 2010 and 2012.  6. The reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.  7. The projections in Table 1 assume that basic state pension is uprated in line with prices and the standard guarantee credit with prices each year after 2008. It should be noted that there is a Government commitment to uprate the standard guarantee credit with earnings until 2008. Treasury projections for the current system assume price uprating of the standard guarantee credit beyond 2008.  8. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-5 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-5 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.  9. The projections are rounded to the nearest 50,000.  10. Qualifying age for the guarantee credit will increase with women's state pension age between 2010 and 2020, from 60 to 65.<br>

 Pensioners do not have to have a bank account to receive pension credit. However, we have always made it clear that payment into a bank account is the best option for the overwhelming majority of customers, and so it is only right that we alert customers to the fact that there are accounts that may better meet their needs. For example, many are missing out on the savings that direct debits can bring and on interest paid on balances. Around 25 different bank accounts can be accessed at Post Office branches now. The Post Office has already introduced one new account&#151;the Instant Saver&#151;and plans to introduce more new accounts in the future.</p>

Weight constraints mean it is not possible to provide additional armour.

In addition, there are certain victimless crimes in various offence classifications but they cannot be separately identified from other crimes where there is a victim.

<i> [holding answer 13 September 2006]:</i> Following difficulties experienced in meeting the demand for home oxygen cylinders, especially standard and lightweight ambulatory cylinders, arrangements have now been made to make more cylinders available. The majority of patients in the two regions in the South East of England serviced by Allied Respiratory have transferred to the new supplier. Remaining patients are continuing to receive their oxygen cylinders through community pharmacies and are expected to transfer to Allied Respiratory over the next few weeks. Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts continue to monitor the situation and work with the supplier and clinicians to ensure patient&#146;s needs are met.</p>

This fact-finding exercise is expected to take between three to six months, at which stage the OFT will consider whether a further detailed investigation of the fairness of individual bank default charges is needed.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 September 2006]: </i>Our latest estimate (2005) is based on a comparison of the Vehicle register, maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and the Motor Insurance Database. It is that there are about 2 million vehicles (about 6 per cent. of the UK vehicle fleet) being driven by uninsured drivers. There are no similar comparisons for earlier years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="60918w0016.htm_para0"><a name="06091937001036">In order to strengthen enforcement activity to tackle motor insurance evaders we introduced two new measures last year. First, to give the police improved access to the Motor Insurance Database to enhance their capability to detect uninsured driving by using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="60918w0016.htm_para1"><a name="06091937001037">Second, powers to allow the police to seize vehicles being driven uninsured. Both these measures are proving effective with the police seizing nearly 600 uninsured vehicles a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="60918w0016.htm_para2"><a name="06091937001038">In addition we are seeking powers in the Road Safety Bill to introduce a scheme of Continuous Insurance Enforcement which would enable us to enforce the requirement for motor insurance from the record. This means that rather than having to rely on spotting an uninsured vehicle on-road we can identify, from the database, vehicles where insurance policies have lapsed and not been renewed. This will enable us to target all such evaders, rather than just the necessarily smaller numbers that it is possible to identify on-road.</p>
