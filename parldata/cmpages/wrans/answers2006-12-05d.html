 Recent consultancy work, carried out on behalf of DEFRA, estimates that 24,850 tonnes of household batteries were sold in the UK in 2003. The great majority of these were alkaline manganese and zinc carbon varieties. There has been no legislative requirement for waste household batteries to be separately collected and detailed statistics have not therefore been kept. However, we estimate that various local voluntary schemes have resulted in a capture rate of less than 2 per cent.</p>

Member states have two years to transpose this measure into national law. This is a &#147;producer responsibility&#148; directive and, as such, the onus on collection and recycling will fall on battery producers in the first instance. However, local authorities are also likely to play a role given their current involvement in the collection of household waste. The exact form this may take will not be decided until the completion of formal domestic consultation with all parties concerned.</p>

 Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally. The sector accounts for 36 per cent. of methane and 67 per cent. of nitrous oxide emissions in the UK, but only 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. About 80 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive system of animals (sheep, pigs and bovines), and 20 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>

 While carbon sequestration by forestry is a useful tool for offsetting some greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration in cropland and pasture through new management practices is less certain. This is because new management practices have to be followed for a substantial period of time in order to record additional carbon storage. Also, several years of stored carbon could be released by a change of practice in just one season.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 November 2006]: </i>The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) recently published an Achievement Report. This included details of progress made on minimising waste through composting, reusable nappies, and in the retail sector. Progress made included:</p>

The challenge in relation to reusable nappies, because of the convenience of disposable nappies, was recognised from the outset.

 There is sufficient landfill capacity in England to meet current waste disposal needs. Future capacity is difficult to predict. However, a number of Government policies are designed to significantly reduce the amount of waste being sent to landfill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="61205w0004.htm_para9"><a name="06120593000442">More challenging waste targets, progressively lower landfill limits and the escalating landfill tax will all help the UK to move away from its reliance on landfill.

 Rail fares are set by train operators, not by Government. Fares which are regulated must be set within the limits laid down by fares regulation, which restricts annual average increases to inflation + 1 per cent. Other fares are a commercial matter for the operator concerned. Bids for franchises will take into account both the restrictions imposed by fares regulation and the bidders&#146; views of how the train service can best be developed, priced and marketed.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 December 2006]: </i>The Department does not set aside funding specifically for the installation of sprinklers in schools. It is for local authorities to decide what they do with the funding they are allocated. They can use it to install sprinklers where their need is demonstrated by a risk assessment, or where they represent value for money. Where a local authority has a general policy of installing sprinklers in schools, and need or value for money is not demonstrated in a particular project, it can of course provide additional funding to cover sprinklers.</p>

We therefore commissioned consultants to analyse case studies of school projects where sprinklers have been installed. They are establishing reliable figures for both installation and maintenance costs, and developing these into a full cost benefit analysis.

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="61205w0009.htm_para1"><a name="061205100001470">The figures are for the average number of staff employed by the LSC each year and include temporary staff and agency staff. A rise in staff numbers occurred between March 2002 and March 2003 as the LSC began to build up the organisation, and took on significant new responsibilities, including the funding of school sixth forms. During 2004 the LSC undertook a re-shaping exercise which resulted in a fall in numbers in March 2005. Staff numbers subsequently increased slightly, reflecting the further work which was transferred by the Department to the LSC during 2005, including education maintenance allowances. However, we anticipate a reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 as a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This new structure aims to make the LSC more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. This process is now nearing completion, and will achieve estimated savings of up to &#163;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

We are committed to further reducing the numbers of failing and underperforming schools. The Education and Inspection Act contains measures to give local authorities additional powers to tackle underperformance, to ensure that fewer schools become a cause for concern, and to enable local authorities to turn around more quickly those schools which do get into difficulties.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="10"><sup>(1)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup>. 1999-00 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1996 and York LA was separated out from North Yorkshire LA. Hence what was previously regarded as North Yorkshire Local Authority (pre-LGR) was split into new North Yorkshire and York local authorities.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> The 1999-00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
<sup>(8 )</sup>Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-00.<br>
<sup>(9 )</sup>School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>
<sup>(10 )</sup>Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup>. 1999-00 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1996 and York LA was separated out from North Yorkshire LA. Hence what was previously regarded as North Yorkshire Local Authority (pre-LGR) was split into new North Yorkshire and York local authorities.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> The 1999-00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
<sup>(8 )</sup>Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-00.<br>
<sup>(9 )</sup>School based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>

<i> [holding answer 28 November 2006]:</i> The bid document did not include VAT and the candidate file pointed out that the UK Government would ensure that tax issues will not have a significant impact on the Games. The bid document included contingency and preliminaries of 23.5 per cent. in main venue costs. It also included a contingency for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. The bid did not include provision for an Olympic Delivery Partner. This proposal was made following the establishment of the Olympic Delivery Authority. The use of a delivery partner will help to ensure the highest levels of programme management and cost control.</p>

The police (and CPS where appropriate) will consider whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances. If the suspect has previously received a caution, a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), a caution can be used.</p>

Depending on the seriousness of the offence, a reprimand is normally given for a first offence and a final warning for a second offence. If a young person who has been given a final warning commits a further offence he or she must be charged (the only exception is where it is at least two years since the previous warning and the offence is not so serious as to require a charge, in which case a further warning can be given).</p>

Although sufficient to estimate higher orders of data, these data are not robust enough at a detailed level and have been excluded from the table.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. The tables show annual numbers of self-harm and assaults incidents in prisons in England and Wales to the nearest thousand.<br>
2. The number of self-harm incidents and assaults reported are derived from the Prison Service Incident Reporting System (IRS). This system processes high volumes of data supplied by prisons and is constantly being updated. The numbers indicated provide a useful indication of the realistic scale of assaults and self-harm incidents, many of which are relatively minor. The numbers should not be interpreted as absolute.<br>
3. The increase in reported numbers of assaults reflects, in part, the increase in prison population.<br>

 In the current recruitment exercise for probation board chairs and members we have sought to attract applicants from across the public, private and not for profit sectors. We have particularly sought to attract individuals with &#145;business acumen&#146; in whichever sector such skills have been obtained. During the present process we have written directly to the Magistrates&#146; Association, and the LGA, as well as to such organisations as Lions and Rotary Clubs, to encourage applicants with diverse experiences. This has been supported by considerable additional activity to encourage applicants from BME and other traditionally under represented groups.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
 1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

However, one of the key success factors for residents&#146; parking schemes is effective enforcement. At that time, the Police Service of Northern Ireland was responsible for the enforcement of parking restrictions, but indicated that they could not provide resources to carry out this enforcement. No schemes have therefore been implemented to date.</p>

On 17 November 2006 we launched a draft policy consultation on residents&#146; parking, which will end on 9 February 2007.</p>
</ul><a name="61205w0026.htm_brev3"><a name="06120610004559"><ul><p class="tabletext">While we have received a number of enquiries in relation to residents&#146; parking schemes, none of these will be considered in detail until the consultation has been completed and a policy developed. However, I can advise that following publication of the residents&#146; parking policy, it is intended that the first residents&#146; parking schemes will be implemented towards the end of next year.</p>

 The eruption of Mount Nyamulagira in North Kivu, DRC has been anticipated for some time. Fortunately for the population of this troubled region, this volcano is situated within the Virunga National Park, which is largely uninhabited. Lava flows are being monitored by the Goma Volcano Observatory, and while it is still possible that lava may reach the Sake-Goma road, the speed of the flows has reduced considerably. To date the impact on inhabitants of the area has been minimal, but the situation will continue to be assessed.</p>

DFID is providing support to the Goma Volcano Observatory to increase its technical capacity to monitor the status of these two volcanoes and to establish a risk management unit to carry out contingency planning and emergency response preparation. The Observatory is funded through the UN and works closely with local authorities in North Kivu and Rwanda, other UN agencies and NGOs. If it becomes necessary to evacuate people from the area, support will be provided through the rapid response mechanism (RRM)&#151;a contingency fund established in DRC to ensure emergency assistance is provided as quickly as possible, supported by the UK and other partners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="61205w0027.htm_para8"><a name="06120610004177">The recent fighting in Sake (25 km west of Goma) and surrounding areas between combatants loyal to renegade army commander General Nkunda and MONUC/FARDC forces has caused considerable disruption in the area, with approximately 15,000 people displaced. The area is now quiet again, but people are delaying their return home, fearing looting. A joint UN/NGO assessment mission has reviewed the situation and made a first distribution of food and other essential items to those in need, using RRM resources. The humanitarian agencies on the ground will continue to monitor and respond to the needs of the population until they can safely return home.</p>

We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&#147;flexible service delivery&#148;).</p>

The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs if she will review the provisions of the Limitation Act 1980 in so far as they apply to victims of child sexual abuse. [104690]</p>

 Under the current law, legal proceedings seeking civil damages for child abuse are usually brought as actions for trespass against the person in relation to intentionally inflicted injuries and as actions for negligence in other cases. The limitation period for trespass against the person is six years from the date on which the cause of action arose, although this period will not start to run until the child reaches the age of majority. In relation to actions for negligently inflicted injuries, the period is three years from the cause of action or from the date of knowledge (if later) of the person injured. The court has discretion to allow certain actions for negligently inflicted personal injuries to be brought even though the limitation period has expired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_591"><a name="61205w0032.htm_para3"><a name="06120648000181">In its 2001 report &#147;Limitation of Actions&#148; (Law Com 270), the Law Commission recommended that the general law of limitation should be reformed. Under its proposals, a child abuse claim for trespass against the person or for negligence would have to be brought within three years from the date on which the claimant knew (or ought reasonably to have known) the facts giving rise to the cause of action, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. As now, time would not run while the claimant was a minor. In addition, the court would have discretion to disapply the limitation period if it would be unjust not to allow the claim to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="61205w0032.htm_para4"><a name="06120648000182">In July 2002, the Government announced their acceptance, in principle, of the Commission's recommendations, subject to further consideration of several issues. In relation to child abuse cases, as announced in the Home Office publication &#147;Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System in Favour of the Law Abiding Majority: cutting crime, reducing re-offending and protecting the public&#148; (July 2006), we intend to consult on whether limitation periods are fair to people who have been injured as a result of crime. When the work on the outstanding issues is complete, we will seek an opportunity to introduce a Bill to reform the law.</p>

Because MOD introduced a new bonus system for the main body of staff in 2003, we are only able to supply four years of data. The Ministry of Defence also awards special bonuses to individuals and teams for exceptional performance in a specific task or for the achievement of professional qualifications which benefit MOD and the individual; these are shown in table four. The final table (five) shows the total value of all bonuses paid: in cash terms and as a percentage of the total civilian workforce.</p>

 For the last three years the Department has funded Defence Schools Presentations Teams (DSPT) which tour secondary schools giving a half day interactive presentation about defence to 14 to 16-year-olds. There are five such teams covering different areas of the country, and over the last year they visited about 460 schools (about 10 per cent. of the total number in the country serving this age group). These presentations are generally well received and do allow us to get some of our messages over about the importance of defence. The investment here is about &#163;2.1 million a year and we have reviewed our approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_610"><a name="61205w0034.htm_para1"><a name="06120648000405">The Department will be introducing a new schools e-learning product. Through creating an educational website called &#147;Defence Dynamics&#148;, our main focus will be to provide Secondary School teachers of 14 to 16-year-olds with pre-packaged electronic lesson plans with Defence themes. Defence Dynamics will start with the delivery in September 2007 of 40 plus lesson plans with audio-visuals in Science, Maths and English based on scenarios that reflect the professional work of the MOD and the armed forces worldwide. The material will be developed to support the requirements of the school curriculum and across a range of subject areas in the longer term. MOD will be working closely with DfES and the devolved Government education Departments in the UK. Initially the Defence Dynamics programme will run for two years with the aim to develop this for the long-term. A similar e-learning approach has been used successfully in Australian schools for three years (&#147;Defence 2020&#148;).</p>

 File WO208/3548 and extract WO208/3654, were originally reviewed in accordance with the terms of the Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967. They were assessed as being suitable for permanent preservation at the Public Record Office (now The National Archives) but were judged then to be too sensitive for release. They were therefore retained in the Department in accordance with section 3(4) of the Public Records Act with the approval of the Lord Chancellor. Their sensitivity would routinely have been re-reviewed every 10 years.</p>

 The 18 weeks target focuses on hospital consultant pathways. Over time, patients with hearing problems who do not need to see a hospital consultant have increasingly been referred direct to audiology services, enabling services led by ear, nose and throat consultants for example to focus on more complex cases. Direct access services should be quicker for patients because they cut out a stage of the potential pathway, and it would be perverse to reverse this. Nevertheless there are currently long waits for direct access audiology services and the action plan for publication in early 2007 will address this.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice the Department offers to pharmacists on the purchase and supply of mannitol powder; what measures she has put in place to prevents its illicit use; and whether she has plans for further restrictions on its availability. [107581]</p>

 None. As far as licensed medicinal products are concerned, mannitol is available as an intravenous infusion and is a prescription only medicine which means that pharmacists may only dispense it against a prescription issued by an appropriate practitioner. Mannitol is also used widely as an excipient (i.e. an inactive ingredient) by the pharmaceutical industry in the manufacture of other medicinal products.</p>

There is an established mechanism to allow proper consideration of making drugs of misuse controlled. The advisory council on the misuse of drugs (the expert body that advises Ministers) is made aware of problems posed by specific drugs, or where they are requested by Ministers to consider a specific drug, they will undertake a detailed assessment of whether or not a substance ought to be controlled and make appropriate recommendations to Ministers.</p>

1. The postcode of the dental practice was used to allocate dentists to specific geographic areas. PCT areas have been defined using the Office for National Statistics all fields postcode directory.<br>
 2. Dentists consist of principals, assistant and trainees. Information on NHS dentistry in the community dental service, in hospitals and in prisons is excluded.<br>
3. The data in this report are based on national health service dentists on PCT lists. These details were passed on to the Business Services Authority (BSA) who paid dentists based on activity undertaken. A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data do not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.<br>
4. PDS schemes had varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations are estimated using &#147;proxy registrations&#148;, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations were not estimated for periods before September 2003&#151;actual registrations were used before this date.<br>
 5. Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, eg dental access centres, and are therefore not directly comparable with later data.<br>
