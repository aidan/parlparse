 Defra commissioned several analyses of the likely impacts of the reform proposals before they were agreed, to help inform the Government&#039;s negotiating position. In addition analysis of the redistribution of subsidy and other effects arising from implementation of the Single Payment Scheme in England was carried out in-house. These studies are all published on Defra&#039;s website. A programme to monitor and evaluate the CAP reforms is also being put in place. This will include a CAP Environmental Observatory to monitor the environmental impacts of changing farm practices and production levels, and a project to analyse the economic linkages of the agricultural industry, including the Single Payment Scheme, with the wider rural economy.

 By decoupling subsidy and implementing the Single Payment Scheme in England, as announced on 22 April, the Government are providing a policy framework conducive to encouraging enterprise and market orientation in line with the Strategy for Sustainable Food and Farming. Future prospects for agriculture depend on various factors but the Government are optimistic that farmers and growers will rise to the challenges and opportunities that present themselves.

 Almost all the recommendations of the 1999 Braithwaite Report have been implemented by the House of Commons Commission.

The Commission frequently discusses House governance issues; most recently, at its June and July meetings, considering the recommendations of a major review of IS/IT governance, which will be taken forward in consultation with the Information Committee and the authorities of the House of Lords. In the circumstances, I see no current need for a broader review.

 DFID is in regular contact with the Kenyan Government on this issue. DFID&#039;s Kenya Country Assistance Plan recognises that budget support is Kenya&#039;s preferred form of aid. It also makes clear that the level of British aid to Kenya, and whether or not DFID will provide bilateral poverty reduction budget support, will depend on the pace with which the Kenyan Government implements its Economic Recovery Strategy, especially in tackling corruption, preparing and implementing budgets that benefit the poor, and strengthening public financial management.

Examples include the Natural History Museum Darwin Phase 1 Project which contains the Museum&#039;s remarkable collection of 22 million zoological items collected over the last 200 years and the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester&#039;s Collection Centre which opened up 70 per cent. of the Museum&#039;s collection to the public when it opened in 2001. The National Museum of Science and Industry will be opening a new branch of the National Railway Museum (Locomotion) at Shildon in September of this year. It will enable visitors to view up to 60 vehicles that they might not have been able to see previously. In each case the Department has contributed funding to these developments. We also encourage the development of virtual access. A recent example of this is &#039;Ingenious&#039;, the new website of the National Museum

Two sets of figures are provided above due to the merger in 2002 of the Employment Service with the Benefits Agency to form Jobcentre Plus, a business unit of the Department for Work and Pensions.

Table B represents the employment law statistics for cases conducted by departmental solicitors, who dealt with all employment litigation cases on behalf of the former BA, CSA, Pensions Service and DCS and other DWP agencies.

In particular, information on the costs of settling cases was not collected by the Department, nor was information collated, prior to 2003, on the specific types of case against the Department.

<p class="tabletext">It may be helpful if I explain that Jobcentre Plus came into existence in April 2002, bringing together staff from the Employment Service and part of the Benefits Agency. It deals with both claims to, and payments of, all working age benefits as well as job-finding activities. Data on staff is collected by grade rather than job role and it is not possible to identify accurately the number of staff working in front facing customer service centres from this information. The financial figures shown are only available since the introduction of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As these figures show, there has been a reduction in staff numbers from 2003 to 2004 and, as would be expected, the staff costs for 2004 have also decreased. However, the gross administration costs for the agency have increased. This is due to higher costs falling under the heading &quot;Other Administration Costs&quot;. There are a number of different categories of expenditure that come under this section of the accounts, although the majority are not directly related to the number of staff employed. The main variances relate to the following:</p>

<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Estimates relate to the household&#039;s status at the time they were interviewed for the FRS.<br>

2. The threshold &#039;60 per cent. of median&#039; (equivalised weekly household income) is the most commonly used in reporting absolute and relative trends in low income.<br>

3. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the grossing regime.<br>

4. Equivalised incomes use the McClements equalisation scale.<br>

5. When reporting numbers of individuals in &#039;relative low income&#039;, we apply 60 per cent. of the median income for the year in question; therefore, this threshold changes from one year to the next.<br>





6. When reporting numbers of individuals in &#039;absolute low income&#039;, we take a single level of real equivalised income, which is set at 60 per cent. of the 1996&#150;97 median income, which is &#163;166 before housing costs and &#163;140 after housing costs, at 2002&#150;03 prices. Equivalised income adjusts household income for household size and composition. The corresponding cash values for this absolute threshold, for different family types are shown in the table.<br>

7. All figures are in pounds per week, in 2002&#150;03 prices, rounded to the nearest pound, and are consistent with current National Statistics conventions.<br>

8. The figures relating to absolute and relative low income were derived from &quot;Households Below Average Income&#151;An analysis of the income distribution for 1994&#150;95&#151;2002&#150;03&quot; (HBAI). Copies are available in the Library.<br>

Not all industry returns have yet been received to enable presentation of the 2003 figures, but it is estimated that the use of tyres in cement kilns rose to almost 80,000 tonnes and other recovery approached 190,000 tonnes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w18.html_para5">
Tyres disposed of to landfill arise from two principal channels, retail outlets and end of life vehicles (ELVs). In the former case, figures show a sharp drop from over 87,000 tonnes in 2001 to around 42,000 tonnes in 2002. The 2003 figures are expected to show a further significant diversion of tyres away from landfill disposal. Tyres are also disposed of to landfill as part of automotive shredder residue. The figures for 2001 and 2002 are similar at around 57,000 tonnes, although it should be noted that this total derives from an assumption that all ELV tyres not reused as part-worns or retreads are disposed of in this way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w18.html_para6">
For both 2001 and 2002 this leaves around a 10 per cent. gap between estimated tyre arisings and stated recovery and disposal. The difference may be due to a number of factors including over-reporting of arisings and under-reporting of recovery and disposal, together with any tyres that are stored or are otherwise not consigned for immediate treatment.

<p>
<a name="40720w18.html_para7">
Tyre fly-tipping takes a number of forms, including that dealt with by landowners and local authorities as well as those tyres that are dumped on the forecourts of tyre retail premises, and there are, as yet, no overall figures quantifying this illegal activity. However, The Environment Agency (EA) estimates that &#163;1.65 million is spent annually by local authorities on tyre related fly-tipping. In addition, a joint Defra/EA report estimated that 8,700 tonnes of tyres were fly-tipped on agricultural land in 2001, equating to a cost of &#163;1.3 million. There are a range of other affected landowners including British Waterways, Railtrack and the National Trust. In addition, there is fly-tipping on tyre retail premises where the retailer will subsequently meet the costs of disposal. A third of respondees to a 2003 survey by the representative body for tyre retailers reported that they had been subject to tyre fly-tipping. Since April 2004, Flycapture, a web-based fly-tipping database for England and Wales managed by the EA on behalf of Defra, has been operational. The database, populated with information provided by both the EA and local authorities, provides a systematic basis for the collection of information relating to all fly-tipped wastes, including tyres.

<p><a name="40720w22.html_wqn6"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate he has made of the cost of providing free public transport for the disabled in Northern Ireland.  [184062]</p>








<p><a name="40720w22.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 Free travel on scheduled public transport is available to people who are registered blind and to people in receipt of a War Disablement Pension who have been assessed as being more than 20 per cent. disabled. During the financial year 2004&#150;05 it is estimated that the cost of providing such concessions will amount to &#163;320,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w22.html_para4">
In addition, free travel is available to all Northern Ireland residents aged over 65 years of age, 57 per cent. of whom consider themselves to have a limiting long-term illness. During the financial year 2004&#150;05, I estimate that the cost of providing free travel to that proportion of older people will be around &#163;7.8 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w22.html_para5">
Since 1 April 2004, half fare concessions have been available under the Northern Ireland Concessionary Fares Scheme to people who:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">are in receipt of either mobility component of Disability Living Allowance;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">have had a driving licence refused or revoked for medical reasons;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">are registered with a Health and Social Services Trust as being partially sighted;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">are known to a Health and Social Services Trust as having a learning disability.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w22.html_para6">
The Department for Regional Development has estimated that the operating costs for these four groups of people for the financial year 2004&#150;05 will be &#163;205,000, at current fare levels. The estimated cost of changing the Concessionary Fares Scheme to provide free-fare travel, rather than half fare concessions, to these groups would be likely to cost around &#163;500,000 per annum in addition to set-up costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w22.html_para7">
I therefore estimate that the cost of providing free travel on scheduled public transport to people with disabilities would be in the region of &#163;8.62 million in the current financial year. However, there are currently no plans to further extend the Northern Ireland Concessionary Fares Scheme to provide free public transport for the four groups of people who have received half fare concessions since April 2004.

 The latest data on property prices to earnings ratios are set out in the following table. The substantially increased funding for affordable housing announced in the Spending Review will, along with significant improvements in efficiency, provide 10,000 (50 per cent.) more social rented homes a year by 2007&#150;08. More than 40,000 homes will also be provided in the next three years for essential public sector workers and through other low cost home ownership schemes.

 The information is as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w24.html_para1">
<i>(a)</i> The Public Accounts Committee&#039;s 40th report: Improving Social Housing through Transfer published in July 2003 contains supplementary evidence provided by the office on the value for money of stock transfer. This assessment carried out in April 2003 used guidance in the 2003 Treasury Green Book &quot;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&quot; which took effect on 1 April 2003. As stated in our response to ODPM: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions Committee&#039;s Report on Decent Homes, evidence is also available on inspection ratings of ALMOs following their first six months of operation compared with their previous inspections as local authority managed housing departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w24.html_para2">
Together with the Housing Corporation, we are currently considering the most appropriate approach for future monitoring and evaluating the transfer programme, and parallel work is underway for the ALMO programme. Each monitoring/evaluation system will be tailored to the particular circumstances of each programme, but will also collect consistent data so that it is possible, in the longer term, to provide a comparative assessment of decent homes delivery, value for money, and tenant satisfaction across the different programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w24.html_para3">
<i>(b)</i> Housemark&#039;s January 2004 report showed 79 per cent. of transfer tenants were satisfied with their landlord compared to 74 per cent. for council tenants.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he expects to meet Regional Planning Guidance targets of 6,000 to 10,000 new affordable homes per year established in 2001 for the South West.  [183990]</p>








<p><a name="40720w24.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Policy of the Office Deputy Prime Minister&#151;as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3&#151;is not to set region-wide targets or quotas for affordable housing. Targets are more appropriately set at the local level as they are, necessarily, derived from local circumstances and assessments. The figures set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the South West (RPG10) are, therefore, not a target but an indicator against which the provision of affordable housing can be monitored. Better quality information than currently available is needed to assess how we are progressing against this indicator. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does know that we are not yet providing sufficient affordable homes. That is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has accepted Kate Barker&#039;s recommendation that there should be a step-change in housing supply. Over the coming months, we will be consulting on a package of proposals designed to achieve this, including the provision of independent advice to the Regions, which should improve significantly our ability to deliver and monitor the provision of affordable homes. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also committing more resources to the

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps his Department is taking to combat <i>(a)</i> overcrowded and <i>(b)</i> dangerous multi-occupancy housing.  [182162]</p>








<p><a name="40720w25.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Local authorities have powers in the Housing Act 1985 to deal with overcrowded or unfit Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). Section 352 of the Act gives local authorities powers- to require works to be carried out to render an HMO suitable for the number of occupants. In addition section 354 permits local authorities to limit the number of occupants in an HMO to the number which the authority considers it to be suitable for. A failure to comply with a direction or notice under these sections is a criminal offence. These provisions are to be replaced by new measures in the Housing Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w25.html_para1">
The Bill includes provisions for a new Housing Health and Safety Rating System which will replace the current fitness standard and will enable authorities to take action to deal with health and safety hazards in all 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2004 : Column 211W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
housing including HMOs. The Bill also includes provision for mandatory licensing of large HMOs, and local authorities will have powers to introduce additional licensing to tackle the smaller HMOs. In order to obtain a licence, the landlord will be required to satisfy the local authority that he, or the manager of the property, is a fit and proper person and the house is reasonably suitable for the permitted number of occupants. It will be a criminal offence to operate an HMO without a licence if it is required to be licensed or to permit such an HMO to be occupied by more persons than are permitted under the licence. In addition, local authorities will have powers to make management orders on individual HMOs that are not subject to licensing, if a tribunal agrees that it is necessary to make the order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents or other persons occupying properties in the vicinity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w25.html_para2">
Under the Housing Bill, the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales will have power to amend by Order the statutory overcrowding standards in Part 10 of the 1985 Act and also the provisions in Part 4 of the Bill under which local authorities may serve notices to tackle overcrowding in HMOs. I will be consulting later this year on the ways in which this power might be used.

<p><a name="40720w26.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 We are developing urgently a programme for implementing the recommendations in the Bichard Report. The Home Office is co-ordinating this programme, but it will involve all the Government Departments responsible for implementation agreeing a timetable and key milestones for the work. We are committed to achieving substantial progress across the range of recommendations by the time Sir Michael Bichard reconvenes his Inquiry in six months.

<p>
<a name="40720w26.html_para4">
The current criteria of eligibility for Enhanced Disclosures have been under review. Proposals for revised criteria have been the subject of consultation and the results are being analysed. The recommendation that all posts working with children and vulnerable adults, including posts in schools, should be eligible for Enhanced Disclosures is being taken forward in the context of this review. Our aim is that new criteria should be in place by the end of the year.

<p>
<a name="40720w26.html_para5">
Work to develop a national IT system for police intelligence is being undertaken as a key priority. It may well be two years before such a system is fully up and running. However, the work we have done with the police service to develop a strategic approach to the delivery of national IT infrastructure is already producing great progress. The Police Local Exchange (PLX) system, which indicates where forces hold intelligence on specific individuals, will be introduced as an interim solution by spring 2005. Taking into account projects such as the &#163;500 million Airwave communication system, the new national DMA database and the investment we have put into the Criminal Records Bureau over the past three years, we have invested more than ever before. This commitment is further reinforced by the &#163;600 million that we allocated from 2002 to the whole criminal justice IT system to improve links between the courts, policing and social services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w26.html_para6">
The other specific recommendations referred to are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. Officials in his Department are already in discussion with the National College for School Leadership about ways in which appropriate training might be developed for head teachers and governors to enable them to reflect the importance of safeguarding children when interviewing for staff appointments. It will be necessary to consider the practical issues associated with delivering additional training to many of the approximately 22,100 head teachers and a proportion of the estimated 350,000 school governors before making a commitment to a timescale for this to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w26.html_para7">
As regards handling information about cases involving known or suspected offences against children, the Department for Education and Skills will be writing to local authorities very shortly to reaffirm the existing guidance in &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; and will set out how the relevant recommendations will be taken forward in the longer term.

<p><a name="40720w28.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 All police forces have been set the objective of reducing sickness absence levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w28.html_para2">
The Strategy for a Healthy Police, which was launched in October 2002 supports this objective through funding, guidance and best practice in managing sickness absence and attendance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w28.html_para3">
All forces in England and Wales were allocated a share of &#163;4 million in 2002&#150;03, and then &#163;5 million in 2003&#150;04 and the current financial year. They have been able to focus this extra resource on projects aimed at reducing sickness absence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w28.html_para4">
Sickness absence figures have improved since the launch of the Strategy, with overall sickness absence now at a national average of 10.4 days per officer per year, and 11.7 per support staff member. This has decreased from 12.2 days per officer and 12.6 days per support staff member when the Strategy was launched. The best performing forces have continued to make improvements, but the gap between best and worst performers has also significantly narrowed.

<p><a name="40720w28.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Prison Service does not currently collect data on the qualifications held by its employees. Craftsmen are a sub-grade of industrial staff. While data are available on overall staffing levels within the industrial grades, specific data on the number of craftsmen employed are not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<p><a name="40720w28.html_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Since 1997 the number of staff in front line and delivery support functions has increased by 6164 (19 per cent.).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w28.html_para6">
During this period, the Prison Service has introduced a number of measures to improve overall efficiency, including identifying a number of tasks within establishments previously undertaken by Prison Officers that can more efficiently be undertaken by Operational Support Grade staff. A programme has also been implemented to use industrial grade staff to undertake activities within works departments, which

 Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary have estimated that the average salary, training and development costs of a probationary police constable up to independent patrol (which is normally 31 weeks after joining a force) in 2003&#150;04 were &#163;27,048.

<p><a name="40720w29.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Victims&#039; Code of Practice, provided for in the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Bill currently before Parliament, will place national obligations on criminal justice agencies to deliver specific services to victims of crime. Those bereaved as a result of death on the road will be entitled to the relevant police obligations and, where a charge is considered or brought, the relevant Crown Prosecution Service and courts&#039; obligations. They will not, at present, be entitled routinely to the Code&#039;s personal support services, to be offered by Victim Support, as practice in this area is still being determined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w29.html_para2">
Last year, at a cost of some &#163;500,000, we established three pilot sites to test different ways of organising and delivering services to road traffic victims. These pilots are subject to independent evaluation with a full report on their effectiveness envisaged for Summer 2005. Following this, we will need to consider, with voluntary sector partners and others, the key outcomes from the evaluation programme and how we can best implement a support service to address the needs of all those victimised by incidents on the road.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w29.html_para3">
The victims&#039; legislation clearly sets out the procedures for making revisions to the Code of Practice and it is likely that, because it is statutory, there will be regular updates to reflect front line developments. So if, as seems likely, it is not possible to include obligations to provide personal support services for road traffic victims in the initial version of the Code, which is likely to become fully operational during 2005, then we should be in a position to do so when it is revised for the first time.

<a name="40720w31.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Defence Projects (US Funding)</h3>





<p><a name="40720w31.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Godsiff: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which defence-related projects in the UK are supported by <i>(a)</i> the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency and <i>(b)</i> the US Office for Naval Research; what funding is being made available in each case; and what the actual or intended benefit to the UK is in each case.  [182013]</p>








<p><a name="40720w31.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 In keeping with our strong defence relationship with the United States of America, the United Kingdom works closely with the US Government on a range of defence projects and has dealings with both the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Research.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para0">
Currently the Office of Naval Research is involved in collaborative programmes with the UK on anti-submarine warfare and unmanned underwater vehicle technologies. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency does not currently lead any of the collaborative programmes with the UK but may contribute indirectly through projects led by one of the US Armed Services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para1">
These collaborative links are to our mutual benefit, enhancing the military capabilities of both our nations and improving our ability to operate alongside one another. Typically, such collaborative activities involve both parties pooling the outputs of respective national defence research activities, on an equitable basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para2">
It is unusual for the US Government to directly support or fund UK defence projects. The US does contract directly with UK companies and academia in support of their own defence programmes, but details of these contracts are a matter for the US Government.

<a name="40720w31.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>End-to-end Review</h3>





<p><a name="40720w31.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the outcome of the end to end review.  [183973]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2004 : Column 234W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40720w31.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The original End to End Study reported its findings on 1 July 2003, leading to a six-month Demonstration Phase which has been a notable success. Many of the principles and recommendations put forward by the End to End Final Report have been proven through the pilot activities conducted thus far. It is the intention; therefore, to focus future activity on implementation and the early realisation of benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para3">
As an example, the cost of delivering the first wave of End to End was far outweighed by the year-on-year savings. The MOD has invested &#163;18 million in this programme over the last 15 months. End to End Demonstration has identified efficiency benefit of between &#163;16 million to &#163;19 million per annum and identification of realisable benefit of around &#163;330 million. Potential exists for additional benefit, whilst at the same time preserving and in many cases improving, operational effectiveness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para4">
The quick wins achieved by the End to End Programme and the ongoing and extremely successful DLO Change Programme, have been the catalysts for the launch of a defence-wide programme of logistics transformation.

<a name="40720w31.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Haiti</h3>





<p><a name="40720w31.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what support the UK has provided to the Brazilian and other UN forces in Haiti.  [184188]</p>








<p><a name="40720w31.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para5">
The UK supports the work of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), and welcomes the work of the troops from Brazil, Canada and Chile, operating under Force Commander Lt. Gen. Heleno Ribeiro Pereira of Brazil. The UK is pleased that additional contingents from Argentina, Uruguay, Nepal and Sri Lanka and Peru should be deployed by the end of July.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para6">
The UK is not currently providing personnel contributions to Haiti as we have strong and emerging commitments elsewhere&#151;particularly in Africa. We will be contributing an estimated &#163;8.9 million in assessed contributions until October 2004. This contribution will support the UN troops in Haiti as well as other UN work set out in resolution 1542 (2004). Our financial support will continue beyond October, but the levels are dependent on operational needs which are not fully known as yet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para7">
In addition to financial support for the forces in Haiti, the UK has contributed to related work. The Department for International Development (DfID) sent &#163;1.9 million in bilateral support to Haiti to address civilian unrest. DfID also responded to the flooding in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2004 : Column 235W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Haiti, sending &#163;250,000 to the World Food Programme (UN Programme), &#163;150,000 to Save the Children and &#163;109,400 to Action Aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40720w31.html_para8">
The UK also has a continued interest in raising the standard of peacekeeping. The UK funds world-wide &#039;train the trainer&#039; programmes to support countries in developing their peacekeeping capacity. These focus on police training, but some of the personnel in Haiti may have benefited from this.

<a name="40720w31.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Hearing Loss (Veterans)</h3>





<p><a name="40720w31.html_wqn3"><b> Ms Atherton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research he has conducted on the comparative levels of hearing loss suffered by <i>(a)</i> those suffering from age-related hearing loss and <i>(b)</i> veterans suffering from hearing loss which is both age-related and attributable to wartime noise.  [184111]</p>








<p><a name="40720w31.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Neither the Ministry of Defence, which is now responsible for veterans&#039; matters, nor the former Department of Social Security, has commissioned research on this specific comparison. However, we recognise that, particularly in the past, noise injury arising from service in the Armed Forces has been a significant contributor to hearing loss among service personnel. The Government have therefore taken a close interest in the medical understanding of the causes of and prognosis for hearing loss, including instigating the 1997 Caiman review. The current scientific understanding of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss is that it does not get worse on removal from the noise giving rise to the injury and that, in the context of the War Pensions Scheme, hearing loss due to noise and that due to subsequent effects of age are not more than additive. The aim remains that policy and individual decisions should reflect the latest published peer reviewed scientific evidence and, to that end, we carry out a regular scrutiny of emerging relevant scientific literature.

The National Employers&#039; Liaison Board, later renamed the National Employers&#039; Advisory Board was relaunched in 2002 as &quot;Supporting Britain&#039;s Reservists and Employers&quot;. Finally the Independent Board of Visitors for Military Corrective Training Centre has recently been re-categorised from an advisory NDPB to an independent monitoring board. Further details on MOD&#039;s NDPBs are in the Cabinet Office annual &quot;Public Bodies&quot; publications which can also be found on the Cabinet Office website.

<a name="40720w32.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Non-EU Defence Contractors</h3>





<p><a name="40720w32.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what scope there is to amend the Public Procurement Regulations insofar as they relate to Ministry of Defence contracts to regulate the use by UK companies of sub-contractors outside the EU.  [183782]</p>








<p><a name="40720w32.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Public Procurement Regulations implement in the United Kingdom law the European Union Directives on the award of public sector contracts. They apply to Ministry of Defence procurement on non-warlike goods and services. Neither the Regulations or the Directives regulate the engagement of sub-contractors. As a matter of procurement policy, MOD places responsibility on its prime contractors for securing and demonstrating value for money in meeting defence requirements. To this end, MOD encourages the greatest application of open and fair competition by its prime contractors in the selection of sub-contractors.

<p><a name="40720w32.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Laxton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what meetings Ministers in his Department have had with their US counterparts on the Support Vehicle contract; and if he will make a statement.  [171577]</p>

<a name="40720w32.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Tanker Aircraft</h3>





<p><a name="40720w32.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the current forecast is for <i>(a)</i> the in-service date and <i>(b)</i> the final cost of the contract to provide new tanker aircraft; what the original projections were; and if he will make a statement.  [183313]</p>









<p><a name="40720w32.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) project is currently in its Assessment Phase and does not have a formally approved in-service date (ISD). At the commencement of the Assessment Phase, ISD was broadly forecast to fall in the period 2007&#150;09. We now believe it will be achieved later than this, but endorsement of a firm planning date for ISD is subject to the outcome of negotiations with industry. The maximum whole life cost of the FSTA programme is currently estimated to be &#163;13.1 billion, at Outturn prices, which compares to an estimate of &#163;13.9 billion at the commencement of the Assessment Phase.
