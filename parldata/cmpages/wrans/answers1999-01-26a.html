 Detailed decisions on the public private partnership proposals for National Air Traffic Services will not be taken until after the consultation period closes on 31 January 1999. However, our preferred option, as set out in the consultation paper, would give NATS autonomy within a new framework, policed by an independent regulator.

<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government's reasons for proposing a public/private partnership for NATS, in preference to any other option, are set out in paragraphs 2-6 of the document "A public/private partnership for NATS: a consultation paper by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions", copies of which were placed in the Library of the House on 20 October 1998. In essence, we believe that a public/ private partnership would provide an innovative solution to growing air traffic demands in the next century, while maintaining high standards of safety and performance through strong, independent, safety and economic regulation. A partnership would also:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the ability of the reorganised National Air Traffic Services to guarantee necessary levels of investment.  [66861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government issued a consultation paper setting out our broad proposals for a public/private partnership (PPP) for National Air Traffic Services (NATS) on 20 October 1998. Decisions on the detail of the proposals will not be taken until after the consultation period closes on 31 January 1999. However, one of the main objectives of the PPP is to free NATS from public sector borrowing restrictions so that it can more easily invest for the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the Civil Aviation Pension Scheme will continue to be open to <i>(a)</i> existing and <i>(b)</i> future members of staff of National Air Traffic Services after the proposed reorganisation of the service.  [66862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government are currently consulting on the details of future pension arrangements for staff of National Air Traffic Services (NATS), as part of the consultation exercise on the proposed public/private partnership for NATS. The Secretary of State hopes to make a statement in due course, after responses to the consultation have been considered.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will preserve the rights of those low-income pensioners who are currently entitled to tokens redeemable against community bus and taxi fares when he implements his proposals for half-price travel passes.  [66821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are no statutory rights, as such, to a particular kind of arrangement for concessionary travel. It is for each local authority to decide what concessions to arrange for its residents. Consultation on the introduction of the standard minimum scheme will consider the future arrangements for token schemes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to compensate local authorities in whose area there is a disproportionate number of pensioners when he implements his proposal for half-price bus travel permits.  [66820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Local authority expenditure receives support from the Government by means of Revenue Support Grant. All aspects of our proposal for a national minimum standard for concessionary travel, including finance and the formula for the distribution of RSG, will be subject of consultation with local government and other relevant organisations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Eurotunnel will need to obtain safety approval from the bi-national Intergovernmental Commission (acting on the advice of the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority) before they can convey LPG- and dual-powered vehicles. Subject to this safety approval, the Government would welcome the opening of Shuttle services to these vehicles.

<a name="90126w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Fuller Peiser Property Consultants were commissioned in 1997 to review the existing policy context of Ministry of Defence disposals in England, and to advise Government on how they should seek to obtain value for money whilst having regard to the wider interest of Government. The Consultants' Report: "Development of the Redundant Defence Estate" has been received, and we are considering it. I expect to publish it shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 My Department has commissioned several research projects in connection with the pesticide minimisation policy including: a study into the private costs and benefits of pesticide minimisation, carried out by RPA and Entec; an assessment of a range of economic instruments for pesticide minimisation, carried out by ECOTEC Research and Consulting; and research into the design of a tax/charge scheme for pesticides, also carried out by ECOTEC Research and Consulting. This last research considers the detailed design and potential impact of a charge or tax intended primarily to secure reductions in pesticide use, better targeting and substitution by less harmful pesticides or alternative techniques. A decision concerning publishing the results of this report will be made in due course.

<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 An Explanatory Memorandum (EM12791/98) on the proposal for a Council Directive on the incineration of waste was submitted to Parliament on 30 November 1998. Expert consultants are currently finalising a report on the proposal, on the basis of which a Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment will shortly be submitted to Parliament under a Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum.

<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Woolas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he has taken to ensure the compliance with the landfill site licence in respect of noxious smells at the Highmoor Quarry site in Oldham.  [67225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Environment Agency is responsible for the supervision and enforcement of waste management licences and has provided the following information about odours at Highmoor Quarry.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90126w01.html_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There shall be no offensive smells or other strong odours detectable outside the boundary of the site. All malodours detected shall be investigated and immediate steps taken to ameliorate the problem."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90126w01.html_para10">The steps taken to ensure compliance with this licence condition include the Environment Agency's requiring the site operator to take measures to prevent the emission of odour. This resulted in the capping and covering of the leachate and monitoring wells and the engagement of "Entec" as consultants to carry out further investigation of odour emissions at the site. The consultants' report is due in the week beginning 25 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="90126w01.html_para11">The Environment Agency is also carrying out its own investigations. It has established a "footprint" of odour sources at the site and submitted air samples for analysis of the odour constituents. This will enable the Agency to monitor for identified determinants at sensitive locations. As a part of its consideration of compliance with the licence, the Agency is registering all complaints about odours from the site and plotting their locations, with the intention of linking them to meteorological conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to paragraph 1.43 of the White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport", what measures he proposes to facilitate quality partnerships for freight between local authorities and lorry operators.  [67614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 1999]:</i> The draft guidance on Local Transport Plans, issued on 12 November 1998, explained that, as well as passenger transport, issues connected with freight distribution would need to be addressed within the plan. As stated in our Transport White Paper, our intention is that these be addressed through quality partnerships for freight.
<P>

<a name="90126w02.html_para0">The draft guidance pointed to the practical guidance in "A Manual of Guidance for Local Authorities and Others: Lorries and Traffic Management" which was distributed to all local authorities in 1990, providing 256 pages of practical, low cost advice designed to promote efficient distribution of goods and minimise their environmental and social impacts. This manual is complemented by a booklet "Lorries in the Community" which provides the strategic context; explaining the potential impact of lorries in terms of congestion, pollution, noise, vibration and damage to the road infrastructure and the conflict that can arise between the need for access to town centres with the desire to improve safety for pedestrians and other road users. It explains the value of voluntary agreements and the value of the practical measures described in the manual in meeting the Government's goals for distribution.
<P>

<a name="90126w02.html_para1">The Freight Transport Association has been promoting a best practice initiative "Delivering the Goods" which has helped put the ideas into practice.
<P>

<a name="90126w02.html_para2">Over the coming months the Department will develop further guidance by drawing together best practice and experience on how to go about establishing quality partnerships. Through sharing this experience with as wide an audience as possible, we will provide further, practical advice to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="90126w02.html_para3">By bringing environmental, social, planning and business objectives together, partnerships can play a key part in promoting a more sustainable system for goods distribution. We intend to develop this theme further in a follow up to the White Paper on sustainable distribution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the first bridge strengthening project began in implementation of EU Directive 85/3/EEC; what percentage by mile of work required has been completed to date; and when he expects work required under the Directive to be completed.  [67594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The first strengthening of a Highways Agency bridge under the current assessment and strengthening programme was carried out in 1989. Of the Highways Agency's bridges which require strengthening, some two thirds have been permanently strengthened to date and the remainder have been safeguarded pending permanent strengthening. The permanent strengthening work is expected to be completed in 2001. There is no estimate by mile of the work required to implement EU Directive 85/3/EEC but the whole motorway and trunk road network is operational for HGVs. This network carries 57 per cent. of goods vehicle traffic.

Not all of this work, however, is a requirement of Directive 85/3/EEC. Authorities' programmes include strengthenings which meet the needs of their local communities as well as those on routes of greatest strategic importance for HGVs.

 The Franchising Director has not received any such proposals from the rolling stock companies. As I said in the answer to the hon. Member on 12 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>102-04</i>, it is the responsibility of the train operators to make such arrangements with rolling stock companies as may be necessary to meet either their commitments to the Franchising Director or any requirements of the Health and Safety Executive. The Government are considering recommendations from the Health and Safety Executive that all Mark 1 rolling stock on the network should be modified or rebodied by 2003 and any modified stock replaced by 2007.

<a name="90126w03.html_para3">Full 1998-99 statistics are not yet available as London Underground Ltd's data collection year covers 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999. Therefore the 1998-99 figures represent 36 weeks only.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on Government plans for the funding of London Underground's investment for 1998 to 2003 and past spending from 1992 to 1997.  [67905]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 London Transport currently funds investment from a mix of Government grant, operating surplus, and private finance, through which investment in the Underground over the next two years (1998-99 and 1999-00) will be around &#163;1 billion. Under our plans for a public/private partnership for London Underground, our aim is to secure high and stable investment in modernising and maintaining the system, managed and financed by the private sector, under- contracts through which they will be remunerated in accordance with the delivery of required performance levels:
<P>

<a name="90126w03.html_para4">Over the period 1992-1997, Underground investment ran at an historically high level, in large part reflecting spending on the Jubilee Line Extension. But planned investment in the core network was scaled back dramatically in the light of the cuts imposed in the then Government's November 1996 budget. We have made available an extra &#163;365 million grant for 1998-99 and 99-00 to help redress the shortfall in planned investment caused by this cut, and to cover preparation for implementing our public private partnership policy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made on establishing liability in the case of a serious infrastructure failure on London Underground after concessions have been awarded to private companies.  [67906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Public/Private Partnership contracts that London Underground are currently developing will specify the respective rights and responsibilities of the London Underground operating company and the infrastructure contractors. There will be a simple and robust procedure for allocating responsibility for asset failures that will form part of the day-to-day process for managing the contacts.
<P>

<a name="90126w03.html_para5">Work is still continuing to develop the details, but, if a serious infrastructure failure results in damage to the operating company's property or injuries to its employees or members of the public, the general principle will be that the party responsibility for the failure will bear the financial consequences. An appropriate liability regime and insurance requirements will be put into place.

 Crew numbers for operational Swiftsure submarines are maintained at the full complement level of 16 officers and 121 men. Submarines in refit and not required for sea duty have a reduced ship's company fluctuation around a core of eight officers and 58 men. Currently one of the five S class submarines is in refit and is manned by six officers and 44 men. Reduction in non-operational crew numbers is an approved policy to help maintain operational complements at the full level.

<P>
<a name="90126w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 It is for local authorities to make financial provision for their concessionary fares schemes from the resources available to them, and authorities will not yet have set their budgets for 1999-2000. Authorities are free to determine the nature of their concessionary fares schemes, although from April, 1 expect all local authorities in Wales to be operating schemes which at least meet the minimum standard of &#163;5 for a bus pass and half fare for bus travel for pensioners. The increases in net total standard spending announced on 9 December included sufficient funds for this.

Following on from this, the Director General is currently looking at ways of revising of Ofgas Social Dimension Action Plan to identify actions which will provide solutions to the problems of the fuel poor, including looking at ways of reducing the costs of prepayment meters, and at addressing the needs of other low income customers who pay by other methods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), of 18 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>364-65</i>, on nuclear fuel, what is the basis for his statement that the Japanese Government's preferred means of using recovered plutonium is for it to be converted into MOX nuclear fuel.  [67099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The policy of the Japanese Government with respect to the nuclear energy industry is set out approximately every five years in a document published by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. This is called the "Long Term Programme for Research, Development and Utilisation of Nuclear Energy". In the most recent of these documents, published in 1994, the Atomic Energy Commission confirmed Japan's policy on recycling nuclear fuel and noted the need to begin using MOX fuel. More recently, a full review of Japan's nuclear fuel recycling policy was undertaken and culminated in the publication on 31 January 1997 of a policy statement by the Atomic Energy Commission. This policy statement, which was subsequently endorsed by the Japanese Cabinet on 4 February 1997, proposed a prompt start to a programme for using MOX fuel in Japanese light water reactors. The contracts between the Japanese electricity utilities and both BNFL and COGEMA for the supply of MOX fuel are consistent with that programme.

<P>
<a name="90126w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The effect of the Government's special share in BG plc is to prohibit any person from having an interest in shares which carry 15 per cent. or more of the total votes attaching to the shares in BG plc. Given their market-sensitive nature, significant announcements about policy towards the special share would be made through the Stock Exchange. The interests of consumers are protected through the regulatory system; this is enforced by the Director General of Gas Supply, and is currently under review by the Government.

For example, last autumn the Minister for Science opened a renewable energy seminar, and associated trade mission, in Peking. We also take advantage of other opportunities in overseas markets, which in the past year have included, Poland, United States and the Philippines.

 The Government are providing new resources to support rural public transport over the next three years. &#163;13.5 million will be available through the Rural Transport Fund. As part of this initiative, I am pleased to be able to announce today that I am awarding grants totalling over &#163;500,000 to 22 rural community transport projects. Many different areas of Scotland will benefit, ranging from Wigtownshire in the south to Orkney and Shetland in the north. In addition, local authorities will be able to bid to the Public Transport Fund for rural transport projects. That Fund will provide &#163;90m over three years. From 1 July 1999 this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<a name="90126w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 &#163;13.5 million is being invested over a 3 year period through the rural transport funding package announced last year. Taking the allocations the Government have made from this fund in 1998-99 as a yardstick, totals of &#163;10.5 million would be available to local authorities to provide additional public transport services, &#163;1.8 million for community transport projects and &#163;1.2 million to assist rural petrol stations. I know that this initiative is being warmly welcomed in rural areas, not least because these resources represent additional funding not previously made available. In addition, local authorities will be able to bid to the Public Transport Fund for rural transport projects. The Fund will provide &#163;90m over 3 years. From 1 July 1999 this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

 The early intervention programme, worth a total of &#163;60m over five years, will establish the basic literacy and numeracy skills children will need. We have set targets to raise the level of achievement in literacy and numeracy in line with the national benchmark of 80 per cent. of children achieving the relevant stages in primary school and 75 per cent. at S2. We have invested &#163;30m over three years from the Excellence Fund to support in-service training of teachers with particular emphasis on literacy and numeracy in the P6 to S2 stages, and &#163;15m over three years to support family literacy

<P>

<a name="90126w09.html_para3">Precise information on whether a scheme under consideration will be build, own and operate depends on the outcome of negotiations. No contract sponsored by The Scottish Office has a performance bonus regime. Payment mechanisms vary on the basis of usage, availability and performance. In general, payments commence on the delivery of services, with deductions thereafter for non-availability or poor performance. A feature of PFI projects is that they are not separable into components, and so service costs are not a separable element of the overall charge. From 1 July 1999 this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<a name="90126w10.html_para0">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contains measures to improve case management and bailed defendants will appear in court on the first available day after charge. In addition, fast tracking schemes are being introduced to halve the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders.

34. <a name="90126w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ian Bruce: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what is the current workload of the Land Registry; and what assessment he has made of the employment prospects of Land Registry staff as a result of the change in demand and the increased use of information technology.  [65862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The current workload of the Land Registry is 10.8 million transactions for the first nine months of 1998-99. This compares with 9.3 million transactions for the same period in 1997-98 and represents an increase in business of 15.6 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90126w10.html_para2">Employment prospects for Land Registry staff have not changed as a result of its use of information technology. In response to increased property market activity in 1997-98, the Land Registry recruited 330 new members of staff to maintain service level requirements. Over the current financial year, the Land Registry intends recruiting some 240 staff to replace those lost through natural wastage. Information technology has enabled the Land Registry to develop the talents, skill and enthusiasm of its staff to provide a progressively improving service whilst maintaining a workforce in the region of 8,500.

<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 My Department has received a number of representations on this matter. As of 15 January 1999 I have received 120 letters from MPs and 107 letters from members of the public. The Department also received 114 responses to the Consultation paper. These included representations from all seven of the representative bodies within the Magistrates' Courts Service.

 To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what progress his Department has made in reviewing the current working practices of the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors.  [65867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Office for the Supervision of Solicitors is an independent body, and its working practices are primarily a matter for the Office. There are no current plans to alter the current arrangements for handling complaints against solicitors. However, the Legal Services Ombudsman oversees the handling of complaints against members of the legal profession, and she has stated in her latest report that although the Office has made some improvements since it started operating in September 1996 there is still a long way to go. When the Ombudsman publishes her next annual report later this year, I will consider whether any further action is necessary.

<a name="90126w10.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Legal System (Reforms)</center></H4>


<P>
39. <a name="90126w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hawkins: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what cost savings he estimates will accrue from his planned reforms to the legal system and its administration.  [65868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government are undertaking a wide-ranging programme of reforms of the legal system and its administration. The most significant elements of that programme are: the establishment of the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service and the measures to reduce delay in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in the Access to Justice Bill currently before Parliament; and the implementation of the first phase of reform of the civil justice system in April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90126w10.html_para8">Saving money is not the Government's objective. The reforms of the system should make it easier for those wishing to resolve disputes to do so effectively. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 1999 : Column: 187</I><P>
Those who need to seek assistance from a solicitor should find that costs are more predictable and the risks of litigation much less. No-win no-fee arrangements between lawyers and private clients in more cases will give greater access to justice. Contracting for publicly funded legal services will provide cost effective, quality assured and properly targeted help to those most in need and the taxpayer will get better value for money from what we spend. We will direct resources to areas of greater need or into areas where the market cannot provide necessary services.

<a name="90126w10.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Sheriffs</center></H4>


<P>
40. <a name="90126w10.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hinchliffe: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what proposals he has to review the role of sheriffs.  [65869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Sheriffs have a role in the enforcement of High Court judgments. A review of enforcement is currently being undertaken by the Lord Chancellor's Department, which will examine that role in some detail. 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 1999 : Column: 188</I><P>
Work on this stage of the review will begin in July 2000. Any proposals that might change the role of Sheriffs will be subject to full public consultation as and when they arise. I am not aware of any proposals to review the functions that Sheriffs have in addition to their enforcement role.

<a name="90126w10.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list the titles and dates of publications of Law Commission reports on which legislation has not been enacted.  [67308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A list is provided. The Law Commission has published 157 Law Reform reports and 18 Statute Law Revision reports, of which 57 have not resulted in legislation or have not been otherwise implemented. Of these, 14 were not intended for legislation and one further report, "Judicial Review and Statutory Appeals (Law Commission Report No. 226)", resulted in minor legislation but for completeness it is included in the list.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what arrangements are in place in his Department to respond to Law Commission reports; and if he will make a statement.  [67307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Reports which relate to the Lord Chancellor's areas of responsibility are allocated to the Division within his Department's Headquarters most closely concerned with the subjects covered. Progress on each report is monitored, and there are regular meetings between the Commission and senior Departmental staff to clarify issues and discuss how consideration of reports is taken forward.

<a name="90126w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No staff or other resources are solely dedicated to dealing with Law Commission reports. Because the Law Commission's reports raise issues relating to particular policy areas, they are handled by the police Divisions most closely concerned with the subject.

 Last year, we reviewed all Law Commission reports for which my Department was responsible, and which were then outstanding.

Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Melanie Johnson). The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, provided further information on unimplemented Law Commission reports in another place on 29 July 1998, <i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> columns <i>201-02</i>.

 Asylum decisions are taken by trained officers at the appropriate grade depending on the complexity of the issues raised.

<a name="90126w13.html_para6">The Prison Service is currently re-examining instructions and guidance on caring for the suicidal to be issued as a new Prison Service Order (PSO). The special needs of under 18 year olds will be considered as part of that review. In addition, the Prison Service is currently developing new regime standards for under 18 year olds in consultation with the Youth Justice Board. These, along with the creation of a distinct juvenile estate, will improve the standard of care and quality of regimes for remanded and sentenced juveniles held in Prison Service accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Reasons for orders not being given effect could be established only by examining each case individually at disproportionate cost. However, a delay may arise for one or more of the following reasons: an appeal or other legal challenge, an asylum application, difficulties in obtaining a travel document, the subject has still to complete a custodial sentence or cannot be traced. Some of the latter may have left the country without informing the Immigration Service. Orders issued later will inevitably be activated outside the reference period.

 General Sir John Learmont's report on the escapes from Parkhurst and the management of the Prison Service has had a huge impact. His findings, together with those of Sir John Woodcock's inquiry into the escape 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 1999 : Column: 202</I><P>
from Whitemoor in September 1994, have led to greatly improved physical security and a significant change in the way staff in prisons consider security as they go about their day to day tasks. The number of escapes, the measure by which the Prison Service is most often judged by the public, has dropped significantly since the report.
<P>

<a name="90126w13.html_para8">Of the 127 recommendations on prison security and the management of the Service, 118 have been accepted in full, in part or with some qualifications. The position on each recommendation is set out in a document which has been placed in the Library. Those recommendations which have been accepted but have not yet been implemented in full will be taken forward within existing resources. A revised Security Manual has now been published which will tie up a number of outstanding matters. I have decided not to accept Sir John's proposals for a High Security prison and a control prison, in the light of the significant improvements to security in the Category A estate and improvements in the management of the most seriously disruptive prisoners.
<P>

<a name="90126w13.html_para9">There remains one substantive recommendation on which I have asked for further work to be done--No. 63, proposing that all staff, including Governors, should normally wear uniform. I hope to be able to announce a decision on this recommendation soon and a final report on the outcome of this inquiry will be provided then.

 Civil servants are required under the terms of the Civil Service Code to conduct themselves with integrity, impartiality and honesty, and in such a way as to deserve and retain the confidence of Ministers and potential future Ministers. This is supported by a duty placed on Ministers not to use public resources for party political purposes, to uphold the political impartiality of the Civil Service and not to ask civil servants to act in any way which would conflict with the Civil Service Code.

 <i>[holding answer 27 December 1998]:</i> On 26 February 1998 the Committee on Safety of Medicines advised that the National Health Service Bio Products Laboratory and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service's Protein Fractionation Centre take steps to source products from plasma derived from outside the United Kingdom including Anti-D and gamma globulin. The Committee further advised that this should be done within a timeframe to be agreed with the committee, giving regard to the effects on the supply of all products but especially of vital and less readily obtainable life saving products. In the meantime, the Committee did not advise withdrawal of licensed UK sourced Anti-D and gamma globulin products. I have accepted the Committee's advice and will keep the matter under review in the light of any further advice or changed circumstances.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 1998]:</i> No. The potential of prophylactic medicines has been demonstrated in rodents under laboratory conditions, but has not been developed for use in natural disease in either animals or humans.
<P>

<a name="90126w14.html_para5">In so far as modes of transmission of spongiform encephalopathies are understood, any prevention or control measure must be carefully evaluated for its safety and efficacy (by research study where appropriate).

<a name="90126w14.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 November 1998]:</i> The recommended autoclave regime set out in Annex B, Table B1 re-iterates previous advice from the Department, first issued in 1981. Therefore, the autoclave regime in itself is not new advice. The main change in the 1998 guidance with respect to surgical instruments is to advise disposal of all instruments used on patients with clinical symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and not just those used for neurological and ophthalmological surgery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department has made no investment in the facilities at the Royal Hospital Haslar in any of the last 5 years.
<P>

<a name="90126w15.html_para0">The Portsmouth Hospital National Health Service Trust and Royal Hospital Haslar work closely together and staff from both organisations work across both hospital sites.

 We are keen to find improved ways of handling clinical negligence claims which do not involve litigation. The National Health Service Executive launched pilot mediation schemes in the Anglia and Oxford and Northern and Yorkshire regions in April 1995 with the aim of exploring the scope for mediation as an appropriate alternative to litigation in the resolution of clinical disputes. The pilots ended last year and an evaluation project is in the final stages of reporting. We will look carefully at the findings and particularly whether there is scope to extend the use of mediation in the NHS.

Unlike the currencies of Italy and Finland, neither of which were within the ERM for two years, the Swedish Crown exhibited insufficient exchange rate stability during the two year review period. In addition, national legislation in Sweden, including the statute of the Swedish national central bank, was not compatible with the requirements of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 1999]:</i> At the Vienna European Council meeting on 11 December 1998 the UK argued that there was a good case for looking once more at the decision to end duty-free sales in the EU. Heads of Government agreed that the Commission and ECOFIN should examine, by March 1999, the problems which could arise with regard to employment and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibility of a limited extension of duty-free sales.

<P>
<a name="90126w18.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Despite recent gains in some East Asian and Latin American markets, stock values and currencies in these regions are still well below their levels of 18 months ago. But it is difficult to assess the direct effect of these price movements on global capital assets.
<P>

<a name="90126w18.html_para2">Because financial turbulence in Asia and the Americas has negative consequences for the inhabitants of those regions and poses a threat to global economic stability, the UK has taken a lead in finding solutions to the present turmoil. The G7 Declaration of 30 October 1998, which the UK brokered as G7 Chair, contained commitments to fight financial market contagion through an enhanced IMF facility; increase the transparency of the international financial system; enhance global financial regulation, in particular through better co-ordination between international financial institutions, national regulators and international regulatory bodies; and improve financial crisis prevention and resolution mechanisms, including the involvement of private sector creditors.

<a name="90126w18.html_para4">The G7 declaration of 30 October 1998 set out a blueprint for the reform of the international financial architecture which will make a major difference in this regard. Increased transparency and openness in the public and private sector will provide better information on which the private sector can base its risk assessment and investment decisions. Better methods of involving the private sector in crisis resolution and prevention will also sharpen private sector risk-management and reduce moral hazard.
<P>

<a name="90126w18.html_para5">In addition, the G7 declaration pledges to bring together the key international institutions and key national authorities involved in financial sector stability better to co-operate and to co-ordinate their activities in the management and development of policies to foster stability and reduce systemic risk in the international financial system and to exchange information more systematically on these risks.

 Member states are free to set excise duty rates at the level they feel are appropriate to their own particular circumstances, subject only to the agreed minimum rates. This was the basis of the agreement reached by all member states in ECOFIN in 1992 and achieved harmonisation to the extent necessary for completion of the Single Market. Nevertheless, the UK continues to argue for a levelling up of most minimum rates but recognises that progress is likely only in the long term.

 The Inland Revenue provides taxpayers with a unique taxpayer reference in the SA system from which the issue of final reminders and other forms is controlled. This unique reference should ensure that even where a taxpayer has more than one source of income and deals with more than one tax office, final reminders are generated only once.

That will make it easier for many small and medium businesses to obtain gross payment certificates. Those who do not qualify for certificates will be paid with deductions made on account of tax and national insurance contributions (NICs), but they will not ultimately be liable for any more tax and NICs than if they held certificates. The Inland Revenue has consulted widely with construction industry representative bodies on the design of the new scheme and has published guidance and set up telephone helplines for contractors and subcontractors.

 In our response to the Report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education (the Dearing Committee) we accepted the Committee's recommendation that, over the two years up to July 1999, institutions should review and, if necessary, amend their arrangements for handling complaints from students. We have encouraged them to take the necessary action in the light of guidance issued by the Committee of Vice- Chancellors and Principals on an independent review of student appeals and complaints, published in April 1998. The Department does not currently keep records of whether or not an institution has a student complaints procedure but we shall be reviewing this summer the progress made in following up the Dearing Committee's recommendation.

 Engineering and manufacturing are not subjects of the National Curriculum, but related issues are commonly covered by National Curriculum design and technology (D&T) and information technology (IT). D&T and IT have occupied a justifiably important position in the National Curriculum since its inception in

In reaching decisions on the future shape of the National Curriculum, we will listen to the views of a wide range of people. There will be a public consultation on the revised National Curriculum in the summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> Gloucestershire County Council and <i>(b)</i> other interested parties, on the proposal to amalgamate Toddington Primary School with Didbrook Primary School; what discussions with interested parties he intends to have before coming to his decision on the proposal; and when he expects to reach a decision.

 On 16 October, Gloucestershire Local Education Authority published statutory proposals to close Didbrook and Toddington County Primary Schools, and to establish a new school on the Didbrook site. We have received a number of representations. The local education authority has also received objections to the proposals, which they have passed on to the Department. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will give careful consideration to the proposals, to the objections to the proposals and to the local education authority's comments on the objections; and to any other comments he receives. He will reach a decision as soon as possible, consistent with full consideration of all the relevant issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how design and technology scores at secondary level compared with other subjects at <i>(a)</i> Key Stage 3 and <i>(b)</i> Key Stage 4 in Ofsted reports on progress and on teaching quality.  [67782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Ofsted reports covering 1995-96 show that 58 per cent. of schools had good standards of achievement for design and technology (D&T) at Key Stage 3. More pupils reach this standard in English, art and physical education than in D&T, but fewer do so in other subjects. At Key Stage 4, 57 per cent. of schools had good standards of achievement for D&T. This is better than pupils' performances in mathematics, science, information technology and modern foreign languages but poorer than other subjects. We expect that the improvement at Key Stage 3 will gradually feed into Key Stage 4.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the capital sum which would be required, at current annuity rates, to buy a pension which would give a person retiring at the age of 65 years the same income after housing costs as someone entitled to income support, assuming an average level of housing costs and taking into account the cash value of the principal benefits in kind available to pensioner recipients of income support but not to other pensioners.  [65423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="90126w21.html_para2">Using a single life annuity rate, a capital sum of approximately &#163;50,000 would be required to purchase an annuity paying &#163;70.45 per week (the current level of Income Support applicable to a single 65 year old with no dependants or disability), indexed annually to the Retail Prices Index, for a person aged 65. A charge of 2 per cent. of the fund has been assumed to be deducted.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. No adjustment has been made to the basic Income Support entitlement for a person aged 65. Pensioners on this level of income would qualify for assistance with most housing costs and for the principal benefits in kind, even though not actually in receipt of Income Support.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The annuity rate used is derived from the tables issued by the Government Actuary for determining the maximum annual income withdrawal from post-1997 protected rights held in an appropriate personal pension, based on the yield on UK gilts (High Coupon; 15 years) on 15 January 1999. These tables assume an annuity with Limited Price Indexation, ie an annual increase in line with the Retail Prices Index or 5 per cent., whichever is lower. Under current conditions, this gives a reasonable approximation to the cost of an annuity with full RPI linking.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to paragraph 17, on page 14 of "Partnership in Pensions", Cm 4179, what estimate he has made of the number of those reaching retirement age who, by 2025, will have to rely on means-tested benefits under his proposals.  [65579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90126w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Green Paper proposals are designed to ensure that someone with a full working life, or years covered by credits, will receive a pension on retirement above the Minimum Income Guarantee. The full impact of the proposals will be felt when people have experienced a full working lifetime in the new scheme.
<P>

<a name="90126w21.html_para3">The estimate referred to in the Green Paper was made using the Department's PENSIM model which can give only a broad indication of the impact so far into the future. Due to the degree of uncertainty surrounding estimates, 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 1999 : Column: 231</I><P>
PENSIM cannot identify relatively small changes. The impact of pension policy tends to build up slowly over time and in 2025, after only 20 years of the new system, will be relatively small.
<P>

<a name="90126w21.html_para4">However, estimates suggest that approximately 1.5 million pensioners (around 20 per cent.) will receive payments from the Minimum Income Guarantee when it is introduced in April 1999. On the basis of unchanged policies (ie. not taking into account the effects of our other proposals in the Green Paper) approximately 3.5 million pensioners (1 in 3) in 2050 could rely on the Minimum Income Guarantee. Even if no behavioural changes are assumed, the new insurance contract for pensions will mean that these estimates are reduced to approximately 2.5 million pensioners (1 in 4) receiving income from the Minimum Income Guarantee in 2050, and a lower proportion in years after 2050.
<P>

<a name="90126w21.html_para5">As an illustration of the possible impact of the behavioural effects of the proposals in "Partnership in Pensions", if all those in work saved an additional 5 per cent., the figure would fall to approximately 2 million in 2050.

<a name="90126w21.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the numbers of pensioners who would be entitled to <i>(a)</i> existing income support and <i>(b)</i> the future minimum pension guarantee if (i) a pension disregard of (1) &#163;10 per week and (2) &#163;20 per week were introduced and (ii) if the disregard were confined to pension income paid to widows and widowers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security in what respects, other than the rate of accrual on annual earnings below &#163;18,000 and the crediting-in of carers and disabled people, the state second pension is planned to differ from SERPS.  [67887]<P>

<a name="90126w22.html_para3">However, there are a few instances where local criteria are used for the provision of funds. One such example is the annual allocation of the discretionary social fund budget to Benefit Agency District Offices. In this instance, one of the criteria used is individual demand for social fund loans amongst the local population in receipt of income support. This budgeting exercise occurs annually and full details on local budget allocations and how they are set are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90126w22.html_para4">In addition, there are a number of discretionary provisions available to those local authorities who administer Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. For example, housing benefit can be increased up to the level of the contractual rent for people who would otherwise experience exceptional hardship under provisions like the local reference rent. Overall financial provision, and its distribution to individual local authorities, is made annually in full consultation with the Local Authority Associations. Authorities can also operate discretionary local schemes to disregard up to the full amount of a War Disablement Pension and War Widow's Pension not already subject to a statutory disregard within the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit provisions.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) The definition of "jobs obtained" includes only Employment Service (ES) job placings. This means that this figure does not include jobs obtained by lone parents who participate in NDLP but who find the job through a non-ES source. Since 26 October 1998 for example, another 146 lone parents participating in the NDLP have found jobs through a non-ES source with the help of their adviser. This figure is therefore likely to be an undercount of the total number of jobs obtained by lone parents participating in the NDLP.</FONT></UL>
