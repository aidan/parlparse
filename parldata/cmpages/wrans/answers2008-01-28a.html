Quality systems are based on HACCP and are BRC compliant which surpass international standards. Animal welfare is of utmost importance and the calves are given diets that are high in fibre (and not iron deficient), generous space allowances, and adequate bedding. All the calves are accommodated in groups in spacious, well-ventilated and well-lit stables.</p>

However, during the bidding phase, the International Olympic Committee commented on the distance between Bisley and the Olympic Park. On the basis of this feedback, and following consultation with the International Shooting Federation and British Shooting (the national governing body), the Royal Artillery barracks at Woolwich was selected as the shooting venue, due to its iconic location and its close proximity to the Olympic Park and Village. These factors will improve the athlete and spectator experience by limiting travel and making it easier to attend other Games events on the same day in the Olympic Park.</p>

 Eastern Chad hosts 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 refugee camps and 46,000 central African refugees in four refugee camps. There are 180,000 IDPs, and an estimated 700,000 in host communities have been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict. DFID relies on data from partner agencies for assessment of the humanitarian situation affecting the displaced populations, and the humanitarian situation in Chad is monitored closely by a dedicated west African humanitarian advisor. In financial year 2007-08, DFID has committed &#163;6.5 million to Chad through humanitarian agencies. These include ICRC (3600,000), UNHCR (&#163;2 million) UNOCHA (&#163;260,000), Oxfam (&#163;330,000), WFP (&#163;1.8 million) and Islamic Relief (&#163;500,000).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80128w0002.htm_para6"><a name="0801287000208">Though conditions for refugees remain of concern, the immediate humanitarian needs of most of the refugee population are being addressed. In the majority of refugee camps, for example, refugees are receiving  15 litres of potable water per person per day, in accordance with international standards. According to the UN, refugees all have access to primary health care facilities, although vaccination coverage is less than the accepted level. The UN estimates that 82 per cent. of refugee school-age children are enrolled and attend school. In line with international nutritional norms, refugees are all receiving 2,100 kCal per person per day. Nutritional surveillance shows that in the refugee population, global acute malnutrition is 7.7 per cent. which is within the WHO-defined &#145;alert&#146; band, and severe acute malnutrition is 0.75 per cent.&#151;which is defined as &#145;acceptable&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80128w0002.htm_para7"><a name="0801287000209">The situation for the internally displaced population is more worrying; in many cases, standards fall below the internationally accepted norms. Of the total of 180,000 IDPs, only 125,000 are receiving more than 10 litres of potable water per person per day. The UN estimates that 70 per cent. of IDPs have access to primary health care facilities at utilisation rate of one visit per person per year, which is below what is to be expected for a displaced population. 2,100 kCal per day have been provided to a caseload of 150,000 IDPs. Global acute malnutrition levels are at 21.4 per cent. and severe acute malnutrition levels are at 2.6 per cent; both levels are classified by WHO as &#145;serious&#146;. The UN notes that information relating to the full extent of coverage of humanitarian need is as yet incomplete. The situation for the host population, and those otherwise affected by the conflict, is very serious, with global and severe malnutrition figures comparable to those prevalent amongst the IDPs. The UN estimates that some 700,000 additional people fall into this category.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 January 2008]:</i> The UK has been actively engaged with the US Government to address health worker shortages in Africa. Through the International Health Partnership, DFID recently held a joint meeting in Ethiopia with the US Presidents Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and four PEPFAR and IMP African countries to agree priority actions to increase and improve resources for health workers, including those needed to deliver HIV and AIDS services.</p>

 Where the Department for International Development (DFID) gives money to partner governments, it comes with conditions.

This change was introduced in order to bring these clearance types more closely into line with police services in England and Wales where they have been applying the Crown Prosecution Service evidential test since 2002. In Northern Ireland the equivalent standard became relevant to PSNI clearances only with the establishment of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in June 2005. While this has had the effect of reducing the overall clearance rate, sanction clearances (those where a formal sanction is taken against an offender by means of charge, summons, and caution or where the offence is taken into consideration at court) remain unaffected.  <i> Source:</i>  Central Statistics Unit, PSNI.<br>

 MOD officials have discussed the general issue of sponsorship of academies with officials from the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) on a number of occasions, though these were not formally minuted meetings. In particular officials spoke on 5 September 2006 and 15 March 2007 on sponsorship and there were a number of other exchanges. These discussions confirmed that the MOD would not sponsor academies, but that it was appropriate for the local chain of command to engage with sponsors where there was a significant Service community interest. For example, there has been considerable contact between military representatives in Wiltshire and the sponsor of the planned Wellington academy.</p>

 There is no precise definition of what elements of Service personnel allowances might contribute to a Military Covenant. The provision of Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA) assists Service personnel in achieving continuity of education for their children; continuity that would otherwise be denied them in the maintained day school sector if the children accompanied the Service parent on frequent assignments at home and abroad. It is one of a range allowances designed to provide targeted and appropriate support to Service personnel and their families.</p>

 The only rigorous evidence currently available that demonstrates academic achievement of service children is the Key Stage results in service schools overseas, run by the Service Children's Education (SCE) Agency. These results would regularly place them well within the equivalent of the top 25 per cent of local education authorities in England. In order to understand academic achievement more widely, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has introduced a service indicator on the annual school census and is working with MOD on a joint mitigating mobility project to identify the best way of improving outcomes further.</p>

 The land at Angle, formerly owned by the Ministry of Defence, was transferred on 1 July 2001 to QinetiQ as part of the operational estate of the former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency which was privatised on that date. Releasing individual valuations could adversely impact on potential disposal receipts should QinetiQ dispose of the site in the future. For information, the value of all property in the overall transaction as reported in the QinetiQ opening balance sheet was &#163;342 million for land and buildings plus &#163;98 million for surplus properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80128w0007.htm_para6"><a name="08012821001146">Regarding covenants, the sale would have transferred all those in the original conveyance of 1901 that were still applicable, together with those usually included in any property transaction. In addition there were certain specific covenants applying to all the sites included in the privatisation, including responsibility to repay a proportion of excess profits, over an agreed value and subject to a sliding scale, by way of clawback clause. There was also obligation to consider the Crichel Down rules in relation to any future disposal.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence transferred the former Angle site in Pembrokeshire to QinetiQ on 1 July 2001. The Crichel Down rules only apply to land acquired from 1935 onwards. As the site was acquired by the MOD in 1901, the rules did not apply. The transfer was also made under exemption 14 (6) of the 1992 version of the Crichel Down rules in use at that time.</p>

 Where Government land is transferred to another body (for example a defence contractor) which is to take over some or all of the obligations of the Department that currently owns the land, the transfer itself does not constitute a disposal for the purposes of the Crichel Down rules. Likewise, disposals for the purposes of Private Finance Initiatives/Private Public Partnership projects do not fall within the rules and the position of any surplus land would then be subject to the PFI/PPP contract.</p>

 The Solidarity Clause reflects EU member states' desire to offer each other support in dealing with disasters on their territory, including terrorist attacks. The use of any UK military assets under the Solidarity Clause would be on a voluntary basis and would be a sovereign decision for the UK Government to take in the light of other commitments at the time. Any support would be given only in response to a specific request by an affected member state. The arrangements required to implement the Solidarity Clause would be defined by a European Council decision. In the case that there were defence implications, the Council would decide unanimously.</p>

 It was originally envisaged that Galileo would be built and operated by a private sector body under a concession contract. However, the Transport Council concluded in June last year that these concession negotiations had failed and should end. Instead, the Community has agreed that the deployment and initial operation of Galileo to 2013 should be taken forward through a public procurement managed by the Commission.</p>

 There is no such criterion in the Department&#146;s current guidance.

The current guidance lists a number of parameters to be considered including the number of vehicles, speed of approach, number of pedestrians, proximity of schools, and stations. Using these in a decision framework enables local authorities to compare alternative solutions and make an objective decision as to whether a crossing is needed and which type is most suitable.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Estimates are for the average cost faced by the transport user, net of any subsidy to the rail operators.<br>
2. Motoring costs include expenditure on car purchase, spares, maintenance, insurance, taxation, fuel and parking, but excludes costs paid by employers.<br>
<i> Source</i>:<br>
Estimates for rail average costs are based on revenue collected by operators and mileage estimates published in National Rail Trends by the Office of the Rail Regulator. The car (and van) motoring costs estimates are based on household expenditure on private motoring from the Expenditure and Food Survey and the Family Expenditure Survey published in Food Spending 2006 by the Office for National Statistics and household mileage figures from the National Travel Survey (NTS) carried out on behalf of my Department.

This could affect the amount of maintenance that the non-resident parent must pay.</p>

 The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our Households Below Average Income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the family resources survey (FRS) may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>

3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses disposable household income, equivalised for household size and composition, as a proxy for standard of living using the OECD equivalence scale.<br>
4. This response uses the Government's preferred measure of relative low income poverty, defined as being in a household with a household income of less than 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income. This is an internationally recognised measure.<br>
5. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are. This means that after housing cost incomes will generally be lower than before housing cost.<br>

<i> [holding answer 24 January 2008]:</i> There are a number of measures in place that provide protection to animals generally and are not species specific. For example, last year the Government introduced the Animal Welfare Act 2006, under which it is an offence to cause an animal, under the control of man, any unnecessary suffering. The Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 makes it an offence to intentionally inflict unnecessary suffering on wild mammals. In addition, the Government are committed to improving the welfare of animals such as through the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy and the Animal Welfare Delivery Strategy.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 January 2008]:</i> The samples for routine dead wild bird surveillance are collected according to standardised protocols, accredited to a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) International Standards Organisation (ISO)17025 quality system. DEFRA employs the diagnostic expertise of the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge, which is the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and European Union (EU) Reference Laboratory for avian influenza (AI). Our sampling, collection, storage and transportation methods are entirely consistent with international and European Union standards. We continually revise and subject all aspects of our AI surveillance activities to peer review in light of new international evidence as it arises. Our testing regime conforms to the highest standards for protecting animal and public health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80128w0015.htm_para4"><a name="08012839000556">The delivery target for the following dead wild bird surveillance activities is five days. Eligible wild birds are collected from the field by a collection agency operator (generally from the Meat and Livestock Commission) in a biosecure manner, including double bagging of the bird to protect operator health and safety. The wild birds are then delivered to the nearest VLA regional laboratory, where they are refrigerated (+4° Celsius) pending sampling. Once samples are collected from the wild bird at the VLA regional laboratory they will also be stored at +4° Celsius. Samples are then packaged and despatched. Rapid courier delivery of specimens collected in this manner ensures high quality material is received at the VLA headquarters laboratory for testing. Testing of the samples at VLA Weybridge usually commences as soon as practically possible upon the day of receipt, with samples held at +4°Celsius as required.</p>

 The Government support an open trading scheme, as was agreed at the December 2007 Environment Council.

These additional emissions may also be covered by Kyoto project credits up to a limit of 15 per cent. of the total number of allowances surrendered by operators.

Any activity promoted in this sector will result in greater carbon savings being attributed to a measure than would otherwise be the case.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedures her Department employs to ensure that licences to conduct scientific experiments on animals are only granted in circumstances where no viable alternative exists; and what steps it takes to ensure that licences are not granted unnecessarily to different scientists simultaneously.

 Under section 5(5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, a project licence cannot be granted if the purpose of the programme could be achieved satisfactorily by the use of a reasonably practicable non-animal method. Applicants for project licences are, therefore, required to explain why animals have to be used and a key element of the assessment of licence applications by Home Office inspectors focuses on ensuring that the use of animals is essential. In considering this issue, inspectors have access to a wide range of expertise and sources of relevant information and fully explore potential alternative methods in discussion with applicants.</p>

However, the replication of experiments by more than one research group is not necessarily prohibited. The scientific method demands that research findings can be corroborated by the same or different research groups to establish the validity of the results.</p>

A number of communities have been connected using the model. In partnership with the regional development agencies in north-east England and Yorkshire and Humberside, we are co-funding demonstration projects delivered by Community Energy Solutions, a community interest company that will provide cost-effective energy to 40 communities. These projects will use mains gas and renewable technologies as appropriate, will benefit both urban and rural communities and are designed to be replicable elsewhere. Under the new gas distribution price control, Ofgem, with our support, has incentivised the gas distribution network companies to provide mains gas connections to deprived communities. We expect this to result in many thousands of customers gaining access to mains gas during 2008  to 2013.</p>

 The Government&#146;s response to the national public consultation on the post office network in May 2007 set out the definitions supporting the minimum access criteria for the post office network. The definition of a rural area is a settlement of less than 10,000 inhabitants. Deprived urban areas are defined as the most deprived 15 per cent. of super output areas in England, 15 per cent. of data zones in Scotland, and 30 per cent. of super output areas in Wales and Northern Ireland to take account of the proportional spread of disadvantaged areas across the UK.</p>

Implicit in this criterion is a safeguard for people in remote areas who might otherwise not have been assured of reasonable accessibility to services under nationally-applied criteria alone.</p>

 There have been cases where the remediation of contaminated land was not addressed appropriately prior to redevelopment. This is why the Government published new planning policy on land remediation in 2004. The policy, set out in Planning Policy Statement 23: &#147;Planning and Pollution Control&#148; (PPS23) and supporting annexe, expects a local planning authority in granting planning permission for new development to be satisfied that the proposed development is appropriate, having regard to the information available to it about the contamination and the proposed remediation measures and standards. PPS23 makes it clear that the developer is responsible for ensuring appropriate, competent professional advice is available to carry out investigations of land potentially affected by contamination, assessment of risk and the design and execution of remediation works, including verification of their effectiveness. The local planning authority is entitled to rely on that advice or to challenge it on the basis of similarly-qualified expert advice accessible to it in-house or externally. In all cases the standard of remediation to be achieved through the granting of planning permission for a new development is the removal of unacceptable risk and making the site suitable for its new use.</p>

 The new planning policy statement (PPS) on climate change will boost the use of local renewable and low carbon energy in new development. The PPS sets out our &#145;Merton-Plus&#146; approach. It expects all local planning authorities to have a council-wide target (like existing Merton rules) and, additionally, tailored targets for sites where there is greater potential for using decentralised energy to supply new development. These targets should be flexible enough to consider community schemes (for example, wind turbines or CHP schemes serving more than one site) as well as building specific technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80128w0025.htm_para2"><a name="08012839001981">Councils could still set an on-site target in their Development Plan Document (DPD) provided they can show this is the only local energy option and there are no other options than on-site.

The findings of this research and consultation are available on the Communities and Local Government website. Following this assessment, the Secretary of State has recently issued draft guidance for consultation which sets out the role that Government think, subject to the results of consultation, LSPs might be expected to perform and the key governance principles which we recommend they might adopt.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will consider introducing a court diversion scheme for offenders aged 16 to 25 involving attendance on a course of military training as an alternative to court sentencing. [178215]</p>

 The Government share the concerns about offending by young people and recognises that the military may have resources that could benefit young offenders. We are consulting with a range of organisations which have an interest in youth justice and the provision of youth justice services as part of the Youth Crime Action Plan which will be published in the summer, and will consider the feasibility of sending young offenders on training programmes by the armed services in light of the response to that consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80128w0034.htm_para3"><a name="0801297002610">However, we do not think that a course of military training is the answer. Research from the United States indicates that simply adopting a military-style regime does not, of itself, reduce reoffending. The more successful programmes were those which supported their physically challenging and highly disciplined regimes with well developed education and training addressing offending behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80128w0034.htm_para4"><a name="0801297002611">We are planning to test out the referral of young adult offenders (18 to 25 years) to existing senior attendance centres through the conditional cautioning scheme, which diverts offenders who admit their offence from court in appropriate circumstances. The centres aim to assist these offenders to acquire and develop personal responsibility, self-discipline and new practical skills and interests within a structured and disciplined environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80128w0034.htm_para5"><a name="0801297002612">At present, the conditional cautioning scheme applies only to those aged 18 and above, but we are extending the scheme to young offenders aged 16 and 17 years old through provisions in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill currently before Parliament.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 14 January 2008]:</i> Effective language and communication skills are fundamental to children and young people&#146;s learning, development of social skills and fulfilment of their potential. On 11 September 2007, my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and the Secretary of State for Health launched a major review of the provision of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs, to be led by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80128w0035.htm_para0"><a name="0801297002732">The review will build on the investment and improvements to speech and language therapy and resources in the last 10 years. It will advise the Government on how the very best provision can be mirrored in all areas and how local services can work together so children and young people up to 19 years of age get the support they need, when they need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="80128w0035.htm_para1"><a name="0801297002733">The review has been specifically asked to consider the clarity of accountability and responsibility for planning service delivery from national to local level across health, social services and education and to analyse good practice in joint working by schools, local authorities and PCTs, particularly in joint commissioning, including needs assessment and design of service delivery. As mentioned in the Children&#146;s Plan, it will also look at means of improving support and information to parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80128w0035.htm_para2"><a name="0801297002734">The review plans to submit an interim report in March 2008 and produce a final report by July 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80128w0035.htm_para3"><a name="0801297002735">As regards parent support advisers, we have recently announced funding to expand their availability in every local authority. These advisers work with parents to improve children&#146;s behaviour and school attendance, offering advice with parenting, and providing support for families at the first sign a child or young person may be experiencing social, health or behavioural issues. Such support would include help where parents need it to address children&#146;s communication needs.</p>

 The training programme for lead teachers in gifted and talented education began to be rolled out in September 2007.

Their contribution to the national overall pass rate in 2007 (60.3 per cent.) was just 3.3 percentage points. The contribution of academic GCSEs was 51.9 percentage points. The contribution of all GCSEs (including vocational GCSEs and short courses) was 53.9 percentage points. GNVQs have now been phased out. The last cohort sat the examination last summer. GNVQs will disappear from the Achievement and Attainment Tables from 2008.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what estimate he has made of the number of 11 and 16 year olds who were functionally illiterate in each of the last 10 years; and if he will make a statement. [180786]</p>

 We do not have a measure of functional literacy, Although level 4 is the target that we expect children to reach by the end of primary school, at level 3 pupils can read a range of texts accurately and independently; and their writing is organised, legible and clear. Figures show that 93 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved at least level 3 in English in 2007. Of the 7 per cent. of children not reaching level 3, many will have special educational needs which make the achievement of level 3 or level 4 in English a very challenging target.</p>

The Government&#146;s current public service agreement target is for 60 per cent. of 16-year-olds to achieve five good GCSE grades (A*-C) or equivalent by 2008. Figures for 2007 published on 9 January show that this target has been met. But we are raising the bar and in future the target for the end of Key Stage 4 will be measured against the proportion of pupils achieving five grades A*-C or equivalent, including GCSE English and mathematics. The figures for pupils in England achieving this standard for each year since 1998 are given as follows:</p>

 Surplus school places can represent a poor use of resources. Local authorities must examine the benefits and drawbacks of redeploying resources tied up in surplus school places for the wider benefit of pupils in the area.</p>

Rationalisation can involve adapting accommodation for alternative use and broadening the services their schools offer in line with the likely future pattern of children&#146;s services and the needs of local communities.

 Performance management arrangements, introduced for teachers in England, in September 2007, are designed to establish a clear and consistent process of planning and assessment so that teachers and head teachers understand what is expected of them, and that support teachers and head teachers in addressing their professional development needs. The revised arrangements introduce a more structured approach to the planning meeting at the beginning of the year, including clarity about how performance will be assessed at the end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="80128w0040.htm_para1"><a name="0801297004442">In order for performance management to operate in a fair and transparent way, teachers must know what is required of them before any assessment can be made. The framework of professional standards for teachers, introduced in September 2007, helps to provide this context. The standards are statements of a teacher&#146;s professional attributes; professional knowledge and understanding, and professional skills. They provide clarity of the expectations at each career stage and support teachers in identifying their professional development needs. The framework for standards will, therefore, provide a backdrop to the revised performance management arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="80128w0040.htm_para2"><a name="0801297004443">Effective management, clear expectations and appropriate support are key factors in addressing weaknesses in performance. Ongoing professional dialogue will enable any such issues to be identified early, thereby avoiding the need for formal capability procedures in most cases. Where a teacher&#146;s capability is still in question after all normal avenues have been exhausted then formal capability procedures should be instigated, in line with locally agreed practice.</p>
