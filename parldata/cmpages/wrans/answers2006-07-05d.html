<i> [holding answer 29 June 2006]: </i>The current development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA).

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="60705w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06070581000043">Individual member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are responsible, under their own national and/or any international export control regimes&#151;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime) and Wassenaar&#151;of which they are signatories, for the control of strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required. For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assess Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these criteria.</p>

 The Department has made substantial investment in road transport related schemes in Yorkshire during the first local transport plan period (2001-06) and will sustain this investment throughout the second period, which runs until 2011. This includes significant investment by the Highways Agency on the motorway and trunk road network in the Yorkshire and Humber region over the last five years. This high level of investment is set to continue with, for example, the innovative &#163;1.29 billion programme announced last year to reduce congestion on strategic routes in South and West Yorkshire.</p>

These cover major (greater than &#163;5 million) local transport plan schemes and major Highways Agency schemes other than on those on roads of the greatest strategic national and international importance.</p>

 The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Wales Office was an early adopter of pre-legislative scrutiny and the national health service (Wales) Bill was scrutinised during the 2001-02 session. Since then, a further three Bills introduced by my Department were published in draft for consultation: the Public Audit (Wales) Bill; the Transport (Wales) Bill; and, the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill. A public consultation has always been conducted in parallel with the pre-legislative scrutiny process. My Department has also introduced two further Bills. My Department had conducted a public consultation jointly with the Welsh Assembly on the principles underlying the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Bill, and as there was general support for the proposals, further scrutiny was not considered necessary, and would only have further delayed the legislation. The Government of Wales Bill, which is currently before the House, was introduced without pre-legislative scrutiny, because the proposals need to be implemented for the May 2007 Assembly elections. Extensive consultation was however undertaken on the White Paper, which was published well in advance of this Bill being introduced. All the Department's formal consultations also abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation.</p>

 The UK strongly supports the Global Fund and wants it to be effective in the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria. The Global Fund recently revised its resource needs to an estimated US$5.5 billion for 2006 and 2007. There is a current funding gap of US$2.1 billion for 2006 and 2007. Of this, US$1 billion is needed this year to fund a new round of grants which was launched by the board in April. The Mid-Term Review of the Global Fund (4-5 July 2006) will review the fund&#146;s performance and mobilise extra resources for 2006-07 to fill the funding gap.

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2006]: </i>DFID does not track long-term health sector spending because we provide pooled financial support for basic health services. But, as the Prime Minister recently made clear, we are committed to making good on our G8 promises, and a key part of this is to support developing countries with long-term, sustainable financing for health. We are currently working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to encourage development of long-term&#151;10 year&#151;health plans and to ensure that predictable support is available from donors for them. This long-term support will provide poor countries with the security to make long-term investments and meet the costs of salaries, drugs, infrastructure and training. We have also increased our funding to multilateral organisations supporting countries to strengthen their health services, including to the Global Fund and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). We are spearheading innovative efforts to secure significant additional resources for essential health care through the International Finance Facility for Immunisation, with the first bond issue due in the coming months.</p>

 The main impact of recent military action has been to the loss of electrical power following damage to Gaza's only power plant. The closure of the Nahal Oz oil pipeline from 26 June to 2 July and greater difficulty in movement due to the destruction of three bridges providing north-south access have also had an effect. Hospitals in Gaza are maintaining services by using back-up generators, although there are reports that supplies of some essential drugs and supplies are nearly finished. It is difficult for anyone from the south to access to the main referral hospital in Gaza city in the north.</p>

Most of the water supply to Gaza is pumped from wells.

The vouchers can be used to pay registered child minders, nurseries, playgroups, crÃ¨ches, nannies, holiday play schemes for school age children, and close relatives who care for children, thus allowing staff a range of choices when making their child care arrangements.

 The overall daily resource cost of running the House administration in 2003-04 and 2004-05 was &#163;487,000 and &#163;520,000 respectively. The difference in cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around &#163;90,000 of additional works expenditure was incurred directly by the House sitting in each September period.</p>

 Pay 2000 is the generic term used to describe the incremental pay system for armed forces personnel.

Supplies of the Td/IPV triple booster are not affected by the national shortage of immunoglobulin, and there are currently no known shortages in naval or military units.</p>

 The Department does not make use of private debt collectors. Of the executive agencies, Companies House uses the services of a debt collector in connection with the administration of the penalties raised on companies for late filing of accounts. The Insolvency Service uses agents for the collection of book debts (moneys owed by creditors to bankrupts and companies in liquidation) where the Official Receiver is trustee or liquidator and to collect costs from directors who are disqualified as a result of a court hearing.</p>

 There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO. In all cases the relevant containment and operating requirements laid down by Health and Safety Executive/Defra would need to be met.</p>

Electoral registers are available for public inspection and anyone who believes that an ineligible person has been included may notify the ERO who may then make further inquiries as to the eligibility of that individual.

The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has worked hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships Approvals Group (independently chaired by the Skills for Business Network ie Sector Skills Council led) have a key role to play in ensuring that Apprenticeship Frameworks make all reasonable adjustments to maximise participation from diverse groups.</p>

It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area. It reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived. The report is available on the DfES website http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research and the findings will be used to inform future work in this area.</p>

However, EU competence in education and training is limited to supporting and supplementing the actions of member states, and fully respects the responsibility of member states for the content and organisation of education and training. There is therefore not a great deal of EU legislation in the education and vocational training field to be transposed into domestic legislation. In the majority of cases the Department for Education and Skills responds to EU decisions, recommendations and communications through the development of policy rather than legislative changes.</p>

 It is for local authorities and schools to decide the level of resources required to support sexual health education in schools taking account of local needs. We are working to improve the quality of sexual health education in maintained schools. The Department for Education and Skills, together with Department of Health, is supporting the PSHE certification programme for teachers with over &#163;2 million in 2006-07. In addition, both Departments are supporting the national healthy schools programme with &#163;12.3 million of funding in 2006-07. These programmes support schools in delivering sexual health education as part of broader programmes.</p>

 All public service schemes pay cash equivalent transfer values to other pension schemes in respect of accrued rights in compliance with pensions law. Under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the Public Sector Transfer Club. The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights.</p>

 Extinction of a species within the UK is now a rare event. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan was published in 1995 and included a list of priority species and habitats for which urgent conservation action was required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="60705w0014.htm_para4"><a name="06070623001349">In 1999, 2002 and 2005 reports were published on the progress made on these priorities. These reports included actions to be taken and an update on the status of the priority species. In 2002, one species, the Starry Breck Lichen (Buellia asterella), was reported as having become extinct, and two UKBAP priority species, the pool frog and interrupted brome, were reported to have been lost. Both the pool frog and interrupted brome have since been re-introduced. Although both re-introduction projects are at an early stage and there is some way to go before the species are successfully re-established, effectively their extinction has been reversed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="60705w0014.htm_para5"><a name="06070623001350">This is the only evidence we have of a UK species becoming extinct within the last 10 years. It is also worth noting that the Pashford pot beetle (Cryptocephalus exiguus), another priority species, has not been found at its known localities for a number of years but this is not thought to represent sufficient evidence of extinction yet.</p>

 The end of the regulatory payment window for the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS) is 30 June 2006. Discussions with the European Commission suggest that a formal extension to that window is unlikely, but those discussions will continue, focussed on the application of separate regulatory requirements on the EU funding of payments. As things stand, those requirements are, in summary, that where payments made after 30 June in any member state amount to 4 per cent. or less of what was paid out before that date, no reduction in EU funding will be imposed. For any amounts outstanding after 30 June over and above the 4 per cent. threshold, reductions will apply as follows:</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) offsets the carbon dioxide and other emissions generated by the air travel of Ministers and officials based in the UK. Each year we offset the previous year&#146;s air travel emissions, so in 2005-06 we offset our 2004 emissions. An agreement was signed with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) at the end of 2005 to offset our 2004 emissions, one year ahead of the requirement for Government Departments to offset air travel by April 2006.

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i> 1. Projections of the number and proportion of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes. 2. The estimates of proportions shown here are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit. 3. Projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain. 4. These projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper. 5. Estimates cover all those aged above women&#146;s state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain. 6. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women&#146;s state pension age. 7. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-5 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. 8. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible are rounded to the nearest 50,000.<br>

Projections of the proportion of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes. 2. The estimates of proportions shown here are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit. 3. The reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper. 4. Estimates cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain. 5. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's state pension age. 6. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004/5 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to Pension Credit, which adjust 2004/5 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.<br>

 Earnings-related accruals of state second pension would be tapered away by around 2030 by freezing the national insurance upper earnings limit, for the purpose of state second pension accruals, in cash terms from the point at which earnings uprating of the basic state pension as proposed in the White Paper is introduced. Earnings-related accruals built up under the state earnings-related pension scheme and/or the state second pension prior to 2030 would be fully protected and would continue to be revalued in line with earnings from that date. The combination of our proposals to &#145;flat-rate&#146; accruals of the state second pension and earnings uprate the basic state pension would ensure that the state pension outcomes for people reaching state pension age after 2030 would not be reduced.

The Club is a network of public and private sector occupational pension schemes which makes it easier for employees who move between employers covered by separate participating schemes to transfer their accrued pension rights. There is also a requirement under the Fair Deal for Staff Pensions to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the public sector under Public Private Partnerships/Public Finance Initiatives or under Machinery of Government movements and subsequent transfers for former public servants.</p>

introduced Operation Bullent in the Downpatrick, Newry and Mourne, Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt districts.

I understand that this initiative has identified a number of persons who have been charged and are remanded in custody awaiting trial in relation to burglary offences against older people.</p>

Following the 2001 Census a number of improvements were made to the methodology of international migration. Improvements were made to allow for those who stayed in their destination country for longer or shorter than they had originally intended, and therefore either became or were no longer considered a migrant (migrant and visitor switchers). Improvements were also made to fully allow for the migration of dependants of asylum seekers and to fully estimate outflows of failed asylum seekers and their dependants.

</ul><a name="60705w0028.htm_brev33"><a name="06070623004907"><ul><p class="tabletext">More specifically the IMPS project will consider how further improvements can be made to the internal migration methodology and data sources, one example of this is the issues around students registration with GPs. Research involving international migration will consider improvements in how to distribute International Passenger Survey (IPS) flows within England and Wales. In addition to this, other possible data sources will be considered, as will improvements to the estimations of IPS flows by altering and adding to existing questions in the IPS. In addition, ONS set up a Task Force on Migration Statistics in May. This aims to identify improvements that could realistically be made over the next couple of years.</p>

 The independent advisory committee on pesticides (ACP) provides authoritative advice to Government on all aspects of pesticides. At its meeting in November 2004, the ACP considered a report produced by its medical and toxicology panel on the possible links between pesticides and Parkinson&#146;s disease. At that meeting, the committee concluded that although this review indicated a correlation between recalled pesticide exposure and Parkinson&#146;s disease it did not point to a particular toxic mechanism or a hazard from a specific compound or group of compounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_697"><a name="60705w0033.htm_para4"><a name="06070623002023">However, the committee did advise that further mechanistic and epidemiological research be carried out on the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson&#146;s disease. The tender process has been organised by the pesticides safety directorate and has now finished. Two research proposals have now been funded by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, one is an epidemiology study, the other a mechanistic study.</p>
