Ladyman</b><i> [holding answer 29 June 2006]: </i>The current
development phase is a joint project between the Directorate General
for Transport and Energy in the European Commission and the European
Space Agency (ESA). The Supervisory Board of the Galileo Joint
Undertaking is established to ensure an adequate information flow and
political control by member states of the implementation of the
development phase.</p><p><a name="06070581000042">The
Government are aware of the sensitive nature of some parts of Galileo.
We continue to monitor the project closely. We have been careful to
ensure that any agreements with partners in the programme that are not
member states of the EU or ESA specifically exclude them from
participation in all sensitive
aspects.</p><p><a name="06070581000043">Individual
member states of the ESA and EU participating in Galileo are
responsible, under their own national and/or any international export
control regimes&#151;such as MCTR (Missile Technology Control Regime)
and Wassenaar&#151;of which they are signatories, for the control of
strategic exports and should apply these rules to Galileo as required.
For example, all EU countries follow the EU Code of Conduct on Arms
Exports which prohibits export of military technology, including dual
use technologies where a military end use is known or suspected, to
non-EU states, including China, where this is inappropriate. An
assessment of the risk of diversion to an undesirable end user or end
use is a key criterion under the code. The UK Government assesses
Galileo technology proposed for transfer to non-EU states against these
criteria.</p><br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 1070W</b><br>

there is no formal link between the two. In contrast to the EUWI, the
EUWF is a funding mechanism. The Water Facility has made &#8364;500

analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010
approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking
water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to
basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this
year and the full &#8364;500 million of the Water Facility will be

gap of US$2.1 billion for 2006 and 2007. Of this, US$1 billion is
needed this year to fund a new round of grants which was launched by
the board in April. The Mid-Term Review of the Global Fund (4-5 July
2006) will review the fund&#146;s performance and mobilise extra
resources for 2006-07 to fill the funding gap. The UK has committed

closed, trade with Israel has all but stopped and a very limited number
of public sector salaries have been paid. Most of the water supply to

Harvey:</b> The House provides child care
vouchers to the value of &#163;8 per child per day. The Commission
favours the child care voucher scheme because of its flexibility and
availability to staff wherever they are based. Vouchers are available
for children up to and including age 11. The vouchers can be used to
pay registered child minders, nurseries, playgroups, cr√®ches,
nannies, holiday play schemes for school age children, and close
relatives who care for children, thus allowing staff a range of choices
when making their child care arrangements. Information can be found on
the parliamentary intranet. The scheme is currently under review to
ensure the House continues to offer the most appropriate arrangements
for the majority of
staff.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070589000004">Delegations</h3><p><a name="06070589000018"><b><a name="06070589000056">Mr.

what the cost was of the sittings of Parliament in September <i> (a)</i>
2003 and <i> (b)</i> 2004; how many contracts were changed due to the

of running the House administration in 2003-04 and 2004-05 was
&#163;487,000 and &#163;520,000 respectively. The difference in
cost between sitting and non-sitting days is small, as the major costs
of accommodation and staffing are not appreciably affected. Major works
and other contracts were negotiated on the basis of the revised sitting
arrangements in both September 2003 and 2004. It is therefore
impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of
alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that around
&#163;90,000 of additional works expenditure was incurred directly by
the House sitting in each September
period.</p>

Watson:</b> The Ministry of Defence&#146;s requirement for
tetanus immunoglobulin is low. It is only used to treat patients with
wounds who have not received the normal tetanus vaccine. Very few such
cases arise in our armed forces since MOD aims to ensure that all its
personnel have up-to-date tetanus vaccinations prior to deployment. The
only people who would need it would therefore be any service personnel
who missed their vaccination and any non-UK individuals who are treated
in our medical facilities in
theatre.</p><p><a name="060705105000126">There is a
temporary UK national shortage of tetanus immunoglobulin. We do not
currently have any centrally held defence stocks in the UK. However,
with the exception of designated field hospitals, units are not
required to hold tetanus immunoglobulin, although some do at the
discretion of individual medical officers. We are not aware of any
stock shortfall of tetanus immunoglobulin in the designated field
hospitals and we do not expect a shortfall to arise before supplies
become available
again.</p><p><a name="060705105000127">Routine
tetanus immunisation is given by the combined low dose
diphtheria/tetanus/inactivated polio (Td/IPV) triple booster which is
administered at trainee entrant establishments. Personnel who require a
further booster dose because they have sustained an injury from which
they could be at risk of an acute tetanus infection can also be given
the Td/IPV triple booster. Supplies of the Td/IPV triple booster are
not affected by the national shortage of immunoglobulin, and there are
currently no known shortages in naval or military
units.</p><p><a name="060705105000128">In light of
the national shortage, the MOD has repeated recent Department of Health
guidance on tetanus immunoglobulin to defence medical personnel,

Platoon Commander said there was a practice of making looters wet which
was discussed at the company &#147;O&#148; Group meetings; however

miserable.</p><p><a name="0607061000067">Mr. Niall

consider this dangerous because it involved the use of minimum
force.</p><p><a name="0607061000068">Despite this
evidence, coming from higher up the chain of command, the evidence
given at trial made it clear that neither the commanders on the ground
nor the individual soldiers were aware of such a policy or practice
(officially sanctioned or otherwise). Not one of the accused raised
this in their witness statements or interviews under caution. None of
the members of their platoon or section who gave evidence knew of such
a policy or had even heard of looters being put into water-knowledge of
the policy, if one did indeed exist, was restricted to the middle
echelons of the chain of command
only.</p><p><a name="0607061000069">During the course
of the trial a statement was obtained from the then Battle Group
Commander, Brigadier Riddle-Webster, who said that the practice of

such a practice he would have put a stop to it immediately since he
regarded it as illegal, dangerous and immoral. However due to legal

key success criterion for Apprenticeships from the outset has been that
the programme should be open to all young people regardless of gender,
ethnic origin or disability and it should provide equal access
particularly to those from potentially socially disadvantaged or
marginalised groups. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has worked
hard to establish and build on the Apprenticeship Frameworks and
procedures required for successful equality. The Apprenticeships
Approvals Group (independently chaired by the Skills for Business
Network ie Sector Skills Council led) have a key role to play in
ensuring that Apprenticeship Frameworks make all reasonable adjustments
to maximise participation from diverse groups.</p><p><a name="0607061000170">The LSC maintain a website

School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by
local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and
school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment,
and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded
from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and
rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services
such as home to school transport, local authority administration and
the financing of capital expenditure. This is drawn from the 2004-05

Projections of the number and proportion of pensioner households
eligible for pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and
to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner
incomes. 2. The estimates of proportions shown here are the
mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation
models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase
in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which
would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension
credit. 3. Projections of the number of pensioner households
eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions
eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great
Britain. 4. These projections assume: continued earnings
uprating of the standard guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the
savings credit threshold from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the
basic state pension from 2012; price uprating of the maximum savings
credit from 2015; measures to improve coverage of the basic state
pension described in the White Paper. 5. Estimates cover all
those aged above women&#146;s state pension age in the private
household population of Great Britain. 6. Estimates account
for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also
account for the proposed further increases in state pension age
described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age
at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with
women&#146;s state pension age. 7. Estimates are calibrated
to the mid-points of the 2004-5 National Statistics range estimates of
non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family
Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.

Hanson:</b> Statistically older people in Northern Ireland are
still the least likely group of citizens to become a victim of crime.
However over the past couple of years there has been a disproportional
increase in domestic burglaries committed against those aged 65 years
and over as a proportion of the population. It is also recognised that
the fear of crime among older people is
significant.</p><p><a name="06070623003060">The
Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office has developed and
funds the Lock Out Crime Scheme (LOCs) which supplies and installs free
of charge additional home security in the form of door and window
locks, door chains and viewers and external front and rear door
lighting to the homes of all those aged 65 and over who are in receipt
of housing benefit or a rate
rebate.</p><p><a name="06070623003061">Since the
launch in May 2004 up until 3 June 2006, 52,688, letters have been
issued and 16,087 individuals have so far returned forms and have been
admitted to 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 1186W</b><br>the scheme. Since that date a further 4,361 letters of offer have been
issued for which registration is
on-going.</p><p><a name="06070623003062">In addition
on 27 March 2006 I launched a mobile pilot handy van service in the
Greater Belfast area. This service which is being managed by Help the
Aged fits free additional home security measures for those older people
who don't qualify for the LOG Scheme. There is also the Unknown Callers
TV Advertising campaign aimed at providing information to older people
about answering the door to bogus callers. This advert was screened for
a total of six weeks during
2005.</p><p><a name="06070623003063">The police offer
free advice about home security and personal attack alarms to older
people and several of the Community Safety Partnerships (there is a
partnership in each district council area) have included the safety of
older people as a priority issue in their action plans for tackling
crime. These plans have now been agreed with the Community Safety Unit
and the Partnerships are currently in the process of setting up their
projects.</p><p><a name="06070623003064">Finally,
the police have established a special team to co-ordinate the
investigations of attacks upon older people across the Downpatrick,
Newry and Mourne, Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South
Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt
districts. I understand that this initiative has identified a number of
persons who have been were charged with and are remanded in custody
awaiting trail in relation to burglary offences against older
people.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070623000170">Teenage

rioting in Dublin on the day of the Love Ulster parade was in no way
representative of the views of the vast majority of the people there.
He further added that he did not believe that it would have any lasting
impact on the peace process or on relations generally and that the
rioting was organised by a small group of agitators and had been
rightly condemned on all

Crime</h3><p><a name="06070623003072"><b><a name="06070623005423">Dr.
McCrea:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland what measures are being taken to tackle violent crime
against the elderly in Northern Ireland.
[48279]</p><p><a name="06070623003073"><b><a name="06070623005424">Mr.
Hanson:</b> Older people in Northern Ireland are still the
least likely group of citizens to become a victim of crime. However the
recorded crime statistics for 2004-05 and 2005-06 to date would
indicate that those persons aged 65years and over are disproportionably
affected by domestic burglary as a proportion of the population. It is
also recognised that the fear of crime among older people is
significant. To address these issues the Community Safety Unit of the
Northern Ireland Office is currently leading on the development of a
strategy for the safety of older people. It is planned to publish the
draft strategy document for consultation in the autumn of
2006.</p><p><a name="06070623003074">On
a practical level the Unit has developed and funds a number of ongoing
initiatives to tackle the problems of crime and the fear of crime
amongst older people. These include the Unknown Callers TV advertising
campaign which provides information to older people about answering the
door to bogus callers and the Lock Out Crime Scheme that supplies and
installs free of charge additional home security, in the form of door
and window locks, door chains and viewers and external lighting to the
homes of all those aged 65 and over who are in receipt of housing
benefit or rate rebate. A mobile pilot Handy Van service was also
launched on 27 March 2006 in the Greater Belfast area to fit free home
security devices for the elderly who do not qualify for the LOG
Scheme.</p><p><a name="06070623003075">The police in
addition to offering free advice about personal security and personal
attack alarms have 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 1188W</b><br>introduced Operation Bullent in the Downpatrick, Newry and Mourne,
Craigavon, Banbridge, Armagh, Dungannon and South Tyrone, Fermanagh,
Cookstown, Omagh, Strabane and Magherafelt districts. This project
deals with the problem of travelling criminals who commit burglary
offences, including those that involve violence, predominantly against
persons over 65 years in these districts by co-ordinating their
intelligence, investigations of crimes and delivery of preventative
measures. I understand that this initiative has identified a number of
persons who have been charged with and are remanded in custody awaiting
trial in relation to burglary offences against older people.</p><p><a name="06070623003076">At community
level, several of the Community Safety Partnerships (there is a
partnership in each council area) after conducting a community audit,
have included the safety of older people as a priority issue in their
respective action plans to tackle crime. These plans have now been
agreed with the Community Safety Unit and the partnerships are
currently in the process of setting up their initiatives.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070623000174">Waste

376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a

were known limitations with the electoral roll data source. For example
there were variations in the registers caused by the procedures used to
maintain them. It was also possible for people to be registered in two
different areas, such as students, and those under 18 were not
included. Research was carried out that identified a higher quality
data source in GP registers. From 1999 onwards, the internal migration
component of the population estimates was based on a combination of
NHSCR and GP register
data.</p></ul><a name="06070623004903"><ul><p class="tabletext">Population
estimates use the United Nations definition of an international

methodology of international migration. Improvements were made to allow
for those who stayed in their destination country for longer or shorter

no longer considered a migrant (migrant and visitor switchers).
Improvements were also made to fully allow for the migration of
dependants of asylum seekers and to fully estimate outflows of failed
asylum seekers and their dependants. Along with more minor technical
adjustments to migration estimates, these changes have been
incorporated into the revised 1991 to 2001

England and Wales. In addition to this, other possible data sources
will be considered, as will improvements to the estimations of IPS
flows by altering and adding to existing questions in the IPS. In

PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and
1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing
values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP)
practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor,
with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased
to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based
fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to
missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis
including these years need to be aware of these issues in their
interpretation of the data. <i> Ungrossed

Flint:</b> The NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) is the key
component of the new systems and services being delivered through the
national programme for information technology. It has a number of
applications,
including:</p><a name="0607077003041"><ul><p class="tabletext">personal
demographics service (PDS), which holds nationally demographic
information for every patient covered by the national health service in
England, accessible through local systems, and is currently processing
message transactions at a rate of over 9 million per
month;</p></ul><a name="0607077003042"><ul><p class="tabletext">spine
directory services, which holds reference data such as users and
locations. Over 260,000 users are now registered, around 50,000
currently access the system on any given
day;</p></ul><a name="0607077003043"><ul><p class="tabletext">access
control framework, which registers and authenticates users, including
patients, and provides a single log-in and a record of each
professional accessing a NHS care record;
and</p></ul><a name="0607077003044"><ul><p class="tabletext">transaction
messaging system, which processes and routes data messages, for example
from a GP to a hospital or from one general practitioner to
another.</p></ul><p><a name="0607077000378">Introduction
of the NHS CRS has not been delayed. These four elements went live on
time and to budget in July 2004 to support choose and book. Among other
planned applications, the first stage of the secondary uses service
went live in June 2005 to support payment by results. Other core
modules are scheduled for release over the course of 2006 and 2007.
However, ambitious initial targets were set to drive the programme, and
some individual components have been
delayed.</p><p><a name="0607077000379">In general
implementation is being achieved in carefully managed stages, via
incremental rollout both geographically, and by increasing
functionality over time to build the care record. The programme is
about patient and clinician benefit and improved safety. We believe it
is best to get things right in the long term rather than to push on
regardless against a rigid 
<br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 1250W</b><br>timetable and risk getting things wrong in the short term. In the
context of a 10-year programme the impact of this is
limited.</p><p><a name="0607077000380">When fully
deployed, the NHS CRS will be made up of records of individual
clinicians recording episodes of care, key aspects of which will be
placed in the detailed care record for sharing with others as their
roles allow within local health communities, and a summary care record.
The national programme&#146;s national clinical leads, working with
NHS Connecting for Health, have undertaken work with a wide range of
groups including the British Medical Association and the royal colleges
to consider the best way of populating and launching the summary care
record.</p><p><a name="0607077000381">As a result, a
limited amount of clinical information will be automatically uploaded,
such as prescriptions and allergies. More detailed information would
then be added on a case by case basis. This approach is supported by
the BMA on the basis that as it takes full account of the views of
patients.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607077000032">NHS

result, traffic using the slip-road will continue to be restricted to a
single lane, with a 40mph speed limit, for safety reasons. Short-term

information available is from Land Use Change Statistics, shown in the
following tables. The tables show figures for 2004 and the average for
2001 to 2004 for each local authority in the south east. Single year
figures at local authority level are not representative due to small
sample sizes and are therefore subject to fluctuation, so the average
over the period 2001 to 2004 is a better representation than the figure
for a single year.</p><p><a name="0607077001613">The
figures provided in the previous answer included conversions, which are
only available at a regional level. The figures in this answer
therefore exclude conversions, and as a result the regional total shown
will be different.</p><p><a name="0607077001614">The
tables also include figures for 1989 to 1992. Before 1989 the data was
based on smaller samples and so is not comparable.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="5"><i> New

Justice and Court Services
Act</h3><p><a name="06070727000373"><b><a name="06070727003511">Mr.
Amess:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for the
Home Department if he will make a statement on the operation of section
57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000; and what recent
representations he has received about the operation of this <i> (a)</i>
section and <i> (b)</i> Act.
[71014]</p><p><a name="06070727000374"><b><a name="06070727003512">Mr.
Coaker:</b> Section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court
Services Act 2000 (CJCS) inserted new provisions in section 38 of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). These provisions enable
police custody officers to detain a person after charge for the
purposes of taking a sample (of urine or other non-intimate sample) to
test for the presence of specified Class A drugs, subject to conditions
and procedures set out in sections 63B and 63C of PACE
.</p><p><a name="06070727000375">The Drugs Act 2005
(section 7 and paragraphs 1-4 of Schedule 1) subsequently amended
section 63B and other sections of PACE to allow for the testing of
adults for specified Class A drugs on arrest while retaining the powers
for testing on charge in the case of adults and the under eighteens
(where applicable). Where a person has tested positive under these
powers, section 9 of the Drugs Act introduced a new power for the
police to require adults to attend an assessment of their drug use or
face a criminal
sanction.</p><p><a name="06070727000376">This
legislation forms a core part of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP)
and aims to identify problematic drug misusers at the earliest
opportunity of their contact with the criminal justice system and get
them into drug treatment and other support. Currently, drug testing
operates within the 71 crime partnership areas across England and Wales
with high levels of acquisitive crime, the so called &#145;DIP
intensive
areas&#146;.</p><p><a name="06070727000377">The
volume of tests conducted under this legislation continues to grow.
Some 17, 400 adult drug tests were carried out in April 2006, more than
three times the number in April
2005.</p><p><a name="06070727000378">The Home Office
has received no specific recent representations about the operation of
section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 although
a number of police forces have made enquiries about introducing drug
testing in their
areas.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06070727000022">Criminal Records
Bureau</h3><p><a name="06070727000379"><b><a name="06070727003513">Mr.
Burstow:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
the Home Department how many Criminal Records Bureau disclosure
applications were received in each of the last 12 months; how many were
issued; and what the average length of time taken to issue a disclosure
was in each month.
[81688]</p><p><a name="06070727000380"><b><a name="06070727003514">Joan
Ryan:</b> The total number of disclosure applications received
and disclosures issued by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in the last
12 months is contained in table
1.</p><p><a name="06070727000381">Information on the
average length of time taken to process the checks during these periods
is not available in the format requested. The CRB operates to a set of
a Published Service Standards (PSS) which for the majority of the
period was to publish 93 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two
weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. The
monthly performance measured against the PSS is as shown in tables 2
and 3.</p><p><a name="06070727000382">The four week
target for Enhanced Disclosures is made up of two distinct parts. The
CRB is required to process 90 per cent. of valid Enhanced Disclosure
applications to the police within 10 days, with the police forces
required to process 95 per cent. of the checks within a further 14
days. The CRB consistently exceeded their target in 2005-06 and, for
May 2006, processed 97.4 per cent. of applications to the police within
10 days. The CRB and the police forces are working together to reduce
police completion times in line with the overall service standard
objectives.</p><p><a name="06070727000383">The CRB
recently published its Five-Year Strategy and Business Plan 2006-07 and
the PSS for the financial year 2006-07 for Standard Disclosures
is90 per cent. within 10 days and for Enhanced Disclosures 90
per cent. within 28 days. The shortening of the Standard Disclosure PSS
is the result of the effectiveness of the CRB&#146;s internal
processes.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 1325W</b><br><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="3"><i> Table

and the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. At the
conclusion of the trials in August, the IMPACT Programme Board will
have a better understanding of the business benefits and resources
required to respond to inter-force requests for information following a
match on the INI. It is for forces to determine how to manage the
resource requirements to implement the new operational capability we
are delivering. The INI is being developed to incorporate certain local
audit and administration functions. We are currently assessing the
impact of INI on forces in terms of the operational benefits delivered
by the system and the demands associated with responding to inter-force

10.5 per cent. retired with an ill-health pension, based on available
data from 42 out of 43 forces. Since the number of retirements is
liable to change from year to year, the rate of ill-health retirement
is now measured against the number of officers in service, this being a
more stable measure. For 2004-05 the rate of ill-health retirement was
three per 1,000 serving officers. These figures are published in HM
Chief Inspector of Constabulary&#146;s annual report for 2004-05

data for April. These steps include the recruitment of 38 additional
staff and the transfer of four experienced Incapacity Benefit staff
from another site to bolster experience levels. We have also reviewed
our internal process from first contact by the customer to payment,
which will reduce the time it takes to assess claims. We are reviewing
progress against this plan weekly and putting in place arrangements to
clear the arrears of claims that have built up by lending Chippenham
additional help from outside.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="6" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>6 July 2006 : Column 1348W</b><br><a name="06070727003456"><ul><p class="tabletext">I have set out in the attached

(CAS) is a management information tool that is used to assess and
monitor the attitudes of serving officers and soldiers over time. Its
findings inform the development of service personnel strategy and
policies. In the ninth Serving Personnel (SP9) survey, which was
distributed in September 2005, question 66 was removed and replaced
with question 39c, an open-ended question which asks &#147;If within
the last 12 months you have suffered unfair treatment, discrimination,
harassment and/or bullying and you have chosen not to complain please
explain why?&#148;. The analysis of open-ended questions is complex
and not contained in the Technical Annex of the CAS Report, which is
placed in the Library of the
House.</p><p><a name="06070727001030">The analysis of
question 39c is summarised as follows. It gives the number of comments
made as well as a more detailed breakdown of the negative comments,
which are used to identify areas for improvement. Overall, a total of
90 officers and 252 soldiers commented, which equates to 8 per cent.
and 16 per cent. respectively of those who responded to the

a wide range of opportunities for personal and community development
(PCDL). I reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard the funding for PCDL

education (adult and community learning) with a budget of &#163;210
million in

have increased further education funding nationally by around
&#163;2.5 billion&#151;since 1997 equivalent to 48 per cent. in
real terms. Our investment in adult learning will remain broadly stable
at&#163;2.9 billion but the nature of provision will change.
Colleges will provide more publicly funded long courses to meet
national skills demands including a new free entitlement to a first
full level 3 qualification for young adults for which we are making
available new funds of &#163;25 million. Post-16 providers, including

not require parents to take up additional hours or services as a

carried out on proposals for the vetting and barring scheme (VBS).
Further engagement with stakeholders on the policy detail was carried
