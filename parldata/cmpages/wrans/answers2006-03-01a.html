 Good progress is being made overall in Asia to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty, and the region is on track to meet this target by 2015. Progress on other Millennium Development Goals is uneven. Areas of particular concern are the high rates of maternal mortality, the spread of HIV and AIDS, the quality of and access to education, especially for girls, and the need to improve access to sanitation.

 At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in November 2005 the Heads of Government reaffirmed their commitment to good governance. At the heart of the organisation is the Harare Commonwealth Declaration which sets out the shared commitment to good governance, human rights and democracy. To deliver these objectives the Commonwealth administers four Peace and Democracy Programmes: Good Offices for Peace, Democracy and Consensus Building, Rule of Law and Human Rights. Discussion has focused on learning from the experiences of member states on what works.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps he is taking to reduce corruption in sub-Saharan Africa. [49080]</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60301w01.html_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Corruption is both a symptom and a cause of poor governance. DFID supports a wide range of governance reforms to prevent, detect and take action against corruption. For example, DFID is helping countries to reform their judicial system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. DFID also supports public financial management reforms in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, DFID also provides technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia. DFID also helps civil society hold African governments to account for the proper use of public resources. For example, DFID supports the international NGO Transparency International and its country chapters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">In addition, African countries are working together to tackle corruption regionally as well as in their countries. For example, DFID is helping the East and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) to build capacity in the region to prevent and detect money-laundering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Both developed and developing countries must play their part to reduce corruption in Africa. In 2005 at Gleneagles, G8 countries committed to a set of actions at home to help stop corruption in Africa. DFID is working with other Government Departments to meet these commitments in the UK. For example, secondary legislation is now in place to enable the UK to ratify the UN convention against corruption, the first global anti-corruption standard. We expect to ratify imminently.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the role of remittances from abroad in assisting development and poverty reduction; what studies he has commissioned on the impact of such remittances; and how such research has influenced aid strategies.

 DFID is active in assessing the role of remittances in development and poverty reduction, and uses the resulting findings to inform its aid programming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_17">In general, studies indicate that remittances reduce poverty in developing countries. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Recent research from Guatemala and the Philippines show that remittances reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty. Households receiving remittances were found to spend around 50 percent. more than households with no remittances.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">In Bangladesh, remittances from internal migration can represent the majority of household income. Households receiving remittances have higher nutritional and health status, higher levels of educational investment, and pools of money available for emergencies.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_18">At the level of the economy, research suggests that remittances provide valuable foreign exchange for developing countries, and strengthen the balance of payments situation. Unlike other financial flows, remittances are counter cyclical, thus alleviating macroeconomic shocks. Remittances can also provide investment capital for economic activity, contributing to economic growth. Where remittance flows are saved rather than spent, they provide a higher deposit base for the banking system, which is necessary for economic growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_19">DFID has funded a number of studies and also analyses relevant research by other organisations such as the World Bank. DFID funded a study in 2003 on remittances to developing countries in general which found a positive poverty reduction role for remittances. This finding was supported by DFID studies in 2004 and 2005 in Nigeria, Ghana and Bangladesh. DFID funded a household survey in the UK amongst the Bangladeshi community last year, which explored the impact on recipients of remittances to Bangladesh. DFID has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2006 : Column 707W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
recently commissioned a wider household survey to better understand the volume and value of remittance flows from key ethnic minority communities within the UK, and their impact on respective recipient countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_20">DFID also funded a study to determine the contribution of UK based diasporas to development and poverty reduction. The study noted wider benefits from remittances and other forms of assistance from diasporas and migrant communities. These benefits were in the form of relief from war and disaster and in post war reconstruction (e.g. Somalia, Sri Lanka), and in education and health. .
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_21">DFID has used this research to design aid strategies in reducing barriers to remittance flows and further enhance their developmental impact. In particular, DFID has initiated remittance country partnerships programmes with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. These partnerships include work to extend access to remittances to poorer and more rural people, encourage greater competition and lower remittance prices, and improve data. This will be achieved by working with the private sector to extend access and outreach, and working with central banks and government, to address regulatory, data, competition and consumer issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_22">In terms of work in the UK, DFID has recently set up a taskforce comprising of banks and money transfer companies, in order to lower remittance prices and improve the services they provide to low income migrants. The taskforce will implement recommendations from a public/private sector working group report that DFID launched late last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w02.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_23">DFID has also initiated a website (www.sendmoneyhome.org) for those wishing to send remittances to developing countries from the UK. This provides easily available comparative information on remittance prices and providers. The aim is to improve choice and stimulate competition, leading to lower prices and a better service for low income migrants.

<i>[holding answer 13 February 2006]:</i> In England and Wales, water resources are the responsibility of the Environment Agency, which produced in 2001 &quot;Water Resources for the Future&quot;. This strategy document considers four different future scenarios for water use, based on the &quot;Environmental Futures&#039; framework from the DTI&#039;s Foresight programme. Annual updates to the strategy keep it up-to-date. For example, the 2004 update draws from water company projections of water use that take account of population increase. Water Resources for the Future also considers demand from increased housing, which is to some extent associated with population increase. Increases in housing might also be expected to impact on rural areas and the environment. In 2004 Defra published the Entec report, &quot;Study into the Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Supply of Housing in the UK&quot;, which was partly driven by anticipated population increase. The ODPM also have an interest in housing supply increases, through their work on buildings and sustainable communities. Defra&#039;s Horizon Scanning and Futures team is currently preparing the groundwork for a study on the environmental impacts of increasing population. T his work will look at impacts on both urban and rural environments. Other elements of Defra&#039;s work include human population growth as a component: for example, population increase is factored into our air quality and emission projections.

 For transport infrastructure projects, a range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system apply to all schemes submitted to the Department for funding.

<i>[holding answer 27 February 2006]:</i> Science infrastructure is funded by the DTI through a number of routes. Universities are funded directly via the Science Research Investment Fund. Other investments are channelled through the Research Councils, who fund infrastructure both within the university sector and within their own institutes. Councils can also draw on the centrally-held Large Facilities Capital Fund for the largest new capital projects. The Research Councils or individual universities and research institutes are responsible for taking decisions on investments in science including new scientific infrastructure. Each Research Council has mechanisms for ensuring decisions are taken impartially in the best interests of the UK scientific community, overseen by a governing Council. The Department organises periodic prioritisation exercises carried out by the Research Councils to inform on the allocations of

Budget 2005 announced a commitment to increase the child element of child tax credit at least in line with average earnings up to and including 2007&#150;08.

This figure is a snapshot provided on a monthly basis. Private law includes applications for parental responsibility, residence and contact, where parents have been unable to reach agreement and Rule 9.5 cases under the Family Proceedings Rules (1991), in which a child involved in a private law case is represented by a Guardian ad Litem.

A key shift will be towards an early intervention model in those cases, which will benefit most from that. We also now have dispute resolution schemes in place in our local teams, and families who can benefit from this service now receive a prompt and timely service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

 The Department has received correspondence about university staff pay.

Pay and conditions of service are subject to negotiations between employers, their staff and their representative trade union bodies. The Government plays no part in this.
