 We continue to work with the Afghan national security forces and ISAF partners to bring security to the Afghan people. The increasing ability of Afghan security forces has been shown recently in their effective planning, leadership and execution of Operation Moshtarak, which is successfully extending the authority and influence of the Afghan Government in central Helmand Province.</p>

 The Afghan Government wants the Afghan national security forces (ANSF) to take the lead and conduct the majority of operations within three years, and to take responsibility for physical security within five years. At the London conference, the international community agreed to support this goal by continuing to improve the capability and effectiveness of the ANSF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="100222w0001.htm_para0"><a name="1002227000075">We hope that a number of provinces will transition to ANSF lead by late 2010 or early 2011, with ISAF moving to a supporting role. However, the rate of transition will depend upon conditions on the ground, and the judgment of military commanders and the Afghan Government.</p>

Charges are not raised for normal wear and tear and any charges for the replacement of lifed items such as carpets will take into account the remaining life of the item. Housing officers visit every SFA property prior to move-out in order to advise occupants what work may be required to clean properties to the required standard, and to allow occupants to raise any concerns they may have.

 A Reservist's Guaranteed Income Payment is calculated, in the same way as a Regular's, using age and salary at time of discharge and reflecting the severity of the injury. The salary for Reservists is calculated using a military salary of equivalent rank as a Regular plus any Reservist pay supplements that an individual earns to compensate those whose gross civilian salary is higher than their gross Service pay. In line with the Review Recommendations the Guaranteed Income Payment calculation will be amended to reflect, for the most seriously injured, the average number of promotions they are no longer able to receive.

This also impacts on the return flight from Kandahar. A fallback flight has run on 19 occasions in the same period to account both for these cancelled flights and for the differing capacity between KC1 TriStars that carry 115 passengers, and C2 TriStars that can carry 190, which are normally scheduled.

Furthermore, when arranging meetings, due consideration is to be made to holding the meeting at a time that will allow attendees to return to their home units and avoid the need to stay overnight.</p>

 1. Figures for 2006-07 exclude RAF data as the nationality of those joining the RAF can be identified only after 2006-07 with the introduction of the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) System.<br>
 2. Army figures for 2006-07 are for an 11 month period between 1 April 2006 and 28 February 2007. Due to the introduction of JPA, Army intake by nationality is unavailable for March 2007.<br>
 3. The data provided are provisional and subject to review due to ongoing validation of data from the JPA system.<br>
 4. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in "5" have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

 The facilities at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court currently include 66 ward beds and 120 other beds that are available for patients who do not require full ward facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="100222w0003.htm_para1"><a name="1002227000451">We keep the numbers of beds required at DMRC under regular review. I refer the hon. Member to my written ministerial statement on 10 February 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, column 52WS, which states that we are working on plans to provide up to 30 extra ward beds later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="100222w0003.htm_para2"><a name="1002227000452">No individuals undergoing a course of residential rehabilitation at Headley Court are housed elsewhere. As part of its services, DMRC also provides a range of out-patient treatment. Personnel attending for a routine out-patient appointment may be offered overnight accommodation in a local hotel if they are unable to travel to and from the unit in a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="100222w0003.htm_para3"><a name="1002227000453">Armed forces personnel requiring residential care or rehabilitation at DMRC are transferred there in accordance with their clinical need at a given date. No patients are awaiting admission because of any shortage in the availability of ward beds. Some personnel undertaking long-term rehabilitation programmes will spend periods of time at home with their families between concentrated periods of treatment at Headley Court. This practice is in accordance with recognised clinical procedures; our experience suggests that patients can often recover better and faster in this way rather than through continuing accommodation in the rehabilitation unit.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 9 February 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 811-12W, on chemical weapons: animals, what quantities of each <i> (a)</i> chemical and <i> (b)</i> biological warfare agent are held in the UK; when such agents were manufactured; and what quantity of each agent is permitted to be held under the (i) Chemical Weapons Convention and (ii) Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention.

 The UK is a State Party to both the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). In accordance with these conventions, the UK maintains small quantities of chemical and biological warfare agents for research purposes, that are not prohibited under the conventions, to ensure that UK forces are adequately protected in the event that chemical or biological weapons are used against them.</p>

The MOD holds some Schedule 1 chemicals within the one tonne limit. The Schedule 1 chemicals held by MOD are between approximately 10 and 40 years old, although on occasion small quantities (typically a few grammes) of Schedule 1 chemicals that are not normally held have been manufactured. These holdings are inspected by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (the OPCW), the international body set up to implement the CWC, to ensure compliance with the convention.</p>

Given this rise in patient numbers, we have a range of contingency plans, which include greater use of the 15 non-ward bed spaces mentioned, for those patients whose clinical condition allows, and greater use of our regional rehabilitation units for the treatment of less seriously injured personnel who might otherwise be accommodated at Headley Court. In addition, as I announced to the House on 10 February 2010, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 926-36, we are now planning to create up to 30 more ward beds at Headley Court later this year.</p>

 The vast majority of health care for service personnel is provided by the Defence Medical Services or the NHS. However, there will be times when it is necessary to employ private medical contractors, such as when a particular specialism is not readily available, or when it would be impractical to provide the service overseas using internal resources. For example, aspects of health care for personnel posted overseas to Germany and other smaller bases and detachments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="100222w0005.htm_para3"><a name="1002227000713">In practice, such private sector health provision is funded by a number of individual budgets across the MOD, including at local unit level within the single services.

We have also removed the local connection criteria that treated service personnel unfairly when accessing social housing. For single personnel, SPACES (Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-Services) aims to assist single service leavers with securing accommodation. Our latest project "The Beacon" in Catterick complements Mike Jackson House in Aldershot and the Galleries in Richmond, which help us to reduce the potential of a single person leaving the armed forces becoming homeless.</p>

 We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Justice and the third sector to raise awareness of veterans in prison to the help and support available to them and to their families, while they serve their sentence and as they prepare for release. The Veterans In Custody Support Service, for example, is designed so that prison staff can quickly identify veterans in prison and refer them to the various support organisations available to assist them, including the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency. The agency's website, "Veterans: UK", provides additional links to further organisations, including regimental associations. Through this service, veterans are encouraged and assisted in seeking the necessary support to help address their needs.</p>

 There is no minimum length of time that must be served by military personnel to qualify for entitlement to some form of support services provided by the Ministry of Defence upon discharge. In order to reflect the differing needs of service personnel, the longer that is served the greater the amount of time that is allocated to enable resettlement activity. The level of support needed and given for those that have served for a relatively short period of time, and who therefore have more recent experience of life outside the armed forces, is less than someone who has spent their working life in service.

For example, in recent years figures do not include military equipment, military personnel pay, service children's education facilities, estate works and maintenance, IT and communication, maritime visits or air charter. Costs associated with these activities are met by other top level budget holders. The MOD's core budget is separated into eight top level budget holders (TLBs), each responsible for delivering individual military objectives. Within these TLBs the budget is not routinely allocated in terms of regions, but in terms of categories of expenditure. To provide the level of detailed breakdown of these categories in relation to the Falkland Islands would be of disproportionate cost.</p>

 The future SAR helicopter service in Scotland is expected to be provided from four locations (Stornoway, Sumburgh, RAF Lossiemouth and Glasgow airport, which is taking over from RNAS Prestwick). With the introduction of new, modern, more reliable helicopters there is likely to be a reduction in personnel at the two locations where they take over from the MOD Sea Kings (RAF Lossiemouth and RNAS Prestwick). The details will be finalised as the contract is agreed. As such, there is likely to be a negligible impact on the economy of Scotland as a whole from the contractorisation of the future service.</p>

 The information is not available in the format requested. Northern Ireland conviction data do not include victim information, such as age, in relation to the commission of an offence. It is possible, therefore, only to give the number of convictions for those sexual offences which by their definition refer to a child or children. The one exception to this is the offence 'unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 14 years'-which confirms that the victim was under 15.</p>

 The three public service broadcasting digital multiplexes, which carry around 15 channels including the public service broadcasting channels-BBC 1 and 2, ITV1, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales) and Five-should reach 98.5 per cent. of UK households after digital switchover. Services carried on the commercial multiplexes, which increase the number of channels available to around 40, are planned to reach 90 per cent. of UK households and any expansion of coverage is a commercial matter for the multiplex operators.

 The data requested are not available because the English Housing Survey, which is used to model fuel poverty, does not monitor individual households through time, rather it draws a representative sample each year. As such, it is not possible to identify individual households that have received assistance under these schemes, although the impact in aggregate of them will be captured in the fuel poverty statistics.</p>

These schemes will provide more of the most vulnerable consumers with help towards their energy costs. We have said that we are minded to focus the majority of the additional resources on older pensioner households on the lowest incomes as these households tend to have a high incidence of fuel poverty-over 50 per cent. of fuel poor households have a person over 60 living in them; their circumstances are relatively stable; and they are at the greatest risk of excess winter deaths.</p>

These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than Â£60 million was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-this year we will be spending around Â£2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In 2008-09, 15,490 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Feltham and Heston.</p>

Disabled people in Feltham and Heston will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in up to eight local authority areas from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

These payments provide vital reassurance to older people so that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather.

The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in up to eight local authority areas from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="100222w0022.htm_para17"><a name="1002233000517">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the financial assistance scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="100222w0022.htm_para18"><a name="1002233000518">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people aren't left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="100222w0022.htm_para20"><a name="1002233000520">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="100222w0022.htm_para21"><a name="1002233000521">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>

Disabled people in South Thanet will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in up to eight local authority areas from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

Drinking above the recommend lower-risk levels, of not regularly drinking more than three-four units per day for men and not regularly drinking more than two-three units per day for women, however, does increase the risk of both ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke compared to non-drinkers.</p>

As there is no AAF for stroke we cannot say how many of these admissions were due to alcohol, but we can provide the number of hospital admissions for alcohol-related haemorrhagic stroke and alcohol-related ischaemic stroke as a proxy. In 2008-09, there were 2,445 admissions for alcohol-related haemorrhagic stroke and 1,197 admissions for alcohol-related ischaemic stroke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="100222w0027.htm_para3"><a name="1002238000984">At the heart of the FACS guidance is the principle that councils should operate just one eligibility decision for all adults seeking social care support. FACS introduced four bands of eligibility based on people's needs-Critical, Substantial, Moderate and Low. Once eligibility for social care has been established using these four bands, the council may then means test the individual and apply the local charging regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="100222w0027.htm_para4"><a name="1002238000985">The Department has been working with stakeholders to revise the FACS guidance in the context of "Putting People First", in order to support councils to implement eligibility criteria for social care as fairly and consistently as possible. The Department carried out a consultation on the revised FACS guidance simultaneously with the publication of the Fairer Contributions guidance, in July 2009. The FACS guidance is integral to the assessment of a person's need for social care, while the Fairer Contributions Guidance is employed, where appropriate, once that assessment has been made. The revised FACS guidance will be published shortly.</p>

An additional Â£130 million will provide 130,000 people with an active programme of reablement to ensure they regain their independence. This will build on the most innovative practices already adopted by many local authorities and primary care trusts. We have already begun engaging with local authority stakeholders to discuss the workings of the scheme, and councils are invited to respond to the consultation document, "Personal Care at Home: a consultation on proposals for regulations and guidance".

The legal basis is that charges generally should be 'reasonable', as set out in the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications (HASSASSA) Act 1983. Should councils decide to charge for these services, this must be in accordance with statutory guidance issued by the Department, "Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other non-residential Social Services".</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. PCT figures have been mapped to their current organisational structure.<br>
2. Data quality: workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data.

1. Hospital Provider: hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). As the data is tabulated by healthcare provider, the figure for a national health service trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using this data as the counts may be lower than true figures.<br>
2. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

When competitive tender does occur, it will be transparent and fair with all providers having an equal opportunity to bid, potentially in new partnerships and joint ventures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="100222w0029.htm_para4"><a name="1002238001503">The aim is to ensure that NHS staff are treated fairly and engaged in decisions, so that they know what is happening and when, and what changes are being sought and why. Service improvement and re-design should not be something which is imposed on NHS staff but something which they own and lead. Clinical engagement and leadership will be crucial to driving the transformation of services patients and taxpayers need.</p>

This includes working with health care professionals to ensure urgent admission to an acute stroke unit, timely access to scanning and the provision of thrombolysis where appropriate.

1. FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
2. The main procedure is first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. In some cases a patient may undertake more than one procedure as part of the same episode. The data does not include the number of secondary procedures undertaken at the same time as the main procedures.<br>
3. SHA of treatment indicates the strategic health authority where the treatment took place.<br>
4. Where Wales is shown as the SHA of treatment, the figure relates to patients who were treated by an English independent provider who also have sites in Wales, where these treatments took place.<br>

Drawing on these and other resources, the Mayor is responsible for publishing, and through TfL, implementing a Transport Strategy for London, while the boroughs are required to publish Local Implementation Plans which set out how they will contribute to the Mayor's strategy.</p>

 Changes to the Government Car Service which came into effect on 12 October 2009, will reduce the cost to the taxpayer. Under the new system, drivers work a single daily shift. Ministers continue to have one dedicated driver (apart from those in the high security category), but any out-of-hours ministerial driving is met, on demand, by the Government Car and Despatch Agency's low carbon taxi service. This is a better deal for tax payers than the previous arrangements.</p>

 The UK position on planned elections in Burma is well known. Unless Aung San Suu Kyi, and all other political prisoners are released, and the regime initiates an inclusive dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups, the elections will have no credibility or international legitimacy. As the elections approach, the UK will work to maintain tough EU sanctions targeted at the regime's economic interests, and press Burma's neighbours, including China, India and ASEAN countries to use their influence to secure real progress. We will also work in the UN's human rights bodies to highlight the ongoing and systematic human rights abuses in the country.</p>

Our assessment remains that an attempt to establish a Commission of Inquiry would not receive the requisite support from a significant number of countries and in particular veto holding members of the Security Council. We are concerned that if we tried and failed to secure agreement this would be interpreted by the Burmese regime as a diplomatic victory and approval of its conduct. The Government will nonetheless continue to do all they can to highlight the appalling and systematic abuse of human rights in Burma, and work to secure as robust an international response as possible.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is committed to recruiting a talented and diverse work force, ensuring that the most qualified candidates from the widest range of backgrounds apply. The FCO sometimes uses external recruitment agencies to manage recruitment campaigns for new entrants, and where specialist knowledge of a specific job market is required; for instance Overseas Security Managers and procurement specialists. Outsourced recruitment is more cost-effective than running all recruitment campaigns through a larger in-house recruitment team and is a model used extensively across central Government.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many plasma screen televisions his Department has purchased since 2001; and what the cost has been of purchasing and installing such screens in each such year. [306079]</p>

 Flat screen televisions may be plasma or LCD. It is not possible to determine which type of flat screen has been purchased in all cases, except at the disproportionate cost of physically examining all of the TVs or retrieving all invoices which are filed locally around the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_767"><a name="100222w0054.htm_para0"><a name="10022314000179">Similarly it is not possible to identify the purpose of these purchases in all cases, except at disproportionate cost. However, no flat screen TVs have been purchased for prisoners' cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_769"><a name="100222w0054.htm_para2"><a name="10022314000181">Since October 2008, the Ministry of Justice has had one main supplier for the provision of flat screen televisions. From the start of this contract up to November 2009, Â£139,676 was spent on flat screen televisions. This figure excludes the costs of installation which is undertaken by local estates teams across the Ministry. Installation costs cannot be separately quantified but represent a tiny element of the work of estates teams. Procurement records indicate that flat screen television expenditure included 10 plasma screen televisions at a cost of Â£6,180.</p>

To investigate whether any flat screen televisions, DVD players or stereo equipment had been purchased with the GPC card would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

However, between March 2006 and March 2008, 397 flat screen television screens were purchased at a total cost of Â£516,478 by HM Courts Service, mainly in connection with the Videolinks Project, which allows vulnerable witnesses to take part in trials without actually being present. Videolinks also connects to a number of prisons, which saves money by allowing certain meetings and proceedings to occur which would otherwise require prisoner transport and accommodation.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has a comprehensive drug strategy for prisons. It has three key elements that interlink to reduce drug related offending and address individual need:</p>
<a name="100222w0056.htm_brev12"><a name="10022314000697"><ul><p class="tabletext">reducing supply, through security measures and drug testing programmes;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_816"><a name="100222w0056.htm_para14"><a name="10022314000570">The overall success of the strategy is evidenced by the reduction in drug misuse in prisons, as measured by random mandatory drug testing. Since 1996-97 the proportion of prisoners testing positive has declined by 68 per cent. In 2008-09 prisons undertook 5.4 per cent. more random mandatory drug tests than in 1996-97. The reduced availability of drugs in prisons provides a firm foundation on which to deliver drug treatment.</p>

The interventions available are designed to meet the needs of low, moderate and severe drug misusers-irrespective of age, gender or ethnicity. Since 1996-97 funding for prison drug treatment has increased year on year, and is now over 15 times that of 1997 (total 2009-10 allocation is around Â£112 million).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_818"><a name="100222w0056.htm_para16"><a name="10022314000572">On 31 January 2008 the Justice Secretary's paper, "Prison Policy Update", set out the steps being taken to tackle drug misuse in prison. Following this the Justice Secretary and the NOMS Director General commissioned two reviews-David Blakey's review "Disrupting the supply of illicit drugs into prisons" and the Prison Drug Treatment Strategy Review Group led by Lord Patel. The focus of the two reviews was complementary, covering respectively security and treatment issues. Together they addressed the range of issues associated with illegal drugs in prison.</p>

 Due to rounding in the conversion of payroll data into hourly wage rates in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) it is likely that a sizeable number of employees earning the NMW are reported in the survey to have a wage rate just above or below this level. This may mean that the estimated number of employees earning exactly at the NMW rate differs from the actual number. In addition, small sample sizes in ASHE for 16 to 17 and 18 to 21-year-olds means the number of job-holders earning a specific wage rate cannot be inferred with sufficient certainty. For these reasons BIS has provided estimates for the number of employees earning a wage at or below the NMW in the UK rather than those paid exactly at the NMW.</p>

A shortened and updated form was published on 12 November 2009 with the Government response which was placed in the Library of the House. This contains a weblink to the full Europe Economics impact assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_931"><a name="100222w0064.htm_para8"><a name="10022371000852">The exact impact will be determined by the outcome of consultations between Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) and organisations concerned on licence fee levels. However, PPL has agreed to voluntarily exempt music as part of divine worship and domestic/family occasions such as weddings. As part of this process it is essential that PPL work with the third sector to agree reasonable and appropriate tariffs. We value the contribution musical performers make to the economic and cultural success of our country. We have got to make sure that they are rewarded for their efforts so they can continue creating. The Government want to ensure that discussions between PPL and the third sector are facilitated so that the outcome is satisfactory for all concerned. A mutually agreed solution is vital if the needs of both PPL members and the third sector are to be met. I remain confident that this will be possible.</p>

 The Government do not collect details of individual children who have gone missing from local authority care and we do not plan to collect this information centrally in future.

 My ministerial colleague, the Baroness Morgan of Drefelin, met officials from the London borough of Hillingdon in March last year to discuss work they are undertaking on child trafficking at Heathrow airport in partnership with officers from the Paladin Team. It is for each local authority to provide services to meet the needs of their local population, including the needs of children who may have been trafficked. To support local authorities the Government published multi-agency guidance targeted specifically at safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children who may have been trafficked in December 2007. This contains a comprehensive strategy to improve the identification and safeguarding of child victims of trafficking. Furthermore, in 2009 DCSF also published revised guidance on sexual exploitation and children missing from care and young runways guidance, which include details of how services must work to protect children from trafficking.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 January 2010]:</i> There is no requirement for schools to provide this information, though the following data are available from information which local authorities voluntarily report to the National Music Participation Director in connection with their Local Authority Music Plans. Local authorities had predicted that 22 per cent. of their Key Stage 2 pupils would participate in their Wider Opportunities programmes in 2008-09, and have since reported that the actual figure was 24 per cent. that is 509,628 pupils. For 2009/10 the predicted figure is 31 per cent. The actual numbers will be reported to the National Music Participation Director by November 2010 and the percentage then calculated using the figure for total Key Stage 2 pupil numbers.</p>

 In the eight years to 2011, the Government would have invested Â£2.4 billion in the national PE and sport strategy which aims to improve the quality and quantity of physical education (PE) and school sport up and down the country. At the heart of our strategy is the establishment of a national infrastructure of School Sport Partnerships, which now includes every maintained school in the country. However, the boundaries and membership of School Sport Partnerships in Preston has changed over time, as the network was rolled out across the country.

We do know that wider research has indicated a positive return to earnings for those undertaking vocational learning while our own Youth Cohort study suggests that around 22 per cent. of learners with existing vocational qualifications are in higher education by the age of 19. Vocational and applied qualifications offer valuable choice to young people and 14-19 Diplomas in particular will enable young people to achieve their ambitions because employers and higher education designed them.</p>

 The most reliable measure of the prevalence of use of drugs is the British Crime Survey (BCS). In 2008/09, the latest full year for which data are available, the proportion of respondents aged 16 to 59 reporting the use of cocaine on at least one occasion in the last year was 3.0 per cent.

 These data are not collected centrally. Handguns are prohibited under firearms law and can only be held with the authority of the Secretary of State. Such authority is generally limited to businesses such as arms manufacturers, and is not normally given to individuals.

 The Policing Pledge, which was introduced across all police forces in England and Wales at the end of 2008, sets out the minimum standards of service that the public can expect to receive from the police including for response times. Through the pledge, the police have committed to aim to answer 999 calls within 10 seconds, deploying to emergencies immediately, giving an estimated time of arrival and reaching the incident as safely and as quickly as possible. In urban areas, they aim to arrive within 15 minutes and in rural areas within 20 minutes.</p>

They show that the number of full-time equivalent police officers in Hounslow rose from 467 on 31 March 2003 to 518 on 31 March 2009, the latest published period. These figures include officers on career break or maternity/paternity leave.

 The value of the introduction of an additional day's public holiday in the Home Office can be costed at an estimated notional value of Â£2.2 million, but it would not in fact incur an additional cost to the pay bill, as staff would merely be paid for a day on which they were not working rather than one on which they were. Similarly, although there are services offered by the Home Office which generate income, income would not be lost, as those services are not available from an alternative source and so would be obtained and paid for on another day. Therefore, although a notional cost can be attributed to the introduction of an additional day's public holiday, there would be no actual cost.</p>

 The British Crime Survey 2008-09 shows that vehicle crime has reduced by 57 per cent. since 1997. This success was achieved by Government and police working with partners in the public and private sectors to reduce crime, and to make cars harder to steal. It is now almost impossible to steal a car without using the keys. Some criminals now target the car keys, and the most prevalent method for doing so is by burgling homes to steal car keys, known as car key burglary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1130"><a name="100222w0083.htm_para4"><a name="100223106003528">We have invested Â£15 million this year in preventing and tackling burglary, including physically securing homes with effective locks and providing the right advice to those most at risk of burglary. Our current publicity campaign "Don't Advertise Your Stuff To Thieves" specifically addresses this crime through its television advert. Renewed advice on preventing burglary, including car key burglary, is also available on the Home Office website. We are currently working with the police and the Home Office Design and Technology Alliance to develop further responses to the issue of car key burglary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1131"><a name="100222w0083.htm_para5"><a name="100223106003529">We have updated our advice to people on how to protect their homes and cars. The Home Office website provides advice to householders on protecting themselves from burglary, including advice on keeping car keys out of sight of doors and windows, closing and locking doors and windows, and advising on appropriate security standards to take account of when replacing windows or doors. It includes "Steer Clear of Car Crime", an updated publication which provides advice for people on protecting their car and its contents from theft, including specific advice on keeping car keys safe from thieves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1132"><a name="100222w0083.htm_para6"><a name="100223106003530">The Home Office also funds the ACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS). Its aims include reducing thefts of vehicles and increasing recovery of stolen vehicles. It works closely with partners across police forces, the wider public sector and the private sector to tackle vehicle crime in all its forms, including car key burglary. AVCIS has participated in a number of successful joint police operations targeted at reducing vehicle crime, including car key burglary.</p>

 The Department has in place a number of measures designed to ensure the consistency of asylum decisions. All applications are considered against centrally produced guidance and new caseowners receive uniform national training before they begin to deal with cases. Audit and quality control processes are in place and issues arising from the audits are promulgated nationally every month. Consistency is promoted through regular meetings of both regional asylum managers and senior asylum caseworkers who use a variety of networks to help ensure that best practice is shared and promoted nationwide.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what reports he has received on <i> (a)</i> an ongoing hunger strike by women at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre and <i> (b)</i> the reasons given by those women for taking that action; and if he will make a statement. [317379]</p>

 The director of detention services and his staff have kept me fully informed about the passive protest by women at Yarl's Wood and continue to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1140"><a name="100222w0085.htm_para0"><a name="100223106003856">The protest has included a number of women refusing to eat meals provided in the canteen, although a number of them continue to purchase food made available in the shop and vending machines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1141"><a name="100222w0085.htm_para1"><a name="100223106003857">The well-being of the women is being monitored closed by health care officials in the centre and none are showing any signs of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1142"><a name="100222w0085.htm_para2"><a name="100223106003858">While each resident will have their own personal reasons for joining the protest, they are in general objecting to their detention. The UK Border Agency aims to keep detention to a minimum in order to enforce the removal of those with no basis of stay in the UK or whose deportation is required to protect the public from the harm they pose. It is a fact that detainees themselves often prolong their own detention by making late spurious appeals and failing to comply with the documentation and removal process.</p>
