<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much of the budget from his Department for the home energy efficiency scheme in 2000-01 has been allocated; and what difficulties have been encountered by managers of the scheme in meeting the target number of homes due to be assisted.  [156558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 For the 2000-01 financial year the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) in England had a total budget of &#163;121.8 million. This was for the final months of the old scheme and for the new HEES scheme, which started on 1 June 2000. The total amount allocated for the year was &#163;113.1 million. Of this, &#163;77 million was paid on the receipt of satisfactory invoices. The balance of &#163;36.1 million represents work orders yet to be completed or for which invoices have not yet been submitted.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para0">The new public spending framework introduced in the Comprehensive Spending Review gives the Department freedom to carry forward unspent grant provision from one year to the next, within a three-year budget cycle.




<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2001 : Column: 100W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para1">The main difficulty encountered by HEES is recruiting sufficient contractors to install and repair gas central heating systems. This is caused by the national shortage of qualified heating engineers. To address the problem, scheme managers are seeking additional qualified heating installers, and encouraging existing installers to increase the number of installation teams dedicated to HEES. These efforts have substantially increased the number of installations and cut the time taken to install measures to less than three months in most areas of England.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para2">In conjunction with Transco plc and the Gas Industry National Training Organisation, my Department introduced training programmes to provide an additional 800 gas engineers over the next 12 months to work under HEES. These will enable the scheme to cope better with short-term fluctuations.

<a name="10403w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Departmental Policies (High Peak)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Levitt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effects on the High Peak constituency of his Department's policies and actions since May 1997.  [156781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The principal funding that this Department has provided to High Peak borough council and Derbyshire county council between 1997-98 and 2001-02 is shown in the table. This includes grants and borrowing approvals for revenue and capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para3">It is not possible to determine how much of this money Derbyshire county council has spent on High Peak constituency. It is for the local authority to decide where within its boundary these resources are applied.

 The contents of the Housing Corporation's new regulatory code are a matter for the Housing Corporation. The Corporation issued a draft regulatory code on 12 January 2001 for consultation and has received a number of representations in respect of the contents of the code.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 27 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 568W, what plans he has for the Housing Corporation's draft revised Statutory Housing Management Guidance to contain strengthened guidance on the obligations on registered social landlords to provide accommodation for households with priority under local authority allocation schemes.  [156850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under S36 of the Housing Act 1996, guidance to registered social landlords is issued by the Housing Corporation. The Corporation plans to issue for consultation a draft of its revised Statutory Housing Management Guidance in May. The Secretary of State will not approve guidance under S36(4) unless he is satisfied with its requirements in relation to the provision of accommodation for households with priority under local authority allocation schemes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The proposals to extend the East London Line to West Croydon and Wimbledon form part of the Transport and Works Act 1992 application submitted last year by London Underground Ltd. The Secretary of State is considering the Inspector's report.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para4">The Strategic Rail Authority are looking into the possibility of a third extension to Clapham Junction as part of their Orbirail study.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority are actively working on developing the Orbirail concept as a major part of their aspirations to enhance rail services in London. The Government support these aspirations, but no commitments can be made at this stage while the proposals are still under consideration.

To ask the Solicitor-General if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the Hazel Grove constituency, the effects on Hazel Grove of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [156185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In November 1999, in line with national policy the Stockport/Sale branch of the Crown Prosecution Service introduced procedures based upon the Narey proposals. It did this in liaison with the Greater Manchester police and the Stockport magistrates court.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para5">All adult defendants charged with a criminal offence now make the first appearance before Stockport magistrates court within 96 hours. The present figures suggest that between 40 per cent. and 45 per cent. of all defendants have their case finalised more quickly than previously was the case.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para6">In January 2001, in line with national policy and new legislation, the CPS and the magistrates court started sending the most serious (indictable) cases to the Crown court within one week of the first appearance in the magistrates court. Henceforth, Crown court judges will monitor the progress of these cases and it is anticipated that they should also be finalised more quickly than previously.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para7">So far as youth offenders are concerned, the CPS--together with the police, the magistrates courts and the local youth offending team--have agreed procedures designed to bring persistent youth offenders before the court much more quickly. They are working towards the Government's 71-day target for disposing of such cases. Protocols have also been designed to bring all youth offenders before the Crown court much more quickly.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para8">All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10403w01.html_para9">Since May 1997, the Stockport team of the Stockport/ Sale branch has successfully prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including several murders, attempted murders and drug-related offences. On Friday 23 March 2001, a 16-year-old youth was found guilty of attempted murder and aggravated burglary on 87-year-old, Miss Edith Champman, of Hazel Grove. The defendant has been remanded in secure accommodation for reports to be prepared before he is sentenced. In October 2000, Ian Morrison was found guilty of the attempted murder of his ex-wife and two police officers and attempted wounding with intent of a third police officer. He was sentenced to a total of 16 years' imprisonment.

<P>

<a name="10403w02.html_para1">The Regulations are designed to benefit recruitment agencies, their clients and those employed through them. They will remove unnecessary restrictions on agencies' operations and the services they can offer, while protecting the interests of work-seekers and vulnerable groups such as the young and those receiving care. They recognise the important role that this sector plays in a flexible labour market and in helping many people back into work. They support the Government's policies on skills and employment, for example by requiring appropriate training and experience to be given, creating incentives to increase the skills of the workforce, and preventing unjustified restrictions on temporary to permanent transfer. A draft Regulatory Impact Assessment has been placed on my Department's website, and a final version will be published when the draft Regulations are laid before Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if charities and political think-tanks are considered political organisations for the purposes of Part IX of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.  [157023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Part XA of the Companies Act 1985 as inserted into that Act by Part IX of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 implements the recommendation by the Committee on Standards in Public Life that companies intending to make a donation to a political party or organisation should be required to have the prior authority of their shareholders. An organisation is to be considered "political" for the purposes of Part XA of the Companies Act if it carries on, or proposes to carry on, activities which are capable of being reasonably regarded as intended to affect public support for a political party or to influence voters in a referendum.
<P>

<a name="10403w02.html_para2">The Government considered the definition carefully, and continue to believe that a test based on an organisation's intent to affect support for a political party or to influence the outcome of a referendum is both appropriate and proportionate. At the same time, the Government are concerned that the definition should not be interpreted so widely as to affect the funding of organisations which could not reasonably be regarded to show such intent. The Government do not believe, for example, that charities which campaign on issues of general public interest or political think-tanks whose publications and events are aimed at informing public opinion generally are likely to be caught by the definition if their activities would not appear, on any reasonable assessment, to be aimed at promoting a political party or to form an active part of a referendum campaign.

 This Government are about ensuring that all regions of the country are given the opportunity to reach their full potential. It is the task of Government to ensure that the right framework is in place for regional economies to flourish.
<P>

<a name="10403w03.html_para0">This is why we established Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)--to improve the economic performance of the English Regions. In the short period of their existence, the RDAs have emerged as the strategic drivers of economic development in the English regions--mirroring the success of their counterparts in Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<a name="10403w03.html_para1">The RDAs have already made a considerable impact. They brought local partners on board to produce Regional Strategies. They have provided a focal point for regional economic development, and they have already established a track record in creating and saving jobs. RDAs have also had a key role in defining the skills needs in their regions in the context of their Regional Strategies.
<P>

<a name="10403w03.html_para2">Our confidence in RDAs is shown in their increased budgets for the new financial year 2001-02. The &#163;1.7 billion they will have by 2003-04 is almost double the amount they inherited in 1999.
<P>

<a name="10403w03.html_para3">Shrewsbury and Atcham companies have already received funding from Advantage West Midlands (Advantage). Companies within the Shrewsbury area have been directly assisted with Rover funding totalling &#163;130,000. I hope that Shrewsbury and Atcham will benefit from the development of the Wolverhampton-Telford high technology corridor, which Advantage is exploring. The Rural Regeneration Zone to the south of the district will, I feel sure, provide much needed support to businesses and communities in the vicinity, improving the local economy and indirectly helping businesses in the Shrewsbury area.
<P>

 I am disappointed to learn of the planned closure of BSK Ltd. with the loss of over 200 jobs. I have considerable sympathy with the individuals and local community affected by this decision. I understand that the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Development Agency are making every effort to mitigate the losses and are exploring options to retain a foundry operation in the area. Similarly the Government are seeking to minimise job losses at Corus. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has urged Corus to reconsider its decision to make 6,050 job cuts and has pressed the company to engage in constructive dialogue to identify a better way forward. I am pleased that a dialogue involving Corus, the Trade Unions and Government are now underway and hope this will alleviate the impact of the large scale redundancies proposed.

Detailed tenders were submitted at the end of the February by the two consortia seeking to provide the new accommodation. These tenders are now being evaluated with a view to selecting a preferred bidder and further negotiations leading to contract signature by July 2001.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our existing accommodation in Bracknell is not suitable for a modern, IT based organisation. It places weather forecasting services at unacceptable risk and is increasingly costly to maintain. A new site with purpose built accommodation is the best way of meeting our long-term needs and those of our customers. Defence Ministers scrutinised the choice of site closely and are satisfied that both the financial and non-financial arguments are substantially in favour of Exeter and that this is the best location for the Met Office to build a secure and successful future. Since the choice was made, the arguments in favour of Exeter have, if anything, increased and there are therefore no plans to review the decision.</FONT></UL>

<a name="10403w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK's Pre-feasibility Study undertaken in 1994-96 reviewed all Government sponsored anti-ballistic missile systems either under development or expected to evolve into development programmes. The guidance from this study contributed to the decision, as part of the Strategic Defence Review, to embark on the Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme, which has continued to monitor developments both in the threat and in the technologies available to counter it.

<a name="10403w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK is firmly committed to the implementation of the Defence Capabilities Initiative, which was launched at the last NATO summit in Washington DC in April 1999. Since 1998, we have contributed to NATO analysis of how best to defend deployed NATO forces against ballistic missiles, including preparatory work for feasibility studies on Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence. We expect these studies to start later this year. Nationally, we continue to assess the potential role of ballistic missile defence systems in countering missile attacks. We monitor developments closely, but it remains our position that it would be premature to decide to acquire a ballistic missile defence for either UK territory or forces deployed overseas.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 2001]:</i> We are committed to encouraging more students to continue in school, further education or training, and to raising attainment levels. Therefore we are developing a suite of measures to offer young people incentives and support while they stay in learning.
<P>

<a name="10403w05.html_para0">Discretionary student support for further education and sixth form students will increase to &#163;115 million in 2001-02, a rise of 16 per cent. on the 2000-01 allocation. This includes &#163;62 million for further education access funds, up from &#163;54 million in 2000-01, and over &#163;10 million for access funds for sixth form students. The access funds are used to help pay for transport, books, equipment, and other expenditure associated with remaining in education, such as residential charges and childcare costs.
<P>

<a name="10403w05.html_para1">We will continue to make Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) available in 56 of the most deprived LEA areas, covering approximately 30 per cent. of England by population. EMAs are a weekly allowance paid to the student or in some cases to the student's family, in return for the student's continuing attendance of an education programme. They aim to encourage young people to remain in full-time education and complete their courses successfully. Payments are means tested on the basis of parental income. Evaluation of the first year of the EMA scheme showed that EMAs lead to a significant increase in the numbers of 16 year olds deciding to remain in full-time education. The Government are considering the case for introducing a national EMA scheme.
<P>

<a name="10403w05.html_para2">We are also introducing the Connexions Card, which will be available to all young people aged 16-19. It will provide a range of incentives to stay in learning, ranging from help with transport costs to discounts on the sorts of goods and activities which young people value. The benefits attached to the Card will be earned through regular attendance and effort.

 Local education authorities' targets for raising pupil attainment are the key elements of an education development plan. These targets are necessarily related to schools' academic years. Information about an authority's planned expenditure in support of their EDP is already included in the plan on a financial year basis. New regulations and guidance will be required for the next generation of EDPs from 2002, which are under consideration.

 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> Inspection evidence is an important factor in the award of Beacon status and in the process of validating a school's continuing operation as a Beacon, but it is not the sole determining criterion. Consistently high performance in relation to school circumstances and the capacity, experience and willingness to build partnerships with other schools are also key factors that are taken into account. We have no record of how many inspections a school may have received prior to being awarded Beacon status. However, 111 Beacon schools have received an Ofsted inspection since becoming a Beacon:

This means that there has been a 10 percentage point rise since 1998. In mathematics, the percentage of children achieving level 4 has risen by 3 per cent. from 69 to 72 per cent.

Account holders can use their ILAs for full or part-time courses as long as the learning is eligible for the ILA incentives. The vast majority of education and training is provided free to people aged under 19. Currently some people aged 18 have to pay for certain types of learning themselves. My Department has addressed this issue and from September of this year no 16 to 18-year-olds undertaking part-time learning will be charged tuition fees.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he will undertake studies of the causes of floods since October 2000 in Colnbrook, Slough.  [156238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Responsibility for such studies rests with local flood defence operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency and local councils, and other bodies, such as water companies. I understand from the Environment Agency that the flooding experienced at Colnbrook was due to a combination of factors, with prolonged and exceptional rainfall exceeding the capacity of local watercourses and surface water drains, and giving rise to high groundwater levels. For its part, the Agency is investigating the feasibility of flood alleviation measures for County Ditch.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The situation in Mozambique is stabilising and is showing some signs of improvement but remains serious. The continued effective management of the dam discharge rates has helped to alleviate the effects of the seasonal rains on the lower Zambezi. The wet season is now drawing to a close reducing the threat of further flooding.
<P>

<a name="10403w09.html_para0">Government of Mozambique reports continue to describe some 494,500 people in the Zambezi Valley as being affected by the current flooding. The Government of Mozambique estimate that some 204,130 are now accommodated in 77 temporary accommodation centres in the four flood affected provinces of Sofala, Tete, Manica, and Zambezia. As floodwater in the eastern part 



<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2001 : Column: 129W</I><P>
of Zambezia Province recedes, some of the displaced population are leaving the temporary accommodation centres and returning to their homes.
<P>

<a name="10403w09.html_para1">Following the immediate relief operation in response to last year's catastrophic floods in Mozambique, my Department has remained engaged in rehabilitation as well as in developing new measures, via the United Nations system, to strengthen both UN and Government of Mozambique contingency arrangements for future disasters. Over the past few months DFID, FCO, MOD, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the UK Fire Service have been working together to prepare contingency plans for different emergency scenarios. In addition we have continued to work closely with the Government of Mozambique's National Directorate of Water to set up early warning flood systems with the UK Met Office.
<P>

<a name="10403w09.html_para2">Following the onset of the current floods, we switched gear to immediate response operations deliberately aimed at 'preventative' rescue and relief, i.e. extricating people before the worst hits them and there is substantial loss of life and suffering. In addition to contributing &#163;250,000 to the Red Cross and &#163;160,000 to Food for the Hungary's appeal for Mozambique, we funded two Puma helicopters to move people from the riskiest areas and transport urgent relief supplies; provided three logisticians to the World Food Programme to assist in its operational response; and provided a humanitarian specialist in Beira to reinforce DFID presence on the ground and conduct field assessments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what requests he has received to provide information to the independent commission of inquiry established by the Irish Government into the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings; and what has been his response. [155971]  [155972] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I have received a request from Mr. Justice Henry Barron, the Independent Commissioner of Inquiry into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings, for all relevant information held by the UK Government relating to these incidents. This request has been shared with all relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including the Ministry of Defence, who are currently 



<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2001 : Column: 131W</I><P>
researching archived records to establish what information they hold. I have assured Judge Barron that I will respond substantively as soon as I am in a position to do so.
<P>

<a name="10403w09.html_para7">I am replying on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence of whom this question has also been asked but who has not received a separate request from the Independent Commission of Inquiry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what representations he has received concerning the holding of an inquiry into a controversial death at the same time as <i>(a)</i> the continuation of a police investigation, <i>(b)</i> the continuation of an inquiry by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman and <i>(c)</i> the continuation of a coroner's inquiry; and if he will place a copy of this advice in the Library.  [156538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I have received a range of representations concerning the holding of inquiries in such a case. I am not legally precluded from establishing a public inquiry in advance of the conclusion of any criminal investigation. However, I believe that to do so would carry the significant risk of prejudicing the outcome of any investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the EU Commissioner's meetings with Chairman Arafat with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> violence and <i>(b)</i> corruption.  [155758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The EU Troika of Anna Lindh, the Swedish Foreign Minister, Commissioner Patten and Miguel Moratinos (the EU's Special Envoy to the MEPP) visited Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt on 12 and 13 March. They met with Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres, President Arafat, Egyptian President Mabarak and Egyptian Foreign Minister Moussa. The visit went well. The Troika delivered strong messages to the Israelis and the Palestinians, including on the need to end the violence. The Troika urged the Israelis to end the economic siege of the Palestinians and resume the transfer of customs revenues due to the Palestinian Authority.
<P>

<a name="10403w09.html_para8">The Palestinians have, since the visit, written to Commissioner Patten accepting the EU requests that they work up an austerity budget and improve the transparency and accountability of their financial management.

<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Vis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent representations he has made to Chairman Arafat about the actions which he has taken against the Tanzim.  [156067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10403w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government expect both the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel to insist on restraint and disciplined behaviour by their military and security personnel, and to restrain extremism. We are in regular contact with both parties, and urge them to take immediate parallel steps to address the current crisis.

 On 23 February, EU Partners and the US issued a demarche to the Turkmen Foreign Minister regarding Shageldy Atakov's detention. We used this opportunity to remind the Turkmen Government of their international human rights commitments, which include those under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. We will continue to remind the Turkmen Government of their legal obligations in future representations regarding Mr. Atakov.

If there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression, external aggression or diverted to an undesirable end-user the licence is refused.

<a name="10403w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 March 2001]:</i> I am advised that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) distributed a draft report on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and food safety in slaughterhouses to various stakeholder organisations and individuals attending a workshop arranged by the FSA in November last year. The draft report covered a wide range of issues relating to the European Commission's (EC) desire to introduce a new approach to the management of food safety in red and white meat slaughterhouses. The issues covered in the report included a suggested approach to the implementation of a HACCP based system in slaughterhouses; the need to reflect the fact that current meat inspection procedures do not adequately control microbiological hazards in meat, the responsibilities of operators; official inspection, supervision and enforcement and the need for the control regime to adapt to the new requirements. Comments on the draft report were received from the UNISON representative at the workshop and these have been noted.
<P>

<a name="10403w11.html_para3">The EC has subsequently published a working document (entitled "The Development of Risk-Based Meat Inspection System") which is intended to form the basis of a EC proposal for new legislation on meat inspection.

<P>
<a name="10403w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer sent 28 March 2001]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the European Commission (EC) has not issued any proposals to replace independent Government meat inspection with industry inspection. Although it has issued a draft regulation on official controls for products of animal origin, as part of a package of proposals to amend and consolidate all existing European Union food hygiene legislation, this largely repeats the current inspection and supervision provisions in meat plants. This draft regulation has yet to be discussed in the European Council working groups in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="10403w11.html_para4">However, in recognition of the fact that current meat inspection procedures do not adequately control microbiological hazards in meat, the EC has prepared a working document entitled "The Development of a Risk-based Meat Inspection System", which the FSA circulated to stakeholders in January. This document, which is the product of discussions held by the EC with independent experts and officials from member states, including officials from the FSA, is intended to form the basis for a EC proposal for new legislation on meat inspection. It follows the general principle that food operators have the primary responsibility for food safety and must guarantee that food safety hazards are under control through the successful application of a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) -based system.
<P>

<a name="10403w11.html_para5">The working document proposes that the competent authority should remain present in slaughterhouses for reasons of animal health, animal welfare, public health and consumer confidence. However, it suggests certain elements of ante- and post-mortem inspection could be integrated into the HACCP system. The EC aims to publish the proposal by September 2001 in the form of a draft regulation. This is in line with its policy to achieve uniform implementation across all EU countries. The views of member states will be established during the course of subsequent negotiations at official level.
<P>

<a name="10403w11.html_para6">The FSA, which provides independent advice to the Government and consumers on food safety matters, will represent the United Kingdom at those negotiations. The FSA will consult widely once the EC's proposals have been published, including taking advice from Agriculture Departments who are responsible for animal health and welfare controls in slaughterhouses. The FSA believes there may be food safety benefits from integrating some aspects of meat inspection into HACCP plans, but would not countenance changes to the present system which did not fully protect consumers, or which effectively allowed the meat industry to police itself.

 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> Between 1 November 1999 and 28 February 2001, the Medicines Control Agency received a total of 12,880 Yellow Card reports of 26,682 suspected adverse drug reactions to the Meningitis C vaccines. The most commonly reported suspected reactions were soreness and/or redness at the injection site, headache, dizziness, nausea and rash. These reactions are documented in the product information for the three Meningitis C vaccines. By the end of the immunisation campaign, the majority of suspected adverse drug reactions received were non-serious. During this time, 18.5 million doses of vaccine were supplied as part of a national immunisation campaign to vaccinate all children under the age of 18 years. This corresponds to a reporting rate of 1 in 1,436 doses distributed. Yellow Card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions do not necessarily mean that the drug caused the reaction.

 Since April 2000, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's (IND) staff has increased by 3,079 full-time equivalents to 9,096 at the end of March 2001. We have taken on leases for space in 15 extra office buildings to accommodate these staff, who are delivering improved service on immigration and nationality casework, asylum support and immigration control. Over the coming financial year we expect staffing to increase to about 10,000 full-time equivalents and will take on space in another 12 office buildings. There will also be a phased return to the newly refurbished Lunar House in Croydon. Changes in organisational structures are made as required to support delivery of services: most significant in the last year has been to combine the Integrated Casework Directorate, Immigration Service and National Asylum Support Service into the Operations Directorate.

<a name="10403w14.html_para0">The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 2000-01, is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. "Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000" and "Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000" can be found in the Library.

<a name="10403w14.html_para6">Luton borough council were awarded approximately &#163;249,000 for two schemes submitted under round 1 of the CCTV initiative. Bury park/Dunstable road was awarded &#163;180,000, providing cameras for one of the town's main roads. The area consists of shops, secondary housing, a community centre, a church and mosque and the Luton Town football stadium. The bid aims to reduce overall crime in the area by 50 per cent. over three years, particularly targeting violence against the person, vehicle crime and theft.

<a name="10403w14.html_para7">Luton station car park was awarded &#163;68,000 for an eight-camera scheme to extend coverage of the car park, which currently has three cameras. The scheme aims to reduce overall vehicle crime, assaults and criminal damage by 50 per cent. over three years.

<a name="10403w14.html_para8"><i>Youth Offending</i>
<P>

<a name="10403w14.html_para9">Luton, South is covered by Luton Youth Offending Team (YOT). Luton YOT is a multi-agency team consisting of staff from Luton borough council working in partnership with Bedfordshire health authority, Bedfordshire police authority and Bedfordshire Probation Service. The YOT is closely involved with the Youth Court Action Group which also includes representatives from the police, courts, Crown Prosecution Service across Luton and Bedfordshire. The group has been established in order to deliver the Government's pledge to halve the arrest time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders from 142 to 71 days. The group meets regularly to review progress and refine procedures in order to achieve this target. The most recent local figure for Luton and Bedfordshire is 68 days.
<P>

<a name="10403w14.html_para10">The establishment of fortnightly 'case discussions' meetings involving all staff from the YOT has ensured that consideration is given to the skills and resources that might be available from all partner agencies in drawing up every Supervision Plan. In addition, a Service Level Agreement with Victim Support has ensured that all victims of crimes committed by children and young people, where the YOT might be involved, are contacted in order that consideration might be given to reparation being made available. There is a crime diversion scheme in place with Her Majesty's Prison Coldingley and Her Majesty's Prison Bullwood Hall where young people experience the reality of life of crime from drama and testimonies of serving prisoners.
<P>

<a name="10403w14.html_para11">The Youth Justice Service continues to develop in partnership with Luton borough's Community Safety Strategy, with the Crime and Disorder Executive operating as the YOT Strategic Management Group. This ensures that all agencies are committed to the joint approach and this has been further enhanced recently with the addition of the local Drug Action Team. The service was successful last year in gaining funding from the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2001 : Column: 148W</I><P>
Youth Justice Board to develop a Youth Inclusion Programme which is managed on behalf of the partnership by the Safer Luton Partnership, a branch of Crime Concern. The programme targets young people at risk to ensure they are included in mainstream activities by offering support to help them overcome a variety of social problems. A summer activities group runs weekly during each school summer holiday targeted at young people at risk. Structured group work sessions take place in the mornings followed up by supervised activities in the afternoons. Recent discussions across all agencies about the issues associated with nuisance youths has led to the creation of the Youth Intervention Group which meets on a monthly basis to share information on those young people coming to the attention of the police for 'sub criminal' behaviour.
<P>

<a name="10403w14.html_para12">The introduction of Final Warnings in June 2000 built naturally on the success of the Youth Diversion Scheme. Assessments are carried out on all cases where the police decide a Final Warning is appropriate. The police officer seconded to the YOT is responsible for administering the warning, together with a member of the YOT when an intervention programme is to be offered. The YOT work in partnership with Spurgeons Childcare to develop groupwork programmes with parents on a statutory and voluntary basis. Comprehensive assessments continue to be carried out on the suitability of Parenting Orders whenever a young person is sentenced with the information detailed within the Pre-Sentence Report. Similar assessments are carried out when parents are prosecuted for failing to ensure their children receive education, and whenever an Anti-Social Behavioural Order is applied on a child or a young person. The successful application for funding under the Government's 'On track' initiative includes a joint post with Social Services to develop support for parents from Asian communities which will enable the YOT to introduce more culturally sensitive parenting programmes.

<a name="10403w14.html_para23">Hazel Grove is covered by the Stockport Youth Offending Team (YOT). The Stockport YOT provides a working example of partnership practice, drawing together skilled professionals into a multi-disciplinary partnership between police, social services, probation, health and education authorities. The team acts as the central hub of the local criminal justice systems specific to youth offending. Subsequently the team draws into action many agencies, voluntary sector groups and private organisations specific to the central aims of the Youth Justice System. Specific examples include: the development of computerised Youth Offending Information Systems (YOIS), contracted out to a private software company; NCH (National Children's Home) provides bails support service for the 10 local YOTs across Manchester and the development of diversion schemes specific to sports development is managed in partnership with local voluntary organisations (including Sports Stockport and Moving Up Through Sport).

<P>

<a name="10403w14.html_para25">In accordance with National Standards for Youth Justice (April 2000) assessments are carried out on all young offenders who come to the attention of the team. A consistent approach to assessment is achieved through using the ASSET assessment tool, which is a national standardised tool, enabling the specific problems of the individual offender and the risks they pose to others to be assessed. Programmes are tailored to the individual needs, aimed at impacting upon each of the factors operating in an individual's life which contribute to the likelihood of further offending. Assessments are peer reviewed within a professional's forum, providing for further consistency of approach and quality assurance.

<a name="10403w14.html_para26">If the primary aim of the Stockport YOT is to be achieved, consultation with the local community, agencies and partners is key. However, consultation by itself is inadequate if concerns are not addressed. To that end, throughout its working practices Stockport YOT relies on community participation. Integral to the community served by the team are the concerns of victims and offenders. The team seeks to work in co-operation with offenders, utilising court ordered interventions and the secure estate where necessary. A cornerstone to the team's ongoing commitment to the community is provided through work with victims of youth offending. The victims of all offences are contacted, with reparation activities aimed at meeting the needs of victims of crime.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The overall publicity campaign for the 2001 Census will establish the awareness of the Census across the population as a whole, and the banner logo 'Count Me In' aims to encourage universal self-inclusion in the Census.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customised press notices associated with all the main PR events will be disseminated to all ethnic minority media outlets. For our Recruitment Blitz the press notice directed at ethnic minority media carried a supporting quote from Civil Service Commissioner Karamjit Singh CBE, and we specifically targeted metropolitan areas at 14 sites around the country where there would be good links with local TV and radio as well as a high concentration of ethnic minority populations. Our partnership with BBC Local Radio extends to the BBC's Asian Language Network, which has already run a number of Census promotions.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new initiative for the 2001 Census is the Community Liaison Programme in which the ONS is working in partnership with minority groups, including ethnic communities in order to encourage participation in the Census and to help identify sources of field staff. A significant number of local community members are playing an active part in the census operation as members of the field staff and also by supplying local intelligence that will benefit the Census. The wide range of links established with local communities has helped with the recruitment of the local field force where our aim has been to reflect the make-up of these communities. As well as appointing Enumerators who speak other languages and who understand the needs of local communities, interpreters will be used where necessary.</FONT></UL>

<a name="10403w16.html_para5">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para6">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals are helping lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; and the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para7">We have recently published the Green Paper "Towards Full Employment in a Modern Society", which sets out how we will build on our achievements and deliver employment opportunities for all.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para8">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 11 million older people nationally have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para9">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Over 10 million pensioners nationally will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are over 4 million nationally. Around 1.7 million pensioner families nationally are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para10">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

Our priority is to work with local authorities to improve administration, drive out fraud and error and promote work incentives.
<P>

<a name="10403w16.html_para12">Raising standards of administration is the biggest challenge facing Housing Benefit today. That is why we have set up the Expert Help Team, bringing together advice and support from experienced local authority managers, the Department's staff and external consultants.

<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para0">The effect of these Regulations will be to provide protection for the spouses of people who reach State pension age between 6 October 2002 and 5 October 2010, in recognition of the fact that the amount someone needs to save to make up for the reduction to 50 per cent. inheritance increases the closer they are to pension age. The amount of SERPS that the surviving spouse can inherit will be reduced from a maximum of 100 per cent. to a maximum of 50 per cent., but on a sliding scale.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para1">This is in addition to the protection for the spouses of existing pensioners or of people due to reach State pension age by 5 October 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what efforts are being made to ensure that pensioners entitled to back-dated payments for winter fuel allowance are <i>(a)</i> made aware of their entitlement and <i>(b)</i> given guidance on how to claim.  [156341]<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 An information campaign has been running since last April. Its aim is to ensure that existing and potential customers know about changes to the scheme and what, if anything, they need to do to get a payment. It is up to the individual to choose whether to claim payments for past winters. There is no time limit on claiming payments for previous years of the scheme.

<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para8">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para9">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Hazel Grove 9,744 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para10">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Hazel Grove the number has reduced from 1,000 to 600. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in Hazel Grove from 1,000 to 900.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para11">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 18,000 older people in Hazel Grove have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para12">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 16,500 pensioners in Hazel Grove will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are about 6,500 in Hazel Grove. 1,900 pensioner families in Hazel Grove are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10403w17.html_para13">Other reforms in the pipeline: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

 The New Deal has made a significant impact on youth employment in Scotland. In January alone, 700 more young people in Scotland have found work through the New Deal. 32,000 more young people in Scotland are now in work thanks to the New Deal. Unemployment among young people has fallen by 67 per cent. since the introduction of the programme in 1998.

 I have frequent discussions with the Scottish Executive on a wide variety of issues. On pensioner poverty, we have introduced a number of measures to target the poorest pensioners. These measures include the Minimum Income Guarantee, free television licences for those aged 75 or over and the Winter Fuel Payments for those aged 60 or over. From this month, the basic State pension will raise by &#163;5 for a single pensioner and &#163;8 for a couple. From 2003, we shall introduce the Pension Credit which will reward pensioners with modest savings. Together with Jackie Baillie I launched the Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy in Scotland.
