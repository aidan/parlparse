To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make it his policy that newspapers published by local authorities should be subject to the complaints procedure of the Press Complaints Commission; and if he will make a statement. [118781]

<P>
<a name="00417w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Press Complaints Commission is part of a self-regulatory regime for the newspaper industry. All local authority publicity, including newspapers published by local authorities, is subject to the statutory regulatory regime provided by the Local Government Act 1986 and the Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity issued by the Secretary of State thereunder.

<a name="00417w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones, set up at the instigation of the Government and chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS FRSE, is currently considering the possible health effects of the use of mobile phones, base stations and transmitters and is conducting a comprehensive assessment of existing research. The Group is expected to finalise its report shortly. The Government will consider the Group's recommendations and issue a response.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning announced on 13 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 249-50W, the publication of a consultation draft of a new Planning Policy Guidance Note 25, "Development and flood risk". This sets out all the considerations to which planning authorities should have regard when handling applications for development in flood risk areas. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00417w01.html_para0">We will consider the responses to this consultation with a view to issuing the new PPG in its final form later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what powers planning authorities have to <i>(a)</i> defer and <i>(b)</i> reject planning applications for development in areas known to be at risk of flooding pending the completion of flood alleviation works.  [119473]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Local planning authorities have powers under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to impose conditions on a grant of planning permission requiring the carrying out of necessary flood alleviation works as part of a development where such works would form part of the development. Where the necessary flood alleviation works would be required elsewhere than the development site, local planning authorities may impose a condition requiring that the development should not proceed until those works have been carried out, whether by the developer or by any other body. In addition, a developer and local planning authority may enter into an agreement under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to ensure that the necessary works are carried out as part of the development.
<P>

<a name="00417w01.html_para1">Flooding issues are important considerations in the determination of applications for development in areas known to be at risk of flooding. Local planning authorities have powers under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to refuse applications where that risk outweighs other material considerations in the absence of flood alleviation works. Where such works are planned, local planning authorities may refuse an application for development on the grounds of prematurity pending the completion of such works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much money from the Single Regeneration Budget 5 Programme, "Gateways to Community Success", <i>(a)</i> has been and <i>(b)</i> is due to be, provided to fund skills development and training in the Dartford area.  [118843]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 "Gateways to Community Success" was approved last year under the Single Regeneration Budget 5 Programme. The scheme aims to develop the capacity of organisations to equip local residents with personal and vocational skills relevant to the needs of the local labour market. Total SRB funding of &#163;4.3 million will be made available to the scheme over a seven year period from 1999 to 2006. In the first year, &#163;200,000 (mainly for set-up costs) was provided by the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), which is now responsible for Government SRB fundings.
<P>

<a name="00417w01.html_para2">Most of the specific projects supported under this scheme will benefit residents across the whole of the Thames Gateway area in North Kent. It is difficult therefore to break down how much funding will be targeted specifically at Dartford. However, one project under this scheme (Making Connections) is aimed at residents in and around the Temple Hill area of Dartford. Within the overall scheme, this specific project will receive total SRB funding of &#163;809,000. In the first year, &#163;30,000 (again mainly for set-up costs) was provided by SEEDA.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00417w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 April 2000]:</i> The allocation methods vary for the RDAs eight main programmes and for their administration. Many factors are taken into account. These include: levels of deprivation; existing legal commitments; opportunities; value for money; Structural Fund responsibilities; regional population totals; and likely receipt income. There are also some allocations for common costs and account is taken of the RDAs' corporate plans and of other relevant information supplied.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library the opinion on which he based his decision that he was unable to make a statement, under the provisions of section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, that the provisions of the Local Government Bill [Lords] are human rights compliant.  [119160]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00417w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 April 2000]:</i> The Government do not normally publish their legal advice. However, I can clarify that there are doubts as to whether section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986 is compatible with Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the 



<P>
<P><I>17 Apr 2000 : Column: 319W</I><P>
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and with Article 14 (freedom from discrimination) when read with Article 8 (respect for private and family life) and Article 10.
<P>

<a name="00417w02.html_para0">The Bill on introduction to the Lords was, in our opinion, compatible with the ECHR. However, clause 91 of the Local Government Bill amends, and thereby reaffirms, the provisions of section 2A. By extension, this amendment casts doubt on whether the Bill is now compatible with the ECHR. On this basis, the Secretary of State made a statement under section 19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="00417w02.html_para1">The Government have already said that they intend to remove clause 91 of the Bill and, in its place, provide for the repeal of section 2A of the 1986 Act. In our view, the Bill will then be compatible with the ECHR.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will provide funding for local councils to pay a mileage rate on cycle use by their employees.  [119337]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government do not provide funding specifically for this purpose. It is for individual local authorities to decide whether to pay cycling mileage allowances to their employees, and to meet the cost from their general budgets. We would certainly encourage all councils and other employers to promote the use of cycles; mileage allowances are one way of doing this. The Government have already increased the taxable allowance on business travel by bicycle to 12p per mile.
<P>

<a name="00417w02.html_para2">If cycles are used on official journeys by employees instead of their cars, councils stand to make a considerable saving on mileage payments.

 The Department's target is to reduce energy consumption by 8 per cent. from a base year of 1994-95 to 1999-2000 and 1 per cent. per annum thereafter. This later base year reflects the fact that the Department was not created until 1993.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what monitoring the Independent Television Commission carries out of programmes on SIMA TV; if SIMA TV broadcasts the statements of Mojahedin Khalq Organisation of Iran and the National Council of Resistances of Iran; when SIMA TV was last fined by the ITC; and if he will make a statement about the future licensing of SIMA TV.

<P>
<a name="00417w02.html_spnew8"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Monitoring is regularly undertaken by the ITC on the broadcasts of all its licence holders. For broadcasters, like SIMA, who have breached the ITC's Programme Codes, this monitoring would be more intense.
<P>

<a name="00417w02.html_para6">Broadcasting statements by groups such as Mojahedin Khalq Organisation or the National Council of Resistances of Iran are not in themselves a problem, provided they carry no incitement to crime, and that they form part of a wider range of views. SIMA was fined &#163;20,000 in November 1999 for not adhering to these points. SIMA may retain its licence as long as it complies with the ITC's Programmes and other Codes.

 There are 577 sites in England providing full size, synthetic turf pitches for community or club use. A further 12 sites have, in principle, been awarded funding from the Lottery Sports Fund. Sport England will shortly be carrying out a detailed analysis of the provision of synthetic turf pitches. Any gaps in existing provision will be assessed on the basis of the size of the population served, rather than by parliamentary constituency. The adequacy of the provision of pitches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is assessed in the same way.

 In my reply to my hon. Friend on 15 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 223W, I announced that I would be consulting on the future of Glenthorne Youth Treatment Centre, including its possible closure.
<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para1">That consultation has now been completed and I have considered the representations made to me by the staff of the Centre and their representatives, by Members of Parliament; by local authorities; and by others, especially those representing young people accommodated in the Centre. The Centre has made a valuable and important contribution to the treatment and care of some of the most difficult and disturbed young people in the past, and these representations have paid fitting tribute to that contribution.
<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para2">When the Youth Treatment Centres were first developed over 20 years ago, there were no comparable facilities for accommodating and treating such difficult and disturbed young people. Things have moved on considerably since then. Local councils have developed their own secure accommodation and have become skilled and experienced at dealing with young people requiring secure care, including young people like those accommodated in Glenthorne. In recent years, the Department of Health has undertaken a major expansion of local authority secure accommodation by providing an additional 170 places for young people. Providers in the voluntary and private sectors have also established their worth. In these circumstances, I have concluded that it is no longer appropriate for the Department to run such a child care facility and that we should therefore withdraw from providing such a service.




<P>
<P><I>17 Apr 2000 : Column: 330W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para3">We have looked carefully at the option of someone taking over the Centre as a going concern, but, unfortunately, no suitable proposals have been put forward, and 18 of the 30 young people who were in the Centre at the time of my announcement in December have been moved by their placing authorities to alternative facilities. The whole question of the financial viability of the Centre is affecting the morale and welfare of both the staff and the children. It is, therefore, time to bring to an end the uncertainty which has inevitably existed over recent months.
<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para4">However, the welfare of the children currently placed in Glenthorne is of paramount importance and no decision will be taken on when the Centre will finally close until suitable alternative placements have been found for them. The Department will be working closely with the local authorities and the Prison Service to identify the most appropriate places. Once that transition has been achieved, the Centre will close.
<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para5">The Department will also be working closely with the Department Trade Union Side to identify posts elsewhere in the civil service to which some of the staff of the Centre could be re-deployed. However, given the specialist nature of some of the posts in the Centre, re-deployment may not be possible in all cases. In those instances, redundancy terms will apply.
<P>

<a name="00417w04.html_para6">This has been a difficult time for the staff of the Centre and I am grateful for the professional manner in which they have continued to conduct themselves.

Of these, 226 have been successful, 30 proved to have no entitlement and were rejected, and 17 have been returned to the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Irish Regiment for further investigation.

 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2000]:</i> The Action Plan for Farming discussed at the Farming Summit on 30 March outlined a programme of measures to help provide a proper, structured plan for the future. The aid measures amounting to over &#163;200 million are listed. Many of the other measures within the Action Plan will also have considerable benefit to the farming industry, though it is not as yet possible to quantify these.

<a name="00417w06.html_para1">The organic farming sector also benefits from much of the other research the Ministry undertakes: for example, its planned spend of over &#163;8 million in 1999-2000 on biological control techniques, plant health, animal welfare and wildlife conservation on farms.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> To qualify for hill livestock compensatory allowances, West Dorset would have to be designated as a Less Favoured Area (LFA).
<P>

<a name="00417w06.html_para2">LFAs in the UK were first designated under Council Directive 75/276/EEC, and last amended by Commission Decision 91/25/EEC. For any additional area to be designated as LFA it would need to meet the general criteria set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/99 (Articles 17-21) and the specific criteria set out in Council Directive 75/268/EEC (Articles 3 (4) and 5) as adopted by Council Directive 84/169/EEC.
<P>

<a name="00417w06.html_para3">Proposals for any extension of the LFA area in England would need to be submitted to the European Commission for approval as part of the England Rural Development Plan. No such proposals have been included.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reason, in the 1998 survey of the working party on pesticides residues, aldicarburas was not among the pesticides actively sought in retail samples of speciality potatoes.  [118803]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00417w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 April 2000]:</i> This was the first time speciality potatoes had been analysed as part of the Government's annual residues monitoring programme. The potatoes were therefore tested against a standard multiple residue screen to give an indication of the residues present. Aldicarb is not part of this general screen. However, processed potato products were also surveyed in 1998, and aldicarb was included in this analytical suite. The results of this survey are due to be published later this year. A special survey on the variability of aldicarb residues in potatoes (including new potatoes) was published in August last year, the results of which are available on the Pesticide Safety Directorate's (PSD's) internet website (http://maffweb/aboutmaf/agency/psd/psdhome.htm), or direct from PSD. The full document is also available to all Members in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 12 April 2000]:</i> The surveys of the Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR) are not, except in certain circumstances, directed towards produce of particular countries. The samples of speciality potatoes purchased as part of the 1998 survey were representative of what was available on the UK market at the time of purchase.

 So far, five countries have qualified for relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This is disappointing because the target was for 11 countries to have qualified by the Spring Meetings of the World bank and the IMF. The Government remain strongly committed to the G7 target of three-quarters of eligible countries getting to Decision Point by the end of 2000. We are pressing the bank and Fund to speed up the process.
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para0">Discussions are also continuing to agree the financing arrangements for the multilateral development banks' participation in the Initiative. Further contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund will be required. UK has made the largest commitment to date--over $350 million. This includes our share of European Community contributions to the Trust Fund.

<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para2">

<BR>
As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning special payments relating to Jobseeker's Allowance in 1999. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
The Employment Service has arrangements to consider claims for compensation from jobseekers who claim to have suffered a financial loss or severe worry and distress, gross inconvenience or embarrassment as a result of errors by our staff, under the terms of a Department of Social Security compensation scheme.
<BR>
In the period 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999, we received 391 claims for special payments as a result of alleged error in connection with Employment Service administration of Jobseeker's Allowance. Of these claims for compensation, 16 were in connection with advice concerning the National Insurance Contribution conditions for Jobseeker's Allowance, of which two were refused.
<BR>
I should add that the Benefits Agency also make special payments as a result of alleged errors with their administration of Jobseeker's Allowance. Therefore, I have asked for the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency to reply to you direct on the number of special payments they have made in relation to Jobseeker's Allowance.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<P>
<a name="00417w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) does not directly employ lawyers but obtains them from Treasury Solicitor's Department (TSD). The lawyers are employed by TSD and allocated to DfEE. The figures given represent the number of lawyers allocated as at 31 March for the years in question.
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para3">As at 31 March 2000, 24 lawyers were allocated by TSD to DfEE.
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para4">DfEE came into existence following Machinery of Government changes in July 1995. The figures given for 1995 are for the number of lawyers allocated by TSD to its two predecessor Departments: the Employment Department Group (EDG) and Department for Education (DfE).
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para5">As at 31 March 1995, 13 lawyers were allocated to the former EDG and 10 to the former DfE, making a total of 23.
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para6">Meaningful comparisons between the numbers for 1995 and 2000 will be difficult to establish as DfEE's responsibilities do not precisely equate with those of its predecessor Departments.
<P>

<a name="00417w07.html_para7">For example, the Health and Safety Executive and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service were both part of EDG in March 1995 but transferred to the Department of Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry respectively as part of the Machinery of Government changes later that year.

It was explained then that a new target had been set across the Government estate, to apply from 2000-01, of a one per cent. per annum reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The base year will be 1999-2000 as it was the final year to which the previous target applied. My Department will aim to meet this target. It represents a change against the previous cross-Government Target to 31 March 2000 which was expressed in terms of reductions in energy expenditure. Measurement in greenhouse gas emissions provides a much better fit with the current climate change programme and the UK's Kyoto targets.

<P>

 The law already requires that those local education authorities and schools that choose to provide milk must make it available, without charge, to pupils whose parents receive Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Secretary of State for Health have not had any recent discussions about extending eligibility for free school milk. In the last six months we have received only three letters from members of the public pressing for the re-introduction of compulsory free school milk for all school children.
<P>

<a name="00417w08.html_para2">The Government have no plans to extend eligibility for free school milk or to make the serving of free milk compulsory. We have not therefore assessed the feasibility of doing so. We have however legislated to allow free drinking milk to be served at any time during the day, rather than only at lunchtime.
<P>

<a name="00417w08.html_para3">Milk is one of many foods that play an important part in a balanced diet. Milk and dairy foods are part of our proposals for minimum nutritional standards for school lunches, which will come into operation next year. We will be recommending in our guidance to school caterers that drinking milk should be made available every day. We also encourage schools to claim existing subsidies for school milk, such as those available through the European Community School Milk Subsidy Scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 14 April 2000]:</i> I have written to the headteachers of all schools in England who will benefit from the extra &#163;290 million we are making available following the Budget. This includes maintained nursery and primary schools. The money is part of a real terms increase of over 10 per cent. this year. Copies of the letters, including those sent to nursery schools, are being placed in the Library. The final allocations are subject to approval of a special grant report which was laid before Parliament on 6 April and is being debated on 17 April. No additional resources have been allocated directly to Early Years, Childcare and Education Development Partnerships. I have, however, made an additional &#163;0.5 million available for pre-schools' groups and playgroups facing financial difficulties. This follows a similar scheme last year, and will give groups time in which to consider their longer term plans.

All the nursery school closures were linked to the establishment of alternative nursery units at other schools except one where the nursery school was closed as there were surplus nursery places in the area. Since 1997, four new nursery schools have been established.

The additional funding will be part of schools' delegated budgets, so they will be free to decide what to spend it on. It will give extra support to secondary schools in raising standards as part of the new Key Stage 3 programme, which will include: the setting of challenging school-level targets, and development of strategies to meet them, by all secondary schools with Key Stage 3 pupils for performance in the Key Stage 3

 In our Prospectus for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) we made it clear that adult and community learning is a vital part of the Government's plans to drive up achievement, widen participation in learning, and strengthen community confidence and capacity.
<P>

<a name="00417w09.html_para0">Our first consultation document on the funding of post 16 learning, published in January, confirmed the strategic contribution that local authorities, together with local Learning and Skills Councils, can make. The Learning and Skills Bill (Lords) now before Parliament includes the necessary provisions to allow this. The Secretary of State has already recognised the importance of local education authorities in adult and community learning by guaranteeing them a minimum level of funding in the first two years of the LSC, provided they maintain their spend in this area and effectively implement their lifelong learning plans.

 The ConneXions service will largely be staffed by existing civil servants, but will draw as necessary on secondees from other Government Departments, the voluntary, youth and private sectors where appropriate. We do not anticipate any significant increase in the current establishment.

 The funding for the ConneXions service will come from the bringing together of existing resources devoted to youth support and guidance. We are also considering what additional resources will be needed and can be made available as part of the Government's Year 2000 Spending Review.

 The ConneXions service will ensure that every young person, whatever their needs, has local access to appropriate high quality guidance and support during their teenage years. A key factor in achieving this will be to ensure that all young people have access to a personal adviser. It is too early at this stage to give precise information on the numbers of personal advisers to be employed by the ConneXions service. The service will be phased in from April 2001 and the ConneXions partnerships will be responsible for deciding how best to deliver the service in their area, in the light of local circumstances.

For 14 and 15-year-old pupils, only 0.1 per cent. of pupils are in classes of over 35, representing a fall of nearly one half between January 1999 and 2000. Similarly, within the same time period, the number of pupils aged 16 or more in classes over 35 also fell to only 775 pupils, a reduction in the number of pupils of about one third.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State receives representations from time to time on various issues related to class sizes. The evidence, including from Ofsted, indicates that class size is most important at Key Stage 1. That is why we pledged to reduce the size of infant classes to 30 or below, ensuring that all children benefit, and helping to give young pupils the important start they need. We are well on track to deliver our pledge by September 2001 at the latest.
<P>

<a name="00417w10.html_para8">The average number of pupils in secondary classes is 22--about five fewer than in primary schools. The pupil/teacher ratio in secondary schools is 17.1--more than six lower than in primary schools. Class sizes in secondary schools have been rising steadily since 1998, when the figure was 19.9.
<P>

<a name="00417w10.html_para9">In the recent budget, secondary headteachers each received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000. It remains for headteachers to decide how to use this money but, spent on teachers, the secondary pupil/teacher ratio could be reduced by 0.4. More generally, between 1997-98 and 2000-01, overall funding per secondary school pupil has increased in cash terms by some &#163;580--an increase of around 20 per cent.

<a name="00417w11.html_para3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) commissioned Durham University to undertake a monitoring exercise last summer to ascertain the extent to which the P scales, the assessment framework proposed in the publication 'Supporting the Target Setting Process--Guidance for effective target setting for pupils with special educational needs', are being used in schools. 313 schools, including 116 mainstream and 197 special schools, took part in the survey. The exercise was supported by the 63 local education authorities (LEAs) in which the schools are situated.

<a name="00417w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The percentage of primary and maintained and non-maintained special schools which have been placed in special measures since 1995 is contained in the table. While there are some special schools which cater for pupils wholly of primary school age, or wholly of secondary school age, there are many others which cover age ranges bridging part or the whole of the primary and secondary phases. The attached table does not distinguish between special schools covering the wide number of possible different age ranges. The figures in the table represent the proportion of all primary and maintained and non-maintained special schools which were inspected by Ofsted during that academic year and deemed to be in need of special measures.

 The role of the Humber task group is not to oversee the transition of the TEC into the Learning and Skills Council but rather to collect information from current funding bodies (such as TECs, FEFC, and Local Education Authorities) on the range and volume of provision currently being funded in each area. The aim is to ensure that sufficient funds will be available in each area to at least maintain current levels of provision and to avoid disruption for learners resulting from the introduction of the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00417w11.html_para5">Since they are not funding bodies there is no requirement for a direct representative of Humber colleges on the Humber task group, although a college principal who is a chair of one of the four Local Learning Partnerships has been invited to join the task group.

<P>
<a name="00417w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 There are nine TEC areas in Yorkshire and the Humber region. Four Learning and Skills Councils are planned for the region and there are, therefore, four task groups in the region. The role of these task groups is not to oversee the transition of the TECs to the Learning and Skills Council but rather to collect information from current funding bodies (such as TEC, FEFC, and Local Education Authorities) on the range and volume of provision currently being funded in each area. The aim is to ensure that sufficient funds will be available in each area to at least maintain current levels of provision and to avoid disruption for learners resulting from the introduction of the new arrangements.

<a name="00417w11.html_para6">Since they are not funding bodies there are no representatives of local colleges on any of the task groups in each region, although a college principal does sit on the South Yorkshire task group because of the wider remit that the group has identified to link LSC development with objective 1 status for South Yorkshire.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 29 March 2000 that an additional &#163;50 million will be allocated from September 2000 to expand the education maintenance allowance (EMA) pilots. The new money will allow us to expand some of the original pilots and to introduce EMAs in 40 new areas (which were set out in the Secretary of State's announcement). We will shortly announce the model that each new area will be testing.
<P>

<a name="00417w12.html_para2">We have chosen a selection of new areas where we believe the EMA has the potential to make the most difference.

The choice of areas also includes some additional rural areas where we will be concentrating on transports costs.
<P>

<a name="00417w12.html_para3">The new pilots will mean that EMAs will be available in almost a third of the country. We will be monitoring the new pilots carefully to inform future decisions about EMAs, including whether to expand further.

 The purpose of Minimum Rates of Pay is to protect Service personnel and their families from hardship. Of the Child Support Agency maintenance awards made against Service parents, 99 per cent. are met in full. In only one in a hundred Service cases is less than the full amount of a maintenance award being paid. This contrasts with the current Child Support Agency average of only 40 per cent. of parents paying in full, with 30 per cent. paying nothing at all. Nevertheless, consideration is being given to reforming minimum Service pay regulations.

In addition, we have agreed that the firm of Bombardier can use one of the surplus hangars for aircraft maintenance, which will create job opportunities in the local area. There should also be scope to market surplus hangar capacity on the airfield site.

Partnership. Last year's consultation exercise on a potential PPP proposal produced a wide range of useful comments from stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="00417w14.html_para3">As a result of this process, I announced in October that we would be widening the scope of our discussion to take these comments into account. That work is now complete and has led to the development of two revised models for potential PPP structures, known as "Core Competence" and the "Public Sector Option". A detailed evaluation of these options indicates that Core Competence best meets the PPP objectives while also responding to the views of stakeholders. Both models are described in a consultation document which has been placed in the Library of the House and which is also available on the internet at www.mod.uk/commercial/ppp/dera/.
<P>

<a name="00417w14.html_para4">The essence of Core Competence is a clear separation of those functions which are best developed within a PPP, and those which are best performed wholly within Government. Around three quarters of DERA would be turned into a company, which we would hope to float on the stock market as soon as its potential is judged to be suitably developed. A core of staff would be retained wholly within the MOD to provide a high level overview of defence science and technology. This ensures that MOD would retain access to in-house impartial advice and allows management of the defence research programme and international research collaboration. Specific very sensitive areas and programmes would also be retained.
<P>

<a name="00417w14.html_para5">I believe that this approach would create two vibrant sustainable organisations. The new company would have the freedom to flourish, to grow its business and to diversify the wealth of knowledge it has built up over the years to the benefit of the wider UK economy while still providing the MOD with the essential services we will continue to need long into the future. The retained organisation will be a small but also world-class organisation offering rewarding careers within MOD and the wider civil service.
<P>

<a name="00417w14.html_para6">This approach is good for DERA, good for MOD and good for the wider UK economy. It will provide the UK technology sector with added impetus and ensure we are well placed to take on the challenges and opportunities offered by the 21st century.
<P>

<a name="00417w14.html_para7">All stakeholders are now being invited to submit their views on the revised proposals. As the exercise has proved, we are willing to listen and to respond to comments before taking a final decision.

(c) In all other respects the individual is considered a good serviceman or woman whose retention would be in the interest of the service.

The rules state that a soldier is to be discharged if he has been sentenced by a civil court or by court-martial to imprisonment or to detention or to any other form of custodial sentence. If in the opinion of the commanding officer there are exceptional reasons that make retention of the soldier desirable then the case is to be submitted with valid and explicit reasons to the Director of Manning (Army) for a decision.

Its future is being considered as part of our wider review of the Department's estate holdings in London. If it is determined that the Eastcote site is surplus to defence needs, the property will be disposed of.

 The majority of Service Families Accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales was sold to Annington Homes Limited (AHL) on 5 September 1996, on a 999-year lease. The Ministry of Defence leases back those properties it requires to house Service families on a 200-year lease. Those properties not required for Service use are released to AHL, as they become available. 1,472 properties were disposed of in this way in 1999 calendar year. The amount raised from these sales is a matter for AHL.
<P>

<a name="00417w15.html_para0">In addition, Defence Estates remains responsible for a small number of SFA's in England and Wales and all of those in Scotland. Of these, 478 have been disposed of in the period providing revenue of &#163;10,437,516.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his letter of 19 March, Ref. D/Min/(AF)JS/0906/00/P, what conclusions he has drawn from his scrutiny of the report of the Congressional Committee on National Security which reviewed the US Department of Defense's policy on the use of US-licensed anthrax vaccine and the way in which that policy had been implemented.  [117973]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We have studied the Committee's report and a response by the US Department of Defense refuting the Committee's findings. These concerned both the safety and efficacy of the US anthrax vaccine and the scope of the US Department of Defense's mandatory immunisation programme. The anthrax vaccine produced in the UK differs from the US product and is administered in a different way. Independent advice in both the UK and the US has confirmed that vaccination against anthrax is safe and effective. Against this background, it remains our policy that vaccination against anthrax has an important part to play as one of a range of measures to provide protection against biological weapons for our armed forces.

 Budget 2000 confirmed that the climate change levy will be introduced from April 2001 and the aggregates levy from April 2002. The revenues from these levies will be recycled to business through cuts in employer NICS of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points respectively. This is consistent with the Government's approach to shifting the burden of taxation from "goods" such as labour to "bads" such as environmental pollution.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his oral statements of 29 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 26-27 and 28 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 234, and to his answer to the right hon.

and (iii) sex offenders should not be influenced by the electronic monitoring provisions of the Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [118307]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 April 2000]:</i> The electronic monitoring measures in the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill will not change the timing of any prisoner's eligibility for release. The basis of any discretionary release decision will continue to be careful risk assessment. The use of the new licence conditions will be subject to piloting before full implementation. Evaluation of the pilots will include consideration of the impact of the new licence conditions on discretionary release decisions taken by the Parole Board and by the Prison Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para1">In the vast majority of cases, we anticipate that the availability of electronic monitoring as a licence condition will have no impact on release decisions.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para2">Prison Service Orders will make clear there are no circumstances in which the availability of the new electronic monitoring provisions in the Bill should influence decisions on release made by the Prison Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para3">In addition, using the powers available to him under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Home Secretary will direct the Parole Board that in considering certain types of case, decisions on release should not be influenced by the availability of the new powers of electronic monitoring in the Bill. The Home Secretary's Directions to the Parole Board will cover any sex offender required to register under the Sex Offenders Act 1997, and any sexual or violent offender who is serving an "extended sentence" as provided for in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Directions will also apply to all prisoners serving a licence sentence, to other prisoners serving a determinate sentence for homicide or attempted homicide, terrorism, arson, robbery or assault and to any other prisoner whose offending or other behaviour suggests that he poses a clear risk of violence to the public. This definition could include prisoners convicted of drugs offences, firearms offences or burglary, depending on the circumstances of the cases.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para4">The types of case where the use of electronic monitoring may provide sufficient extra reassurance to influence a decision in favour of release are expected to be those where the Parole Board is considering prisoners who are at the lower end of the offending scale (within the category of prisoners eligible for parole), and who pose no obvious risk of violence to the public.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para5">It is, therefore clear that the Home Secretary's policy is that the timing of the release of serious, high risk and sex offenders, as defined above, should not be influenced by the electronic monitoring provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00417w17.html_para6">The term "serious offenders" has different legal definitions in different contexts. In the context of my oral statement of 29 November, the term "serious offenders" was a reference to those prisoners serving sentences of four years or more who will be covered by the planned Directions to the Parole Board.

 All asylum applications, regardless of the applicant's nationality, are considered in accordance with the criteria set out in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. To qualify for asylum a person must be outside his/her country of nationality and have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Those who meet these criteria are granted asylum; those who do not meet the requirements of the 1951 Convention may nevertheless be granted exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom if there are exceptional compelling humanitarian reasons why they should not be required to leave.

<P>
<a name="00417w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Most work done on alternatives is neither done by the Government nor with Government money. Nonetheless, each year, the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) a budget for the research into the development and promotion of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering. Work aimed at improving the environmental conditions in which laboratory animals are kept and transported has also been sponsored. Through national advertising, the APC Research and Alternatives Sub-Committee invites applications for funding of suitable projects. It then selects the most appropriate and monitors progress. Details of completed research for 1998 is published in the Report of the Animal Procedures Committee for 1998.
<P>

<a name="00417w18.html_para0">The budget available to the Committee in 1998-99 for this purpose was &#163;259,000 (an increase of 42 per cent. from &#163;182,000 the previous year). However, this is not the only money spent by the Government on alternatives: other Departments also fund such work; estimates of spending reach approximately &#163;2 million each year. Industry, too, spends millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives.
<P>

<a name="00417w18.html_para1">On an international level, the United Kingdom Government will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (now known as the Unit for the Validation of Biological Testing Methods) through contributions to the European Union. It is the unit's task to monitor and co-ordinate research into alternatives and to develop the processes of validation--that is, the assessment of alternative methods to see whether they are reliable and whether they produce a level of information similar to the animal based tests they are to replace. The lack of progress in some areas is more often due to the limitations of science than to inadequate funding.

 The Government recognise the particular concern about the use of dogs in scientific procedures. Under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, animals may only be used where there are no alternatives and where the benefits of the programme outweigh any suffering caused to the animals concerned. In addition, certain species (such as dogs, cats and primates) can only be used where animals of no other species are suitable. Special conditions, tailored to each project, control and minimise any pain or suffering caused.

<a name="00417w18.html_para5">Dr. Christopher resigned from the Animal Procedures Committee in 1997, after the establishment with which he was associated was investigated by the Home Office. Again, no direction was given by the Secretary of State nor officials to the then Chairman or to that member. As was proper, the Secretariat to the Committee advised the Chairman only on how to handle discussion of the investigation at the relevant meetings of the Committee.

 The Immigration Service sent the appropriate appeals papers for this case to the Appellate Authorities on 22 January 2000. Unfortunately there is no record of receipt. To avoid further delay, duplicate papers were then sent by facsimile on 10 March but, in this form, they were not acceptable to the Appellant Authority. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate will now forward a full bundle to the Authority as a matter of urgency.

 Statistical data are collected on offences involving alcohol or illegal drugs only, not on offences which may have been committed under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. A report published in 1998 on research carried out during 1996 and 1997 on behalf of the Home Office by the University of

Cambridge sheds light on the links between alcohol, drugs and crime, Further data collected during 1998 and 1999 are currently being analysed as part of the NEW-ADAM programme for interviewing and drug testing arrestees. It is hoped to publish the next set of full results in the first half of this year.
<P>

<a name="00417w19.html_para0">The research undertaken so far on drug testing of arrestees, based in five locations, indicates that three-quarters (74 per cent.) of arrestees had recently taken at least one illegal drug and/or alcohol prior to arrest. The proportion of arrestees testing positive for alcohol average 25 per cent., while that for heroin/opiates was 18 per cent. These findings confirm the supposition that offenders tend to be heavy consumers of drugs.
<P>

<a name="00417w19.html_para1">While this study considerably advances knowledge of drugs-crime links, it will always be difficult to calculate a single percentage figure reflecting precisely what proportion of all crime is alcohol- or drug-related.
<P>

<a name="00417w19.html_para2">Figures on drug offences in 1998 were published in February 2000 in Home Office Statistical Bulletin Number 3/00 "Drug seizure and offender statistics, United Kingdom, 1998". Some alcohol-related statistics are also published. Figures on breath tests were published in Statistical Bulletin 16/99 "Breath Test Statistics, England and Wales, 1998", motoring offences in Statistical Bulletin 12/99 "Motoring Offences, England and Wales, 1997"; other offences involving alcohol are included in "Criminal Statistics England and Wales 1998" published in March 2000.

 The Probation Estate Transitional Strategy was an internal document produced by officials in the Home Office. It drew on the advice provided by a consultants' report, but was not dependent upon that report. Prior to and during the formulation of the Probation Estate Transitional Strategy, Home Office officials consulted with the principal probation management organisations, Central Probation Council (CPC) and Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP), who are represented through the Probation Estate Advisory Committee. Some 10 representations concerning the Probation Estate Transitional Strategy have been received, from probation committees/boards and from the probation organisations, CPC and ACOP. Forty six probation services also responded to a request for comments on the consultants' area survey reports.

<a name="00417w19.html_para6">In 1999, the Audit Commission published "Action Stations--a management handbook on improving the management of the police estate". Management of the much smaller national probation estate presents a very different set of issues, but as much of the good practice guidance has generic application to all property management, it provides a useful reference source/guide.

 The UK has played a leading role in calling for higher standards in the electoral process in Peru. We have financed two reports this year which have highlighted the deficiencies, and copies of these reports have been sent to the Peruvian Government as well as being circulated widely internationally. We were instrumental in organising a critical EU statement on 7 April in advance of the vote. On 12 April, after the vote, I issued a statement which was delivered through our Embassy in Lima to the Peruvian President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. In it I suggested a second round was both desirable and sensible in the light of widespread concerns, including that of the two British observers, my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The information is in the table.
<P>

<a name="00417w23.html_para0">While our priority is to target help to those pensioners in greatest need through the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), we have provided significant help to all pensioners. During this Parliament, we will have spent nearly &#163;1.9 billion more on Winter Fuel Payments and the MIG than on earnings uprating the basic State Pension. Clearly, given constraints on resources, if we had uprated the basic pension in line with earnings, we would not have been able to provide the level of help we have, particularly to the poorest pensioners. Also earnings uprating the basic State Pension does not help them as the increase would be offset by a pound-for-pound reduction in the MIG they received. All these aspects need to be taken into account when using figures in the table.

<a name="00417w24.html_para7">The Group has considered a wide range of subjects including active aging, care issues, consultation and involvement, transport, volunteering and improving services for older people. A consultation document, "Building a Better Britain for Older People", was published in November 1998. The Group has also sponsored research into attitudes and aspirations of older people which was published last year <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="00417w24.html_para8">The Group has consulted widely with organisations representing older people and has undertaken a significant programme of consultation with older people themselves. Members of the Group attended a series of listening to older people events across the UK during 1999, which provided older people with a further opportunity to discuss issues that are important to them. The programme will conclude with a National Listening Event on 17 May in London. This will build on and respond to the consultation that has taken place over the past year.

<a name="00417w24.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what period of time has been devoted to training start-up officers and personal advisers in the ONE pilot areas to enable them to identify entitlement to income support, housing benefit, disability living allowance and incapacity benefit; and what period of time has been devoted to training to enable them to identify entitlement to working families tax credit and disabled persons' tax credit;  [119338]
<P>
<UL>(2) what training advisers in the ONE pilot areas have received in understanding and applying the principle of good cause.  [119343]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00417w24.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 ONE training for all advisers is individually tailored through the use of the learning assessment framework which matches training provision to training need. A copy of this framework can be found in the Library.




<P>
<P><I>17 Apr 2000 : Column: 405W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00417w24.html_para30">There is extensive benefits training available to advisers on the entitlement to ONE benefits. Advisers receive a three-week benefit entitlement training course, which includes Income Support, Housing Benefit, Disability Living Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit.




<P>
<P><I>17 Apr 2000 : Column: 406W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00417w24.html_para31">Advisers also receive training in relation to good cause. However, it should be noted that most already understand and know how to apply the principles of good cause. Good cause provisions exist elsewhere in the benefit system and were, for example, included in the training for the New Decision Making and Appeals procedures which were implemented in the Autumn of 1999.
