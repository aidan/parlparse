 This matter was discussed by the working group which drafted the code of practice. As there is no specific obligation in the European regulation about the provision of oxygen, it was not considered appropriate to make a specific recommendation in the code about carriage of oxygen cylinders. Instead, the code reflects current guidance and practice in this area, in particular with regard to security considerations.</p>

 Piracy is an international problem that requires an international solution. Piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden are less than 0.1 per cent. of the estimated 16,000 vessels which pass through the region annually. The Government are however, very concerned by increasing numbers of incidents in and around Somali waters. The EU is planning a counter piracy operation to which the UK will provide the operation commander and operation headquarters. EU partners agree that any operation must be co-ordinated with NATO and Combined Task Force 150, themselves active to deter piracy off the Horn of Africa. The UK contributes to both. The UK Government are also tackling piracy at its roots on land. Through the Department for International Development, the UK has allocated &#163;25 million to support efforts to tackle instability in Somalia. The instability creates the conditions allowing piratical activities to flourish.</p>

This advice can be obtained from the Royal Navy&#146;s UK Maritime Trade Operation based in Dubai. The shipping industry has also been informed of the Maritime Security Patrol Area (MPSA) established by the Combined Maritime Forces. The MPSA does not eliminate the risk of criminal activity and shipping has been warned to exercise extreme caution and vigilance.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 October 2008]:</i> The Government are committed to contributing towards funding independent domestic violence adviser (IDVA) services with funds derived from the victims surcharge. In 2008-09 125 IDVA services were allocated grants including the 104 services supporting the specialist domestic violence courts. This includes four sites in Hampshire at Alton, Andover, Portsmouth and Southampton. The Government also allocated funding in 2008-09 to Government offices for the expansion of IDVA services (and multi-agency risk assessment conferences) locally and anticipates that funding will be made available again in 2009-10.</p>

The custodial costs of a DBO are lower (than an ASBO) since the shorter DBOs are assumed to have fewer breaches. This is estimated to be &#163;0.5 million to &#163;2.5 million or &#163;2 million to &#163;10 million, if the increased number requires new prison places to be constructed. This assumes an equal mix of two, six and 12-month DBOs. The additional construction costs are not expected to be necessary as the total impact is expected to be less than 100 prison places. Even this scenario allows for six times more DBOs than there are currently ASBOs.</p>

Such checks will provide a very secure and reliable means of proving identity.</p>

 The National Policing Improvement Agency's (NPIA) Missing Persons Bureau has been developing its services to police forces, partners and stakeholders. This includes examining the protocols for the capture, storage and matching of DNA in missing persons' cases, and work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) on their Action Plan on Young Runaways, launched in June 2008. The Bureau has a change programme with over 40 enhancements designed to develop its response to missing person investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="81117w0013.htm_para3"><a name="08111738000589">A new national child rescue alert system is being developed and will enable the Bureau to launch United Kingdom-wide alerts and to participate in launching cross-border alerts with other European Union (EU) member states.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="81117w0013.htm_para4"><a name="08111738000590">The Bureau is involved in an EU-sponsored (Justice and Home Affairs Council) joint Anglo-French alert exercise to determine if a national scheme is viable for the United Kingdom and test a hypothesis of how such a scheme might work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="81117w0013.htm_para5"><a name="08111738000591">The Bureau is currently liaising with the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (USA) and with four EU member states in this development programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="81117w0013.htm_para6"><a name="08111738000592">A review is currently being carried out of the state of 'unidentified body' cases within forces and encouraging forensic reviews. Work is also being done to establish an effective DNA strategy for missing persons' enquiries and the Bureau is developing its IT system (Hermes) to enable automatic and electronic transfer of data from police forces to the Bureau and onwards to the charity Missing People.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="81117w0013.htm_para7"><a name="08111738000593">One of the key future priorities for the Bureau is the development of a code of practice to create a national &#145;picture' of missing people. A code will generate accurate and timely data to enable the new national indicator on runaways as part of the National Indicator Set for 2009-2010. This indicator (NI71) is designed to secure effective joint working between children's services, the police and other local partners to ensure that necessary data about young runaways is collected, analysed and used to assist in safeguarding children. This code of practice has been drafted and consultation ends on November 21.</p>

The Government's Crime Strategy has now moved away from centrally imposed targets toward making local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. Where sheep rustling emerges as a pressing local issue there is a local framework in place for local police forces and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to devote resources to tackling this crime.</p>

 School cleanliness is the responsibility of the head teacher and governors and the local authority where they are the employer. The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 Regulation 9 and the Approved Code of Practice on the regulations issued by the Health and Safety Executive cover cleanliness. More specifically &#147;Toilets in Schools&#148; a recent departmental document on Teachernet makes clear the importance of well designed and well maintained facilities so that pupils can and will make regular use of them. The Government have made a number of steps. The BSF Furniture and Equipment (F &amp; E) brief aims to encourage schools and bidders to recognise the role furniture can play within the transformational agenda. As part of this aim, it will make clear the expectations for furniture such as the need for improved strength and stability criteria as set out in part 2 of the new European standard EN1729. It is also proposed to include the ergonomic requirements of EN1729 part 1. A 30-month research project the Department has recently commissioned into the accommodation implications of personalised learning will examine the role furniture can play in ensuring flexible layouts. The Department has also published a website which gives ergonomic dimensions for furniture in order that designers have the most up-to-date data from which to work on new designs. Quality of furniture in schools can often lie in making the right choices of furniture, the Department&#146;s website aims to ensure that schools buy appropriately sized furniture.

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="81117w0015.htm_para3"><a name="08111738000739">The proportion of teenagers who drink regularly is falling but those who do drink are drinking a lot more. Young people who drink too much not only put their own health at risk, but are more likely to get involved in antisocial behaviour and contribute to insecurity on our streets. The Youth Alcohol Action Plan, published in June, sets out a number of actions to address the problems of young people's alcohol consumption. We will provide clearer health information for parents and young people about how consumption of alcohol, particularly at an early age, can affect children and young people. This will include the chief medical officer's guidelines on safer drinking by young people and a comprehensive communications campaign aimed at 11 to 15 year-olds to be launched in spring 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="81117w0015.htm_para4"><a name="08111738000740">In line with recommendations from an independent review of drug and alcohol education, Ministers announced on 30 October 2008 that Personal Health and Social Education (PHSE) would be made statutory subject. This would underline the key role PSHE has to play in young people's personal development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="81117w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08111738000741">Very few young people are addicted to alcohol but we know that a small proportion of young people do drink too much which puts them at risk of harm. DCSF are working closely with the National Treatment Agency (NTA) to continue to improve the accessibility and quality of substance misuse treatment for young people (under 18), with the aim of ensuring that effective treatment is available for any young person with alcohol problems that needs it.</p>

1. Although the 5 per cent. sample data would normally be used to produce tables on DLA disabling condition as it contains more complete information on disabling condition, in this case the 100 per cent. Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study has been used. This is because for a small subset of the caseload such as those with one specific disabling condition in one parliamentary constituency, the sampling variation associated with figures produced from the 5 per cent. sample data would be such as to make the results unreliable.<br>
2. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
3. Figures are only available from 2002.<br>
4. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.<br>
5. Where the claimant is eligible for both care and mobility components, the disabling condition associated with the mobility component is shown here. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.<br>

 From December 2004, the standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments in income support, income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance and state pension credit was changed to respond to changes in the Bank of England base rate. The standard interest rate is the Bank of England base rate plus an additional 1.58 per cent. This is more representative, transparent, easier to understand and easier to administer than the previous method, which was based upon an average of building society interest rates. The additional 1.58 per cent. recognises the fact that lenders' interest rates are set at a higher rate than the base rate and to ensure that no-one lost out when the method of calculation changed.</p>

 The proposed Regulation changes will not apply to lone parents who: are in receipt of Carer's Allowance; have a child for whom they are receiving the middle or higher rate care component of Disability Living Allowance; foster children. These lone parents will be exempt and continue to be eligible for Income Support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="81117w0021.htm_para0"><a name="0811183001300">Lone parents in these circumstances who are also home educators are included in this group. Those lone parents who do not qualify for exemption and are capable of work will have to claim Jobseeker's Allowance, where they will be required to actively seek and be available for work of at least 16 hours a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="81117w0021.htm_para1"><a name="0811183001301">However, it is recognised that lone parents who home educate may face unique and varied circumstances. Therefore we are ensuring that Jobcentre Plus Personal Advisers will have the appropriate training and guidance to deal with home educators when they make a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance. This will include making use of the proposed additional flexibilities to the Jobseeker's Allowance regime where the individual circumstances of home educators make this necessary. In addition home educators, like all other lone parents, will not be penalised if they have good cause for not taking up a job and the availability and suitability of childcare will be central to such a decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="81117w0021.htm_para2"><a name="0811183001302">As there is no requirement for parents to register as home educators there are no official statistics on the number of children who are being home educated. Therefore, it is not possible to provide any breakdown of lone parents who home educate whether through necessity or choice. Research carried out by York Consulting in 2006 estimated that around 20,000 children from all types of families were then registered with their local authority as being educated at home. We recognise that the figure could be substantially higher.</p>

 We have made a comprehensive assessment of Jobcentre Plus's capacity to implement the changes and are satisfied that the plans Jobcentre Plus has in place will enable the organisation to manage the change.

 Lone parents impacted by these changes will be invited to an interview, six weeks before they are due to lose their income support, where they will be provided with specific advice and support to move into work or claim another benefit. Those who subsequently claim jobseekers allowance will have a further meeting with an adviser to agree a Jobseekers Agreement, which sets out the sort of work they will look for, their hours of availability and when they need to attend the Jobcentre to confirm they have been available for and actively seeking work. At this meeting the individual circumstances of each lone parent will be considered. Those who claim employment and support allowance will have a series of six work-focused interviews to help them focus on what work they are able to do.</p>

The regulatory payment window then opens on 1 December and during 2007 RPA made the first payments to farmers on 10th December. This period between 9 June and 10 December therefore represents the shortest period within which applications were processed to completion during the 2007 SPS scheme year.</p>

 No such estimate into the losses directly attributable to the varroa mite or the viruses associated with it has been made. However, investigations into colony losses show these are mainly attributable to the poor weather, especially during last summer.

 Farmgate milk prices are determined by a number of factors, including the time of year; exchange rates; prices of dairy commodities prices on world and community markets; supply and demand; the value of the product mix; and for some contracts, production costs are taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="81117w0024.htm_para0"><a name="08111812000407">With production in its seasonal trough, farmgate prices are likely to have reached the peak of this cycle. As production increases towards the spring, farmgate prices will fall. How far and fast they will fall will depend on the adjustments needed to the downside of the commodity cycle. Prices for products such as butter and milk powders are currently falling on EU and world markets. The global economic downturn is also likely to have an impact on dairy commodity prices and demand. In time, this will feed through to farmgate prices. However, because of exchange rates and the large liquid milk market in Great Britain, the full effects of the downturn in commodity markets are unlikely to be fed through into farmgate prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="81117w0024.htm_para1"><a name="08111812000408">The exception is Northern Ireland, which is more reliant on the trade in commodity products than the rest of the UK.

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="81117w0024.htm_para2"><a name="08111812000409">Looking to the longer term, prices will recover as demand increases. However, farmgate prices are likely to become more volatile in future as the market is further deregulated.</p>

 The European Court of Justice in its judgment of 15 July 2004 in case C-424/02 found that the UK had failed to take the measures necessary to give priority to the processing of waste oils by regeneration to fulfil the requirement in the Waste Oils Directive (75/439/EEC as amended). However, since that time a revised Waste Framework Directive (WFD) has been developed which repeals the Waste Oils Directive, and includes a revised waste hierarchy. The text of the revised WFD was adopted by the Environment Council of Ministers on 20 October 2008, and following its publication in the <i> Official Journal</i>, the UK and other member states will have two years to transpose its requirements.</p>

 Recent and current research and monitoring studies have identified further losses in both the thickness and extent of Arctic ice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="81117w0025.htm_para1"><a name="08111812000454">Last month, scientists from University College London reported that the thickness of Arctic sea ice was significantly lower (by an average of 10 per cent.) during the winter of 2007-08 than during the previous five winters, indicating that the total volume of sea ice has decreased significantly. Though based only on satellite data (which are not ideal for measuring sea ice thickness), this result confirms previous evidence of decreasing sea ice thickness over the past three decades from U.S. and U.K. submarine sonar measurements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="81117w0025.htm_para2"><a name="08111812000455">Satellite monitoring since 1979 also shows there has been a long-term decline in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and this decline has accelerated over the last decade. The summer minimum in 2008 was slightly greater than the record low in 2007, but was still the second lowest year on record, despite relatively cool temperatures this year. The latest generation of climate models developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre, under its joint DECC and MOD-funded Integrated Climate Programme, appears to capture the recent trend well and indicates that this decline will continue over coming years.</p>

The longer term results show that the total ice mass has decreased over the past few decades and recent observations indicate that the duration and total area of surface melting on the ice sheet was higher during summer 2007 than during any other summer since records began in 1973. This year, there has been significant loss of ice from Petermann and Jakobshavn Isbrae glaciers. Continuing ice sheet loss has major implications for sea levels rise and DECC is working with UK researchers to understand and model ice sheet dynamics better, to improve estimates of where the Greenland ice sheet 'tipping point' might be in relation to global temperature increase.</p>

Until the operation of the full chain of CCS in conjunction with a power station has been proven, it would not be prudent to require new coal plants to be fitted with CCS or to set a date by which this would be required. The urgency for demonstrating the foil chain of CCS is why the UK Government are supporting one of the world&#146;s first commercial-scale demonstration projects.</p>

 On 15 October 2008 the European Commission adopted amendments to EFRS 39 and IFRS 7, with the unanimous support of member states. These amendments ensured that EU companies have the same flexibility as their American competitors to reclassify assets held-for-trading into the held-to-maturity category. The current financial crisis justifies the use of reclassification by companies. In these circumstances, financial institutions in the EU would no longer have to reflect market fluctuation in their financial statements for these kinds of assets. These changes will apply as from the third quarter of 2008.</p>

 Valuation officers are required to maintain accurate rating lists. When they become aware a change is needed, they must make the alteration and also specify the date from which the change should be effective for rates charging purposes.

These forces also operate very closely alongside Afghan Army and police units. Without undertaking a detailed assessment of each engagement, it is not possible precisely to define in every case whether an attack was aimed at UK forces, at our ISAF partners, or against Afghan units. Data are therefore collected on the number of incidents involving ISAF forces in Helmand without attempting to identify the nationality of the forces actually being attacked. The environment also makes it extremely difficult precisely to distinguish between incidents initiated by insurgent forces and those initiated by ISAF.</p>

 The Government's stance on piracy has recently been reviewed.

 On 8 October HM Government made the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008. This requires all persons in the UK (and UK persons elsewhere) to freeze funds owned, held or controlled by Landsbanki, including those owned held or controlled in relation to Landsbanki by certain Icelandic Authorities or the Government of Iceland. The Order was made because the Icelandic Government, its authorities and Landsbanki appeared to be on the brink of action which would be to the detriment of the UK economy, including detrimental treatment of UK depositors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para7"><a name="08111819000067">The effect of the Order is that all funds owned, held or controlled by Landsbanki in the UK are frozen. Landsbanki funds may only be released from frozen accounts in the UK under the authority of a licence granted by HMT. No freezing orders have been made in respect of other Icelandic banks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para8"><a name="08111819000068">The Order was made under a power contained in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. This Act includes a broad range of provisions and is not only about countering terrorism. The power enables the Treasury to make a freezing order where the Treasury reasonably believe that action to the detriment of the UK economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a foreign government or resident of a foreign country or territory. As we have made clear the UK's action was not taken on the basis of the anti-terrorism provisions in the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para10"><a name="08111819000070">The Treasury's approach has been to publish general licences and guidance to deal with industry concerns. A general licence was granted on 9 October. This dealt with the concern of allowing the London branch of Landsbanki to continue its commercial finance operations, on which a number of UK businesses depend for their immediate cash flow. This licence also confirmed a broad range of transactions that were permitted, including that third parties could set-off and net out arrangements where Landsbanki was the counterparty. A further licence was granted on 13 October, to provide reassurance to a wide range of market participants who might otherwise be in a position of dealing with frozen funds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para11"><a name="08111819000071">In response to inquiries received, the Treasury published a series of notices to ensure the scope of the Freezing Order was clear to UK financial institutions. The notice published on 17 October provided detailed guidance and reiterated that other Icelandic banks and companies were not affected by the Freezing Order. It was published on the Treasury's website and was also sent to financial institutions in the UK via the financial sanctions e-mail notification service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para12"><a name="08111819000072">In response to a request from certain financial institutions, the Treasury granted a licence on 7 November in relation to securities settlement through exchanges where there is no central counterparty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="81117w0036.htm_para13"><a name="08111819000073">In addition, the Treasury liaised with the major UK banks to ensure that the freezing order was not preventing payments to Icelandic companies; discussed individual transactions with banks that advised transactions had been blocked because of the Order; and made clear that the Order does not prohibit UK banks from transferring money to Iceland in payment for imports of Icelandic fish (as long as they are not unlicensed &#147;frozen funds&#148;).</p>

 There has been no official confirmation of the number of Tibetans held in detention following the protests in March and April 2008. Unofficial estimates vary considerably&#151;International Campaign for Tibet, for example, gives a figure of 4,000 people detained, of whom 2,000 had been released by 14 April.</p>

We have also stressed the need to differentiate between those who peacefully express their views and those who commit violent crimes. I have spoken to Chinese Foreign Minister Yang on several occasions since the protests emphasising the need to respect human rights. My officials have raised the detentions directly with the Chinese authorities both in Beijing and London.</p>

 Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice advises against all travel to eastern and north eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including North Kivu. British nationals in the affected areas are likely to be working with international aid agencies and UN agencies. These organisations have their own security systems in place for evacuation of staff and take advice from MONUC locally. The British embassy in Kinshasa is able to provide limited consular assistance to British nationals in need of emergency assistance. The embassy also has a diplomat based in Goma who, as part of his role, is able to offer ad hoc consular advice and assistance.</p>

 The majority of &#145;suitable persons&#146; will either be court-appointed deputies, donees of lasting powers of attorneys or friends or relatives who may already be involved in managing and organising the care of the direct payment recipient. It would not be appropriate to vet these people who have been chosen by the person without capacity themselves or the Court of Protection. However, it is up to local authorities to satisfy themselves that identified suitable persons are able to act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity, even where they are not fully vetted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="81117w0048.htm_para29"><a name="08111824000438">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 introduces further safeguards where the &#145;suitable person&#146; is not a friend or family member of the individual whose direct payment they are managing. Where the council engages someone to provide services for that individual, then they become a regulated activity provider. These issues were fully debated during the passage of the Act. In practice, this means that the council must ensure that the individual they engage has undergone a vetting and barring check, as specified in the Act. If the suitable person is a friend or family member, the council will be able to apply for vetting information about potential carers but checks will not be mandatory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="81117w0048.htm_para30"><a name="08111824000439">Guidance recommends that this is a good option currently for Direct Payment recipients and we would envisage that the new guidance would mirror this advice for suitable people. Furthermore, regulation 16 of the draft regulations sets out that the local authority must review the making of the direct payment at certain intervals and under certain circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="81117w0048.htm_para31"><a name="08111824000440">Until the safeguards included in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 are brought into force, safeguards are being provided through Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks. Through a registered body, such as a local authority, a &#145;suitable person&#146; will be able to apply for a CRB disclosure on the person they wish to employ. This facility is currently available to people managing their own direct payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="81117w0048.htm_para32"><a name="08111824000441">In relation to support and information available to the person managing direct payments on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity, the Department will issue guidance after analysing responses to the &#145;Putting People First&#151;Transforming Adult Social Care&#151;Consultation on Direct Payments Regulations&#146; in spring 2009. This guidance will also support suitable persons identified in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and draft Direct Payments regulations made under the provisions in this Act. Furthermore, as part of &#145;Putting People First&#146;, we have encouraged councils to explore different support mechanisms to support people to access Direct Payments.</p>

 It is for each primary care trust to determine locally the funding for their health centre depending on the range of services and staff required. For some, this will also include what percentage of income should be guaranteed to the provider, and for how long. If the income guarantee is set too high it could reduce the risk on the provider who may not be incentivised to provide a high quality service and reduces value for money. If set too low the general practitioner-led health centre provider may not obtain sufficient income in the early period of the contract to deliver a high quality and usable service 8am to 8pm, 365 days a year.</p>

Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

Young people who drink too much not only put their own health at risk, but are more likely to get involved in antisocial behaviour and contribute to insecurity on our streets. The Youth Alcohol Action Plan, published in June, sets out a number of actions to address the problems of young people's alcohol consumption. We will provide clearer health information for parents and young people about how consumption of alcohol, particularly at an early age, can affect children and young people. This will include the chief medical officer's guidelines on safer drinking by young people and a comprehensive communications campaign aimed at 11 to 15 year-olds to be launched in spring 2009.</p>

 Ministers and officials speak to many institutions and organisations about issues that affect individuals' progression to higher education. Progression to higher education for vocational learners is an important element in our drive to capture, enrich and exploit the talents and potential of all learners; and the Lifelong Learning Network programme has been established precisely to focus on progression and widening opportunity for vocational learners, putting them on the same footing as those following more traditional academic pathways.</p>

These networks make an important contribution to a number of the Government's strategic objectives including lifelong learning, credit transfer, articulation arrangements between higher education programmes and the Qualifications and Credit Framework, employer engagement and workplace learning, and progression from the 14-19 diplomas. HEFCE officers, including those from widening participation teams, meet with senior staff from institutions in the north west in the normal course of HEFCE business and progression for vocational learners and widening participation forms part of that dialogue. HEFCE officers were involved in discussions with the Greater Merseyside and West Lancashire LLNs about additional student numbers for 2009-10 and how they should be distributed and targeted in priority areas.</p>

Although the Address Register strategy takes account of other national addressing initiatives it is only being developed for the 2011 Census. Subject to having appropriate data sharing agreements in place, it should provide a one-off quality improvement to each of the main address sources. It is also hoped that the development of processes and delivery partnership models could be used to support the wider agenda for a single National Address Register in the future.</p>

The guidance is extensive but two main stages can be identified when classifying an entity to an institutional sector. The first involves a decision on whether the entity is within the public or private sectors, and the second a decision on whether it is a market or non-market producer.</p>
</ul><a name="81117w0055.htm_brev18"><a name="08111833001210"><ul><p class="tabletext">21. In summary the difference between the public and private sectors is determined by where control lies, rather than by ownership or whether or not the entity is publicly financed. International guidance defines control as the ability to determine general corporate policy. For example, this control can be exercised through the appointment of directors, control of over half of the shareholders voting power, through special legislation or decree, or through regulation.</p>
</ul><a name="81117w0055.htm_brev19"><a name="08111833001211"><ul><p class="tabletext">22. As a result NACC will examine an entity to see whether there are any factors that enable any part of the public sector, either individually or collectively, to determine the general corporate policy of the entity. This includes recognition that government, or other sectors, may also control a unit through contractual arrangements. If this control is established the entity is classified to the public sector.</p>
</ul><a name="81117w0055.htm_brev20"><a name="08111833001212"><ul><p class="tabletext">23. Having decided whether an entity is part of the public or private sectors, the second important aspect for sector classification is to determine whether it is a market or non-market entity. Public sector market entities are classified as public corporations (for example Royal Mail and Manchester Airport Group); public sector non-market entities are classified in the general government sector (for example government departments and the BBC). General government is then sub-divided into sub-sectors, including central government, state government and local government. Private sector market entities are classified as private corporations, and private sector non-market entities are generally classified to a sector known as Non Profit Institutions Serving Households.</p>
