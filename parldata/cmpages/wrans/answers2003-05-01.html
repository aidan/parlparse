<a name="30501w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Michael Foster: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 16 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 606&#150;7W, on average earnings, what assessment he has made of what population base provides reliable New Earnings Survey data for use by the ODPM to calculate area cost adjustment.  [109365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para0">The area cost adjustment is calculated using New Earnings Survey (NES) data. This data contain no information on the size of an areas resident population. Office for National Statistics uses national insurance numbers to select those who participate in the survey.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para1">The NES does contain information on the area in which the survey respondent lives and in which they work. Information on the area in which the survey respondent works is used in the calculation of the area cost adjustment.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para2">The area cost adjustment (ACA) has been calculated for each 1991 county in line with the recommendations of the independent Elliott review of the area cost adjustment. The exception to this rule is that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has further refined the ACA geography around London, by acknowledging fringe and non fringe areas in the counties which surround London, and by separating Greater London into four ACA areas.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister calculates the ACA for county areas because we wish to produce robust ACA factors that are stable over time. For individual authorities the NES sample size can be small and small samples can lead to volatility. In reforming the ACA the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has had to strike a balance between more finely reflecting local labour market pressures, by calculating the ACA for smaller areas, and providing stable and robust ACA factors each year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w01.html_wqn9"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact upon CO2 emissions in 2010 of his revised forecast that car fuel costs will drop by 30 per cent.over the present decade, rather than the 20 per cent. assumption in the original 10 year transport plan.  [110074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In our revised forecasts, fuel costs in 2010 (measured in pence per km driven) are forecast to be only 1 per cent lower than assumed for 2010 in the original 10 Year Plan. This is estimated to increase CO2 by approximately 0.1 MtC in 2010.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para8">It should be noted that the forecast drop in car fuel costs between 2000 and 2010 of 30 per cent., compared with 20 per cent. forecast in the original 10 year Transport Plan has arisen from two main factors. The first is that the actual base year (2000) fuel price was higher than that originally estimated (although this has no direct impact on 2010 costs) and secondly, that the forecast for fuel duty, which takes into account changes since 2000, will be lower. The underlying forecast for car fuel efficiency improvements remains unchanged.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress has been made in meeting targets for the proportion of people with disabilities in senior posts in the Department.  [110529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department for Transport currently has 0.1 per cent. of senior civil servants (SCS) with a disability. Following last year's machinery of government changes, we are yet to revise the former DTLR diversity targets for DfT. However, we are reviewing this, and are working with two other departments on work they are doing on modelling for setting targets for under-represented groups in the senior civil service and below. It is expected that a model will be in place by the summer. In addition to this, we propose to undertake a disability resurvey of all our staff later in the year.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para9">We are engaged in a number of measures and initiatives to help increase the representation of disabled people in more senior posts. The Department advertises open competition vacancies in media targeted at disabled people eg Disability Now, and Ready, Willing and Able as well as other medium. We also operate a guaranteed interview scheme (commonly known as "Two Ticks") whereby all disabled applicants meeting the minimum criteria for advertised posts are guaranteed an interview.
<P>

<a name="30501w01.html_para10">The Department is a corporate sponsor of the Employers Forum on Disability, and has a contract with disability consultants to advise on disability issues including ways in which we might increase the representation of disabled people within the Department.

 Overall armed forces recruitment is holding up well.

This compares with 95 per cent. in FY 2001&#150;02 and 90 per cent. in FY 2000&#150;01.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w02.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what procedures are in place to provide spouses of army personnel with <i>(a)</i> maternity benefit, <i>(b)</i> jobseeker's allowance, <i>(c)</i> disability allowance and <i>(d)</i> advice on how to seek these benefits, when they are living or have been living abroad; and if he will make a statement.  [110389]<P>

<P>
<a name="30501w02.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) issue pamphlet GL26, which gives specific advice on benefits and allowances for Service families moving overseas. Claims are dealt with through the DWP Newcastle office which has a help line; and the availability of the help line is published to Service families. There are also advice leaflets available through British Forces Post Offices overseas. Service welfare organisations will also provide advice to families.
<P>

<a name="30501w02.html_para7">The procedures for claiming benefits are set by the Department of Work and Pensions, and will depend upon the benefit being claimed and the circumstances of the individual. The ability to claim benefits overseas will also depend upon the country being visited. There are specific rules for European Economic Area (EEA) countries and there are also a number of two way social security agreements with other countries.




<P>
<P><I>1 May 2003 : Column 447W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30501w02.html_para8">In the case of maternity allowance, if the individual is going to an EEA country and is a United Kingdom or EEA national and is already in receipt of maternity allowance, they can continue to receive it while abroad. If going to a non-EEA country, they may be able to get maternity allowance if a two-way social security agreement exists covering maternity benefit. In other cases, the Ministry of Defence will make an ex-gratia payment equivalent to maternity allowance for accompanying Servicemen's wives when all the relevant qualifying criteria are met.
<P>

<a name="30501w02.html_para9">Jobseeker's allowance can be claimed when moving to an EEA country if all the criteria are met. However, it is not payable in countries outside the EEA. In some cases, it is possible to use UK national insurance contributions to claim an unemployment benefit in countries that have two-way social security agreements with the UK.
<P>

<a name="30501w02.html_para10">Disability living allowance is normally payable for as long as the applicant can be treated as 'ordinarily resident'' in Great Britain. It is not payable where the family has severed links with Great Britain and has no plans to return, or where a severely disabled child born abroad has not established ordinary residence in Great Britain. In practice, members of most Service families stationed overseas would be treated as ordinarily resident in Great Britain.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what standards have been set for the rapid resolution of benefit claims by Service families; and whether there are complaints procedures available for cases that have resulted in the undue delay of such benefits.  [110391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w02.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has a target to process claims for jobseeker's allowance within 12 days. This applies to all claims, including those made by Service families. If there are delays, DWP will consider complaints and claims for compensation which should, in the first instance, be made to the local DWP office. Complaints can also be made by e-mailing Jobcentre Plus via the website at: jobcentreplus.gov.uk or using the "How Do I Complain?" leaflet available at any Jobcentre Plus Office. Service authorities will provide assistance to Service families as necessary in cases where there is dispute over entitlement to a benefit.

 Since the inception of the European Amphibious Initiative (EAI) at the end of December 2000, progress has been made in determining doctrine, concepts, and procedures&#151;although opportunities to conduct a dedicated EAI exercise have been limited.
<P>

<a name="30501w03.html_para0">Work to date has centred on a structured series of Steering and Working Group meetings between the Naval staffs of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

<a name="30501w03.html_para1">It was planned to use Exercise Destined Glory 02, a NATO amphibious exercise in the Mediterranean, to test the practical implementation of evolving concepts and other work, but the commitment of the Royal Marines to operations in Afghanistan meant that UK participation was greatly reduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The European Security and Defence Identity was initiated within NATO to enable European Allies to make a more coherent and effective contribution to the missions and activities of the Alliance and to respond to European requirements. In addition to its objective to improve European military capabilities, it recognised the European Union's resolve, supported by the United Kingdom Government, to

<P><I>1 May 2003 : Column 449W</I><P>
have a capacity for autonomous action so that it could take decisions and approve military action when the Alliance as whole was not engaged. Our policy is for NATO and the EU to be strategic partners in crisis management and the development of military capabilities. This partnership is underpinned by the recent implementation of the 'Berlin Plus' arrangements through which the EU has assured access to NATO planning capabilities and a presumption of availability of NATO common assets and capabilities. This will ensure that the EU's European Security and Defence Policy continues to develop in a manner that is supportive of, and supported by, NATO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no evidence to suggest that allied weapons caused the damage in the al-Nassar market in the Shula area of Baghdad. The crater in the market place is inconsistent with that normally created by an air-to-ground missile. Moreover the nearest target attacked by coalition aircraft at the time of the explosion was some 8 km away from the market.

<P>
<a name="30501w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear at the Hillsborough summit, our aim is for Iraqis to take charge of the administration and Government of Iraq as soon as possible. The process of establishing a transitional Government, representing all Iraq's ethnic groups, regions and diaspora, began with the National Dialogue Conference on 15 April 2003. It is impossible to know with certainty precisely how long this process will take. We anticipate that coalition forces will remain in Iraq as long as their presence is necessary to help the Iraqi people in the political and economic reconstruction of their country.

 Our Military Campaign Objectives contain a commitment to withdrawal of British military forces from Iraq as soon as is practicable. It is too early at this stage to predict when the appropriate circumstance will arise to allow a full withdrawal. We will maintain an appropriate military presence in Iraq as long as is necessary to enable the conditions within which the Iraqis can get their country running effectively, politically and economically.
<P>

<a name="30501w03.html_para3">We have kept the House fully informed of deployments to the middle east and of subsequent withdrawals of forces from the region. We will continue to keep deployments to the region under review and will keep the House informed of future withdrawals.

 The Ministry of Defence has always been committed to minimising any environmental damage caused by our training activities, an approach which has now been formalised through the Defence Estate Strategy and taken forward through the implementation of ISO 14001, the Environmental Management System.
<P>

<a name="30501w03.html_para4">A wide variety of military training activity is undertaken on Woodbury Common, Dartmoor and Salisbury Plain Training Areas and specific surveys of the environmental impacts of this military training are carried out as part of Departmental management plans.

 There are no mechanisms in place to monitor the payment of national insurance by families of soldiers or other Service families when living abroad.

 The Ministry of Defence is committed to the work/life balance of its civilian staff. A range of flexible working patterns including part-time working, flexible working hours, home working and job share is available to civilian staff by agreement with their management.

<a name="30501w04.html_para0">The number of civilian staff employed part-time has increased steadily during the last five years from 4,055 in April 1998 (4.5 per cent. of total work force excluding trading funds) to 5,323 in March 2003 (7 per cent. of total work force excluding trading funds). There has, however, been no attempt to assess the specific impact of the Part-time Workers Directive on this increase as MOD's policies to ensure equal treatment of part-time workers were largely in place well before the European Directive came into force.

Following a wide-ranging consultation, Postcomm has established its policy on when exceptions might be permitted, and identified where exceptions exist. This document is available on their website at http://www.psc.uov.uk/docuinents/liccnsiiiR. Under this policy, exceptions to the universal service daily delivery can only be allowed in very specific and restricted circumstances.

 The practice of using animal by-products in the production of fertiliser was discussed at a working group meeting in Brussels on 17 March. It was noted that the European Commission intends to lay down further rules on fertilisers, and the TSE Regulation (999/2001) already prohibits the use of Specified Risk Material in the production of fertiliser.

<a name="30501w08.html_para10">The findings of all Government sponsored research into this issue are routinely referred for advice to the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC), the Government's independent advisory committee established to advise Ministers on the safety, quality and efficacy of veterinary medicines. The VPC's latest advice on OP research was on a research letter published in the Lancet on 2 March 2002 describing findings from the Health and Safety Executive funded research project into ill health in sheep dip farmers and polymorphism of paraoxonase (PON1). The research letter concluded that these results "support the hypothesis that organophosphates contribute to the reported ill health of people who dip sheep".
<P>

<a name="30501w08.html_para11">Although the full results of this study are still awaited. The VPC, under guidance from its Medical and Scientific Panel (MSP), has advised that the differences reported from the study were not large and were not, in themselves, sufficient to support the hypothesis that organophosphates contribute to the reported ill health of people who dip sheep. However, the VPC considered that the hypothesis postulated by this study could merit a more robust and better designed study. The VPC considered that once the full findings had been published the authors of the study should be invited to present them to the MSP.

 During the seven year period in question (1995&#150;2002) the total number of samples analysed for pesticide residues totalled around 24,000, of which around 14,000 were of UK origin and 10,000 were imported. Only 26 residues were found of the withdrawn substances listed in the reply of 11 March. 8 samples were of UK origin and 18 were imported. The proportion of samples containing residues of withdrawn substances were therefore 0.06 per cent. UK and 0.18 per cent. imported.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the wild animal poison known as T3327 is species specific; and what assessment <i>(a)</i> she and <i>(b)</i> the Central Science Laboratory has made of the impact of it being consumed by (i) other wild mammals, (ii) escaped domestic mammals and (iii) wild birds.  [108140]<P>

<P>
<a name="30501w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 T3327 is a shorthand code name for a carbamate and as such is not species specific, but is toxic to all animals. The trial site was carefully chosen and fully licensed under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended) and by other relevant bodies (note: see replies to PQs 1608 and 1609). The Advisory Committee on Pesticides, made an assessment of the potential impact of the poison. The Central Science Laboratory, as the holder of the Experimental Permit and data owner, has agreed to copies of the environmental assessments being placed in the

The baits are buried to reduce the chances of being found by domestic livestock and wild birds. A full report of the trial will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will ask the Environment Agency to examine the operation of Crabbe Yard, Wadborough, Worcestershire, for compliance with regulations relating to the disposal of waste.  [109856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been assured that the Environment Agency has visited the site on several occasions this year and is working in cooperation with other organisations to regulate this site and the company operating from it. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that any waste activities are being carried out on the site that would require a waste management licence from the Agency, although the site has registered an exemption from waste management licensing for the storage of road planings. The Agency will continue to monitor the site to ascertain whether activities being carried out come within the scope of Waste Management Licensing.

This is a devolved matter, so figures are shown for England only. The data are available on the Defra website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what trials the Department is engaged in with the Central Science Laboratory; and whether such trials relating to wild mammals involve the use of <i>(a)</i> repellants, <i>(b)</i> electric fencing and <i>(c)</i> condition taste aversion.  [108141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has commissioned the Central Science Laboratory to carry out a range of studies of wild mammals and birds with the aim of developing effective, humane and environmentally sensitive approaches to wildlife management. Ongoing work with wild mammals includes the potential use of repellents and conditioned taste aversion as non-lethal means of resolving conflicts between wildlife and other interests. There are no current trials on electric fencing although previous studies have developed effective methods to manage some problems posed by rabbits, foxes and badgers. Advisory leaflets on these methods are available from the National Wildlife Management Team of Defra's Rural Development Service <i>www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/leaflets.htm.</i>

<P>

<a name="30501w10.html_para1">While the Government cannot see a case for extending the use of public money to directly fund their wcrk, it has policies in place to increase the value of these gifts by generous tax concessions, thereby supporting the work of all charities without compromising their independence.
<P>

<a name="30501w10.html_para2">As part of the Government's policy to encourage more people to give to charity, the tax incentives for charitable giving were improved from 6 April 2000. There are now no limits on the amounts that individuals can give through the Gift Aid and Payroll Giving Schemes. In addition, for the first time, there is a new income tax relief for gifts to charity of listed shares and securities. Businesses can also get tax relief when they donate money, stock or equipment to charities in general.

Part of this study is to track 300 teachers over three years measuring their effectiveness by pupil outcome measures and other qualitative techniques. "Sixth annual survey of parents of three and four year old children and their use of early years services" is part of a programme of annual surveys of parents of three and four-year-old children which has been undertaken to measure patterns of participation in early years education and child care.

<P>
<a name="30501w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government are not requiring that schools continue in the same way those activities previously supported through the Standards Fund. The purpose of reducing the proportion of funding provided through ring-fenced grants is to give schools greater control of their resources. It will be for schools to decide how best take forward action in areas previously supported through these grants, taking account of local priorities.
<P>

<a name="30501w13.html_para4">This year's increased funding for education of over &#163;2.6 billion, 11.6 per cent. extra, is more than &#163;250 million greater than the pressures due to pay, pensions, inflation and ending specific grants in order to reduce the proportion of ring-fenced funding, giving schools greater control of their resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment has been made of the change in cost to maintained schools in <i>(a)</i> the East Riding of Yorkshire and <i>(b)</i> England resulting from (i) changes in pension funds, (ii) national insurance contribution increases and (iii) the shortening of the teachers' pay spine; and what financial provision will be made to compensate for shortfall.  [108287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30501w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information on the distribution of teaching salaries by local education authority or school. It is therefore not possible for us to calculate the additional cost of the national insurance contribution or the shortening of the teachers' pay spine for each local education authority. It will not be possible to calculate the additional cost of the increase in employers' contributions to the Teachers' Pension Scheme for each local education authority for 2003&#150;04 until we have analysed the contributions data for March and April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30501w13.html_para5">In 2003&#150;04, the national increase in funding is sufficient to cover all the pressures that authorities face. The increase in Education Formula Spending (EPS)&#151;the base funding for schools and LEAs that forms a part of local government funding system&#151;and School Standards Grant&#151;additional base funding that goes directly to every school&#151;is a 11.6 per cent. cash increase over 2002&#150;03. This includes a baseline adjustment to the Education Formula Spending total of &#163;586 million to cover the pre-16 costs of the 4.75 per cent. increase in employers' contribution that arises from the inclusion of pensions increase on the scheme. Further transfers have

<a name="30501w13.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID's target for 2002&#150;03 in respect of the proportion of people with disabilities in the Senior Civil Service was 1.7 per cent. That target has been met. Our target for 2004&#150;05 is 3.3 per cent. We are increasingly advertising senior posts outside the Department and we use the disability media where possible. Adverts carry a statement encouraging applications from under-represented groups, including people with disabilities. We also provide financial support for a bursary scheme for Civil Servants run by the Cabinet Office, that aims to improve the representation of people with disabilities in the Senior Civil Service.

We will use these measures of effectiveness to assess our future contributions.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment her Department has made of Kenya's progress towards meeting World bank and IMF targets for reform and policy changes on corruption, reform of the judicial and legal system and macro-economic framework; and what time-frame she expects for increases in financial assistance through <i>(a)</i> the IMF, <i>(b)</i> the World bank and <i>(c)</i> her Department.

 The new Kenyan Government have made a good start in developing their policies to tackle corruption, reform the legal sector, stimulate economic growth and improve basic services. Tough decisions are needed to implement them. Provided these are taken, I would expect to see increased financial assistance from both the IMF and World bank within the next few months. My Department has already responded to the new opportunities for poverty reduction in Kenya by providing an additional &#163;10 million to support the implementation of universal primary education. This brought total DFID spending in Kenya to over &#163;40 million in 2002&#150;03.

People with asthma will benefit from the emerging expert patients programme which will via the NHS&#151;provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. We have now commenced on a fourth wave pilot phase for the remaining selected primary care trusts (PCTs), with activity taking place on a generic basis. The previous pilots have been well received by the course participants.It is the role of health authorities, in partnership with PCTs, to decide what services to provide for their populations including those with asthma. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them. 



We have welcomed guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on inhalers for children under five in September 2000 and for older children, aged five to 15, on April 11 2002. The NICE recommendations provide clear evidence based on guidance on the most suitable inhalers for children.<P>

<a name="30501w18.html_para6">The Government considers the provision of first class health services for asthma sufferers as very important and is involved in a broad spectrum of research and development work into the disease. The principal body providing Government funding in the scientific area is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC receives its grant-in-aid from the Department of Trade and Industry and it spends around 2 million a year on asthma research. In addition to this, a major joint initiative is being funded by the Department of Health, the Department for the Environment, Transport and Regions and the MRC into air pollution and respiratory disease.
<P>

<a name="30501w18.html_para7">A new general medical services contract agreement was launched on Friday 21 February 2003, which, if accepted by the profession, will lead to an unprecedented level of new investment in general practice to deliver a wider range of high quality services with better clinical outcomes for all patients.

<a name="30501w18.html_para8">The Department of Health and the Royal College of General Practitioners, under the supervision of a national development group of key stakeholders, have produced a framework for implementing a scheme for GPs with special interests and clinical guidelines for GPs with special interests in specific specialities, including respiratory medicine. Whilst this document focuses on GPs with special interests, it is recognised that specialist nurses already play a major role in the management of respiratory conditions, and much of the GP role could equally apply to an appropriately qualified specialist nurse. It is likely that the core activities of a GP with special interests will vary according to local need and resources, but are likely to focus on asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease.

<a name="30501w18.html_para9">The national service framework (NSF) for children is being developed to set standards for the care of children and young people to ensure all children and young people have access to good quality care. Whilst it is not the intention to look at specific conditions in the NSF, it has been agreed that asthma, as one of the most common childhood conditions, should be used as one of the exemplars which will accompany the main NSF report. These will illustrate how the standards should be applied to ensure that services delivered to children are effective and meet their needs.

 We have made no such assessments, but the decision was taken to restrict the availability of treatments for erectile dysfunction on the national health service because of the high potential costs of providing these treatments and the consequent risk that resources might be diverted from other services such as cancer. Following a public consultation exercise undertaken in 2001 we estimated that the cost of removing the restrictions might be in the order of an additional &#163;100 million a year.

 The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC spent an estimated &#163;8.9 million on research into diabetes in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="30501w19.html_para3">The Department and the MRC worked together with Diabetes UK and the Wellcome Trust on the Review of Current and Future Research on Diabetes, published in October 2002. The review was intended to inform the development of future research into diabetes sponsored by the Department and the MRC, and to be of use to other agencies funding research. A Department led task group with participation from the MRC, Diabetes UK and others has been established to determine how best to take forward the proposals in the review. A copy of the review is available in the Library.

<a name="30501w19.html_para4">The Department also funds some direct costs of diabetes research through a variety of programmes.

The amount of such service support funding for diabetes research is being established and will be reported on at a later date. The scale of this funding, however, can be judged from the NHS national research register which gives details of over 1,600 diabetes research studies undertaken in NHS hospital trusts which receive service support.

 We have provided new powers under the Police Reform Act 2002 to supplement the offences in the Road Traffic Act 1988. As from January 2003, where a vehicle committing one of the Road Traffic Act offences is being driven in such a way that it is causing or is likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public, a constable in uniform is empowered to stop and seize it. He will be able to enter premises other than a private dwelling to effect the seizure. The owner will be able to retrieve the vehicle on payment of removal and storage charges. Detailed arrangements have been made by regulation to ensure that the owner is not required to pay when the vehicle was used without his consent.
<P>

<a name="30501w22.html_para11">The new powers will enable the police to deal with vehicles being used illegally off road more effectively by putting an immediate stop to such anti-social behaviour. Their use is currently being developed by the police and will be monitored to ensure it is effective.

 As part of the initial screening process asylum-seekers are required to provide proof of residence at a particular address. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) maintains databases containing the information supplied, which is also recorded in the individual Home Office file. All applicants, and their representatives, are told of their obligation to notify the Home Office of any subsequent change of address. For those subject to a reporting regime, their place of residence is verified during the reporting event.
<P>

<a name="30501w22.html_para18">The Immigration Service has eight designated reporting centres to assist in managing reporting regimes and, in addition, a person may be required to report to a police station near their address.

<a name="30501w24.html_para2">Prison Service Order 3550, issued on 20 December 2000, introduced a new Prison Service Standard for Clinical Services for Substance Misusers. This concerns the effective clinical management of the substance misuse treatment service provided by staff working in prisons. It is designed to ensure that good quality clinical substance misuse services are available in all local prisons and remand centres to a level that is at least comparable with those in the community.
<P>

<a name="30501w24.html_para3">The standard requires, among other things, all prisons which receive prisoners from court to have detoxification guidelines in place for at least one of Methadone, Lofexidine, and Dihydrocodeine. It also stipulates that, as new evidence becomes available on the chemical management of detoxification or abstinence, establishments should develop further treatment guidelines which are in line with those available in the national health service (NHS).
<P>

<a name="30501w24.html_para4">My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Jacqui Smith) has already agreed to place a copy of the standard in the Library in response to a request from the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden).

In addition, the contracts for two new PFI prisons at Ashford, Middlesex and at Peterborough have been signed and construction work is under way.
<P>

<a name="30501w24.html_para8">In all cases, there was no up-to-date publicly procured prison and the public service comparator was therefore estimated, being derived from past experience in terms of public sector capital expenditure in constructing and refurbishing a prison and to cover the cost of operating prison. Estimates took account of the different requirements of each prison. The public sector comparators are shown in the following table.

 Responsibility for the provision of grants to support prison visitors' centres was devolved to prison Governors on 1 April 1994. It is a matter for individual Governors to decide the level of funding to be allocated to their visitors' centre, as they are best placed to assess the facilities required locally. Information on funding to centres by individual prisons is not collated centrally.

 There are a growing number of visitors' centres. We acknowledge their potential in assisting the delivery of our aims and aim to provide such a centre at each prison. However, the considerable financial and other resources needed to run visitors' centres effectively, and the many competing priorities within the Prison Service, have prevented some establishments from making as much progress as we would like. All newly-built and contracted-out establishments are required to have a visitors' centre under the terms of their contract.

 There are no plans to put in place a separate national strategy for elderly prisoners that specifies regime requirements. The Prison Service aims to assess individual prisoner's needs through sentence planning. This takes account of the requirement for appropriate, accommodation, health care, regimes and resettlement support for all prisoners.
