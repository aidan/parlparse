 Seasonal fluctuations were not taken into account when calculating the annual run-rate of firms, which predict the number of matter starts that might potentially be required by each provider to year end. However, any provider who had their allocation of matter starts reduced following the review can request a review by the Legal Services Commission and present evidence in support of a request to reinstate matter starts, including data regarding seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations vary greatly from firm to firm and among categories of law and therefore it is not possible to apply a standard formula to take these into account.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) fully recognises the benefits of using the specialist skills of probation staff in appropriate posts. Where there is a business need for a particular post to be filled by someone with a probation service employment background, NOMS headquarters groups may second or advertise externally, in line with NOMS and civil service recruitment policy.</p>

In addition, NOMS is developing a facility for vacant posts, where appropriate, to be simultaneously advertised internally to Ministry of Justice employees, and as secondment opportunities to probation service employees.</p>

Offenders in custody are subject to drug testing and usually receive a range of interventions and support aimed at reducing reoffending. It is practically difficult to pinpoint the precise effect of any one of these interventions on overall drug misuse or reoffending. Evaluations to date specifically of prison drug treatment programmes run in England and Wales are limited and have not always met the highest methodological standards. However, they suggest that accredited programmes can reduce reoffending (Ramsay, M. (ed) (2003), Prisoners' Drug Use and Treatment: Seven Research Studies. Home Office Research Study 267. London: Home Office). International evidence supports these findings.</p>

 The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation contains strong provisions to minimise the amount of animal testing by EU-based companies when compiling their substance registration dossiers. These require that animal tests be the last resort, with the use of non-animal test methods instead wherever possible, and prohibit the repetition and duplication of animal tests. REACH also requires that when preparing registration dossiers, data derived from animal tests must be shared between all members of a Substance Information Exchange Forum (SIEF) in order to achieve this. Where further tests are necessary to complete registrations for substances on the market in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per year, then proposals must be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for approval before any such tests are undertaken, so pre-emptive testing would be illegal. Part of this approval process involves a 45-day public consultation on the test proposals, so that third parties have the opportunity to provide information on the substance that would render the proposed animal tests unnecessary.</p>

Companies should actively look for alternatives to animal testing wherever possible, and refer to the REACH Test Methods Regulation for what is available for use. Other internationally-valid non-animal test methods that do not appear in the Test Methods Regulation may also be used. However, where animal tests are the last resort, then companies should use the most refined method possible to reduce the numbers of animals involved.</p>

 DEFRA has a long-term commitment to reduce its carbon emissions. Performance in 2008-09 shows that DEFRA's carbon emissions from offices has reduced by 18 per cent. on the 1999-2000 baseline, exceeding the 2010 Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) target by 6 per cent. Since 2006-07 the Department has delivered a reduction of 4 per cent. carbon emissions (year on year) from its estate through its Carbon Reduction Programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"><a name="100127w0003.htm_para10"><a name="10012763000871">DEFRA's achievements have been recognised through the award of the Carbon Trust Standard in May 2008, where the Department was one of the first 12 pathfinder organisations to receive the award. This built upon the earlier success of the Department achieving Energy Efficiency Accreditation Scheme (EEAS) status in July 2007. Both of these awards clearly demonstrate that DEFRA has an ongoing commitment to long-term, year on year carbon emissions reductions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="100127w0003.htm_para11"><a name="10012763000872">The Department is expecting to continue to deliver significant year on year savings, anticipated at as much as 6 per cent. year on year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="100127w0003.htm_para12"><a name="10012763000873">A strategic long-term investment plan allows the delivery of projects which provide long-term benefits through reducing energy demand and minimising the need to reinvest in the short to medium term. To disrupt these long-term plans in order to achieve 10:10 would impact negatively on DEFRA's ability to achieve its long-term goals and would not deliver value for money. However, the combination of DEFRA's long-term plans, a minimum 6 per cent. reduction in 2010 and a short- term call to action all constitute a credible contribution to tackling climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="100127w0003.htm_para13"><a name="10012763000874">In light of the above, achieving a 10 per cent. saving across the DEFRA Estate in a single year would require my Department to divert significant funds from its long-term delivery plan; therefore The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its Executive Agencies have not signed up to the 10:10 campaign.</p>

 There are various measures which create duties to address contamination, depending on the circumstances of the case. Contaminated land legislation (Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) makes persons liable for the cost of remediating a site if they caused or knowingly permitted it to become contaminated land. This allows direct action to be taken by regulators, and it creates an incentive for operators to avoid causing contamination in the first place, and to clean it up voluntarily if it occurs. For contamination caused after 1 March 2009, the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 would also be applicable in similar circumstances and to achieve similar objectives to Part 2A of the 1990 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="100127w0004.htm_para7"><a name="10012763001021">Legislation also directly applies to prevent contamination during the operation of a petrol station. Under the Groundwater Regulations 2009 there is a code of practice to prevent hazardous substances from reaching groundwater from underground tanks, such as those at petrol stations. The Environment Agency can serve a notice on the operator if it is likely that the code of practice is not being complied with. The Agency also has powers under the Anti-pollution Works Notices Regulations 1999 to serve notices where there is a threat of pollution to controlled waters or to require clean up where pollution of controlled waters has occurred.</p>

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 6 May 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 16WS, as part of work to consider the optimal base-porting arrangements for the less complex variants of the Future Surface Combatant (FSC), the Department would examine whether there is any case to change the base-porting of the Type 23 frigates. Under the Maritime Change Programme, key stakeholders, including representatives from Portsmouth and Plymouth city councils as well as naval base staff, are supporting Warwick university in developing a shared socio-economic model, which will help to greater understand the implications of any potential future change to warship base-porting arrangements at Portsmouth and Devonport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_506"><a name="100127w0008.htm_para2"><a name="10012763001784">The contiguous impact of three principal scenarios is to be initially investigated: the move of Trafalgar Class submarines from HM Naval Base Devonport to HM Naval Base Clyde; the decommissioning of Type 22 Frigates and any potential change to the current Type 23 base-porting arrangements. We aim to have this model ready in spring 2010 to help inform debate and decision making. The impact of any proposed base-porting changes across the Defence Lines of Development, including accommodation, support, personnel and infrastructure, will be also assessed during the decision making process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_507"><a name="100127w0008.htm_para3"><a name="10012763001785">Currently, no date has been agreed by when an announcement on any potential Type 23 base-porting arrangements will be made. As part of any future announcement, we will be able to confirm that there will be no base porting changes for around five years as we are committed to providing sufficient notice for Royal Navy personnel and their families and the wider community to plan for the future.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 January 2010]:</i> The Major Projects Report 2009 reported delays to the Astute Class Programme which will lead to cost growth and reduction in planned submarine availability. Of the seven planned Astute Class submarines the first four boats have been ordered. Boat 1 (Astute) is currently undergoing an extensive programme of Sea Trials while Boats 2 to 4 (Ambush, Artful and Audacious) are in various stages of construction. Orders for long lead items for Boat 5 and the reactor core for Boat 6 have also been placed.</p>

The competition was cancelled in March 2009 and subsequent work to review the procurement strategy concluded that a more open approach, considering a range of possible solutions, is more likely to secure best value for money. A new international competition for the Tanker element of MARS is therefore under way and Pre-Qualification Questionnaires from a number of companies/consortia are currently being evaluated. This work is nearing completion and, once internal MOD approval to proceed to the next stage of the competition has been granted, invitations to submit outline proposals will be issued. This is expected to be during spring 2010. On current plans the contract is due to be awarded in 2012.</p>

 The available information is given in the table. The offence groups used are those in place at the time the data were published. The offence of indecent exposure was included in the 'Other' offences rather than, as now, in the sexual offences group . There have also been changes with respect to two other rarer offences (bigamy and concealing an infant death close to birth). Figures are given for the old offence group of 'Theft and handling stolen goods' which is now split into 'Offences against vehicles' and 'Other theft'.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="100127w0015.htm_para5"><a name="10012763003058">In making such assessments, the chief officers follow guidelines including, Home Office circular 5/2005, "Criminal Records Bureau: Local Checks by Police Forces for the Purpose of Enhanced checks", and this has been augmented by a process known as the Quality Assurance Framework. The circular makes clear that consideration has been given to a person's right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related conditions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis. These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
Secondary diagnosis<br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of episodes to y</i><i> ears</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

The Department has provided a range of support for implementing personalised care plans, including: publishing guidance for NHS commissioners on what care planning and self-care is (January 2009); support for NHS work force, through publishing an information booklet (April 2009); and publication of a Primary Care Service Specification (November 2009) to support commissioning from primary care providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="100127w0021.htm_para6"><a name="10012776001153">The Department is currently preparing good practice guidelines for children and adults with asthma that will reinforce the value of personal asthma action plans and continue to encourage clinicians to ensure that every patient has one tailored to their needs. This is entirely consistent with the recommendation that all patients with long-term conditions should have a personalised care plan by the end of 2010.</p>

 Every year people of all ages, including those with asthma, are eligible for vaccination against seasonal influenza, and can have this at their general practitioner's (GP's) surgery. This year all people with asthma should also have been contacted by their GP's surgery in order to receive a vaccination against swine influenza. This measure was introduced to ensure that people with asthma were protected from influenza of both kinds.</p>

1. The programme budgeting data collection is complex, therefore expenditure figures are best estimates rather than precise measurements. Year on year comparisons are not straightforward due to annual refinements to the data collection methodology and changes to underlying data sources.<br>
2. Subcategory level data were collected for the first time in 2006-07 and tend to be less robust than main category data as they are smaller categories and are therefore subject to greater variation.<br>
3. Figures include expenditure across all sectors. Disease specific expenditure do not include expenditure on prevention or general practitioner expenditure.<br>

 Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England.

Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

The remuneration arrangements for dentists working within the practice, either as the main contract holder or as partners, associates or employees of the practice owner, are an internal matter for the practice.</p>

</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev5"><a name="10012776003549"><ul><p class="tabletext">In July last year, the Charity Commission published public benefit assessments of twelve charities, which included five charitable fee-charging schools. We conducted these assessments on a co-operative basis with the charities concerned. In the case of the schools, we worked with two that had volunteered to be assessed and with three that agreed to be assessed after we had approached them.</p>

</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev7"><a name="10012776003551"><ul><p class="tabletext">changed the definition of charity by removing the presumption that certain categories of charity, including those which advance education, are for the public benefit. The revised definition means that all charities have to show that they have purposes which are for the public benefit; and</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev8"><a name="10012776003552"><ul><p class="tabletext">gave the Charity Commission, as the independent regulator of charities, a statutory objective to promote awareness and understanding of the operation of the public benefit requirement.</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev9"><a name="10012776003553"><ul><p class="tabletext">These public benefit assessments are part of our work in furtherance of this statutory objective. We explain our policy on carrying out these assessments in section H of Charities and Public Benefit which, following extensive consultation, we published in January 2008. It is guidance to which all charities must have regard and which sets out the approach and factors we take in all those cases where we are looking at the public benefit of an organisation. In summary, we said that:</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev10"><a name="10012776003554"><ul><p class="tabletext">in order to provide clear information about how the public benefit requirement is met by different groups of charities, we will issue guidance about what public benefit means for different types of charity and that such guidance would include pilot assessments of the public benefit of individual charities in different sub-sectors; and</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev11"><a name="10012776003555"><ul><p class="tabletext">we were likely to carry out detailed public benefit assessments on charities most affected by the removal of the presumption of public benefit and about which public benefit concerns were raised during the debate on the Charities Bill, such as fee-charging charities.</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev12"><a name="10012776003556"><ul><p class="tabletext">These first assessments have provided practical examples on the application of the public benefit principles and guidance which should help other school charities to meet the requirement themselves. We think that, at this stage, these are sufficient for schools and we have not included schools in the second round of public benefit assessments which we started in December. Public benefit will, however, continue to be an essential element of our separate, reactive casework with charities (including schools) which we would not routinely publicise. In these cases we will explore public benefit in more detail only where:</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev13"><a name="10012776003557"><ul><p class="tabletext">it is necessary to do so (because, for example, we must be satisfied that the revised aims of a charity will continue to be charitable before agreeing to a change of purpose), and</p>
</ul><a name="100127w0027.htm_brev14"><a name="10012776003558"><ul><p class="tabletext">there is a high risk that public benefit will be difficult to demonstrate-examples of high risk factors include private benefits, novel or controversial purposes, narrowly defined beneficiary classes and high fees.</p>

<a name="100127w0027.htm_brev15"><a name="10012776003559"><ul><p class="tabletext">In terms of the statutory provisions governing these assessments, the Commission has power, both at common law and under the Charities Act 1993, to do anything which may fairly be regarded as necessary, conducive or incidental to carrying out its statutory objectives and functions. Section 1D of the Charities Act 1993 (as inserted by the Charities Act 2006) requires us (so far as is necessary) to have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice in the performance of our functions. I should also mention, for the sake of completeness only, that we have formal inquiry and protection powers under section 8 and 18 of the Charities Act 1993: we have not used these powers in relation to charitable schools and public benefit and would only do so where serious misconduct or mismanagement is involved or where it is necessary to protect charity assets.</p>

The Tenth Revision (ICD-10) has been used since 2001. In the Ninth Revision of the ICD (ICD-9) there are no specific codes that would allow deaths mentioning Clostridium difficile to be easily identified. Figures for 1998 and 2000 are therefore not available as ICD-9 was used in these years. Deaths registered in 1999 were coded to both ICD-9 and ICD-10 as part of a special study to compare the two ICD revisions, and have therefore been used to give an additional year of data on deaths involving Clostridium difficle.<br>

These estimates are given in table 2. Please note that these figures are not comparable with those in table 1, as they are for a different age group and a different time period.</p>

For example, a CI of +/-4.2 percentage points (pp) means that the true value is between 4.2pp above the estimate and 4.2pp below the estimate.</p>
