<sup>(1)</sup> For the years 1999&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2003 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

I42.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Figures for new awards for chronic fatigue syndromes, including ME/post viral medical conditions, are taken from a 5 per cent. sample for year ended 31 May 2004. Figures are in thousands rounded to the nearest 100.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. From November 2002, the methodology for producing the figures for all claims was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

2. Claims received in one year are not necessarily cleared in the same year.<br>

3. The number of claims reconsidered include applicants who received an award at a lower rate and/or for a shorter duration.<br>

4. The figure for appeals received at the Appeals Service cannot be broken down by appeals without prior reconsideration and those that were received after reconsideration.<br>

5. Medical conditions are not recorded on the MIS system and only a total figure can be provided.<br>

definitions of &quot;employer insolvency&quot;, including the dates of any insolvency events and their timing in relation to the scheme wind up date, remain under consideration.

 Campaign medals, such as the General Service Medal, are made from silver. War medals, such as the Iraq Medal, have, since the Second World War, been made from cupronickel. There are no plans to revert to the practice of striking war medals in silver. The additional cost of striking a war medal in silver would depend on the market rate for silver bullion and the number of medals issued. The current difference in unit cost is approximately &#163;10. The current unit cost of making a campaign medal in silver is &#163;23.31 plus VAT plus bullion (which varies in price but at present is &#163;5.92 per unit). The current unit cost of making a war medal in cupronickel is &#163;19.93 plus VAT. While the silver medal is clearly a superior product, the quality of the cupronickel medal is considered acceptable and no justification is seen for a 17 per cent. cost increase, especially given the large number of war medals made.

<a name="41209w14.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_101">In the summer the Government asked Ofcom to undertake a review of the regulation of premium rate services (prs), the abuse of which has led to some consumers falling victim to dial-up internet scams. The report has been published today and contains a set of recommendations to reduce the scope for consumer harm. The recommendations will, when implemented, tighten up the regulatory regime giving the regulator, ICSTIS, more powers to act more quickly against those abusing the prs payment mechanism. They will improve the likelihood of consumers being able to get their money back where they are the subject of a prs fraud. They will also ensure that consumers are better informed of how to avoid being the victim of prs fraud. The review recommendations include:
</p>


<p>
<a name="41209w14.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_102">Telecoms network providers should not make payments to service providers offering prs for at least 30 days. This will give the regulator ICSTIS sufficient time to assess complaints and fraudulent activity. These payments should also be frozen during any additional investigation that is necessary and if necessary for a further three monthhs after an investigation is complete to fund any customer refunds that ICSTIS concludes are appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41209w14.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_103">The ICSTIS Code should require network providers to better support ICSTIS by providing detailed information on the identity of those companies offering prs, by taking all reasonable steps to ensure that information is accurate and by providing ICSTIS with call traffic and revenues data when complaints have been received. All this information will make it easier for ICSTIS to identify and act against those that abuse prs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41209w14.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_104">The ICSTIS Code should require companies offering prs to have effective customer service and refund policies in place. Telecoms providers should be required to make practical information on prs available to their customers, including information on how to bar prs calls and how to protect themselves when using internet dialler services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41209w14.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_105">The Department, Ofcom and ICSTIS will now form a Steering Committee to oversee the implementation of these recommendations as soon as possible. However the implementation process will take some months to complete as a number of the recommendations will require changes to both the ICSTIS Code and to the Ofcom general conditions of entitlement both of which require full public consultation. There is also a requirement for an EU consultation on changes to the ICSTIS Code which we plan to carry out in parallel with the domestic consultation processes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41209w14.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_106">Until the recommendations can be implemented the emphasis should be on ICSTIS continuing to use the powers that it has to take enforcement action against those that abuse the prs charging mechanism and on raising consumer awareness of how they can best protect themselves from prs fraud.

 DVLA is required to examine original documents when it receives an application for a first photocard driving licence.

Where this is not possible DVLA reserves the right to call for sufficient documentation to establish a link across any, and all, change(s) of name which might have occurred.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="41209w20.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 Under the initial agreement of December 1966 between the UK and the US on the use of BIOT, the whole Territory is to remain available for the defence needs of the two countries for an initial period of 50 years from 1966, and thereafter for a further period of 20 years unless either party has given prior notice to terminate it. The question of renewal therefore does not arise at the present time.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s (FCO) policy is that officials are permitted to use official telephones for minimal personal use, and we trust our staff not to abuse that, and local management to ensure it is not abused. The costs of private use of FCO telephone systems can be recovered from staff, but actual recovery of costs is a local management decision based on cost effectiveness. No central records are kept of such recoveries across the FCO and its missions abroad. In many parts of the World, use of the official FCO Telecommunications Network is the only reliable way in which FCO staff can keep in touch with relatives and friends.

 In response to the deteriorating security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in mid-2004, the Security Council met to consider how MONUC&#039;s effectiveness could be improved. On 1 October 2004 the Security Council passed a revised mandate for MONUC under Security Council resolution 1565. This authorised an additional 5,900 military and civilian personnel, as well as necessary specialist force enablers. We expect the deployment of additional personnel to improve MONUC&#039;s effectiveness, first with the deployment of two new battalions in December 2004 and then with the deployment of a Brigade force to the troubled eastern region by March 2005. We continue to take an active part in Security Council discussions to ensure best use of resources and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1565.

 The UK and other Security Council members urged the UN to make a quick response to allegations of sexual exploitation by MONUC personnel. The UN initiated an investigation into the allegations and called for troop contributing countries to ensure that the UN&#039;s investigations are followed up by appropriate disciplinary action. In UN Security Council resolution 1565, adopted on 1 October 2004, the Security Council voiced its concern at the allegations. It asked the Secretary-General to continue to investigate the allegations and for the UN and troop contributing countries to take appropriate disciplinary action in cases of misconduct. The Security-Council also encouraged MONUC to conduct training for its personnel, aimed at ensuring their full compliance with MONUC&#039;s code of conduct on sexual impropriety.

<a name="stpa_333">There has been considerable progress since the establishment of the mission&#151;particularly with recent troop deployments.

As of 8 November 2004, 4,493 military personnel and 978 civilian police were deployed. This is over half the maximum authorised strength of 6,700 military personnel and 1,622 civilian police. However more progress needs to be made and we are taking steps to support this. Most recently, we were active in ensuring the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1576 (29 November 2004) which urged troop and police-contributing countries to abide by the deployment schedules agreed, and noted the particular need for more French-speaking officers.

The Government place great importance on ensuring the placement of qualified and trained personnel in the UN Mission in Haiti. In September 2004, representatives of the Metropolitan Police Service provided training assistance to police officers from China for their deployment in Haiti. The trainers focused specifically on understanding and practical application of the Rules of Engagement to ensure that the Chinese contingent would have the requisite skills for effective work on the ground. Ninety-five Chinese riot police were deployed on 17 October, representing their first ever police deployment abroad.

 Encouraging India and Pakistan to work towards a durable settlement of all their outstanding issues, including Kashmir, remains a key priority for the UK. As a close friend of both countries, the UK warmly welcomes the ongoing detente between India and Pakistan, and applauds the countries&#039; shared commitment to a second round of formal composite dialogue talks, which began at the end of November. The UK has regular contact with senior Indians and Pakistanis. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary met the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, in London on 20 September.

Failed asylum seeking families subject to the provision will be given three written warnings that their support may be terminated if they fail without reasonable excuse to take reasonable steps to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily, or place themselves in a position in which they can leave the United Kingdom voluntarily. They also have the opportunity to attend an interview. This process takes a number of weeks before a decision is made on whether support should be withdrawn.

 In June 2003 the European Commission published a Communication (COM(2003)315 final) &quot;Towards more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems&quot;. That discussion document examined possible policy objectives and approaches for reformed asylum systems, having regard to concerns expressed by the UK about the deficiencies of the international protection system for refugees. The Thessaloniki European Council in June, 2003 took note of the Communication and invited the Commission to present a further report, by June 2004, suggesting measures to ensure more orderly and managed entry in the EU of persons in need of international protection and to enhance the protection capacity in the regions of origin.

This contains two main recommendations. Firstly, the Commission advocates the development&#151;in close co-operation with UNHCR and in partnership with the third countries concerned&#151;of &quot;flexible and situation specific EU Regional Protection Programmes&quot;, designed to address protection issues in third countries in the regions of origin. Secondly, the Commission proposes the development of a EU Resettlement Scheme. This would enable member states who wished to, to join forces in

These discussions showed widespread support for Regional Protection Programmes among member states although an EU Resettlement Scheme is unlikely to be acceptable to some. The UK welcomed the Commission&#039;s Communication and supported the broad purpose of its proposals, while making it clear that national Governments of participating member states must retain final control of the numbers and origins of any refugees accepted in their territory.

 British citizenship is acquired automatically, at birth, by a person born in the United Kingdom if either his mother or (providing the child is legitimate) his father was at the time of the birth either a British citizen or settled in the United Kingdom. Where, owing to illegitimacy, British citizenship is not acquired automatically it may be acquired subsequent to birth by registration on application to the Secretary of State. Such registration is discretionary, but the current policy is to grant it where the father is a British citizen, there is satisfactory evidence of paternity and both parents consent. Section 9 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 will remove the distinction in British nationality law between legitimate and illegitimate children but will not take effect until regulations concerning proof of paternity are in place.

 Since the start of the academic year, as of 31 October 2004, 544 young people in the Barnet local authority area have received payments under the national EMA scheme. The number is increasing at a steady rate and we expect it to continue to do so. In 2004/05 across England we expect the number of 16 to 18-year-olds participating in education to increase by 35,000 (3.8 percentage points) as a direct result of EMA. By 2006/07, when EMA is available to all eligible 16 to 18-year-olds, an additional 72,000 young people will be in further education. If the same participation increase

The Department for Education and Skills has responsibility for implementing directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training. UK regulations which give effect to directive 92/51/EEC, were drafted and came into force on 1 January 2003 (S.I. 2002/2934). These regulations consolidated and re-enacted previous implementing UK regulations and made some amendments. The regulations apply to all professions which are regulated by law or public authority. They provide for a scheme for the recognition of qualifications of migrants from member states of the European Community (or from Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein or Switzerland) seeking to take up or pursue a profession which is regulated in the UK.

<a name="41209w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_434">The cost of implementation to businesses takes the form of administrative costs to the regulatory authorities who administer the process of recognition. These bodies are able to levy an administration fee upon individuals for the processing of applications for recognition.

This gives the DfES the entire responsibility for the general system of recognition of professional qualifications and education. These directives have not required implementing UK legislation since the responsibility transferred to the DfES.

 There has been considerable progress on the development of language learning in primary schools, underpinned by the launch in December 2002 of the Government&#039;s National Languages Strategy for England.

This means that over 1,200 teacher trainees will have been trained by the end of this year. In addition we have allocated 50 primary MFL places a year to the Graduate Teacher Programme.

<sup>(25)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LEA and school based expenditure is not available in 2002&#150;03 due to the redesign of the Section 52 Outturn Table A where central LEA expenditure is no longer split by phase.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> 1999&#150;00 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the dotted line.<br>

<sup>(27)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99. The 1999&#150;00 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(28)</sup> In 2002&#150;03 Islington LEA were one of a group of LEAs whose net current expenditure was lower than expected. It is suspected that this was caused by the misreporting of funding in the income column of their 2002&#150;03 Outturn Statement Table A.<br>

<p><a name="qn_319"><a name="41209w35.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what reasons were given by the schools in England which refused to take part in the OECD PISA 2003 survey for their decision not to take part.  [203171]</p>








<p><a name="st_316"><a name="41209w35.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s contractor, ONS, gained some insights from contacts with schools while seeking their agreement to take part about why they did not wish to participate in PISA 2003. The most common reason for refusal was the teaching staff time required in co-ordinating the school&#039;s participation in the studies. Schools also said that they received too many requests from a number of different sources to take part in surveys. The PISA rules require that testing takes place in the spring or summer terms and, as the sample was of 15&#150;16 year olds, many sampled pupils were in their GCSE year and even the half a day&#039;s testing required by PISA was seen as a distraction from their preparation.

 The BELB is currently reviewing all budgets and until this review is complete a precise figure for the educational psychology service budget for 2004&#150;05 is not available.

It is not possible to give an exact figure for the proportion of these costs which were incurred in primary schools in North Belfast only, but we know that 17 per cent. of all assessments completed by the psychology service took place in North Belfast primary schools.
