<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Barron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements he proposes to ensure compliance with the renegotiated Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [60984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme has existed for over 40 years, and is designed to provide reasonable prices for the National Health Service and fair rates of return for the pharmaceutical companies who supply the NHS. The Government remain committed to these objectives, and are currently renegotiating the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para0">The Government regret that there is increasing non compliance by a limited number of companies with the current voluntary agreement. This is adding to the NHS drugs bill at the expense of other NHS treatment and care. In these circumstances the Government have concluded that to ensure full compliance with a new agreement it will be necessary to take reserve powers in the forthcoming NHS Bill. These will make it possible to secure the compliance of any companies who might in future choose not to abide by the voluntary agreement.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to increase public service pensions from April 1999.  [60987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Legislation governing public service pensions requires them to be increased annually by the same percentage as State earnings-related pensions (additional pensions). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced on 28 October 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 339-42, that additional pensions will be increased by 3.2 per cent, in line with the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index up to September 1998. Public service pensions will therefore be increased by 3.2 per from 12 April 1999, except those which have been in payment for less than a year, which will receive a pro-rata increase.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what conclusions were reached by the interdepartmental working group on preventing unsuitable people from working with children and abuse of trust on the need to protect vulnerable 16 and 17 year olds from sexual advances by those in authority over them; and if he will make a statement.  [61127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The working group were asked to prioritise their work on abuse of trust. We have today placed a copy of their interim report on this in the Library.




<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1998 : Column: 3</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para10">The working group recommend a limited criminal offence to protect boys and girls of 16 and 17 from sexual advances by those in authority over them in specific circumstances. The circumstances would include young persons compulsorily detained; looked after by the local authority (whether in foster care, residential care, or semi-independent accommodation); receiving health and/or social care in a residential setting (including hospital); and receiving full time education. We accept this recommendation. As announced on 24 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 6, we will bring forward this Session proposals to implement it at the same time as we give Parliament an opportunity to vote on equalising the age of consent for boys and girls.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para11">The working group also recommend a Government initiative to strengthen codes of conduct generally to protect young people from those in positions of authority over them. They are taking this forward as a matter of priority. The first step is a seminar involving outside organisations on 30 November, and work will continue on this throughout next year.

<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Humble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has for the implementation of a change to a tonnage based levy for statutory joint waste disposal authorities.  [60857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 After announcing the proposed change from a council tax to a tonnage based system for the apportionment of Joint Waste Disposal Authorities levies, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), asked officials to work out methods for such a system and to discuss them with the local authority associations. A consultation document was issued on 9 July to those associations, the JWDAs and their constituent authorities with the intention of implementing the change in time for the 1999-2000 levy. This consultation prompted a large number of considered responses.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para12">As part of the development of a waste strategy for England and Wales, we are looking at the way in which all waste management functions are funded, both in areas where there are Joint Waste Disposal Authorities (JWDAs) and more widely. The proposal to change the levy arrangements to one based on the tonnage delivered for disposal, was part of this exercise.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para13">There are, however, obvious implications for the operation of the recycling credits scheme, a key element in the financing of local authority waste management. In response to the consultation paper "Less Waste: More 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1998 : Column: 4</I><P>
Value", on the waste strategy for England and Wales, views were expressed that aspects of the recycling credits scheme needed amendment. We have therefore decided to undertake a review of the recycling credits scheme. A decision on the levy basis for JWDAs has therefore been postponed pending the outcome of this review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if she will announce the membership of the 18 policy action teams referred to in the Social Exclusion Unit report, "Bringing Britain Together: a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal", published on 15 September.  [60988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Social Exclusion Unit's report "Bringing Britain Together: a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal" set out proposals for an intensive programme of policy development involving 18 cross- cutting Policy Action Teams based around five themes: getting the people to work; getting the place to work; building a future for young people; access to services; and making the Government work better.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para14">The Programme of policy development work will be completed by December 1999, when we will put together the outcome of all the reports into a coherent strategy. I am overseeing the whole process, and each Team has a champion Minister assigned to it.
<P>

<a name="81125w01.html_para15">I am announcing today the full membership of the Policy Action Teams. The Teams include members drawn from central and local government, the voluntary and private sectors as well as people living and working in poorer neighbourhoods. They will play an important part in achieving more joined-up Government policy and action on the ground. I have today placed the membership details in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Government are taking to ensure the availability of adequate compensation to meet claims arising from the death of, or injury to, passengers on board ships.  [60989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I have signed an order today which will triple the minimum amount of compensation available for passenger claims. The order will affect ferry operators, travel agents and tour operators whose principal place of business is in the UK. The new limit of liability of 300,000 Special Drawing Rights--SDR--(about &#163;250,000) per passenger takes effect on 1 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para0">As soon as a suitable legislative opportunity presents itself, we wish to extend this protection more widely to include all passengers whose journey has a link with the UK. This would require the UK withdrawing from the 1974 Athens Convention. This Convention entitles foreign carriers to an outdated limit of liability of 46,666 SDR (about &#163;38,000) per passenger. In the meantime, the UK will continue to press within the International Maritime Organisation for swift revision of the Athens Convention to provide for even higher compensation amounts, guaranteed by compulsory insurance cover.




<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1998 : Column: 5</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para1">I accept, and applaud, the fact that insurance and shipping companies have sometimes not bound themselves by the limits following accidents involving major loss of life. However, we must not be complacent, and this is why the Government intend to work towards better legal protection for all passengers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about the outcome of the meeting with Green Ministers.  [61128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Green Ministers met on 18 November to discuss how to deliver the Greening Government Agenda. The meeting discussed action arising from the Government's response to the Environmental Audit Committee's Second Report on the Greening Government Initiative. We noted particularly that the Deputy Prime Minister had asked Green Ministers to consider and report to the Cabinet Committee on the Environment (ENV) on how far sustainable development can be incorporated into the remit of all existing Departments and their Non-Departmental Public Bodies. Each Green Minister confirmed that they were reviewing the position in their own Department, and would report back to the next Green Ministers' meeting early in 1999.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para2">Green Ministers went on to discuss progress in integrating the environment into policies and operations. We agreed to establish a working group to consider the scope and format of future Green Ministers' reports to ENV, and the first published report on the activities of Green Ministers, to be produced in summer 1999.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para3">Green Ministers' meetings normally consider one cross-cutting issue in some detail. On this occasion we discussed how to get the most from Green Transport Plans and the action that would be needed to meet the specific targets set out in the White Paper "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone".
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para4">The meeting ended with a preliminary discussion of the consequences for the Green Ministers' network of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Green Ministers decided to examine in more detail the membership implications of devolution and to propose future arrangements at the next meeting in February.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para5">Twelve Green Ministers attended the meeting on 18 November; other Departments were represented by officials.

[61129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have accepted a recommendation made jointly by the two Commissions that the name for the new body should be the Countryside Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 I fully support the practical recommendations made in the Task Force's report to improve access and facilities at football grounds for supporters with disabilities. I have written today to the bodies identified in the report as having a role to play in implementing the relevant recommendations.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para7">There are several recommendations which are for Government to progress. These relate to amending the Approved Document (AD) for Part M of the Building Regulations to require all new stadia, new stands and extensions to existing facilities to provide wheelchair spaces in accordance with the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds; to drawing up a sliding scale for the numbers of designated seats for people who are ambulant disabled or visually/hearing impaired within new stands or stadia, and amending Part M accordingly; and to extending the future role of the Football Trust to improve disabled facilities at grounds.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para8">Any changes to the Building Regulations require statutory consultation and will be based on the advice of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee. The British Standards Institution have begun a comprehensive review of BS 5810 Code of practice for access for the disabled to buildings, and it is the intention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to use this standard and its supporting research, once it has been completed, as a basis for developing proposals through the Building Regulations Advisory Committee to revise the AD for Part M.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para9">In the interim, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have taken the opportunity to include references to the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds in the current revision to the Approved Document to extend Part M to new housing. This will draw the guidance to the attention of interested parties.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para10">The review of BS 5810 includes access for the ambulant disabled and when the Green Guide is next updated the standard will be taken on board.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para11">The Football Trust is an independent discretionary trust. Any decisions on its future role is a matter for the Trustees, in accordance with the Trust Deed.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para12">The recommendations made by the Task Force provide an excellent assessment of what has been achieved in the provision of facilities for disabled supporters and where improvements can still be made. The Government are determined to maintain the momentum of progress, by, for example, the continuing implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many indemnity undertakings were given by Departments under section 16 of the National Heritage Act 1980 for the six-month period ended 30 September; and what was the value of <i>(a)</i> any contingent liabilities in respect of such undertakings given at any time under that section which remain outstanding as at 30 September, <i>(b)</i> non-statutory Government indemnities in respect of loans handled by the Government Art Collection which remain outstanding as at 30 September and <i>(c)</i> non-statutory undertakings to Her Majesty in respect of loans from the Royal Collection which remain outstanding at 30 September.  [60972]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects of public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.
<P>

<a name="81125w02.html_para13">In the six-month period ended 30 September 1998, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

Culture 2000 will enable not only co-operation within traditional sectors, but cross-sectoral co-operation to take place.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Agriculture Council held in Brussels on 23 and 24 November.  [61131]<P>

<P>
<a name="81125w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the EU Agriculture Council in Brussels on 23 and 24 November. My noble Friend Lord Sewel, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, was also present.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para2">The Council voted on a proposal made by the Commission for the lifting of the world-wide ban on the export of British beef in respect of meat from animals born after 1 August 1996. 10 Member States voted in favour of the measure; only one, Germany--for understandable domestic reasons--voted against. Spain, France, Austria and Luxembourg abstained. This vote represented a substantial move towards the Commission proposal by 5 Member States from the earlier vote in the Standing Veterinary Committee. Most important, the procedures under which the vote was taken in Council enable the Commission formally to adopt the Decision.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para3">I can now announce to the House that within the last 3 hours the Commission has adopted the proposal, which permits the export from the UK of boneless beef and beef products from animals slaughtered between 6 and 30 months of age and born after 1 August 1996. That is the date on which the Commission have verified that all contaminated feed was removed from the food chain. There are further conditions which aim to prevent the offspring of BSE cases from entering the export scheme; 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1998 : Column: 9</I><P>
a requirement for the slaughter of offspring of BSE cases; and strict rules on slaughtering and processing. The Government will shortly issue a consultation paper on our proposals for implementing these rules. I shall be laying before Parliament secondary legislation which will make the offspring cull, which has been operating since July on a voluntary basis, compulsory. The legislation will provide compensation at the market rate, to owners of animals slaughtered.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para4">This is an excellent outcome which I am sure the House will welcome. It has been achieved against a background of scepticism about the seriousness with which we have tackled BSE. We have now overcome these misconceptions and had our case judged objectively on its scientific merits and supported by independent Commission inspections, taking as our over-riding principle the absolute need to safeguard public health.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para5">Every Agriculture Minister who spoke in the Council, including those who did not vote in favour, had very positive things to say about the commitment shown by the new United Kingdom Government to tackling the problems presented by BSE. The outcome is also an affirmation of the value of this Government's close co-operation and dialogue with our partners in Europe and with the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para6">The lifting of the ban comes hard on the heels of the support measures for the agriculture sector which I announced to the House on 16 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 624-66. Both demonstrate the Government's commitment to securing a viable long term future for the sector.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para7">The Council also held a discussion of the Commission's proposals for CAP reform in the context of the Agenda 2000 measures. These proposals are essential for the future stability of European agriculture and in order to facilitate a successful enlargement of the Union to the east. The Council agreed a report to the Vienna European Council next month identifying the main outstanding issues and expressing its determination to reach conclusions on the package as a whole by next March. It is an important Government objective to secure an ambitious reform of the CAP which serves the national interest and I very much welcomed the commitment by the Council to take early decisions. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made similar points in the discussion in Ecofin on 23 November on the future financing of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para8">This was a very important Council meeting for the United Kingdom. We have achieved a major objective of our policy towards Europe in the lifting of the beef export ban. Although it will take time for the British beef industry to win back markets which have been lost to them in the past two and a half years, I believe we have created the conditions in which they can now plan for the future, confident that their industry is operating to the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1998 : Column: 10</I><P>
highest possible standards. Our immediate task is to work with the industry to ensure that the scheme which we have successfully negotiated in Europe works effectively to help regain recognition for the quality of British beef on world markets.

<a name="81125w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Corbett: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on progress towards a Food Standards Agency.  [61132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81125w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The Government are fully committed to the establishment of the Food Standards Agency as set out in the White Paper published in January 1998. It is a matter of regret that, because of the government's heavy legislative programme in other areas, it has not been possible to secure a space in the forthcoming Parliamentary session. My right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health for Scotland, for Northern Ireland and for Wales and I are determined nevertheless to move action forward where we can, in the meantime, in ways which do not require legislation.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para9">Since the general election, this Government have made a number of improvements to the way in which food safety and standards issues are handled. Officials from MAFF and DH are now working together in a Joint Food Standards and Safety Group, which reports directly to both the Secretary of State for Health and myself. The Group also liaises closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices. The safety of the consumer lies at the heart of our decision making.
<P>

<a name="81125w03.html_para10">I am holding discussions with my right hon. Friends as to how we can, in practical terms, enhance these current joint working arrangements and lay further foundations for the Agency. As soon as we have completed these discussions, I will make a further announcement to the House. A draft Bill will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the support and administration of the Army's training areas and ranges.  [60856]<P>

<P>
<a name="81125w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of the Government's search for efficiencies, the Commander in Chief Land Command is shortly to initiate a competition to seek a long term strategic partner from the private sector to assist in the development of a future strategy to deliver better value for money from the large number of contracts currently in existence from the support and administration of the Army's training areas and ranges. Details will be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities (OJEC) and MOD Contracts Bulletin.
