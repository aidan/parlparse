<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Last November the General Synod agreed a package of proposals relating to clergy stipends and pensions. These proposals had been put together in the light of six-month consultation with dioceses following publication in 2001 of a detailed review of clergy remuneration. The consultation resulted in overwhelming support for a continuation of a "defined benefits" pension scheme.

Matching may be carried out in cases where allegations of fraud are made, but this is only done when ordered by an Election Court.

<a name="30203w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Watts: </B>

the Government of a successful London bid; what impact she estimates a successful bid would have on the funding of sport in the other English regions; and if her Department will carry out an assessment of the benefits of funding a successful bid against other options which promote sport throughout all regions.  [88733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The Government's estimate of the likely cost of staging the Olympic Games is &#163;4.67 billion in forecast outturn prices. Taking account of likely revenues the games might require a public subsidy of &#163;2.6 billion. These estimates are based on the figures provided by Arup Consultants in their report on the cost and benefits of a London 2012 Olympics, the outcome of consultations with key stakeholders, Government Departments and those who would be responsible for delivery of the games, and an assessment of the uncertainty and risk associated with hosting the games. The cost of mounting a bid is estimated at &#163;17 million in forecast outturn prices.
<P>

<a name="30203w01.html_para1">We are also currently considering with the Mayor of London how the games would be funded if a decision is taken in favour of a bid.
<P>

<a name="30203w01.html_para2">This work is part of Government's continuing consideration of whether to support a bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Within this context I am determined that were Government to support a London bid then grassroots sport, especially in the regions, should not suffer from any diversion of resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The &#163;100 million lottery funded people's network programme has enabled 4,085 libraries in the UK to be connected to the internet, including all the libraries in the London Borough of Brent. This represents 99 per cent. of libraries in England, 95 per cent. in Scotland and 100 per cent. in Wales and Northern Ireland. Only 39 English and 30 Scottish libraries have still to be connected, and we expect all but two of these to be online by summer 2003. This is a very significant achievement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement to the House earlier today setting out the conclusions of our consideration of the provision of entertainment and entertainment facilities in places of religious worship and village halls under the Licensing Bill. The Government have now tabled an amendment to the Bill that would exempt secular entertainment provided in places of public religious worship and the provision of entertainment facilities in such places from the need to obtain a licence under the Bill when it is enacted. Music for the purposes of or incidental to a religious service or meeting will remain exempt.
<P>

<a name="30203w01.html_para3">We have also made clear our intention to exempt church halls, chapel halls or other similar buildings occupied in connection with a place of public religious worship, and village halls, parish or community halls or other similar buildings from the fees associated with the provision of entertainment facilities under the licensing regime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew10"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 It was agreed with Buckingham Palace that the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne would be celebrated during 2002 and that the focal point of the celebrations would be the "Jubilee weekend" in June. The details were announced by the Prime Minister on 23 November 2000, <i>Official</i> <i>Report,</i> columns 294&#150;95W, and 22 June 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 7&#150;8W.
<P>

<a name="30203w01.html_para4">Any events to mark the 50th anniversary of Coronation will be arranged as part of the Queen's normal programme of engagements by Buckingham Palace rather than in co-ordination with my officials in the Golden Jubilee Office who were solely concerned with the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In January this year one project in Northern Ireland, the Fermanagh Business Initiative-Biomass for Sustainable Development, received &#163;105,520 from the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) under the small-scale biomass heating schemes strand of NOF's transforming communities initiative. No applications have been received from Northern Ireland for the large-scale (&#163;33 million) strand. The deadline for applications for funding for offshore wind projects is July 2003.
<P>

<a name="30203w01.html_para5">There has been no previous lottery funding for renewable energy, either from the New Opportunities Fund or other distributors. There are, therefore, no figures for previous years.

<P>

<a name="30203w02.html_para0">The gateway process categorises projects as "IT-enabled business change" where the business benefits are dependant upon IT. More significantly, such a categorisation requires projects to demonstrate real changes to the way the client organisation works, its skills, organisation structure and its business process re-engineering. 179 such procurement projects have been reviewed by the Gateway process teams.

 The Government Wine Cellar is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and managed by Government Hospitality on behalf of all Government Departments. The cellar contains a mixture of fine wines, beverage wines and spirits and liqueurs. Stock levels vary but generally the cellar contains approximately 37,000 bottles, the majority of which are wine. The value of the stock is subjective and bears no relation to the purchase cost. Fine wines are bought young and then stored until ready for use, enabling wines of good age and excellent value to be used by the Government for its hospitality needs. The current value of the stock is estimated to be in the region of &#163;1.5 million.

 The UK reviews regularly at working level, with both the European Commission and our EU partners, the progress with EU integration of all Western Balkan countries, including Croatia. There has been no specific discussion at Ministerial level of Croatia's progress towards EU membership.

 The Feira European Council in June 2000 gave Croatia, along with the other countries of the Western Balkans, the firm prospect of eventual EU membership if they meet the accession criteria. We understand that Croatia intends to submit an application for membership in the coming weeks. When it does so, the Council will ask the Commission to prepare an Opinion on Croatia's readiness to open accession negotiations. Particular attention will be given to the extent to which Croatia meets the Copenhagen political criteria. These relate to the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. Co-operation with ICTY will be an important issue that the Commission will examine in

 We would not invite Robert Mugabe to an equivalent Summit in the UK. But the France/Africa Summit lakes place in Paris on 20&#150;21 February, two days after the current EU sanctions on Zimbabwe are due to expire. Our priority is to ensure a rollover of those sanctions. The rollover requires the unanimous agreement of all 15 EU member Slates. This has not yet been achieved, but is the subject of intensive discussions, most recently at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 27 January and at a meeting of Permanent Representatives to the EU on 30 January.

 We are in regular contact with fellow members of the Commonwealth and with the Commonwealth Secretariat about the situation in Zimbabwe. The Minister for Africa, my noble Friend Baroness Amos, discussed Zimbabwe with a number of Commonwealth Ministers at the EU/Southern African Development Community meeting in Maputo from 7 to 8 November 2002, and the Africa/Europe Ministerial in Ouagadougou on 28 November 2002. Baroness Amos also raises Zimbabwe regularly in her bilateral contacts with Commonwealth Partners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his Department's latest evaluation is of the stability of Sierra Leone; and what progress has been made since British intervention.  [93615]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have made a significant political and military investment in restoring peace to Sierra Leone. Good progress has been made since peace was declared a year ago. Over 50,000 combatants were disarmed and almost 39,000 have undergone reintegration. Peaceful and credible elections were held in May 2002. UNAMSIL, the UN peacekeeping mission, began a gradual withdrawal in November 2002. The UK continues to play a major role in post-conflict rebuilding. We have helped to re-equip, assist and advise the Sierra Leone Police (SLP). Through the International Military and Advisory Training Team (IMATT) the UK leads the training and reform of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF). In November 2002, we confirmed a 10-year programme of support to reform in Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="30203w03.html_para0">However, the situation is still fragile and much remains to be done to secure a sustainable peace. Recent events in Sierra Leone, including a raid on a military barracks in Freetown, are of concern. The RSLAF, supported by UNAMSIL and the SLP, responded well to the incident and the SLP have made a sizeable number of arrests. Regional instability, especially the continuing conflicts in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, remains a threat to peace in Sierra Leone. We are actively involved in international efforts to resolve these conflicts.

The legislation to introduce Business Improvement Districts is contained in the Local Government Bill.
<P>

<a name="30203w03.html_para1">We published on 21 January draft guidance on Business Improvement Districts, which is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister website.

[94524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Neighbourhood Renewal Funding is allocated using the Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000). In moving to a new instrument the Government recognised that some authorities that would have benefited on the old basis for allocations would not have done so under the new one. Transitional arrangements were therefore set up to make allowance for authorities that had been among the most deprived areas on the old index and are not among the most deprived areas on the ID 2000. Four London Authorities are now in receipt of transitional protection.

However, I know that many people have written to me expressing concerns about action against Iraq and I reiterate what I have said that no decision has been made to take military action and military action is not inevitable. My office works hard to ensure that all the letters receive appropriate responses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Sulphur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power generators are controlled through limits placed on the amount which can be released. The Environment Agency encourages generators to construct new flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment by allowing coal-fired generators, building a new FGD plant, an increase in their limit.




<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2003 : Column 23W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30203w07.html_para0">These increases are allowed for the two years in which the FGD is under construction. This provides the operator the opportunity to increase the utilisation of his plant in that period.
<P>

<a name="30203w07.html_para1">The agency encourages more intensive use of FGD once constructed. Where a generator takes all practicable steps to ensure that the operating load factor of its FGD units is at least twice the factor for unabated units, the agency will grant an increase in their limit.

 The Department is fully aware that current indicative flood plain maps provided by the Environment Agency do not differentiate between areas that have defences and those that do not, nor between different standards of defence. The first generation of the indicative flood plain maps was designed to influence the planning process and support initiatives to raise awareness of flooding to those living in flood risk areas. The Department is working with the Environment Agency to develop a second generation of these maps that will enable a more realistic representation of actual flood risk, taking full account of the presence and condition of defences, on flood risk maps. This is difficult to achieve on a consistent basis for the whole country but the aim is to publish such maps towards the end of 2003. In subsequent years these maps will be the subject of continuing improvement as the quality of data and techniques of data analysis improve.

 Sales of income drawdown (also known as income withdrawal) products are regulated in the same way as the sale of other investments.

The Financial Services Authority also publishes, as part of its consumer education programme, information on income withdrawal products, which is designed to help consumers understand these products and explain the risks involved.

 The Government reviewed the role of the scheme in consultation with key stakeholders last summer and the pre-Budget report announced the decision to reform the scheme from 1 April 2003. Approximately two thirds of the funding currently going though the scheme, under objects C and CC, will be allocated to additional public spending on sustainable waste management. The remainder, around &#163;47 million per year, will be spent on community environmental projects though a successor tax credit scheme. The LTCS reform, by boosting strategic waste management, will help improve recycling and recovery, though any impact on incineration from this specific reform is expected to be very limited.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The investigations undertaken for the proposed strategy have so far been limited to the assembly of existing data such as geological maps and environmental constraints for a desktop assessment. Route alignment has been based on this information, which is the normal level of study for a scheme at this early stage of development. Particular emphasis has been placed on environmental constraints and consequently, in developing the alignment, we have sought to reduce the impact on the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and designated areas of ancient woodland. At the same time we have assessed future traffic patterns and the safety and economic benefits of the proposals.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No specific ground investigation, air pollution or noise surveys have been undertaken to date, but if a decision is taken to proceed with further development of the route proposals, a comprehensive programme of surveys will be undertaken. The results of the surveys will be taken into account when preparing the Environmental Statement for the scheme which would be published with the draft Orders under the Highways Act.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Studies for improvement of the A21 at Hurst Green were undertaken in the late 1980s and were concluded in 1993 without any proposals being formally published. The area of the studies extended from just north of Coopers Corner to a point midway between Hurst Green and Silver Hill, which limited the opportunities for a line significantly away from the village. At the same time a scheme for a climbing lane at Silver Hill was being investigated and a public consultation was held in the early 1990s. This scheme was cancelled in 1993 due to constraints on funding.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 1996&#150;97 a DBFO package was put forward for the Weald and Downland area which included the A21. There were no major improvements of the A21 proposed south of Lamberhurst Bypass, only minor improvements. This DBFO project was cancelled in 1997 as part of the Government's review of the road programme.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current study has examined the whole of the A21 against future needs and modern engineering and environmental standards and therefore supersedes previous studies and proposals. The purpose of the current consultation is to hear the views of all who are interested in the proposals. Where members

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Public consultation on the strategy started on 19 November last year and the last date for submitting comments is 14 February. Public exhibitions were held between December 5 and December 10 at a variety of locations along the A21 with additional venues added on 13 and 17 December at the request of Hastings borough and Hurst Green parish councils. Around 1,500 people attended these exhibitions. To date over 800 prepaid questionnaires, 100 letters and emails have been received by the Agency whilst a further six letters to the Department for Transport have been passed onto us for the comments to be considered. These do not include letters sent directly to you and copied to the Agency. We are examining all these responses in detail before preparing our submission to Ministers.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The cost of the roundabout installation and junction improvements on the A21 at Johns Cross is &#163;1.5 million. As part of the scheme a new signal controlled pedestrian crossing will be installed to provide a safer means of access to the local school and an improved footpath at New Cut.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The existing junction layout, together with nearby accesses, is complicated and can be confusing to road users. The accidents recorded on the length affected by the roundabout scheme total 14 injury accidents in five years (2.8 per year). This figure is higher than the national average for accidents at rural junctions of this type (1.11 per year). The installation of a roundabout will reduce traffic speeds and is expected to save one injury accident per year.</FONT></UL>

 In-vehicle route guidance systems that take account of prevailing traffic conditions ("dynamic systems") require an operator licence under the Road Traffic (Driver Licensing and Information Systems) Act 1989 and associated regulations. Licences are only issued if systems meet certain safety and routing design and performance criteria, which include a check that they avoid diverting drivers along unsuitable local roads. Other route guidance systems do not require licensing.

<a name="30203w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The consultation period, throughout the UK, has been extended until we have consulted on Gatwick runway options. We intend to issue a revised South East consultation paper later this month. The consultation period will then run for four months after the date of publication of the new material. Those who have already responded to the consultation will be able to amend, add to, or replace their response having considered the new material, if they wish to do so.
<P>

<a name="30203w12.html_para0">All responses to the consultation will be considered and analysed carefully before final decisions are taken. These will be set out in an air transport White Paper, which we aim to publish towards the end of the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) how many cars have been converted from petrol to hydrogen fuel in each year since 2000; and if he will make a statement;  [94278]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he has taken to encourage the fuel conversion of cars from petrol to hydrogen; and if he will make a statement;  [94279]

<P>
(4) how much has been provided by the Government in grants for converting cars from petrol to hydrogen; and if he will make a statement.  [94280]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to promoting the development, introduction and take-up of clean, low-carbon new vehicle technologies and fuels, including hydrogen, where these offer environmental and other advantages over conventional alternatives. Our "Powering Future Vehicles" strategy, published in July 2002, sets out how we will do this, and sets challenging targets for increasing the numbers of clean, low carbon vehicles on our roads.
<P>

<a name="30203w12.html_para2">The Government's research, development and demonstration programmes include support for hydrogen fuel cell research, funding for the trial operation of hydrogen fuel cell buses in London in 2004, and support for the associated hydrogen refuelling installations. We have also announced our intention to exempt hydrogen from fuel duty for a period to encourage early development and take-up, and have introduced 100 per cent. first-year capital allowances for investments in hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="30203w12.html_para3">Hydrogen technologies, however, are still at an early stage of development with many technical challenges to be overcome. There are currently no hydrogen cars on UK roads, and no filling stations selling hydrogen.
<P>

<a name="30203w12.html_para4">Hydrogen fuelled vehicles, though having zero tailpipe emissions, provide carbon-free transportation only where the hydrogen is produced with non-fossil energy sources. My Department has recently commissioned a number of reports into the long-term future potential of hydrogen and other road fuels. These include a report by Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. ("Carbon to Hydrogen&#151;roadmaps for passenger cars"), and a study carried out by leading experts on energy and environmental matters ("Fuelling Road Transport: Implications for Energy Policy"). These are available via the DfT website.

<P><I>3 Feb 2003 : Column 43W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30203w12.html_para5">Both reports, as well as reviewing hydrogen fuel cell technology, indicate the scope for further substantial and early reductions in conventional cars' fuel consumption and carbon emissions, including hybrid engine technology. The second study also identifies the potential for renewable transport fuel from biomass.

[95196R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Data provided by UK charter airlines, assuming a typical aircraft and the latest average Summer load factor on this route, yields an estimate of 100 passenger miles per gallon. My Department is aware of proposals by Air Travel Greener by Design and by the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE), both of which include among other objectives the reduction of CO2 emissions.

 In England and Wales, it is an offence to ply for hire without a taxi licence. The penalty for this offence is a maximum fine of Level 4 on the Standard Scale (&#163;2,500). The actual enforcement of this offence is undertaken at a local level, by district/borough councils, unitary authorities or Transport for London, in concert with the relevant police force. Records of such enforcement activity are not kept centrally.

Investigations into the source of the items found are continuing.

 There has been no change in policy with regard to public access to Royal Navy ships paying courtesy calls since 2001. Such visits have always been undertaken with appropriate security measures commensurate with the perceived threat. For example, public access to RN ships during some visits to overseas ports has not been permitted following advice from our attaches and host Governments. During 2002 there was a slight increase in the number of visits to both overseas and United Kingdom ports compared with those undertaken in 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what studies led his Department to take the view that to preserve, sustain and develop essential technical capabilities found in Dstl a critical mass of staff is required that cannot be achieved with the current dispersed organisation; and if he will place copies of the studies in the Library.  [94065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Dstl Main Board believes that the geographical fragmentation of its work force inhibits their ability to build technical excellence and that the dispersion of staff significantly degrades the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation.
<P>

<a name="30203w15.html_para0">While information technology and advances in communication can aid knowledge sharing, people still need to interact with each other on a regular basis and this is best achieved when they work in the same or adjoining buildings. The career development of staff will also be much easier if Dstl reduces the geographical fragmentation of the organisation as it will be far simpler for people to move between areas increasing their skill base and overall deployability. Dstl has also carried out studies and sought opinions from managers, customers and staff. The results of these studies were summarised in the consultation document issued to trades unions as part of the formal consultation process over Dstl site rationalisation plans. Copies of this document will be placed in the Library.

 As the Ministry of Defence is not a party to the national firelighters dispute, no assessment has been made by the Department of any differential between the pay of Royal Navy personnel engaged on Operation Fresco and that of professional firemen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has held discussions on non-lethal weapons with United States military representatives bilaterally, multilaterally and in NATO. The United Kingdom considers that non-lethal weapons have potential military uses, where such uses are compatible with international legal obligations. No joint developments of non-lethal weapons with the United States are currently planned. All potential new weapons are subject to stringent review at all stages of the research and procurement process to ensure compliance with the United Kingdom's obligations under international and domestic law.

<a name="30203w17.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has retained full ownership for Intellectual property that was generated and predominantly used within that part of DERA which became Dstl.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w17.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 When QinetiQ was created as a plc it had to purchase its assets from the Ministry of Defence. The MOD required the company to purchase these with a combination of shares and interest bearing loan notes payable to the MOD.
<P>

<a name="30203w17.html_para0">The split between debt and equity was made following specialist advice to MOD from its external banking advisors and discussions with QinetiQ senior management.

: In order to inform the decision process and the negotiations with potential bidders the Ministry of Defence had obtained valuations for QinetiQ at various stages of the PPP. Prior to the sale MOD's advisors undertook a valuation based on the information provided to potential purchasers in the QinetiQ information memorandum. Their valuation approach was to use two methods, a discounted cashflow analysis and an analysis of comparable trading companies.
<P>

<a name="30203w17.html_para3">The discounted cash flow was based on the company's financial model and made use of cost of capital estimates provided by advisors.
<P>

<a name="30203w17.html_para4">The analysis of comparable companies attempted to provide a price for QinetiQ based on other firms in the same sector. QinetiQ is a complex business operating in several different sectors. In order to derive a more accurate view of the overall value the comparison was based on sub-divisions of QinetiQ which were compared to a selection of companies in the same sector.

 The total forecast costs to the Ministry of Defence of consultancy, up to completion, is expected to be &#163;17 million. This covers all stages of the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) Public Private Partnership (PPP), including the detailed options study, public consultation process, vesting of QinetiQ as a plc and completion of the sale of shares in the company.
<P>

<a name="30203w17.html_para5">The total cost of the PPP falling to DERA was &#163;39.3 million, which includes consultancy costs. The total cost of the PPP falling to QinetiQ through to completion is expected to be &#163;18.7 million, including consultancy fees, information technology and infrastructure costs. The total PPP cost falling to DSTL was &#163;3.3 million, which was mostly infrastructure costs.

 Responsibility for almost all historic and all future environmental liabilities on freehold sites owned by QinetiQ transferred from the Ministry of Defence to the company on 1 July 2001. Following extensive discussions with insurance advisers and other technical specialists, MOD concluded that there were a small number of uniquely military potential liabilities which could not be transferred on terms which represented good value for money. These potential liabilities, identified in the Departmental Minute laid before Parliament on 8 July 2002, relate to work carried out over many decades by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and its predecessors. This includes work carried out under the conditions of World War 2. Responsibility for these liabilities has always rested with the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="30203w17.html_para7">There is no cost-effective method of comprehensively identifying or quantifying these liabilities. MOD and DERA did, however, carry out land quality assessment studies on the properties and examine existing records and claims history. On this basis we conclude that the actual risk of MOD incurring these liabilities is extremely low. The decision to retain these liabilities was taken before the appointment of The Carlyle Group as preferred bidder for QinetiQ and followed advice from external advisers that potential purchasers would either refuse to accept these risks or would demand a substantial and disproportionate reduction in the price paid.

<a name="30203w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Records relating to the precise date of an approach to the Italian authorities are not held by the Ministry of Defence. MOD officials have been advised by the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), which at the time had lead responsibility, that the approach is thought to have been made in approximately 1994&#150;95. However, SSVC further advise that specific records for that period are no longer held.

 While employment in the armed forces is open to citizens of Commonwealth countries and Republic of Ireland nationals as well as British citizens, the services do not actively recruit overseas. Over the last three years, however, the Royal Navy and the Army have sent selection teams to some Commonwealth countries (eg Fiji, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines) at the specific request of the Government concerned, and only when evidence suggests that there is sufficient interest among the local population to merit a visit. The selection teams screen out those who are not thought capable of meeting the full entry standards to save applicants the cost of a potentially nugatory trip to the United Kingdom to undergo the recruitment

: I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 22 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 327W, to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). Royal Navy vessels do not sail without a full complement of damage control and fire-fighting capabilities and that level of support varies from ship to ship. Fire-fighting is not however an individual specialisation. All Royal Navy personnel are trained to fight fires. This training includes training in the use of safety equipment, breathing apparatus and damage control. The level of that training is appropriate to the role they will fulfil at sea. In addition, on each ship, there will be individuals qualified to provide training in fire-fighting. Each ship in the Royal Navy is fully equipped and has the trained personnel to deal with fire hazards. This capability is regularly tested by means of fire-fighting drills.

 The type of food being sent to the Gulf in support of British Forces is a mixture of Operational Ration Packs and fresh food. I am withholding the quantity in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which relates to Defence, Security and International Relations. Costs are not yet available as the bulk of our force has not arrived in the region and the military feeding plan is not sufficiently mature to generate meaningful data.

<P>
<a name="30203w18.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The United Kingdom armed forces have available to them a range of prophylactic measures to protect against chemical and biological weapons and insects. Because of the range of measures available and the fact that they are not specific to the deployment of personnel to the Gulf, the information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is part of the Home Office and all its procurement exercises are undertaken in accordance with standard Government procurement rules.

undeniably leads to actual abuse of children, sometimes as young as four or five, in the United Kingdom and abroad.

<a name="30203w20.html_para0">The payment card companies have been working on this issue for some time and work closely with the police. More recently, they have begun dialogue with the Children's Charities Coalition for Internet Safety, which they hope will lead to a joint statement.

<P>

<a name="30203w20.html_para5">Co-ordinated action by the major credit card schemes can have a major impact on the commercial trade in child pornography, but this can only be effective if all the schemes are equally involved.

<a name="30203w20.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I understand that 5,700 of the United Kingdom Operation Ore suspects are being investigated by Home Office police forces (the remainder are being investigated by Scottish Forces, Police Service of Northern Ireland and the island forces). In relation to those suspects, as of 23 January 2003, 1,512 searches have been carried out and 1,336 arrests have been made. 189 individuals have been charged.
<P>

<a name="30203w20.html_para6">All forces have prioritised those suspects who have access to children at home or at work and those in sensitive occupations. Typically, computer equipment is seized during the search of suspects' addresses. The capacity to forensically examine the volume of computer data accumulated by these suspects is limited and the Government has provided an additional &#163;500,000 for training and equipment for forces to build capacity for this kind of operation. This Government has provided record funding for police forces and has

established child protection as a priority in the National Policing Plan. It is for Chief Constables and police authorities to improve the quality of their child protection units within those resources. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and Ministers are continuing to monitor progress.

<a name="30203w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2003]:</i> The particular data to which the hon. Member refers relates to recording not only convictions but all court results. It shows the time taken from the completion of court proceedings to record the quickest 90 per cent. of cases entered during the period in question. The data reflects the longest time taken to record any case within the quickest 90 per cent. The figures include the time taken by courts to notify results to the police, and will be affected by factors such as delays due to a need to clarify results, or undertaking back record conversion exercises.

<a name="30203w20.html_para8">The following table shows the results for forces in England and Wales in December 2002. The average figure for the nine-month period from April to December 2002 was 71 days. This compares with an average of 220 days for the period from April 2000 to March 2001, and of 196 days for the period between April 2001 to March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30203w20.html_para9">We have made clear our determination that the timeliness of inputting data onto the police national computer should be improved. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported (Police National Computer Data Quality and Timeliness&#151;Second Report December 2002) that substantial progress had been made following the inspection and review exercise that we commissioned, but that more needed to be done. To this end, we are working with the Association of Chief Police Officers to implement HMIC's recommendations.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House when the consultation paper was published on 3 July 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 227.

There was also widespread print media reporting and coverage on Sky News of the Home Secretary's speech to a conference on entitlement cards organised by the Information Commissioner on 15 January 2003. The Home Office press office has responded to many requests for briefing by national, local and specialist media.

<P>
<a name="30203w21.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service (UKPS) introduced the current universal passport application form in 1998. The length of the application form is determined by the requirements for identity authentication, determination of entitlement and the fact that it is an application form for all types of passport application. UKPS had previously used different forms for the different types of service required. However there were problems with this arrangement. For example, people did not always use the form that was right for them and the printing and distribution arrangements were both costly and complicated. The current version of the universal form is the fourth produced by UKPS and has been reviewed and improved over the past four years to ensure that it best meets the needs of UKPS' customers. This is tested through analysis of customer error rates and regular market research as well as analysis of complaints.
<P>

<a name="30203w21.html_para5">The forms are supported by a passport application pack which aims to provide the information required by all UKPS customers. As well as essential information on eligibility and the documents needed to apply, it contains guidance on the services that UKPS offer, the methods of application, fees and details of the complaints procedure. The pack is regularly reviewed to consider where there are opportunities to improve the textual format, provide greater clarity and reduce, where possible, the amount of text.
<P>

<a name="30203w21.html_para6">UKPS is currently undertaking a further review of both the passport application form and the content of the application pack. All relevant stakeholders are being consulted and customer feedback is being taken fully into consideration as part of this process.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> Prison Service Order (PSO) 2700 (suicide and self-harm prevention) came into effect on 1 January 2003. It replaces the previous instructions and sets out mandatory requirements. This PSO brings existing policy in line with the direction of the Prison Service's approach to suicide prevention (the move from awareness to prevention) and the broader context (decency, safety, the concept of the healthy prison). It provides prison staff with instructions on identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm, and on providing the subsequent care and support for such prisoners.
<P>

<a name="30203w21.html_para11">A guidance document "Suicide Prevention Strategies" has been issued in conjunction with this PSO. Copies of both have been placed in the Library. The guidance document provides suggestions in line with the suicide and self-harm prevention strategy based on the Internal Review of Suicide and Self-harm in the Prison Service, and incorporates protocols on the use of safer cells and information on the role of the Samaritans and prisoner peer supporters. It aims to support the practices and procedures set out in PSO 2700, while recognising that not all the guidance will be appropriate or feasible or affordable for all establishments.

<a name="30203w21.html_para12">These documents cannot reflect all the learning from the Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme, which is at its halfway stage. This programme includes a series of projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support, and the learning from investigations into deaths in custody. The three-year programme, which started in April 2001, will be subject to an independent evaluation, and a new generation of replacement PSOs is planned for 2004. It is likely that, as with PSO 2700 and the supporting guide, the distinction between mandatory actions and good practice will be maintained.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 26 November 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 252W, on prisoner data, whether the Inmate Information System allows <i>(a)</i> prison service staff, <i>(b)</i> the social services and <i>(c)</i> his Department's officials to access information on where prisoners served previous sentences; and if he will take steps to improve co-ordination between the prison service and social services.  [93213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w22.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Inmate Information System allows authorised Prison Service staff to retrieve data of prisoners' previous sentences as long as they have been linked together (on the system) by a member of staff at an establishment or at headquarters. It does not currently allow direct retrieval of such information by other agencies. Approved access by others to agreed data within the new system under development will be enabled by the Criminal Justice System 'exchange' technology now under development by Criminal Justice IT, in line with the targets set out in "Justice For All" (CM 5563).
<P>

<a name="30203w22.html_para0">The Prison Service has taken significant steps in order to improve its liaison with social services, including meetings with individual social services and also centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 28 November 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 428W, on prisoners, whether his Department will make it its policy to put systems in place in order for information on whether prisoners under 35 have served time in young offenders institutions to be centrally available; and what measures his Department will put in place to ensure that reconvicted prisoners who serve sentences in prisons other than the prison in which they served their initial sentence receive continuity with regard to programmes aimed at their rehabilitation.  [93218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w22.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government have put in place targets to deliver improved information systems across the Criminal Justice System by 2005. As part of this, we are considering a replacement for the Prison Service Local Inmate Database System (LIDS) and Inmate Information System (IIS), which will centralise data, improve custodial history information and provide easier interrogation of data across the prison estate and beyond.
<P>

<a name="30203w22.html_para1">The Prison Service already has in place a sentence planning system which seeks to ensure that reconvicted prisoners, returning to custody in a different prison, receive continuity in programmes and other regime interventions designed to address their offending behaviour and prepare them for release. Improved continuity will derive from the new IT based joint prison probation offender assessment system, OASys. Rollout of OASys across the Prison Service is due to start in April 2003 and will take between 12 and 18 months.

 Prison Rule 35A (and Young Offender Institutions Rule 11) allows for a prisoner's correspondence to be intercepted where it is a necessary and proportionate response to what is sought to be achieved. Further detail is set out in the "Prison Service Security Manual", a copy of which can be found in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30203w22.html_para2">In high security prisons, prisoner correspondence is screened by an x-ray machine when it arrives at the prison, and as a matter of good practice, correspondence will also be subject to drug detection by the prison drug dog. At lower security prisons, this will happen when there is intelligence to suggest there is an illicit article in a prisoner's mail, although some prisons screen all mail as a matter of good practice.
<P>

<a name="30203w22.html_para3">Prisoners are aware that all letters are opened and can be read by staff, except correspondence that has the protection of Prison Rule 39, which protects legal professional privilege or contains confidential material.

<P>

<a name="30203w22.html_para4">Prisoners who have committed or are remanded for particular offences (e.g. those who pose a threat to children) will have all their mail read, subject to review about the continuing threat that they pose. In all other cases, except where it has been decided that a prisoner's correspondence may provide useful intelligence for particular investigations, around five per cent. of all mail will be read on a random basis based on an assessment of the threat to security at individual establishments.

 There are currently four mother and baby units which cover England and Wales.

 Every woman prisoner with a child under 18 months may apply for a place on a mother and baby unit (MBU). Each women's prison has a mother and baby unit liaison officer who will outline the MBU process to new prisoners and assist with their applications. No figures are held centrally on the number of women who submit applications each year.

 The Government are commited to improve custodial accommodation and offending programmes for 18 to 20-year-olds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his statement of 22 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 303, on higher education, what his definition of participation is; and when he aims to achieve 50 per cent. participation in higher education.  [93944]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w24.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend in his statement on 22 January 2003 stated that the Government's target remains, as we set out in the Department's public service agreement published in 2000 and reaffirmed in last summer's spending review settlement, to increase participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by the end of the decade. Participation in England is currently at 43 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30203w24.html_para0">Participation in higher education is measured by the Initial Entry Rate (IER). The IER covers English domiciled 18 to 30 year-olds who entered higher education for the first time in a particular academic year. It includes entry to all full-time and part-time courses of one year or more that lead to qualifications awarded by higher education institutions or widely-recognised national awarding bodies.

students from a wide geographical area. However, the particular needs of Cumbria are being addressed through collaborative arrangements by the four core providers of HE in Cumbria; University of Central Lancashire, Lancaster University, St. Martin's College of HE and Cumbria Institute of the Arts. As a result of this collaboration, funding has been made available by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) for an additional 1,200 HE student places in Cumbria since 1999. HEFCE is currently reviewing future funding for Cumbria through a task force chaired by Sir Brian Fender.
<P>

<a name="30203w24.html_para2">In addition, the Government's Excellence Challenge programme, which encourages universities to work closely with schools and colleges in disadvantaged areas, will, from 2003&#150;04, expand to cover west Cumbria. Funds will be available from September 2003. West Cumbria will also be part of the National Partnerships for Progression Initiative run by HEFCE, and will be eligible for its share of funding for projects to enhance progression into higher education. Partnerships will be informed of their level of support in spring 2003. Excellence Challenge and Partnerships for Progression will be merged as "Aim Higher" from 2004.

 In 2002, 2,107 schools chose to administer the Key Stage 2 test (known as the year 7 progress test) for their year 7 pupils, of which 1,947 school administered the English tests; and 1978 schools administered the mathematics tests. From those schools, 61,827 year 7 pupils took the English progress test; and 76,221 took the mathematics test. Some pupils who sat the test were not eligible to do so. Of those eligible pupils who sat the test and who had achieved level 3 at Key Stage 2 in 2001, 30 per cent. achieved level 4 or above in the English progress test, and 18 per cent. achieved level 4 or above in the mathematics progress test in 2002.

Additionally, where IAG is offered within student support services in FE Colleges, it will be subject to inspection by Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate as part of the inspection of the institution as a whole, under the Common Inspection Framework.

 Independent Schools in England which provide full time education for five or more pupils of compulsory school age must register with the Department for Education and Skills. Once registered, they must maintain satisfactory standards in respect of premises, accommodation, staffing and instruction. Independent boarding schools must also safeguard and promote the welfare of their pupils. For monitoring purposes they are inspected on a regular 6 year cycle either by OFSTED or by the Independent Schools Inspectorate in the case of schools belonging to the Independent Schools Council. In addition, independent schools are inspected by the fire brigade and, in the case of boarding schools, every three years by the National Care Standards Commission. Health and Safety requirements are considered by inspectors in the context of standards relating to premises and accommodation. More frequent inspections are undertaken where there are signs of failing and, where inspection evidence indicates that a school has fallen below the standards required, the Secretary of State has powers of enforcement which could lead to the closure of the school.

 The Government do not collect separate statistics on the incidence of teacher occupational stress, but do collect information on teacher absences and ill-health retirements and has commissioned research into the causes of these. They do not show any significant incidence of teacher stress as the cause for these events. In 2001&#150;02, for example, around 0.6 per cent. of teacher retirements occurred as a direct result of stress. Despite this, teaching is a demanding job and stress can be hidden by other health problems. The Government take very seriously the issue of stress in schools. We have concluded a national agreement with most teaching unions, the support staff unions and local authority employers over teacher workload; we have supported the setting-up of an independent 24-hour telephone counselling helpline for teachers, operated by the Teacher Support Network (formerly the Teachers' Benevolent Fund); and we are piloting with a number of LEAs a project aimed at spreading best practice in using support mechanisms to promote teacher health and welfare.

<a name="30203w26.html_para5">The potential disincentive effect of debt is one of the factors these studies haveconsidered. These studies, and the wider research literature, find that the decision to participate in higher education depends on many interdependent factors which are often shaped by the cultural, social, institutional and education backgrounds of individuals. The Department also commissions periodic surveys of students' income and expenditure. Amongst other things these provide an objective picture of students' financial position and how this is changing over time. The Department has recently commissioned a new survey of students' income and expenditure that will report later this year.

 The level of loan taken out by students will depend on their individual circumstances and choices, including the extent to which they work while in higher education. Students from lower income backgrounds will be eligible for fee remission and for the new HE grant. The level of maintenance loan will depend upon students' own choices and the level of maintenance loan to which they are entitled and whether they choose to live at home or study away. There are different maxima of maintenance loan dependent upon length of course and where the student lives e.g. more in London, less if they live at home. The level of loan taken out for fees will partly depend on the fee charged and partly on students' choices of whether to pay up front or to take advantage of the new policy to defer payment of fees which offer graduation.
<P>

<a name="30203w26.html_para6">The length of time to repay the loan after graduation will depend on the size of the loan taken out and on the salary the graduate is earning, it will also depend on whether the graduate makes any additional repayments from their own resources or from their employer.

 In the NHS Plan, the Government made a commitment to reduce under-nutrition by developing a hospital nutrition policy to improve the outcome of care of patients by 2004. A number of measures and strategies are in place to manage, monitor and screen patients for under-nutrition in hospitals.
<P>

<a name="30203w28.html_para7">In February 2001, the Government released the essence of care toolkit, which includes best practice standards for the provision and delivery of food that meets the specific nutritional needs of patients. Standards, identified by patients and professionals, include the screening and assessment of nutritional needs, creating a suitable environment in which to eat, providing assistance required to eat and noting and evaluating what is eaten.
<P>

<a name="30203w28.html_para8">Nutritional screening is also recommended for the care of specific groups, such as those outlined in the national service framework for older people.
<P>

<a name="30203w28.html_para9">The Better Hospital Food programme is improving the ways in which meals are prepared and served through a programme developed by patients, chefs and national health service staff. This also sets nutritional standards for hospital foods. A 24-hour catering service with a new NHS menu was introduced in 2001. The menu covers continental breakfast, cold drinks, mid-morning and afternoon snacks, light lunchtime meals and an improved two-course evening dinner.
<P>

<a name="30203w28.html_para10">Half of all hospitals will have ward housekeepers by 2004 to ensure that meals meet patient needs and that patients, particularly elderly people, are helped to eat the meals on offer and that the service patients receive is round the clock.

New ways of delivering NHS dentistry are about to be tested following the publication last year of the "Options for Change" report about the future of NHS dentistry.

 NHS Direct is keen to work with out-of-hours providers to ensure the seamless referral of patients needing out-of-hours medical care to the relevant provider.
<P>

<a name="30203w30.html_para0">In schemes in a number of parts of the country patients are referred with double triage directly to a home visit or primary care service appointments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what health provision his Department provides to prisons in Greater London; and if he will make a statement.  [94320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w30.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department of Health and the Prison Service have been working together to bring about a significant improvement in standards of prison health care. Under partnership arrangements introduced in April 2000, the Prison Service meets the costs of providing primary health care services to prisoners, while the National Health Service meets the costs of any secondary or tertiary health services they may need. The London prisons have already benefited from this partnership approach, which has, for example, led to NHS-funded, mental health in-reach teams being introduced in the seven closed Prison Service establishments in London.
<P>

<a name="30203w30.html_para2">We shall continue to promote the reform of health services for prisoners, which, over the next few years, will become part of the NHS. Funding responsibility for prison health services in England is being transferred from the Home Office to the Department of Health with effect from 1 April 2003.

<a name="30203w30.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We do not anticipate any of the laboratories losing their accommodation, as the appropriate level of funding will be transferred with the laboratories.
<P>

<a name="30203w30.html_para3">The chief executive of the National Health Service has written to the chief executives of all the NHS trusts receiving Public Health Laboratory Service laboratories, saying that he is sure they will embrace the services into the pathology service organisation.

<a name="30203w30.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) will be wound up only when the necessary primary legislation is in place. We are aware of the importance of a continued supply of microbiological media, of an appropriate quality, to the protection of public health from communicable diseases.
<P>

<a name="30203w30.html_para5">During 2003, we will be carrying out a review of the media supply operations currently performed by PHLS to identify the most appropriate management option and will be taking suitable measures to ensure this supply following the outcome of the review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w30.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Statistics for the number of public sector workers who have access to in-house occupational health care are not held centrally. It is for individual public sector organisations to keep their own records. Research funded by the Department of Health in 1999, the last year for which figures are available, show that 96 per cent. of national health service staff have in-house occupational health care. The NHS is not, however, responsible for occupational health care of other public sector workers. The responsibility lies with individual employers.

<P>
<a name="30203w31.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 As set out in the Government's strategy document, "Delivering 21st Century IT Support for the NHS", our vision for information and information technology is to connect delivery of the NHS Plan with the capabilities of modern information technologies.
<P>

<a name="30203w31.html_para0">In 2006&#150;07, it is planned to introduce telemedicine in general practitioners' surgeries for electrocardiograms and skin disease, ambulance telemonitoring in 20 per cent. of all emergency response vehicles and to make home telemonitoring available in 20 per cent. of homes requiring it.
<P>

<a name="30203w31.html_para1">There is considerable activity already taking place. A notable example is the Cornwall electronic patient record pilot that has implemented a successful use of telemedicine to support minor injuries units and there is fairly widespread take-up of teledermatology services.

 The New NHS was published in December 1997 (Cm 3807). A cancer waiting times multi-disciplinary working group was established and met in 1997.

A copy of the working group report is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30203w31.html_para2">The group made the recommendation that targets should be set to reduce cancer waiting times.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans he has to implement a dry homes scheme, in parallel with the Warm Homes Scheme delivered by the EAGA Partnership, to low income households in Northern Ireland.  [92095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Warm Homes Scheme offers a range of heating, draught proofing and energy efficiency measures to vulnerable people who own their home or rent from a private landlord. The homes of eligible people are surveyed by staff of the Eaga Partnership, and if it appears that works are required to repair or weather-proof the building, clients are advised to contact the Northern Ireland Housing Executive about its private sector grants scheme. There are currently no plans to implement further dry homes measures in parallel with the Warm Homes Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many <i>(a)</i> Home Start and <i>(b)</i> Sure Start projects supported by departmental or trust funding were provided in 2002&#150;03 in each district council area of Northern Ireland; and at what cost.  [93923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 With regard to Sure Start projects, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety does not provide funding directly to the individual 23 Sure Start projects but to the four Childcare Partnerships through the appropriate Health and Social Services Board. For financial year 2002&#150;03, the Department allocated a total of &#163;6.6 million across the four Childcare Partnerships. Information regarding allocations to each district council area is not available.

<a name="30203w32.html_para3">I am very aware of recent pressures on hospitals and the number of patients who have had to wait on trolleys before they can be admitted. A significant amount of planning was undertaken to ensure that additional services were available to help meet extra demand on services during winter and an additional &#163;4.5 million was allocated for this. A wide range of primary and community care measures is also being taken to minimise the number of potential hospital admissions.
<P>

<a name="30203w32.html_para4">Capacity is also being expanded at key hospitals. An additional 20 beds opened at the Ulster Hospital in December and extra beds are planned for Antrim, Craigavon and the Mater. I recently announced an extra &#163;17.4 million for hospital services next year, which will support this development and provide for further improvements in critical services such as cardiac surgery, renal dialysis, cancer and intensive care. An additional &#163;6 million will also be allocated next year to pay for more than 500 extra community care packages,

[93934]<P>

<P>
<a name="30203w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 A number of steps were taken by these hospitals to alleviate pressures on accident and emergency departments. In the Ulster Hospital, the hospital discharge team resettled 15 people on a fast-track basis to community care accommodation to make room for patients being admitted; they also utilised beds in Ards and Bangor Community Hospitals. At Belfast City Hospital, a 16-bed emergency receiving unit, which operates alongside the A&E department, was utilised to deal with emergency admissions and ensure that patients were admitted to the most appropriate wards. Antrim Area Hospital used its day surgery unit on a 24-hour basis to alleviate pressure and ensured as far as possible that patients were waiting on proper hospital beds rather than trolleys. In Craigavon Area Hospital, additional nursing staff were brought in to provide nursing care for patients on trolleys and the hospital also had a team of senior doctors assessing patients before admission.

<P>
<a name="30203w33.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The publication of the Draft Ards and Down Area Plan will inevitably change planning policy for the Down District Council area.
<P>

<a name="30203w33.html_para3">In line with current policy, the Draft Ards and Down Plan published on 10 December 2002 constitutes a material consideration in determining planning applications received ahead of any future Public Inquiry. The weight the Department attaches to the policies and proposals in the draft plan will depend on the nature of development proposals under consideration and if objections have been lodged in respect of specific policies or proposals.
<P>

<a name="30203w33.html_para4">Where no objections have been lodged to relevant policies in the draft plan, then considerable weight may be attached to those policies because of the strong possibility that they will be adopted and replace those in the existing plan. The converse may apply if there have been objections to relevant policies. However, much will depend on the nature of those objections and also whether there are representations in support of particular policies.
<P>

<a name="30203w33.html_para5">It may also be justifiable, in some circumstances to refuse planning permission on the grounds of prematurity. This may be appropriate in respect of development proposals which are individually so substantial or whose cumulative effect would be so significant, that to grant planning permission would prejudice the outcome of the plan process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w33.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Following the 1996 Housing Policy Review, housing associations took over responsibility for all new build social housing under the strategic direction of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE). There were two main reasons for this: firstly, under HM Treasury Rules any private funding provided to the NIHE, as an Non-Departmental Public Body, scores in public expenditure terms, whereas housing associations can lever in private finance; and, secondly, housing associations had demonstrated their ability to deliver the social housing programme. The NIHE, however, still retains new build powers, for instance, when housing associations are unable to undertake particular schemes. NIHE's role is to gauge demand, the type of dwellings required to satisfy the particular needs of the community and the identification of where new social houses need to be built.
<P>

<a name="30203w33.html_para10">The advantage in housing associations taking on the new build role is that by levering in private finance more social houses can be built for the same level of public money. The new build programme undertaken by housing associations is currently operating with approximately 70 per cent. public subsidy and 30 per cent. private finance. Since 1991, housing associations have attracted some &#163;190 million into the building programme. Without this additional funding either fewer houses would be built or other programmes would have to be cut in order to sustain the same level of new build.

 I can confirm that the plans for the retention of services on the railway line north of Ballymena are set out in the "Regional Transportation Strategy for Northern Ireland 2002&#150;2012" (RTS). The intention is to retain services on this line, subject to successful results from the introduction of new trains and improved infrastructure on the "core" network in the early stages of implementing the RTS. Hence, for the foreseeable future services will be retained on the railway line north of Ballymena, subject to safety procedures. However, no major improvements will be carried out until the assessments referred to above are concluded.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland will approve for those deemed medically appropriate new drug treatment for severe rheumatoid arthritis; and what assessment he has made of research from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Health Technology Board for Scotland on drugs for this condition.  [93920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The drugs Enbrel (Etanercept) and Remicade (Infliximab) have been available, where medically appropriate, in Northern Ireland since November 1999, for a number of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to existing drug therapies. The subsequent technology appraisal guidance issued in 2002 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommending selective use of these therapies, and its endorsement by the then Health Technology Board for Scotland, relate only to treatment with these drugs in England, Wales and Scotland respectively. Although Northern Ireland has no formal arrangement with NICE, the approach adopted to making these therapies available is broadly in line with NICE recommendations. It is my intention to make additional funds available in 2003&#150;04 for expensive drug therapies.

 The waiting list for new consultations in rheumatology in the Northern Health and Social Services Board area was closed in March 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what funding was allocated during 2002&#150;03 for new drug treatment for severe rheumatoid arthritis; and how much has been spent to date.  [93988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30203w34.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Within their initial allocation for 2002&#150;03, Health and Social Services Boards set aside &#163;1,140,000 to meet the costs of new drug treatments for severe rheumatoid arthritis. As part of the funding disbursed following June Monitoring, the Department allocated an additional &#163;3,000,000 to meet the costs of expensive hospital drugs. I understand that, of this sum, the boards have committed &#163;286,000 to provide for the anti-TNF treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis.

<a name="30203w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Beta interferon products and glatiramer are used in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis sufferers who meet criteria specified by the Association of British Neurologists. In Northern Ireland approximately 460 people, representing around 15 per cent. of those who suffer from Multiple Sclerosis, are being treated with beta interferon under closely monitored conditions to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy. This represents a treatment rate some five times higher than in the rest of the UK.

It also requires Northern Ireland Departments to advise business at least 12 weeks in advance of any legislation, which may affect it, and to provide appropriate guidance relating to implementation.

 In June 2001 responsibility for work permits was transferred from the Department for Education and Employment to the Home Office in order to integrate that function more closely into the wider immigration control administration. The Department for Employment and Learning had been issuing work permits to Northern Ireland employers under an administrative arrangement with DfEE.

 I have received representations from a number of right hon. and hon. Members on this matter. The Information Commissioner, who carries out his duties independently of Government, has a statutory duty to disseminate information about the operation of the Data Protection Act 1998. The previous Commissioner launched a public information campaign last year to alert organisations to the fact that while they may need to be on the register of data controllers, they should not be misled by businesses who have no statutory powers to maintain the register.
<P>

<a name="30203w34.html_para3">A warning that organisations which falsely imply that they have official status for data protection registration services are exploiting small businesses and causing problems for the Commissioner has been placed on his website at www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk. This advises anyone visited by the representatives of these businesses to notify the local police and anyone who wishes to complain about correspondence received from them to contact their local Trading Standards Office. There is a link to the Commissioner's warning notice on the Lord Chancellor's Department website at www.lcd.gov.uk.

 There are no current plans to alter the entitlement conditions to Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to reflect the costs of communication technology for people whose main disabling condition is deafness. Entitlement to DLA is based on the extent to which a severely disabled person requires attention, supervision or watching over by another person and/or has walking difficulties as a result of their disabilities. Activities for Managing Life (AMLs) is a model for a possible new way of assessing those requirements and difficulties but would not affect the fundamental rule that entitlement depends on each individual's personal care and mobility needs.

<a name="30203w35.html_para9">The following table shows the number of participants moving into jobs and sustained jobs since the programme was launched nationally in July 2001. A sustained job in the New Deal for Disabled People is defined as one lasting 26 weeks out of a 39-week period. Therefore, a number of people who have already moved into jobs have not yet reached the point at which that job can be regarded as sustained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make arrangements to refer calls to the Benefit Fraud hotline and the Targeting Fraud website, which relate to Asylum Support Fraud, to NASS fraud investigations.  [95129]<P>

<P>
<a name="30203w35.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Referrals to the Benefit Fraud hotline and the Targeting Fraud website relating to asylum seekers are already checked against departmental records to establish if a benefit is in payment. If a benefit is in payment, the allegation is passed to the local Counter-Fraud Investigation Service team who, in turn, notify the Immigration Service and the National Asylum Support Service (NASS). If benefit is not in payment, the allegation is passed directly to the Immigration Service and NASS.
