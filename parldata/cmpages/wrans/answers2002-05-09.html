<a name="20509w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average response time was for responding to departmental correspondence; what percentage of letters took longer than one month for a response; and what percentage took longer than three months for a response in each of the last five years.  [37442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Our Minister's correspondence database does not record details of response times and percentages of response times for the last five years. We can only provide this information for letters answered for the period since the formation of DEFRA on 8 June 2001 to 31 March 2002.

<P>

<a name="20509w01.html_para1">The Department suffered severe disruption last year due to allocating top priority to defeating the foot and mouth epidemic. Furthermore the sheer volume of correspondence received following the creation of DEFRA had a major impact on the Department's performance, resulting in a large backlog of letters. We have devoted more resources to clearing the backlog and we are making progress in improving response times.

<P>
<a name="20509w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The final decision on the make-up of the delegation to the summit will rest with the Prime Minister nearer the time. However, both the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will attend the summit. We are keen to ensure that all three pillars of sustainable development are represented in the ministerial element of the delegation.

 The majority of the montane area in the UK occurs in Scotland. Although montane habitats are very scarce in England there are 33 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) with an estimated 26,000 ha of land above 600 m. Several of these are also Natura 2000 sites designated in accordance with the EC wild birds and habitats directives.
<P>

<a name="20509w01.html_para2">In addition to protection measures afforded by notification as special sites (SSSIs, Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas), actions in hand include the establishment of six upland habitat action plans under the UK biodiversity action plan.

<a name="20509w01.html_para3">In England the hill farm allowance (HFA) was introduced in 2001 to provide support to beef and sheep producers in the less favoured areas in recognition of the difficulties they face and the vital role they play in maintaining the landscape and rural communities of the hills. Similar schemes operate in the devolved Administrations. HFA is linked to sustainable farming practices, forms part of the wider rural development programme and is WTO compatible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There are no current research projects on the environmental impact of Chernobyl on the United Kingdom. A great deal of work has been done in the past to understand and ameliorate the effects of radiocaesium on the environment and the food chain. The Food Standards Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs continue to monitor the effects of the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl in sheep and fresh water fish. Details of the latest monitoring results can be obtained from the Food Standards Agency's annual report "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment".

<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have set up and are funding the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote sustainable waste management by working to create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products and removing barriers to waste minimisation, re-use and recycling. Part of this work is to tackle issues relating to composting waste. Currently WRAP is working with the Composting Association to develop the existing industry standard for compost, to 



<P>
<P><I>9 May 2002 : Column 276W</I><P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> FMD related work still continues, however, for the purpose of my response, figures have been calculated from 22 January 2002. This is when FMD status (without vaccination), for the purpose of international trade was restored by the OIE.
<P>

<a name="20509w02.html_para0">At the start of the outbreak a total figure of 1,064.4 veterinary, technical and support staff were employed by the field service element of the State Veterinary Service (SVS), compared with 1,247.66 at the end of January 2002. This indicates an increase of 183.26.
<P>

<a name="20509w02.html_para1">A high proportion of this increase relates to the creation of an enhanced personnel and IT unit, the creation of the National Scrapie Administration Centre at Worcester along with recruitment of fixed term veterinary appointees and other staff at most levels.

 Our overall strategy is: to ensure that the housing needs of people in rural area, including key workers, are properly identified; to increase investment in new social housing; to maximise delivery of affordable housing through the planning system; and to make the best use of existing property. We expect to deliver around 9,000 affordable homes annually in rural areas by 2003&#150;04 through these measures as announced in the Rural White Paper. This should provide greater opportunities for key workers in rural areas where local authorities have identified affordable key worker housing as a priority need.
<P>

<a name="20509w02.html_para9">Our Starter Home Initiative (SHI) is specifically helping key workers in England to buy a home in urban and rural areas where the high cost of housing is undermining recruitment and retention. &#163;230 million SHI funding was allocated to local scheme providers in September 2001, including some &#163;8.7 million to help around 360 key workers to buy homes in rural settlements with a population of 3,000 or less. We expect to announce the allocation of a further &#163;20 million SHI funding to successful bidders later this month.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20509w02.html_para10">Granting Good Quality Combined Heat and Power (GQCHP) a full exemption from the Climate Change Levy (CCL) will encourage the use of this energy-efficient technology, and support the achievement of the Government's target of at least 10 gigawatts (GWe) of GQCHP by 2010. GQCHP achieves a 25 to 35 per cent. reduction in primary energy use relative to traditional forms of electricity generation, and therefore produces less carbon emissions per GWe. The amount of carbon saved depends on which technologies and fuels are displaced by GQCHP.
<P>

<a name="20509w02.html_para11">The DTI and DEFRA are assessing the economic and environmental potential of GQCHP under various energy price and policy scenarios, including the full exemption from CCL. This work will be published shortly, alongside the Government's CHP Strategy.

 Using methane from abandoned mines will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and therefore has a significant environmental benefit. The scale of the environmental benefit cannot be precisely quantified at present, because the effect of pumping the gas leads to some acceleration in the extraction rate beyond the level of natural leakage from abandoned mines. Work is in hand to inform these estimates.

We are also in close touch with the Governments of Tanzania and Burundi, and with UNHCR, on resolving the question of the large number of Burundian refugees still in refugee camps in Tanzania.

 The Government of Tanzania agreed with the World Bank to review its civil aviation requirements in consultation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The ICAO has been in Tanzania to undertake this review and will report to the World Bank and Government of Tanzania. It is not possible to determine the impact of the purchase of an air traffic control system until the ICAO report is issued and the Government of Tanzania and the World Bank have considered it.

 The peace process in the DRC falls within the framework of the 1999 Lusaka Peace Agreement to which Tanzania was not a signatory. However Tanzania is clearly interested in the stability of the Great Lakes region as a whole, particularly in relation to Burundi because of the large number of Burundian refugees currently in camps in Tanzania. The Tanzanian Government are active in seeking to persuade the Burundian rebel groups to agree a ceasefire with the Burundian Government. We continue to press for a full and inclusive settlement to the DRC conflict within the framework of the Lusaka Agreement, which inter alia provides for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in the DRC including those of Zimbabwe.

We are implementing diversity training as part of our management development programmes, have adopted a requirement for all senior staff to have a diversity component in their personal objectives, and have continued to insist on the application of an equal opportunities policy in respect of a wide range of other criteria (including age and sexual orientation) in all aspects of our employment policies.

But the policy is one of continuous improvement and in October (in advance of the operative date of the EU equal treatment directive) the Department expects to implement a new personnel database system which will provide important baseline data against which overall progress can be measured in more quantitative terms thereafter.

These are available at www.dfid.gov.uk or through our public inquiry point, tel. 01355 843132. The empowerment of women is an essential precondition for the elimination of world poverty. This goal is recognised in the internationally agreed set of development targets which provide the core framework for DFID's programme.

Project equipment has also been embargoed by the Israeli authorities, but it has often been possible to circumvent this by creative means.

The levels of the allowances were increased by 3.5 per cent. from 1 April, further to the 30 per cent. increases in 2001, and the structure of the allowances was unchanged. The level for inner London is &#163;3,105 and the level for outer London is &#163;2,043. London allowances will be kept under review for future years. Schools are free to make use of recruitment and retention allowances as circumstances demand.

Performance against service standards, together with compliance with legislative and other requirements, is actively managed by the Department's finance, contract and internal audit teams.

 Broadband internet access (2mbs or better) is provided through regional broadband consortia (RBCs). The target for August 2002 is for 20 per cent. of all schools (including 100 per cent. of secondaries) to have broadband connections. From the latest consortia returns (28 February 2002):

 The work of the fire service college contributes directly to the Department's aim of safe communities and its objectives of improving health and safety by reducing risks from work activity, buildings and fire. Its role is to deliver modern vocational training to the fire service of a type and to a standard that fully meets brigades' needs. The college should operate cost- effectively and should enthusiastically meet the diversity requirements of its customers and employees. In this context, I have agreed the following six targets for the fire service college in 2002&#150;03.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. To maximise the fire service college's contribution to the Government's programme to improve health, education and transport and reduce crime by:</FONT></UL>

The DCMS were not a party to any negotiations on rent. The prevailing average rent for that particular building prior to this rent being agreed is not known, as this figure is a matter between the landlord and the former tenants. However, the rental figure was in line with the average market rent for the properties in that area. Lambert Smith Hampton, Property Management, acted for the Home Office in the lease negotiations.

 The major contributors to the funding of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) amounting to approximately 70 per cent. of the OPCW's budget are: the United States (22 per cent.), Japan (20 per cent.), Germany (10 per cent.), France (7 per cent.), UK (6 per cent.) and Italy (5 per cent.). The UK, France and Italy have paid their contributions for 2002 in full. The United States and Germany usually make staged payments and have so far paid approximately 50 per cent. of their 2002 contributions. Japan is expected to pay the entire amount of its 2002 contribution around the middle of this year.

 Opportunities for British Ministers to meet representatives of the Cambodian Government are limited. Cambodia does not have an embassy in London and plays only a limited role internationally. The last Foreign Office Minister to meet representatives of the Cambodian Government was the late Derek Fatchett in May 1998 during a visit to Cambodia. But British officials are in regular contact with the Cambodian Government through our embassy in Phnom Penh. We are keen to enhance UK/Cambodian relations and the Foreign Secretary wrote to his Cambodian counterpart in November 2001 encouraging the Cambodian Government to re-establish an embassy in London.

 In almost all cases it is a legal requirement for pension scheme trustees to register details of their schemes with the Pension Schemes Registry which is run by the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra). On registration, trustees are required to tell the Registry for example: whether the scheme is an open, closed or frozen scheme; and whether the scheme provides money purchase benefits, benefits other than money purchase benefits, or a combination of both. Trustees must, by law, notify the Registry of any change to this information within 12 months of the occurrence of that change. If trustees, without reasonable cause, fail to comply with this requirement Opra can fine them.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information is based on data held by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR). It covers all schemes including those offering salary-related benefits, money-purchase benefits and mixed benefits as well as schemes where the benefit type is not recorded in the PSR system.<P>

2. A scheme's status will be one of the following. Open schemes admit new members. Closed schemes do not admit new active members, but allow existing members to continue to accrue benefits. Frozen schemes do not allow any future accruals. Schemes starting to wind up are also frozen. Schemes that have completed wind up have no members&#151;all assets are realised and all liabilities are discharged. Column (a) shows all changes in status with an effective date during the specified year.<P>

3. The PSR system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status and the effective date of the change. Because of the way the data are held a later change will overwrite an earlier change, so data for earlier years become increasingly inaccurate. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there is likely to be a lag before the data reflects what is happening currently. <P>

 When disability living allowance recipients aged 16 or over have been in hospital for 28 days, payments are suspended pending their discharge. This is because DLA is paid as a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people as a result of their disabilities. In hospital, the disability related needs giving rise to those costs are met free of charge, and to continue payment of DLA in these circumstances would amount to duplicate provision from public funds. Information is not available on the annual number of suspensions resulting from these circumstances. The latest available information is that, at 30 November 2001, about 11,700 claims were at that time recorded as suspended as a result of a stay in hospital.

<a name="20509w15.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Work Permits (UK) require any employer or agency acting as the employer to sign the "Employer's Declaration" on the work permit application form, which binds them to the criteria of the work permit arrangements. In this way, teacher agencies are treated in the same way as any other United Kingdom employer in ensuring that a contract of employment for the individual is in place.

<P>

<a name="20509w15.html_para2">A contract of employment is required as an overseas teacher should be afforded the same terms and conditions of employment as those of a resident teacher. Anyone working on a contract-for-services basis is not regarded as being "employed" under the work permit arrangements, rather they are regarded as being "self-employed". For this reason, an agency recruiting an individual who is working solely on a contract-for-services basis would not be granted a work permit.

<a name="20509w15.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Checks made on people applying for indefinite leave to remain will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. While the Immigration and Nationality Directorate aims to deal with 70 per cent. of non-asylum applications within three weeks, the need to make further inquiries, including security checks, may affect this. Within that overall target, there are no specific targets for applications which may require security checks, and on security and international relations grounds it would be inappropriate for me to list countries where there are particular difficulties.

 The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) does not hold statistical information in the format requested.

For the calendar year 2000, NCIS received 18,048 disclosures (in total). Which were all forwarded to law enforcement for action as necessary. (Only 0.42 per cent. and 1.35 per cent. were received in that year from accountants and solicitors respectively). To date NCIS has received feedback in 11,047 cases and in 9,082 (82 per cent.) of these replies the police force or law enforcement agency recorded that the reports had assisted law enforcement efforts.

For example, Her Majesty's Prison Dovegate was delayed due to the possibility of a judicial review by a local action group: Hassockfield STC due to planning appeals; changes of strategy from refurbishment of existing buildings to new build in the case of HOCLAS; and problems concluding preferred bidder stage necessitating further negotiation and an invitation to tender for best and final offers on the IT2000 project.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases have been brought against his Department under the Human Rights Act 1998; and what has been the cost in <i>(a)</i> legal fees to defend cases and <i>(b)</i> compensation payments.  [45063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w15.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We do not collect central records of all cases in which the Human Rights Act 1998 is relied on. Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge. We will not always know whether a case has been brought against the Home Office, because the Courts are under no obligation to inform us. It would take a disproportionate amount of time and expense to try to compile such a record, even if cases could always be categorised as "being brought . . . under the Human Rights Act 1998".
<P>

<a name="20509w15.html_para5">We do not collect separate information centrally about the costs to public funds, legal fees or compensation payments which include a human rights issue. In most cases it will be difficult to single out associated costs relating to the human rights element.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> Eventually all asylum seekers will pass through induction centres. Those seeking National Asylum Support Service accommodation will remain in the induction centre for approximately seven days; whereas those seeking NASS financial support only or no NASS support at all, will remain in the centre for approximately one day&#151;this may, in some cases, involve an overnight stay.
<P>

<a name="20509w16.html_para3">It is envisaged those asylum seekers who are to be housed in accommodation centres in the future, will remain in the induction centre for around two days, while appropriate arrangements are made for their transfer.
<P>

<a name="20509w16.html_para4">The cost of introducing induction centres has been kept to a minimum. The Dover induction centre required additional funding for a small number of staff, (and related resources, such as information technology), within migrant helpline to deliver the more comprehensive detailed briefing. In addition a local team of staff has been created, by means of local recruitment and the introduction of a NASS office in the area, (the site of which is yet to be finalised). The introduction of induction centres will negate the need to use expensive bed and breakfast type housing on an emergency basis.
<P>

<a name="20509w16.html_para5">The establishment of the induction centre in Dover has assisted in a faster dispersal of asylum-seekers to NASS accommodation throughout the country, despite the fluctuating numbers arriving there; and the streamlining

These centres will, of course, replace a significant amount of emergency accommodation currently used to house NASS applicants in inner London. In addition, a number of smaller centres within the regions will be established. Again the opening of such centres will be closely linked to the present use of emergency accommodation in related areas and the possibility of regionalising some of the work carried out by NASS staff.

 <i>[holding answers 30 April 2002]:</i> In the course of consultation on the Auld report on the criminal courts, many organisations and individuals who commented on the proposed intermediate tier and abolition of the right to elect suggested that an increase in magistrates sentencing powers might serve as an alternative means of reducing the burden on the Crown court. Similar views were expressed during consultation following the Halliday report on sentencing, particularly in response to the proposed sentence of custody plus, as when imposed in full this sentence would be outside magistrates current powers.

 Our policy is to site accommodation centres in non-urban areas in order to reduce the overall burden placed upon local services in urban areas.

We have not discussed the location of United Kingdom asylum accommodation centres with our European Union counterparts, but we are drawing on the European experience as we develop our plans.

 On 15 January 2002, we announced a temporary suspension of returns of unsuccessful asylum applicants to Zimbabwe. We will resume returns only when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so, and not before. We are monitoring events in the aftermath of the Zimbabwe presidential election in close liaison with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). There is no set time scale, but it would be unrealistic to be able to make any decision on a resumption of removals until the immediate post-election situation has calmed down and we have had time to assess properly the risks to returnees and gather and consider the views of FCO and others.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> Asylum seekers are able to access legal advice to assist them with their applications and this should include information about their rights under international conventions. All unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum are referred to the Refugee Council's Panel of Advisers, a non- statutory body which acts as adviser to the child in his or her dealings with the Home Office and other agencies for the duration of the asylum claim.

 Mr. Brown's application was received by the Criminal Case Review Commission on 2 October 1997. It was routinely allocated to a case review manager on 21 October 1999. It remains under review. The progress of cases is as expeditious as possible taking into account the factors of individual cases. The Commission does not publicly release details of its cases or their applicants.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> Applicants are housed on a full-board basis. Migrant Helpline and the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) provide support services daily leading to dispersal within seven days of arrival. Those who do not seek NASS support are fully briefed about the asylum process in the United Kingdom and an interview is arranged on their behalf.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> The fast track asylum facility operated at the Oakington Reception Centre is a key element within the Government's overall strategy for processing asylum applicants as speedily as possible. Subject to the outcome of the appeal to the House of Lords, we intend that the fast track process will continue to operate as at present. We fully expect to have the use of the Oakington facility until October 2004 but, in view of the outstanding judicial proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.

<a name="20509w18.html_para1">As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and my right hon. Friend his predecessor (Mr. Straw) have said on a number of occasions, increases in spending on communications activities have largely come about for two reasons. Firstly, the expansion of the Home Office Press Office, which took effect in late 2000, was to cope with the widened responsibilities&#151;particularly relating to the Government's reform programme and a significant increase in demand from the media. The second expansion has been on marketing and advertising where a number of substantial and important public information campaigns were mounted&#151;including fire safety, electoral registration, and vehicle crime reduction and, more recently, the continuing highly effective police recruitment campaign which has contributed greatly to the achievement of the highest level of police officers.

<a name="20509w19.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government continue to press for rapid implementation of the HIPC debt relief initiative. At the IMF/World bank spring meetings we secured agreement that there needed to be a full review of HIPC for consideration at the annual meetings in October. This review will ensure that all countries in the HIPC initiative achieve sustainable levels of debt. Already countries are receiving debt relief worth $1.7 billion in 2001&#150;02 which is being used to increase spending on education, health and other key poverty reducing areas.

<a name="20509w19.html_para3">The benefits of the HIPC initiative remain open to all poor countries that are heavily indebted. However it is clear that many poor countries that have only moderate levels of indebtedness none the less need additional finance if they are to achieve the millennium development goals.

 Under the HIPC framework countries must demonstrate their commitment towards poverty reduction prior to qualifying for debt relief.

Upon reaching decision point, countries start receiving interim relief and continue to develop their full poverty reduction strategy. Most countries will have implemented their poverty reduction strategy for a year prior to exiting the HIPC

 We will bring forward legislation for the community investment tax credit in the Finance Bill. Organisations will then be able to apply for tax credit status during 2002&#150;03, subject to State Aids approval for the measure.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the cost of film tax relief in 2004&#150;05 after the Budget 2002 measures have been implemented.  [53579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 It is estimated that the gross amount of relief given under section 48 Finance (No.2) Act 1997 given in 2004&#150;05 will be &#163;320 million. When compared with tax relief that would be available in the absence of section 48 reliefs the net tax cost is &#163;70 million. The net tax cost of other film tax reliefs in that year is estimated at a further &#163;70 million. The decision in Budget 2002 to restrict eligibility to British feature films intended for cinema release will reduce the amount of relief in 2004&#150;05 by &#163;295 million.

 There are 575,000 families with children in the south-west. Around 90 per cent. of these families will be eligible for the child tax credit, which together with child benefit will deliver up to &#163;54.25 in support for the first child from April 2003. There are currently 105,000 families with children in the south-west benefiting from the working families' tax credit.

 The landfill tax was introduced on 1 October 1996 and raised &#163;0.4 billion in its first full year. The projected revenue from the landfill tax was published on 17 April in the Financial Statement and Budget Report 2002. The administrative cost of collecting the landfill tax is less than &#163;2 million per annum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20509w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Government policy is to stimulate enterprise and entrepreneurship in its various forms, and not to support one group of businesses over another. Both incorporation and non-incorporation offer a range of benefits to small businesses. The choice as to whether to incorporate or not is influenced by multiple factors, many of which are firm-specific, for example the personal circumstances of the owner(s). The Government take the view that businesses themselves are best placed to assess the relative benefits of different legal structures, and to decide which is most appropriate for them.

<P>
<a name="20509w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government introduced a 150 per cent. accelerated payable tax credit in Budget 2001 for owners and investors for the costs they incur in cleaning up contaminated sites. This measure will make the development of these sites more viable. There are no other differences in the tax treatment of brownfield and greenfield sites.

<P>

<a name="20509w21.html_para2">The framework is supported by a set of national NHS performance indicators. The indicators published in February 2002 included a number of measures of patient/carer experience, including an indicator of hospital cleanliness and information on the handling of complaints. We are currently developing indicators to reflect patients' views, based on comprehensive surveys, initially of acute in-patients, on food and other issues that are of importance to them.

<a name="20509w21.html_para3">In April 2000 the Government introduced a maximum price scheme for controlling the price of specified generic medicines.

In addition, in July 2001 the Department issued a consultation paper on proposals for NHS controls over the future supply and pricing of NHS generic medicines. In compliance with best practice these initiatives required that information and opinions be sought from those companies and organisations affected by the Department's initiatives. Accordingly officials met with and received representations from many interested parties, including Generics UK, Kent Pharmaceuticals, Regent-GM Laboratories, Norton Healthcare/Ivax and Ranbaxy UK.

<sup>(26)</sup> Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> Figures where sum of staff in post and vacancies is less than 10.<P>

<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> Figures where previously published, where the trusts have advised that the figures supplied were incorrect.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Three month vacancies are vacancies as at 31 March 2001 which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents).<P>

2. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post from the September 2000 medical and dental and non-medical work force censuses (whole time equivalent).<P>

3. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

4. Totals may not equal sum of component parts due to rounding.<P>

5. HA figures are based on trusts, and do not necessarily reflect the geographical provision of health care.<P>

6. Due to the way vacancy data have been collected it has sometimes been necessary to provide combined vacancy data information for certain trusts.<P>

7. Due to combined vacancy data being used and rounding calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<P>

8. Figures may not match previously published data due to a different method of rounding used on the staff in post data. <P>

Additional amounts may have been awarded for particular grades or sub-groups of staff in particular years. The figures for nurses and ancillary staff for 1995&#150;96 and 1996&#150;97 are estimates as these included an element of local pay.

<a name="20509w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I understand that National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended that irinotecan and oxaliplatin should be used in specific clinical circumstances. We set up NICE to give authoritative guidance on when it is clinically and cost effective to use drugs and other treatments. NICE has undertaken a full appraisal of irinotecan, oxaliplatin and raltitrexed and has also considered an appeal against its initial decision. In the light of this, I do not expect NICE to review its decision except as part of its usual processes. The review will take place in April 2005, or earlier if significant new evidence becomes available.
