 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if she will bring forward proposals to require two pathologists to attend an initial post mortem for a murder inquiry for the purpose of ensuring greater clarity on the cause of death and to reduce the possibility of unnecessary delays to an inquiry.

 I do not believe it would be proportionate to require two forensic pathologists to attend every suspicious death post-mortem examination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="101115w0001.htm_para38"><a name="1011155000671">The attendance of two forensic pathologists would significantly increase the costs of the examination and would create additional costs throughout the inquest and criminal justice system processes. Given the number of available forensic pathologists it would also delay the examination in a significant number of cases. This could be justified only if there were clear and substantial benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="101115w0001.htm_para39"><a name="1011155000672">Currently the coroner instructs a forensic pathologist, routinely one on the Home Office Register of forensic pathologists, to perform the examination. The pathologist will perform the examination, according to standards established by the Home Office and Royal College of Pathologists, and prepare a report. In all cases the report is subject to a critical conclusions check by another forensic pathologist prior to issue. The pathologist will also arrange a more extensive "peer review" in more complex cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="101115w0001.htm_para40"><a name="1011155000673">Of the 2,500 to 3,000 suspicious death post-mortem examinations each year about one-third are determined to be homicide. In many of the homicide cases the cause of death is not in dispute and, where it is, this is often based on a disagreement as to the interpretation of the findings established at the examination rather than the accuracy of the findings. Such issues, frequently, becomes clear only when a pathologist is instructed, and has information provided to him, by the defence-which routinely occurs some time after the initial post-mortem examination. It therefore appears that a second pathologist being present at the initial examination would not improve the standards of the examination or, in a significant number of cases, alter (a) the outcome of the examination or (b) the level of dispute that arises in the case.</p>

 The statistics for the amount of military low flying carried out in the UK Military Low Flying System is recorded in hours rather than by the number of passes or sorties, as this is deemed to be more representative of the level of activity within the system. Data are recorded by the training year (April to March) rather than by calendar year. The figures for the training year 2010-11 will be published in the next statement on the pattern of military low flying that will be available in the House in summer 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="101115w0002.htm_para3"><a name="1011155000808">The majority of operational low flying is conducted by fast-jet aircraft, with a lesser amount being conducted by C-130 Hercules aircraft based at RAF Lyneham. Operational low flying is not conducted by rotary wing aircraft. In 2004, fast-jet aircraft conducting operational low flying were the Jaguar based at RAF Coltishall, the Harrier based at RAF Cottesmore, and the Tornado GR4 based at RAF Marham and RAF Lossiemouth. Since 2004, the Jaguar has been retired from service, and in 2010 fast-jet operational low flying is only conducted by the Harrier and Tornado GR4.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="101115w0002.htm_para4"><a name="1011155000809">Prior to 2010, records were maintained by a manual system that enabled the total amount of operational low flying to be calculated for each tactical training area. These figures are primarily used to regulate the total amount of operational low flying conducted according to the relative size of each tactical training area, and also to enable a year-on-year comparison of this training activity. To ascertain the level of detail requested regarding aircraft type, individual sortie duration and the airbase of origin would require a detailed review of each squadron's authorisation paperwork over the requested period, and would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="101115w0002.htm_para5"><a name="1011155000810">From 2010, a system has been developed to enable manual data returns from each squadron to be recorded electronically to produce more detailed statistics.

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2010]:</i> We estimate that the potential increase in average fares and average reduction in bus services, as a direct result of the 20% reduction to the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG), would be around 1.5%. In practice, the effect will depend on the commercial decisions of bus operators and, where relevant, local authorities and Transport for London.</p>

They were hopeful that, in general, the small reduction in BSOG could be absorbed without fares having to rise.</p>

 In 2009, the Department for Transport commissioned an independent evaluation of the Cycling City and Towns programme, which includes infrastructure investment, cycle training (Bikeability), and other measures to encourage more people to cycle more often, and more safely. The evaluation is scheduled to run until 2012, with final results available in 2012-13.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="101115w0002.htm_para26"><a name="1011157000091">Results from preliminary evaluation of the original six cycling demonstration towns (CDTs) are available. They have shown changes in the levels of cycling and physical activity in CDTs across a range of indicators, including a one percentage point increase in the proportion of people cycling for 30 minutes at least three times a week, and a 27% increase in levels of cycling as measured by automatic cycle counts. These findings strongly suggest that cycling levels were increasing in the CDTs three years after the initiative began, with some evidence that similar increases were not occurring in comparable areas.</p>

This information is available in HS2 Ltd's main report, published in March 2010, and available at:</p>

http://83.244.183.180/ESA/esa_additional_feb10.xls<br>
3. Benefit type: The type of ESA is defined as pay status at the caseload date. This may differ to the status at the start or end of the claim.<br>
4. Employment and support allowance (ESA) replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid.<br>
5. Stage of ESA claim: The stage of claim is derived from the amount of payment a claimant receives. There are a number of cases where the stage is unknown, these are claimants which do not receive any payment for ESA (These are those who receive national insurance credits only).<br>
6. ICD (disease) code: Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. Medical condition is based on evidence provided at the start of the claim, this in itself does not confer entitlement to employment support allowance and may not represent a claimant's most recent medical condition. For ESA claimants data on medical condition are only available from February 2010 onwards.<br>

2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
5. These statistics are based on incomes Before Housing Costs.<br>
6. Each of the measures is defined as:<br>
Relative poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.<br>
Absolute poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms.<br>

 A G-rated boiler has a seasonal efficiency of less than 70%. Boiler efficiency has been steadily increased through amendments to the Building Regulations which required the installation of more efficient replacement boilers. The minimum performance requirement of a boiler was increased to 90% in October, when the 2010 amendment to part L of the regulations came into force. Each year, 1.5 million domestic boilers are sold in the UK. As a consequence of building regulations and the clear message that this sends out about the need to replace inefficient boilers, we estimate that there will be virtually no G-rated boilers by 2020.</p>

These show that the chances of achieving this goal are significantly increased if countries deliver emission reductions which will result in global greenhouse gas emissions reaching an early peak (within the next decade) and falling quickly to at least 50% below 1990 levels in 2050 and even lower levels thereafter.</p>

 We are firmly committed to boosting the supply of Apprenticeships, in particular at Level 3 and above, which is why one of this Government's first actions was to announce an additional 50,000 adult places for the 2010-11 financial year. This will take the total starts for apprentices of all ages to well over 300,000 this year. For future years we are increasing annual funding for adult apprenticeships by up to £250 million before the end of the spending review period. Therefore by 2014-15, this Government will have in place sufficient funding for 75,000 more adult Apprenticeships places than were provided under the previous Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="101115w0004.htm_para39"><a name="10111529000142">In this current public expenditure climate we must realise that expanding and improving the Apprenticeship programme depends in no small measure on our ability to persuade a larger and more diverse range of businesses to employ apprentices. We are therefore reducing bureaucracy and making the system simpler for employers and are considering how we might better support employers through improved funding arrangements. Just this month, we joined forces with business leaders and the National Apprenticeships Service (NAS) to launch a new campaign to urge more employers to take on Apprenticeships. Our future plans for Apprenticeships will be set out in more detail in our skills strategy which we will publish shortly.</p>

 Under the insolvency provisions contained in the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Redundancy Payments Service of the Insolvency Service (an Executive agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) can make payment of unpaid wages from the National Insurance Fund (within statutory limits) to employees but only if the employer is legally insolvent as defined under the 1996 Act. Essentially, if the employer is a company, that means the company is in liquidation, administration or has entered into a company voluntary arrangement. If the company is not legally insolvent, employees can seek to recover the wages they are owed through the courts and they can ultimately petition the court to have the company wound up (liquidated), which would enable them to make a claim on the National Insurance Fund.</p>

Once a payment is made from the National Insurance Fund, the Redundancy Payments Service will seek to recover that payment from the employer, whenever possible.</p>

 There are three forthcoming appointments to the Board of the National Heritage Memorial and Heritage Lottery Fund. Two of these will be advertised imminently and represent an opportunity to broaden knowledge of the heritage of the regions of England, further enhance expertise in the historic environment, and build on the board's understanding of how diverse communities can be engaged with heritage and culture. In addition, there will be a need for a new Trustee for Scotland when the incumbent stands down in March.</p>
