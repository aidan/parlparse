 <i>[holding answer 8 July 1999]:</i> No benefits are currently paid as tax credits. The Government have, however, already announced that the new Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit will be paid through the pay packet from April 2000. This will demonstrate the link between reward and work, encourage take-up, and improve work incentives.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the Government's policy relating to gold sales; and if he will estimate the job losses there <i>(a)</i> have been and <i>(b)</i> will be in third world countries which produce gold, with particular reference to South Africa.  [91879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90720w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 As they will be spread out over a number of years, UK gold sales will be modest in the context of the world gold market. The 125 tonnes to be sold this year amounts to around 5 per cent. of estimated annual mining supply and less than a tenth of 1 per cent. of IMF estimates of above ground stocks of gold. Sales on this scale are unlikely to have a significant sustained impact on the price of gold.

 Reducing the National Insurance Contributions rates for employees, the self-employed and employers by 0.5 per cent. would cost about &#163;2.9 billion in 2000-01.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what new data series separated by gender, race, disability and age have been commissioned by his Department since June 1997.  [90826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90720w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 HM Treasury has not commissioned any new internal data series separated by gender, race, disability and age since June 1997. However, the Department has long-established procedures for routinely monitoring staff in post numbers and the outcome of recruitment, promotion and appraisal exercises by gender and race. In addition, an Equality Audit of the posting, appraisal and promotion procedures, by gender and race, will be undertaken later this year.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para6">HM Customs and Excise has not carried out any national internal surveys, but several surveys have been carried out locally. Customs is also considering carrying out a national survey in the near future.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para7">The Inland Revenue has not completed a full Departmental internal staff survey separated by gender, race, disability and age since June 1997. However, a full Departmental survey is currently being issued to everyone in the Department. The survey will concentrate on human resource issues such as training and development, motivation, equality and impressions of the Revenue as an employer. Survey respondents are invited to state their sex, ethnicity, if they have a disability as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act, their age and if they work part-time or full-time. Key results of the survey will be made available to everyone in the Department.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para8">A disability survey will be taken forward later this year. As part of the survey everyone in the Department will be asked to state if they have any disabilities and the nature of those disabilities.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para9">The Revenue routinely monitors issues such as performance management results and staff in posts by band (grade) separated by gender, race, disability, part-time and full-time and since 1998, by age. The Revenue is in the process of monitoring vacancy filling by gender, race, disability, part-time and full-time and age.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para10">National Savings monitors its external recruitment to ensure there are no biases, but has carried out no internal surveys since June 1997 on gender, race, disability or age.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para11">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) routinely collects information from all applicants for jobs on gender, race and disability. Information about age is collected from those who take up posts. Internally it publishes annual information about performance marks by gender, ethnic origin and disability.
<P>

<a name="90720w01.htm_para12">In June of this year, all ONS staff were asked to complete a questionnaire about disability. The results of this are being analysed at present. At the same time, staff who had not previously declared their ethnic origin were asked to do so.

<P>

 The three software companies used by most local education authorities have released the final version of their software to those LEAs.

 There are arrangements for students to make complaints if they are not satisfied with the processing of their applications for student support.

 The UK Passport Agency forecasts the number of passport applications on the basis of financial years. The forecasts published in the Agency's 1998-2001 Corporate Plan were 4.5 million in 1998-99 and 5.0 million in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90720w04.htm_para0">During the year, the Agency revised its 1998-99 forecasts upwards from 4.5 million to 4.9 million to allow for a greater take up of children's passports than its statistical model forecast. In the event, the actual intake for 1998-99 was 4.8 million.
<P>

<a name="90720w04.htm_para1">The Agency continues to analyse the impact on its forecast for 1999-2000 of its recent operational problems and the measures implemented as a result.
<P>

<a name="90720w04.htm_para2">On available information, the Agency's latest forecast for 1999-2000 is for 5.2 million applications which again makes greater allowance for the effect of the child policy against the modelled 5.0 million.

 The White Paper on International Development makes clear that fresh water resources are essential for sustaining life, development and the environment. Access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene education is vital to poor people's health and well-being. We ensure that our support for the provision of potable water is integrated with improved sanitation and hygiene education. With the increasing

<P>

<a name="90720w04.htm_para8">We are increasing commitments on water supply and sanitation projects. In all, we funded approximately 175 projects in 1998-99. Expenditure was &#163;11 million on rural water supply and sanitation and &#163;16 million on urban water supply and sanitation. In total, we spent &#163;45 million in the water sector, including water resources management. Of this 52 per cent. was in Africa (notably, Ghana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda and Tanzania); 39 per cent. in Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China) and the remaining 9 per cent. was spread between South America, Middle East and Eastern Europe.

<a name="90720w05.htm_para0">Information on the value and annual income of individual investments is commercially sensitive. In total, the cost of CDC's investments before provisions, as published in the Report and Accounts for 1998, was &#163;1,520.6 million. Provisions of &#163;319.2 million bring the net portfolio at cost less provision down to &#163;1,201.4 million. These figures take no accounts of surpluses in value over cost on any of CDC's equity investments as CDC's accounts are based on the historic cost convention. However, as part of the process of moving towards valuation accounting, CDC valued its equity portfolio as at 31 December 1998 in accordance with the British Venture Capital Association guidelines and this showed an unrealised surplus in valuation of &#163;99 million.

 Our development assistance for Bangladesh is provided on grant terms.

Technical assistance has been offered on this issue. A new project has recently been agreed which aims to facilitate public/private partnerships. This will help in the power sector among others. This technical assistance will be geared primarily towards the establishment of appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks and the development, marketing and tendering of projects suitable for private sector participation.

<P>

<a name="90720w05.htm_para3">Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) routinely cover exports to a number of countries. Any country initially specified on an OIEL application but not included as a permitted destination on the licence is not recorded on the Export Control Organisation's computer databases. Accordingly, the number of applications for OIELs covering exports to any particular country could be established only by manual examination of the paper records of all of the applications made in the period, which would entail disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90720w05.htm_para4">Between 2 May 1997 and 18 June 1999, 114 applications were received for Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) covering the export to consignees or end-users in Indonesia of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the so-called Military List. None of these applications covered Hawk aircraft. In the same period, no Standard or Open Individual Export Licences covering such exports were revoked.

<a name="90720w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce today some significant improvements in Government supported shipbuilding finance under the Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme.
<P>

<a name="90720w06.htm_para0">I am delighted to say that these improvements are one of the early outcomes of the Shipbuilding Forum, which I established last summer, to bring together all the major Industry, union and Government representatives to examine ways of improving the competitiveness of the shipbuilding sector. The Government are actively contributing to these outcomes. I believe that these 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 1999 : Column: 474</I><P>
improvements, recommended by the Shipbuilding Forum, will put the UK Scheme on a par with the best finance schemes among our EU competitors.
<P>

<a name="90720w06.htm_para1">The Scheme, which currently offers soft credit financing support in pounds sterling and at fixed interest rates to help UK yards win new shipbuilding orders, will now be extended to offer support for loans in US dollars and euros and to provide DTI guarantees in support of loans at floating as well as fixed rates. It is moreover our aim that the Scheme should be more flexible in its operation and to this end loans under the Scheme will be considered in a combination of the permitted currencies. The Scheme will also guarantee loans for periods up to 12 years (previously eight and half years) for mobile offshore installations, including floating production storage and offloading vessels.
<P>

<a name="90720w06.htm_para2">Floating rate loans will be of particular assistance as it allows shipowners to take advantage of the current low interest rates and make the Scheme more competitive and attractive to all.
<P>

<a name="90720w06.htm_para3">Loans in US dollars recognises that shipbuilding is an international business and that the US dollar is the most widely used currency for financing the building of ships. It will bring our UK Scheme in line with other similar EU competitor schemes which already offer loans in US dollars as will the extension to loans in euros.
<P>

<a name="90720w06.htm_para4">I am certain that these new financing arrangements, which the Industry have called for, will help strengthen the hand of the UK shipbuilding sector. The Government will continue to give the Industry every encouragement to improve its competitiveness and I look forward to working with the Shipbuilding Forum to ensure that we continue to achieve this aim.

 The Civil Aviation Authority has no evidence that the use of Kapton wiring in civil aircraft is a safety issue. There has been only one case recorded on the Authority's occurrence database since 1979 where investigations have shown that a breakdown of Kapton wiring may have contributed to an incident (which was not an accident), and that was subsequently found to be the result of a manufacturing fault.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90720w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The regulation of passengers' behaviour on trains is already provided for in legislation which gives railway companies the right to make byelaws. The existing railway byelaws and London Transport byelaws make it a criminal offence for any person to wilfully soil or deface any furniture on a train, and this 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 1999 : Column: 483</I><P>
would normally catch behaviour such as placing feet on a seat. The train operating companies and London Transport are also in the process of making new byelaws, and have submitted them to the Secretary of State for approval. These include a provision that no person shall soil any part of the railway.
<P>

<a name="90720w09.htm_para0">With regard to buses or coaches, the Public Service Vehicle (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990 give drivers the power to remove passengers from their vehicle if they are causing a nuisance or intentionally interfering with any equipment fitted to the vehicle. These powers would be sufficient to deal with the problem of passengers putting their feet on bus or coach seats.

 Government Offices have been working closely with Local Authorities in the preparation of local transport plans (LTPs). Provisional LTPs are to be submitted later this month and we are currently considering the most effective way of disseminating the "best practice" which emerges.
<P>

<a name="90720w09.htm_para1">The Countryside Commission, now the Countryside Agency, published, in 1997, an advisory booklet entitled "Rural Traffic: Getting it Right" which provides general advice on developing traffic strategies for rural areas. Further advice on good practice will be issued once the results of the studies carried out by the Countryside Agency's Countryside Traffic Measures Group are available. Officials from my Department are participating in these studies.

 Radioactive discharges must be authorised by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. When considering an application 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jul 1999 : Column: 484</I><P>
for authorisation, the Environment Agency must be satisfied that the possible radiation dose to those members of the public at greatest risk will not exceed levels prescribed by the Government. In addition, the operators must show that the exposure will be as low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
<P>

<a name="90720w09.htm_para2">Radioactive discharges and their effect on the environment are monitored by the nuclear industry under the terms of their disposal authorisations. The Environment Agency and MAFF monitor radioactivity in the environment and in foodstuffs. The Environment Agency conducts monitoring of drinking water, rain water and air quality on behalf of my Department, in addition to the monitoring it undertakes in support of its regulatory functions under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. The results of this monitoring are regularly published in "Radioactivity in the Environment" by the Environment Agency and in "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment" by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Also the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) publishes regular reviews "Radiation Exposure of the UK Population".
<P>

<a name="90720w09.htm_para3">The latest edition of NRPB's "Radiation Exposure of the UK Population", published in 1993, estimated the average annual doses to the UK population from all sources of ionising radiation as 2,600 micro Sieverts. Of this 0.4 micro Sieverts was estimated to come from discharges of radioactive waste, the majority of which emanates from Sellafield. In a summary publication in 1996, "Living with Radiation", the average dose remained the same but the contribution from discharges had fallen to 0.2 micro Sieverts.
<P>

<a name="90720w09.htm_para4">I am not aware of any reason why the effect on the public in Coventry should be different from the effect on the public generally.

 This reply covers the period since 1 May 1997. No central record is kept of such contacts but I am aware that representatives of Central Railways have kept my officials informed, by way of meetings and correspondence, of their preparation of a scheme for a railway freight line between Liverpool and the Channel Tunnel. I understand that the last meeting took place last October. All contacts by my officials are without prejudice to consideration of any scheme that may eventually be submitted under the Transport and Works Act 1992. Central Railways have also written to Ministers in this Department enclosing an information brochure about the scheme. I am not aware, however, of any meetings between Ministers in my Department and representatives of Central Railways about the scheme.

We expect to see the bulk of such trains phased out substantially before then, but any remaining on the network after the end of 2002 will need to be safety modified in order to remain in operation until the end of 2004.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), representing the Church Commissioners, what is the cumulative cost to date of the financial compensation package for those priests unwilling to accept women's ordination; and if he will estimate the total cumulative cost at the end of the 10 year guarantee period.  [91657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90720w10.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 At 31 December 1998 the cumulative gross cost, to be met from the Commissioners' income, under the terms of the Ordination of Women (Financial Provisions) Measure 1993, was &#163;13.5 million. The Commissioners' latest estimate of the total cumulative gross cost to the end of the guaranteed period is approximately &#163;23 million. The figure is based on our current prediction of 400 resignations by 21 February 2004, and estimates for payments up to 21 February 2014.

<a name="90720w10.htm_para10">Actual expenditure up to 31 December 1998 and illustrative costings based on 400 resignations are set out in the following table. It should be noted that from 1 January 1998, these costings include pension contributions towards the new funded clergy pension scheme, approximately &#163;0.49 million in 1998.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The number of resignations shown (400) is a broad estimate based on current assumptions and knowledge of proposed resignations.<P>

2. Actual costs are shown for 1994 to 1998 based on resignations shown, including housing subsidy. A similar pattern of costs has been projected for future years.<P>

3. The figures for 1998 onwards also include pension contributions for resigning clergy paid to the Pensions Board.<P>

4. The figures make allowance for future increases in house prices and stipends.<P>

5. The net figure takes account of such variables as stipends savings (assuming at least a temporary reduction in the payroll), allowance for retirement housing provision which would otherwise have arisen on retirement, and the possibility of some people redeeming loans or leaving rented accommodation once they have obtained alternative employment.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 1999]:</i> We believe there is considerable potential to develop the use of non-food crops in the UK. The Ministry's Agri-Industrial Materials Branch promotes the use of crop derived raw materials at workshops and other events and through its dedicated Website. The Ministry spends around &#163;1.1 million per annum on strategic research on non-food crops with a number of projects looking at the potential for these renewable raw materials. Most recently the Ministry's Central Science Laboratory has led an EU project on the opportunities and constraints for non-food crops and the report will be published in the autumn. We

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met 12 ambassadors for British Business in July 1998. The aim was to review progress and consider how the scheme could be developed, to hear the views of the Business ambassadors on promoting Britain's image overseas and to underline that the scheme should be used to boost inward investment as well as British business overseas. There was no formal agenda. No briefing material or documentation was provided for the Business ambassadors for the meeting.

I visited Kinshasa in February 1999 and met President Kabila and other Ministers. We enjoy normal diplomatic relations with the DRC. Britain welcomes the signature of a ceasefire agreement in Lusaka on 10 July by the DRC and other countries concerned.

 It is for the Government of Iraq to propose projects and equipment in the telecommunications sector as in all sectors for funding under the oil-for-food programme. The UN Secretary General approved Iraq's distribution plan for the sixth phase of the programme in April, subject to the caveat that each application will require the approval of the Iraq sanctions committee. We would be prepared to consider applications for telecommunications equipment directly related to the humanitarian programme.
