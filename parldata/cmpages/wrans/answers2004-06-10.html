<p class="tabletext">The objective of CIP is to create, for the public sector, the prime source of address and other core contact information relating to people usually resident in the UK. The feasibility study, conducted in 2003, indicated that the creation of a UK-wide population register could lead to cost and efficiency savings for the public sector.</p>

<p class="tabletext">With regard to the specific points you raise in relation to security, identity verification, governance and logistics of its potential setting up, all of these points are being considered during the project definition stage, which is currently running. It is scheduled to run until June 2005 at which point the Office for National Statistics will report back to Ministers with proposals for how CIP could be taken forward. Therefore, no decisions have been taken yet on the form in which it would develop but the latest thinking can be found in the evidence supplied by the Registrar General to the Home Affairs Committee on 27 April 2004.</p>

 Owners of historic houses will not be affected unless they have engaged in tax avoidance of the sort targeted by the Government&#039;s proposals. If they have, they will have the option&#151;under the proposals set out in the Finance Bill&#151;to bring their property back within the scope of inheritance tax. And that in turn opens the way to claims in due course to the heritage exemption from inheritance tax, if the property is of suitable quality and the necessary commitment is made to provide public access.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the future role of HM Customs and Excise at UK sea and airports after its investigation and intelligence work is brought under the control of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.  [177155]</p>









<p><a name="40610w01.html_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 HM Customs and Excise&#039;s expertise in working at the borders to protect national security, collect revenue, facilitate trade and prevent smuggling will continue to play a vital role in the new integrated revenue department, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para1">
Revenue from customs and excise duties, which raise almost &#163;17 billion each year, are heavily dependent upon the protection afforded at the border. Equally important is the economic imperative to ensure that international trade is facilitated in a way that ensures the UK remains a good place to do business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para2">
The nature of indirect taxes makes them more vulnerable to attack by fraudsters than direct taxes. Customs has developed strategies for countering such attacks which depend heavily upon their expertise in frontiers work, investigation, and disruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para3">
For these reasons HMRC will maintain its frontier role while working with the other agencies that undertake controls at UK borders. Following the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency,

<p><a name="40610w01.html_spnew4"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 For the purposes of this response, 1 December 2001 (&quot;N2&quot;) has been taken as the date the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was established, when the FSA was granted its full powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA&#039;s financial year ends on 31 March.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jun 2004 : Column 488W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para4">
Estimated set-up running costs of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) were &#163;14 million (FSA&#039;s annual reports for financial years 1999&#150;00 and 2000&#150;01). Outturn set-up running costs, relating to the new organisational structure of the FSA, were &#163;13.2 million. A further &#163;1.8 million was incurred in relation to the transfer of the UK Listing Authority function from the London Stock Exchange, which was not included in the original estimate. These costs were recovered from FSA fee-payers during the three years including and following N2 and so were not accounted for in the public finances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para5">
In 1998&#150;99, the FSA also incurred capital expenditure of approximately &#163;37 million, to prepare the FSA&#039;s new premises in Canary Wharf, London. Annual depreciation is also being included in the amount charged to FSA fee-payers and is not accounted for in the public finances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w01.html_para6">
The overall outturn expenditure of the FSA since it was established (N2) was &#163;69.1 million in the remainder of 2001&#150;02, and &#163;203.1 million in 2002&#150;03. In addition, a &#163;2 million deficit reduction contribution was made in 2002&#150;03 to finance the FSA&#039;s pension scheme shortfall.The responsibilities of the bodies the FSA took on as successor, and the outturn expenditure of these bodies for the three financial years of their operation up to and including N2, is shown in the table as follows. In addition, the FSA took responsibility for the UK Listing Authority function from the London Stock Exchange on 1 May 2000. Between 1 May 2000 and N2, FSA outturn expenditure in relation to this function was &#163;17.7 million.

<a name="40610w02.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>HIPC Process</h3>





<p><a name="40610w02.html_wqn0"><b> John Barrett: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking to assist those countries which are predicted to exit the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries process with unsustainable debt.  [177419]</p>








<p><a name="40610w02.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The UK fully supports the cancellation of debt of the world&#039;s poorest countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The UK was instrumental in securing international agreement to enhance the original Initiative in 1999, to ensure that as much debt relief as possible is granted to as many countries as possible. The UK continues to be a champion of the HIPC Initiative. We have provided commitments of &#163;2.3 billion of debt relief to eligible countries and have pledged a total of US$474 million through multilateral institutions to support the Initiative further. The UK goes even further than is required under the Initiative, and is committed to providing 100 per cent. debt relief to eligible HIPC countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w02.html_para0">
The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. It is providing over $70 billion of debt relief to the 27 counties which have reached Decision Point. It is helping increase annual social expenditure in countries receiving debt relief. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&#151;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. of the use of HIPC debt relief.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w02.html_para1">
However, there are countries forecast to exit the Initiative with debt-to-export ratios above the HIPC target of 150 per cent. because of factors beyond their control. The UK continues to push for additional relief to be granted to these countries at Completion Point 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jun 2004 : Column 489W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
(&quot;topping up&quot; relief). We successfully campaigned for Niger and Ethiopia to receive such additional relief, resulting in over $800 million in additional relief for two of the world&#039;s poorest countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w02.html_para2">
The UK also continues to lobby for a change in the topping up methodology to maximise the quantum of topping up relief. At present, the additional bilateral assistance (ABA) granted by some countries&#151;including the G7&#151;is included when calculating the amount of additional relief to be provided at Completion Point. We are pressing for this ABA to be excluded from this calculation, which could increase the quantum of debt relief delivered to HIPCs by around $1 billion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w02.html_para3">
We are also working closely with the IMF and World Bank as they finalise a new debt sustainability framework, which will govern all lending decisions for low-income countries, including those that have participated in HIPC. When operational, this framework will ensure that sufficient official finance is provided in the right blend of grants and highly concessional lending to aid future development without threatening long-term debt sustainability prospects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w02.html_para4">
However, all low-income countries will need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is why the UK has proposed the International Finance Facility (IFF), which could provide the much-needed substantial increase in aid&#151;in the form of grants, concessional loans, or further debt&#151;needed to attain the MDGs without threatening the long-term debt sustainability of the world&#039;s poorest countries.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will place in the Library the evidence he has collated on the benefits that arise from <i>(a)</i> separating housing management from housing strategy and <i>(b)</i> the financial effect of the separation.  [177007]</p>









<p><a name="40610w03.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Audit Commission&#039;s Best Value Inspection Reports indicate that stock owning local authorities primarily see their housing role as that of a landlord. This reduces their focus on strategic housing functions. In explaining why they had published best practice on how local authorities that had transferred their stock deliver their strategic housing role, the Audit Commission said that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Having set up a housing association to run its rented homes, a council is able to concentrate on area-based regeneration, including private sector housing. In other areas, councils have used stock transfer as an opportunity to work more effectively with planning services to provide more affordable housing and more mixed-tenure developments&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w03.html_para1">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have information of the financial effects of the separation of strategic and landlord services.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much investment to fund stock improvements has been secured via transfer, private finance initiative and Arm&#039;s Length Management Organisations since the Housing Green Paper was published in 2000, broken down by local authority; and how much of the backlog of repairs and improvement remains to be funded.  [176756]</p>








<p><a name="40610w03.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b>

These figures do not include mainstream housing funding paid to stock owning local authorities including those that have established ALMOs or PFI contracts.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not in a position to update or estimate the reduction since 2001 of the repairs and improvement backlog until we have sufficient data from the English House Condition Survey, the next report of which will be published by the end of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w03.html_para4">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister needs this independent assessment, as we cannot determine the remaining backlog by simply deducting the sums spent from the previous backlog estimate. This is because the expenditure is used both to reduce the backlog and to stop the backlog increasing.

<p><a name="40610w04.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Housing Transfer Manual 2003 Programme provides guidance on housing transfer and sets out the procedure by which an authority should make an application to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. We require Registered Social Landlords to discuss the implications of transfer with the Housing Corporation who published their new registration criteria registration with the Housing Corporation in April 2004. This gives guidance which covers stock transfer applicants seeking to become registered social landlords.

The need to ensure effective tenant representation has been further emphasised in the recent Housing Corporation publication, &quot;Involvement Policy for the Housing Association Sector&quot;.

This revised resident involvement policy sets out clearly what residents, and the Housing Corporation as regulator, can expect from housing associations, i.e.:

The Corporation has asked the Audit Commission, as part of its joint programme of research, to look at the costs and benefits of resident involvement and to consider the evidence that involvement does in fact make good business sense. A report of the study, &quot;Improving Services Through Resident Involvement&quot;, will be launched at the Chartered Institute of Housing conference in June 2004.

 All local authorities are required to produce Business Plans that set out medium/long-term plans for addressing the investment needs of their council housing and improving the quality of services provided to tenants. The guidance provided to authorities highlights the importance of carrying out robust option appraisals as a part of this, to ensure that resources are used effectively and, where additional resources are needed, that the best option for delivering decent homes is identified. Therefore, the cost is met by local authorities, as all work on options appraisals including consultation, publicity material and surveys etc. is funded by the local authority, as the work should be undertaken as part of their Business Plan.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what action her Department is taking to ensure that ancient trees are identified for inclusion in biodiversity action plans; [173941]





</p>



<p>(2) what action her Department is taking to ensure that ancient trees are fully identified and mapped for the purposes of inclusion in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  [173942]</p>









<p><a name="40610w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Sites with ancient or veteran trees are being recorded through a variety of different mechanisms. Some are Sites of Special Scientific Interest and a number of the best areas have gone forward as Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (including the New Forest, Burnham Beeches, Epping Forest, Windsor Great Park, Richmond Park, Sherwood Forest).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w05.html_para0">
Surveys to identify other sites for veteran trees, that may have been over-looked in the past, are under way, including recent work in Scotland and in the East Midlands of England. The Forestry Commission are planning to start the next National Inventory of Woodland and Trees later this year. The methods to be used are being finalised over the next few months and it is expected that the inventory will provide estimates of the overall abundance of veteran trees in woodland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w05.html_para1">
The most important concentrations of ancient or veteran trees across the countryside tend to be associated with wood-pastures (old parks, commons and the former royal hunting forests). The UK Wood-pasture and Parkland Habitat Action Plan is led by English Nature, who are developing the Wood-pasture and Parkland Information System (www.wapis.org.uk) that will enable both biological and historical data about these important sites to be brought together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w05.html_para2">
The National Inventory cannot be expected to pick up every one of the many thousands of individual veteran trees that exist within Britain, in field corners, hedges or along riverbanks. There is scope, therefore, for voluntary efforts such as by local tree wardens and through the Woodland Trust/Ancient Tree Forum&#039;s Ancient Tree Hunt to complement the work of the Government Departments and agencies. We welcome such voluntary sector contributions. We would encourage individuals and voluntary bodies to use the Wood-pasture and Parkland Information System to widen our knowledge and understanding and help make the information readily available through the National Biodiversity Network.

 Poor lane discipline does cause annoyance and can reduce road capacity. We are working to improve lane discipline.

The Theory Test includes questions on motorway lane discipline and the Department produces a leaflet, &#039;A Guide to Safer Motorway Driving&#039;. Police motorway patrols can, where they think appropriate, pull up motorists for poor lane discipline, and indeed can prosecute where the motorist&#039;s behaviour amounts to inconsiderate driving.

 The Immigration Service is increasing enforcement activity against illegal working in general, and we have taken steps to strengthen the law preventing employers from using illegal migrant workers, section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. It is a criminal offence under section 8 to employ someone subject to immigration control who is not entitled to work in the United Kingdom or who is subject to immigration restrictions preventing them 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Jun 2004 : Column 517W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

On 1 May, an order under section 147 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 strengthened the security of the document checks employers must carry out on prospective employees in order to establish a defence under section 8. We have also tabled an amendment to the current Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc.) Bill to make the current section 8 offence triable either way, effectively removing the statutory limit on financial penalties the courts can impose in the more serious cases.

All Immigration Service illegal working enforcement activity is intelligence led, and if the hon.

A number of enforcement operations in 2003 targeted the contract cleaning sector, but I am not aware of any recent cases involving the child care sector. It would not be appropriate for the Immigration Service to use advertisements to induce agencies to supply illegal, workers; to do so would undermine any subsequent criminal proceedings.

 Recorded crime figures, which are available at police force level and are used to measure trends in crime, include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on property crimes, such as burglary. However they do not record whether the latter are related to an offender&#039;s drug habits. There are therefore no figures currently available for the proportion of crime in the Easington constituency which was connected to drug addiction, and what the success rate for prosecution was.

 The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) does not maintain annual statistics for seconded police officers returning prior to the end of their secondment. However, based on an analysis on 100 police officers who left NCIS between July 2000 and March 2003, two thirds left earlier than expected at their own request (by an average of seven months), having secured their next posting in their parent force. NCIS can require an officer to return to force prior to the end of his or her secondment, for example where NCIS has &quot;lost confidence&quot; in the officer. This is a rare occurrence, involving typically only one or two cases a year.

 Police Services operate a number of systems for different operational purposes and the extent of data sharing between these has depended on local requirements. The &quot;Information Strategy for the Police Service&quot; provides guidance to forces on technical integration of systems and a corporate data model to support data sharing both within and between forces. The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) and its Central Customer are actively engaged with forces, the Association of Chief Police Officers and others in articulating the information sharing needs of the Police Service. A specific initiative to facilitate data sharing in support of the National Intelligence Model is incorporated within the Home Office Police Science and Technology Strategy. The first step is a feasibility and costing study. This will link with the Cross Regional Information Sharing Project (CRISP) that is being taken forward by a consortium of forces, supported by PITO, to share information across force boundaries.

This shows that for the period August 2002 to 28 March 2003 a total of four penalty notices were issued for the offence of drinking in a designated public place.

The National Police Records (Recordable Offences) (Amendment) Regulations 1997 added a further 42 offences to the list. The 2000 Regulations added a further 5 offences, and at the same time consolidated the provisions, including the list. Most recently, the 2003 Amendment Regulations added offences of taxi touting, begging and persistent begging to the list, and made some tidying-up amendments including removing from the list three offences which are now imprisonable and therefore no longer needed to be specified in the list as recordable.

 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has calculated specific absorption rates from Tetra handsets.

In areas accessible to the public, signals from Tetra masts are very much weaker than those from handsets.

 An abortion can only ever be carried out where two doctors are satisfied that one of the grounds for a lawful termination, as set out in the Abortion Act 1967, is met.

<p>
<a name="40610w13.html_para0">
Health professionals can provide medical advice, treatment and examination, including abortion, for young people aged under 16. However they must be satisfied before doing so, that the young person is competent to consent to the treatment, by being of sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully the proposed treatment. Health professionals work within an established legal and guidance framework which involves assessing the young person&#039;s competence to understand the choices they are making and in particular encouraging them to talk to their parents. All health professionals are bound by their professional code and legal obligations as to confidentiality, which apply to patients under 16 as well as older patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w13.html_para1">
The duty of confidentiality is not, however, absolute. In the rare cases when a health professional believes that there is a risk to the health, safety or welfare of a young person or others which is so serious as to outweigh the young person&#039;s right to privacy, they should follow locally agreed child protection protocols, as outlined in &quot;Working together to safeguard Children&quot;.

Notes:<br>

Time Waited<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Main Operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when 



looking at admission details, for example, time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

<p><a name="40610w20.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 Government have taken considerable action to combat animal rights extremists, both through legislation and by support for the police to deal with their criminal activities. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 gave the police a new power to direct protestors away from homes when such protests are intimidatory or harassing. It amended the Protection from Harassment Act and the Malicious Communications Act to cover co-ordinated campaigns of harassment and sending harassing emails and made provision for a secure register of company directors&#039; home addresses where those directors are at risk of intimidation and harassment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w20.html_para1">
Recently, we have introduced further legislation in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 that strengthened police powers to deal with smaller, intimidatory protests and office occupations by extremists. Government are also funding a new police unit to provide tactical guidance on policing extremists.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w20.html_para2">

A key part of the development would be the creation of a link road between the A50 and the A514. The viability of the site is impacted upon by the cost of developing this infrastructure. In March 2004 emda&#039;s Board approved &#163;70,000 to fund a feasibility study into the viability of the project, which would address the issues around the road infrastructure.

VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

Notes:<br>

Settlements can be low or even reduced to nothing if some or all of the factors outlined below have a maximum impact.<br>

1. Compensation offered is dependent on the percentage of disability due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the number of years spent underground after 1954, the date of liability. Discounting is then applied, taking into account any smoking history and the number of years worked before 1954. This is consistent with the High Court judgment. In chronic bronchitis (CB) only claims, the maximum amount payable is &#163;5,604 (rising with the RPI), subject to the relevant discounting mentioned previously.<br>

2. Compensation offered in respect of VWF is dependent on the &quot;staging&quot; (the level of disability). Claims are then discounted taking into account any of the five co-morbid conditions as listed in the Claims Handling Agreement. Claims will also be apportioned according to whether there is any co-defendant involvement.<br>

3. Figures for Nottinghamshire are not available separately.<br>

 Following the publication of the UN Expert Panel&#039;s final report in October 2004, we asked the UN for the documentary evidence supporting the listing of British companies in Annexe III of the report.

 Royal Mail has legal obligations, under the Representation of People Act 2000, to deliver election material from any properly nominated candidate, so long as the material is legal. Royal Mail recognises that staff may have strong feelings about the delivery of some election mailings.

 The Government are well aware of concerns about the effects of offshoring, including on employment in the IT sector. But we know from consultation with key stakeholders that there is a broad consensus in the UK that trade protectionism is not the right response. Instead, we must do all we can to ensure that those who are affected by decisions to offshore work are found alternative work as quickly as possible. We also need to ensure that the UK remains competitive and an attractive place in which other countries wish to do business and it is important to note that the UK remains the lead country in terms of inward investment into the EU. We are also working closely with the RDAs and the Learning and Skills Councils to ensure that the UK is equipped to meet these challenges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w22.html_para4">
In this globalised world, companies require the flexibility to take the required steps to remain internationally competitive. Location is ultimately a business decision for companies, and the Government cannot prohibit moves offshore. However the Government continue to create the macro-economic environment to encourage business location and growth within the UK.

 I am very much aware of concerns about rising steel prices and appreciate that this is an unwelcome pressure on steel consumers at a time when manufacturing is showing signs of recovery. This is a global issue caused primarily by soaring demand in China, which is having a knock on effect on the cost of raw materials such as iron ore, coke and scrap. We acknowledge that the problem is especially difficult for steel users with limited scope to pass on price rises to customers. However, European steel prices are still low compared with USA and South East Asia. There have also been concerns about the availability of steel but I

The Chinese Government has recently introduced measures to dampen economic growth as a result of which Chinese steel imports have fallen pushing down prices in the Far East.

VAT registrations do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

<p><a name="40610w26.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 No. It is normal for pensions and benefits schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives and disability living allowance is focused on providing extra help to people who are severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life.

<a name="40610w26.html_para0">
Attendance allowance provides help with the disability-related extra costs of people who experience the onset of disability after age 65. Based on the need for personal care, this help is part of the wide range of support that the Government make available to older people so that they can have a decent and secure income in retirement and share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country.

<p><a name="40610w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Typhoon achieved &quot;type acceptance&quot; in June 2003, triggering the entry to service process. The first RAF aircraft was accepted off contract in December 2003, and to date, six have been delivered. Release to Service, allowing flying under normal RAF procedures, was achieved earlier this month. The aircraft are now engaged in the process of pilot training and operational evaluation to enable Typhoon to be deployed operationally during the second half of the decade. The next step in the procurement process will be the order for the second Tranche of aircraft, and negotiations are in progress.

[176475]</p>








<p><a name="40610w29.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Typhoon, in common with other technologically advanced projects worldwide, has experienced some problems attributable to software development. However, the aircraft has already entered service with the RAF and we do not expect software

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the letter of the Under-Secretary of State D/05 of S/IC 1295/04/A of 5 April, what his policy is on UK legacy wrecks and related issues of liability; what assessment he has made of their potential to pollute; and if he will make a statement.  [177882]</p>








<p><a name="40610w29.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Our policy on UK military legacy wrecks and related issues of liability remains as set out in my letter of 5 April. At present, the Ministry of Defence is consulting with other Government Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as to the most appropriate means of resolving the legal principle in international law of the ownership of wrecks. We do not expect to resolve the international position on ownership for some time because of the differing views taken by various states, although we hope to have a preliminary view by late autumn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w29.html_para1">
In respect of pollution, the wrecks database at the UK Hydrographic Office contains some 60,000 records of wrecks worldwide, of which approximately 20,000 are named vessels. If a wreck is below 200 metres, and so is not likely to be a danger to shipping, it is recorded but not charted. Within the Western Hemisphere there are 422 records of UK military legacy wrecks, only 275 of which are charted, and in the Eastern Hemisphere there are 501 records with 295 charted. No assessment has been made of the potential of each of these vessels to pollute. However, as I said to my hon. Friend in my letter of 5 April, the Ministry of Defence will continue to address individual cases of potential pollution hazards from UK military wrecks on their own merits and take whatever action we deem necessary.

We are aware that vehicles manufactured by Oshkosh and Stewart and Stevenson, two of the four bidders for the support vehicle contract, were used by the US Army and Marine Corps in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Again, these did not include any new issues and, as Mr. Connor was aware from previous correspondence that the MOD would not engage further with him unless new issues of substance were raised, a response was not warranted.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what percentage of premature voluntary retirement applications have been denied for <i>(a)</i> officers and <i>(b)</i> other ranks in all three services in each of the last five years; and if he will make a statement;  [176111]

<p><a name="40610w30.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Data on applications for Premature Voluntary Release (PVR) are published quarterly in the DASA Armed Forces Personnel Statistics publication Tri Service Publication, TSP 5. Copies of the latest publication (1 April 2004 figures) along with back issues are available in the Library of the House. Published data include officers and other ranks and show applications and actual exits for each of the three services, split by gender. The main difference between the number of applications for PVR and the number of actual exits shown in TSP 5 is due to individual applicants choosing to withdraw their applications whilst serving their notice, not due to applications being refused. PVR rates broken down by regiment are not held centrally and could not be provided without incurring disproportionate costs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40610w30.html_para4">
It is not possible to provide the information requested on those requests for PVR that have been denied as all such information is not held centrally and again could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Generally, denials are possible but are very rare and a deferral of the proposed leaving date is the more usual course of action.

 When British forces apprehend people suspected of having committed a criminal offence, they are immediately handed over to the Iraq Police Service who arrest, and if appropriate, conduct a prosecution under Iraqi law. We do not hold central records of the outcome of such cases and cannot therefore estimate how many have been prosecuted or the results of such cases. In any event, the fact that an arrest does not ultimately lead to a successful prosecution does not mean that the arrest was either mistaken or unlawful.
