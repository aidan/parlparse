 It has been the practice for many years to use the landing adjacent to the lower waiting hall to store furniture from the Members&#146; and Strangers&#146; dining rooms when they are both in use at the same time for functions sponsored by Members. These can take place between 4-6 pm each weekday, on Thursday evenings, and at times when the House is not sitting. The furniture has to be kept close to the dining rooms because there are only 30 minutes available to reset them for the evening service to Members.</p>

Until the Administration Committee has had an opportunity to consider the matter, arrangements are being made to advise the fire safety manager when both rooms are being used for functions.</p>

One item (Case 26) had its export licence application refused before a decision was taken on the application because the owner was unwilling to accept a matching offer. Therefore 20 items had a temporary export bar placed on them, including one item for which a licence was issued (Case 23) as evidence was supplied, during the first deferral period, that it had entered the UK within the last 50 years.</p>

The circumstances of each individual case are considered including any representations of hardship from the non-resident parent as well as the size of the debt and any other relevant factors. Should the financial circumstances of the non-resident parent prevent immediate full repayment of the child maintenance debt then the Agency will attempt to negotiate the repayment of the child maintenance debt as quickly as possible to obtain the best possible outcome for the qualifying child and the parent with care while taking account of the circumstances of the non-resident parent.</p>

In a proportion of cases, this means that a repayment agreement of up to forty per cent of net earnings, which includes any regular maintenance liability and repayment of arrears, will be appropriate.</p>

In many cases a Deduction from Earnings Order will be imposed which requires an employer to deduct child maintenance payments at source. These deductions will not exceed forty per cent of net earnings. In cases where this is not appropriate, the Agency can apply to the courts for a liability order confirming the debt, and allowing it to pursue other legal enforcement action.</p>
</ul><a name="81006w0012.htm_brev9"><a name="0810071000750"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Agency also has the power to contract debt collection agencies to recover outstanding debt on its behalf as this is an area where the expertise of private agencies can be particularly effective in helping to get more money to more children. The provisions authorising another person/organisation to carry out functions relating to child support came into force on 3 July 2006. Certain cases with outstanding debt were reviewed and where the non-resident parent failed to make an acceptable repayment offer referral was made to a debt collection agency.

1. Consistent and reliable records of the numbers of cases of possible fraud or misuse being recorded and investigated, and of the resulting numbers of customer contracts cancelled, are only available from 1999 onwards, after Motability established a centralised team to handle such matters in 1998.<br>
2. The fall in the number of contracts cancelled as a result of misuse between 2003 and 2005 resulted from an increase in the standard mileage allowance in 2003 (hence fewer customer contracts being cancelled for unpaid excess mileage bills) and from an improved approach to &#147;fair wear and tear&#148; standards, especially for damage associated with mobility aids (fewer contracts being cancelled for cars falling outside of the condition standards).<br>
3. The increase in customer contracts being cancelled since 2005 has resulted from a stronger focus on appropriate sanctions for customers using cars in any criminal activity or using cars outside of the insurance rules (e.g. allowing uninsured drivers).<br>

1. There are not separate budgets for crisis loans and budgeting loans, but rather a combined loans budget for both. The loans budget is managed centrally and re-allocations are made to Jobcentre Plus budget areas quarterly and towards the end of the year. Funds are taken from some of those budget areas with a projected end of year underspend and given to other budget areas.<br>
2. To provide comparable data, budgets are presented on the basis of the current budget area structure. In recent years, there have been many changes to the boundaries of Jobcentre Plus districts, which have led to adjustment of the budgets for the districts involved. In some cases, a district has been split and the parts merged with other districts. For the districts involved in such a situation it is not possible to give comparable budgets from April 2003. The last split took place in August 2006.<br>
3. Community Care Grants for 2006-07 were set before the boundary change in August 2006 involving a split district, and so are not given here. Community Care Grants budgets are not reallocated during the year. However, some allocations were made from the Contingency Reserve in 2007-08. These have not been included. The budgets for 2008-09 are the same as for 2007-08.<br>

 The Department for International Development's (DFID) work in the education sector in Africa is guided by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which call for the achievement of universal primary education and for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. We plan to spend some &#163;214 million bilaterally on education in Africa this year (2008-09). In addition, DFID provides core funding to a range of multilateral organisations who work to develop education in Africa. A large proportion of our bilateral support is routed through national budgets, notably in Nigeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya and Rwanda. This is in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness which calls for 50 per cent. of bilateral assistance to be channelled through country systems by means of long-term general budget or sector support. There is a particular emphasis throughout our education sector programmes on increasing school attendance, and a key part of this is getting more girls into school.</p>

We have also committed &#163;150 million to the Education for All Fast Track Initiative for 2006-8 to help countries speed up the implementation of their education plans. The Fast Track Initiative is supporting education work in 18 Africa countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="81006w0020.htm_para3"><a name="0810078000203">There is still a long way to go to achieve these MDGs in Africa, but there has been some worthwhile progress. Free primary education has brought millions of children into school: in Zambia and Tanzania, over 97 per cent. of children are now enrolled, with equal number of girls. In Lesotho, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi gender parity rates have reached 98 per cent. or more. In Ethiopia, our support helped one million more children to enter school in 2006. In Malawi, providing better toilet facilities in schools and support to teenage mothers has improved school attendance by girls.</p>

 Outside Southern Africa, the Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) work to facilitate cross-border trade is focused in East Africa (the East African Community (EAC)&#151;Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi). DFID is preparing a major new regional programme to facilitate trade by EAC member states. It will focus on expanding intra-regional trade through reducing the costs of trading across borders by supporting one stop border posts, customs reforms and the development of revenue sharing arrangements between countries.</p>

 The Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) 2006 White Paper stated that disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a crucial part of climate change adaptation. DFID&#146;s climate change implementation strategy incorporates DRR and recognises the need to draw on existing mechanisms to reduce risk when designing new programmes to adapt to climate change. The Bali Action Plan, which the UK signed up to last December, emphasises this when it refers to the importance of using</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="81006w0021.htm_para5"><a name="0810078000338">DFID has also commissioned a review to assess how DRR and adaptation programming could be better aligned to identify mechanisms for joint funding and programming; and to make recommendations for addressing remaining gaps in the system. This work is in progress, but initial recommendations include: supporting more visible engagement of the DRR community in climate negotiations; promoting stronger convergence of the DRR and adaptation teams within DFID and multilateral agencies; and supporting the generation of integrated knowledge and guidance, including by documenting success stories of where integration has worked.</p>

 Analysis made by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA), drawing on a range of assessments made by UN agencies and NGOs, suggests that at least 17 million people are currently in urgent need of food and other humanitarian assistance.

When responding to a DFID funded survey in the UK, almost a third of remittance senders said that their money would be used to buy food, a fifth said it would help with medical bills and one in six reported that the funds would help pay for schooling. 80 per cent. of those surveyed said the money would make a real difference to the lives of their relatives back home.</p>

We understand the need to find ways to promote the inclusion of disabled people into mainstream development as well as looking for ways to build the capacity of representative organisations of disabled people. Our Civil Society Challenge Fund identifies disability as a cross-cutting issue so all applications need to demonstrate how they are engaging with disabled people. The latest round of applications saw a record number of projects with disability as the main focus (22 out of 145) which indicates that more international organisations are becoming aware of the need to promote the rights of disabled people.</p>

We have a Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA) with UK- based Action on Disability and Development which is working directly with disabled people's organisations (DPOs) in eight countries across Africa and Asia. Recently we also committed to providing substantial support to a new Disability Rights Fund (DRF) set up to empower DPOs to participate effectively in the implementation and monitoring mechanisms set out in the UN Convention. This is one of the first foundations to support organisations run by disabled people in the developing world.</p>

We are currently funding the Southern Africa Federation of Disabled People Research Project (SRP) which is an innovative project designed and run by disabled people in the region. This project is helping local DPOs to research issues linked to disability and poverty and is already starting to produce evidence of the kinds of barriers disabled people face when trying to access basic services.</p>

 All of the animals in question were pigs.

In 2006 the work focused on studies not involving psychological stress. The stressors used in 2007 were either routine housing and husbandry practices or involved the mixing of unfamiliar animals which may cause a level of psychological stress.</p>

 Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office can only license the use of animals for scientific purposes where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals and their suffering is minimised. A significant proportion of the time spent by Home Office inspectors assessing applications for new project licences and amendments is devoted to ensuring that these principles are rigorously applied. In addition, the retrospective review of project licences is a key function of the local ethical review process that every establishment designated under the 1986 Act is required to maintain.</p>

 Historically, the number of scientific procedures declined after 1976, levelled out in the 1990s and since 2000 has risen back to around the level recorded in 1990 (historical tables are available online at the Home Office website). Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>

 The purpose of the National DNA database (NDNAD) is to match DNA profiles taken from individuals with those taken from crime scenes. It therefore holds only the information necessary for this function, and does not contain criminal records or information on whether those on it are in prison. There are, however, good reasons for believing that the great majority of the prison population has a profile on the NDNAD. Police forces have had the power to retain DNA taken from those convicted of recordable offences since the establishment of the DNA database in 1995. For the first few years this power was exercised in relation to more serious offenders, but from 2000 onwards additional funding was made available under the DNA Expansion Programme to make it standard practice to take samples from all offenders. Since the extension of powers to take DNA samples to all those arrested for recordable offences, taking a DNA sample in the custody suite has become routine procedure. In addition, two prisoner sampling projects have been undertaken, most recently in 2003, to take DNA from any prisoner who had not already been sampled, for example because they had been imprisoned before DNA sampling was widely practiced.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people of each <i> (a)</i> ethnicity, <i> (b)</i> age group and <i> (c)</i> sex in each ward of Greater Manchester have a DNA sample stored in the national DNA database. [223773]</p>

<p><a name="st_367"><a name="08100736000930"><a name="81006w0029.htm_spnew0"><a name="08100736005196"><b>Meg Hillier:</b>
 Information held on the National DNA database (NDNAD) is available on the basis of the police force which added the DNA profile, not the address of the person sampled. Information is, therefore, not available on the number of people in each ward of Greater Manchester who have had a DNA profile added. Information is, however, available on the number of profiles added by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). These do not necessarily relate to residents of Greater Manchester. Tables 1-3 give figures for subject profiles on the NDNAD added by GMP, as at 17 September 2008, broken down by age, ethnic appearance and gender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="81006w0029.htm_para0"><a name="08100736000931">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="81006w0029.htm_para1"><a name="08100736000932">Table 1 shows the number of subject profiles loaded to the NDNAD by GMP, broken down by ethnic appearance. Ethnic appearance is based on the judgment of the police officer taking the sample as to which of six broad ethnic appearance categories the person is considered to belong. 'Unknown' means that no ethnic appearance was recorded by the officer taking the sample.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="81006w0029.htm_para2"><a name="08100736000933">Table 2 shows the number of such subject profiles broken down by current age, not the age when sampled.</p>

In a limited number of cases, a specific provision may have retrospective effect, for example, to correct an anomaly in the law which, if uncorrected, may adversely and unfairly affect individuals.

 We strongly support the need for stiff penalties for bad drivers. We increased the maximum penalties for causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink and drugs from 10 to 14 years imprisonment in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. We also introduced new offences of causing death by careless driving and causing death by driving when unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured in the Road Safety Act 2006.</p>

This carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Sections 32 and 33 of the Road Safety Act 2006 make clear which alternative verdicts are available if a prosecution for manslaughter (in England and Wales) or culpable homicide (Scotland) is unsuccessful. This is to ensure that manslaughter will be charged where appropriate in the knowledge that, if unsuccessful, the lesser charge can be preferred.</p>

 In 2006, the then Department for Constitutional Affairs agreed to join the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund (GCOF). In the first year, 2006-07, it was confirmed with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that this offsetting would be limited to air travel by Ministers and senior (board level) officials. For the year 2006-07, flights were only broken down into long haul and short haul. The distance travelled was 114639 km short haul which produced 34.39 tonnes of CO2 emissions and 121459 km long haul which produced 61.22 tonnes of CO2 emissions at a cost of &#163;606.72.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice supports local authorities via partnership arrangements. The National Offender Management Service works with them to resettle offenders. Over 130 prisons operate housing advice and support services. Resettlement begins on reception into custody; local prisons in England and Wales assess the housing needs of prisoners to help prevent future homelessness. A strong partnership with Jobcentre Plus, with advisers working in many prisons, provides employment advice. Offender managers work with local authority staff to protect the public and reduce the risk of re-offending. Managing an offender's risk of harm is paramount; probation has a key partnership role in ensuring that the needs of victims and offenders are addressed, including through multi-agency public protection arrangements and the supporting people programme. Resettlement support is also a priority for offenders managed under local prolific and other priority offender schemes.</p>

 The judgment in the case of Hirst <i> v.</i> UK requires the Government to reconsider their policy of a blanket ban on the voting rights of convicted prisoners.

 The UK is seeking to ensure that biofuels used both inside and outside of the UK are sustainable. We have developed a world class carbon and sustainability reporting system under the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation. This requires suppliers to provide reports containing information about the environmental performance of the biofuels they supply. We are working within Europe to ensure that the proposed sustainability criteria under the draft Renewable Energy Directive are made as robust as possible. We are also working with the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) to develop an internationally recognised lifecycle greenhouse gas methodology for biofuels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_699"><a name="81006w0041.htm_para3"><a name="08100736003186">In response to widespread concerns about the indirect impacts of biofuel production the Government asked Professor Gallagher of the Renewable Fuels Agency to carry out a review of the wider sustainability impacts of biofuels. The review involved a number of international experts and examined the impacts of biofuel production at a global level. This review was published in July 2008 and has been disseminated widely. Following the review we are seeking for indirect impacts to be included in the EU's mandatory sustainability criteria.</p>

 It is standard practice in the UK to produce aircraft noise contours between 57 dBA Leq and 72 dBA Leq. Based on past research, the 57 dBA Leq noise level has been used as marking the approximate onset of community annoyance. However the November 2007 Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England (ANASE) study which had been commissioned to update Government research found that people were more annoyed by all levels of aircraft noise than they were in 1985, when the last major study in this field was carried out. However the study reported that there was no identifiable threshold at which noise became a serious problem. Accordingly we believe it is right to retain the 57 dBA level as a safeguard for those most affected by aircraft noise.</p>

In particular, the supporting Civil Aviation Policy report ERCD 0705 &#145;Revised Future Aircraft Noise Exposure Estimates for Heathrow Airport&#146; reviews, in detail, the noise impacts of changing between westerly and easterly preferences in terms of area, population and households affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_724"><a name="81006w0043.htm_para2"><a name="08100736003422">Modelling aircraft noise below 57 dBA Leq 16 hrs becomes increasingly uncertain as the noise level decreases, primarily because of difficulties in obtaining aircraft noise measurements that are not contaminated with other sources of noise. Aircraft noise modelling at such levels is less likely to generate accurate and reliable results. Secondly, noise levels much below 57 dBA Leq correspond to generally low disturbance to most people. It is for these reasons that noise exposure contours are not routinely produced below 57 dBA Leq and only for specific purposes at 54 dBA Leq, e.g. usually as sensitivity test in relation to an assessment of airport expansion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_725"><a name="81006w0043.htm_para3"><a name="08100736003423">As regards to the production of separate maps for the number of people resident within the 54 dBA contour for landings on the northern and southern runways, it is considered that such maps would raise issues of interpretation for local residents between the runways who are exposed to noise from either runway. Accordingly it is not proposed to produce such maps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="81006w0043.htm_para4"><a name="08100736003424">The report also considered the option of the airport abandoning the westerly preference and operating on a no preference scenario.

 There is no guidance on response times specifically for HM Coastguard vessels.

In addition, the Department's contract with Klyne Tugs (Lowestoft) Ltd, specifies that the four emergency towing vessels (strategically located around the UK to provide support to vessels in need of assistance) are maintained at a constant 30 minutes state of readiness.</p>

 The Government remain committed to increased ownership and responsibility for Bosnia and Herzegovina's political leaders and therefore to closure of the Office of the high representative. However, this can only happen when the time is right. In February 2008, the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board agreed to link closure of the Office of the high representative to the fulfilment of five objectives and two conditions. Key among these is the need for a stable political and security situation, based on full compliance with Dayton.

 Our policy is to encourage flexible working for those staff who would like to take advantage of it. We encourage managers to respond positively to requests for flexible working wherever they can. We have anecdotal evidence of a significant rise in the number of staff working, at least part of the time, from home. But we do not intend to monitor or measure specifically how many staff work from home nor for how many hours/days per week as collating this information would involve disproportionate cost and manual effort.</p>

 We continue to have concerns about the treatment of Christians in Iran. In recent months we have received a number of reports about detentions of individuals who have converted from Islam to Christianity, including Mahmoud Matin-Azad and Arash Basirat, who were arrested in May and subsequently charged with apostasy. With strong UK support, the EU issued a public declaration on 26 September expressing concern about the deteriorating situation of religious minorities in Iran and calling for the release of Christian converts who had been arrested in recent months. We have since received information that Mr. Matin-Azad and Mr. Basirat have been acquitted of these charges. However, we remain deeply concerned that the new draft penal code would introduce a mandatory death sentence for the &#145;crime&#146; of apostasy (the death penalty is currently one possible punishment) and the impact that this would have on religious minorities including Christian converts. The EU statement of 26 September also called on Iran to reconsider these elements of the new draft and allow all its citizens the right to exercise freedom of religion or belief in full.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i><i> </i>Morocco, as the de facto administering power in the Western Sahara, has an obligation under international law to ensure that economic activities carried out under its administration in the territory do not adversely affect the interests of the people of the Western Sahara. This includes revenues from the EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement 2006.

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i><i> </i>The EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement was agreed in 2006 and sets out the terms for which UK and other European fishing vessels may fish in the waters off the coast of Western Sahara. The agreement does not prejudice the issue of the status of Western Sahara, which the UK regards as undetermined pending UN efforts to find a resolution. Nor does the agreement represent recognition of Morocco&#146;s sovereignty over the maritime waters of Western Sahara.</p>

 Our High Commission in Islamabad followed the judicial process of the case of the two Christian sisters Anila and Saba closely through local human rights organisations. Following a hearing at the Lahore High Court on 9 September, Anila was returned to the custody of her parents since she is a minor. However, on the evidence of a medical board, Saba was found to be aged between and 15 and 17 and therefore considered by the court to be able to take her own decision. Saba chose to join her alleged abductors during the course of legal proceedings but we have been unable to interfere in the judicial process of this case. Officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and from our High Commission in Islamabad will remain in contact with human rights organisations who are considering taking this case forward through the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. Since Saba chose to join her alleged abductor, we understand that she would need to challenge the findings of the medical board or testify that her decision was made under duress to establish grounds for appeal.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]: </i>The conclusion of a Government-to-Government agreement between the US and Libya on 14 August will provide for compensation for many of the victims of Libya&#146;s past sponsorship of terrorism, while ruling out the possibility of legal action against Libya before the US courts as regards allegations of Libyan involvement in terrorism before 30 June 2006. The Government regard inclusion of the British families of the victims of the bombing of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 in the recipients of compensation as welcome news for these families, but it is regrettable that the deal will not benefit all UK nationals with cases in US courts against Libya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_784"><a name="81006w0050.htm_para0"><a name="08100736004385">During the course of negotiations between the US and Libya, the Government made representations to the US Administration that the families of Lockerbie victims and existing UK claimants, with claims before US courts against Libya for its past sponsorship of Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorist acts (the McDonald case), should be included as recipients of any compensation package. In the event, it proved not possible to include the McDonald case claimants in the recipients of compensation under the US/Libya Agreement. The Government did not make representations to the US Administration regarding the Berlin bombing as there are no UK nationals with cases in US courts against Libya regarding this attack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_785"><a name="81006w0050.htm_para1"><a name="08100736004386">A key reason for not including the McDonald claimants in the compensation package was that international and US law do not permit the US Administration to espouse the claims of foreign nationals. Also relevant to the US decision was their assessment of how likely it would be that claims would fall within the jurisdiction of US courts and how likely it would be that they would succeed. We understand from the US that US courts would not have jurisdiction to hear such actions by British nationals against Libya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_786"><a name="81006w0050.htm_para2"><a name="08100736004387">It was possible for the UK victims in the Lockerbie case to receive payments from the compensation fund due to the unique circumstances of that case. The Lockerbie bombing was subject to a UN Security Council resolution which required that Libya accept responsibility for the Lockerbie bomb and pay victims&#146; families appropriate compensation. On this basis, the US assisted in bringing closure to that case on behalf of the entire international community and the Libyan Government agreed in 2003 to the payment of compensation to the victims&#146; families. The sums to be paid to those families under the terms of the recent US/Libya agreement reflect the final (so far unpaid) tranche of the previously agreed settlement payments. There is no such mechanism, settlement or court judgment in place in relation to the legal actions regarding the supply of arms by Libya to the IRA.</p>

 BERR are working toward achieving the energy efficiency targets expressed in the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) framework.

<p><a name="stpa_894"><a name="81006w0058.htm_para3"><a name="08100764000376">On 12 March 2008, the Government published a new Enterprise Strategy. In the 2008 Enterprise Strategy, the Government committed to a new approach to the way that new and existing regulation applies to firms that employ fewer than 20 people; this includes considering whether small firms can be exempt from requirements without affecting essential protections&#151;or if there is scope for simplified inspection, enforcement and guidance. A risk based approach to regulation will help minimise costs for small businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_895"><a name="81006w0058.htm_para4"><a name="08100764000377">Within the Enterprise Strategy, Government also announced that it would consult on the introduction of a system of regulatory budgets. At present there are limited controls on new regulatory proposals and there is no overall method for the Government to directly manage regulatory costs. A regulatory budget would provide such a mechanism. The Government is currently carrying out its consultation on this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_896"><a name="81006w0058.htm_para5"><a name="08100764000378">In June 2008 The Small Firms Impact Test (SFIT) became a mandatory part of the Impact Assessment (IA) process when a Government proposal imposes or reduces costs on business. The Government's manifesto commitment in 2001 ensured the 'Think Small First' principle was followed as part of UK policy development. The SFIT is intended to establish impact on small businesses and how it is possible to minimise the impact of the requirements on small firms through flexibilities such as exemptions, simplified inspection, less frequent reporting for businesses with fewer than 20 employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_897"><a name="81006w0058.htm_para6"><a name="08100764000379">More generally, Government undertook an exercise, supported by industry, to measure the administrative burdens that impact businesses of all sizes as a result of complying with regulations.

<i> [holding answer 15 September 2008]:</i> Postal operators are legally required to work with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to facilitate the collection of customs duty and taxes on goods entering the UK from outside the EU. The handling fee goes towards covering the costs incurred in storing items and collecting the duty fee on behalf of HMRC before it can be released to the customer.</p>

 The RDAs do not draw a common administrative/managerial distinction between staff. However, for the sake of consistency, administrative staffs have been classified as those occupying posts primarily concerned with supportive responsibilities, e.g. PAs, assistants to PAs, team administrators, office administrators. In the same way, managers are considered to be those who have a discrete area of managerial ' responsibility for a team or programme of work. RDAs vary in overall staffing numbers as some have much bigger budgets/geographical coverage than others. The following tables show this information.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> The LDA is currently in the process of restructuring. This restructure is subject to a formal consultation, which is already under way. However, the phasing of this restructure has yet to be consulted upon with staff and unions. Therefore the LDA is unable to provide estimated figures for 2008-09.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> This increase on 2007-08 is due to recruiting additional senior staff managing strategic programmes and relations with partners.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> SWRDA has additional programmes over other RDAs due to Cornwall's Objective One status.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> YF has appointed three managerial posts in relation to the delivery of the new ERDF programme. Due to internal restructuring, two existing finance posts have been re-graded to include additional responsibilities. There is a new post to manage the contract for Business Link services. There is a temporary post for a payroll specialist.<br>

 The Government have asked local authorities and the valuation office agency to provide information about how reforms to the empty property rate are working.

 Whether a property, which is <i> (a) </i>boarded up and or <i> (b)</i> without a roof, is liable for empty property rates would depend on whether the property is considered rateable. Under the Rating (Valuation) Act 1999, one of the assumptions for valuation purposes is that a building is assumed to be in a reasonable state of repair, except for any repairs that the landlord would regard as uneconomic.</p>

 CLG will be providing over &#163;200 million to local authorities and the voluntary sector over the next 3 years, including the current year, to tackle and prevent homelessness effectively. This is the biggest cash injection for homelessness services. All local authorities receive a homelessness grant allocation and nearly all will use some of this allocation to fund advice services enabling them to prevent homelessness, including assisting home owners. Funding from CLG is not ring-fenced; it is therefore at the discretion of each local authority to determine how best to use the funding to serve its community.</p>

 During the 2004 Spending Review (SR04) period, councils were required to achieve 2.5 per cent. per annum efficiency gains, at least half of which had to be cashable (i.e. release cash resources that could be reallocated to meet local priorities or hold down council tax). This was in line with the efficiency target for the whole public sector and, for councils, amounted to an expectation for &#163;3.0 billion gains by the end of 2007-08.</p>

 English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, were responsible for the costs for staff and the maintenance and management of the millennium dome from July 2001 until the opening of the arena in June 2007.

English Partnerships handed over full responsibility for the dome (now the O2) to Anschutz Entertainment Group in June 2007, when the arena inside the former millennium dome was completed. No further costs were incurred by EP in 2008-09, therefore the amount spent from public funds in 2008-09 is nil.</p>

 The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) is intended to be a deregulatory mechanism which removes the need for planning permission between certain specified uses by grouping into classes land uses which have similar implications for local amenity. The Use Classes Order defines dwelling houses under the C3 use class as houses used by a single person, any number of persons living together as a family, or by no more than six people living together as a single household.</p>

 Decisions about the use of land which is designated as green belt, or whether land should be designated as green belt, must be taken in accordance with the policy in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2 on green belts. This policy has performed an important role in preventing urban sprawl and protecting the countryside for 50 years. There is a presumption against inappropriate development in green belt but the policy allows for some development there, such as to support agriculture or forestry or as limited infill in existing villages. Development that is inappropriate may be permitted only where the benefits clearly outweigh any harm to the green belt and where very special circumstances are also demonstrated. The Government remain committed to current green belt policy and have no intention of making fundamental changes to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1080"><a name="81006w0075.htm_para4"><a name="08100769001456">In the period 1997-2006, an estimated 39,800 dwellings were built in the green belt (as designated in 2007). This accounts for less than 3 per cent. of all dwellings built in that period. In the period 1997-2004, which are the most recent robust figures available for the amount of land developed, around 1,750 hectares of the 2007 designated green belt were developed for residential use. This is around 5 per cent. of all land that changed to residential use in the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1081"><a name="81006w0075.htm_para5"><a name="08100769001457">The total area of green belt land in England in 2007 is 1,636,000 hectares. Taking into account the 47,300 hectares of green belt land which was designated as New Forest National Park in 2005 but which has equally strong policy protection, the total area of green belt in 2007 would show a net national increase of 33,000 hectares since 1997.</p>

 The current version of the Regional Spatial Strategy for the South East (2001) does not propose any green belt release. The Government are currently consulting on the new version of this strategy (known as the South East Plan). The draft contains proposals for selective review of green belt at Oxford and Guildford, and possibly to the South of Woking. The draft also states that boundary review will be required in the area of the former DERA site at Chertsey, as well as a small scale local review at Redhill/Reigate.</p>

 The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) is a risk based evaluation tool to help local authorities identify and protect against potential risks and hazards to health and safety from any deficiencies identified in dwellings. It was introduced under the Housing Act 2004 and came into effect on 6 April 2006. It applies to residential properties in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1094"><a name="81006w0077.htm_para0"><a name="08100769001648">The HHSRS assesses 29 categories of housing hazard, each hazard has a weighting which will help determine whether the property is rated as having category 1 (serious) or category 2 (other) hazards. Local authorities are responsible for the local implementation and enforcement of the HHSRS. If a property is found to contain serious hazards the local authority has a duty to take the most appropriate action in relation to the hazard.</p>

In extreme cases of harassment and where the property is in poor condition, a local authority may take over the management of a house, by making it subject to a control order. A local authority also has compulsory purchase powers which it can use in certain circumstances where there is very bad harassment.</p>

The Department has also asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop a suite of guidance on the prevention of unintentional injury in children under 15 year olds.

 The Department&#146;s interdepartmental working group on sensible drinking reviewed the evidence concerning the beneficial effects of alcohol consumption to both health and mortality and their findings were published in the report &#147;Sensible Drinking&#148;, in 1995.</p>

However, drinking at this level may also contribute to other health harms, although at a lower level of risk.</p>

This is because of the clear evidence that alcohol consumption contributes to a wide range of health harms, particularly when drunk regularly above the lower risk levels. The evidence also suggests that regular drinking above the lower risk levels does not incur any additional protective effect for coronary heart disease. Hence, the advice on lower risk drinking levels for men and women remains consistent with the evidence of possible health benefits for coronary heart disease.</p>

The Department&#146;s website now refers users directly to the NCJDSU website at http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/, which contains the latest statistics, which are updated on a monthly basis.</p>

A copy has been placed in the Library. This has been translated into a number of languages. It is important to note that no screening method is perfect and anyone invited to be screened for cancer must be aware of both the potential benefits and harms of being screened and be able to make an informed decision on whether or not to take part.</p>

The initiative will improve cancer symptom awareness amongst members of the public and healthcare professionals, and will encourage people with symptoms to seek medical help earlier than they do now. It will work with NHS Cancer Screening programmes on key messages and awareness programmes to improve screening uptake, particularly in deprived groups.</p>

 The Department has issued no guidance on the free provision of treatment by hygienists in NHS dental practices. The NHS dental system ensures that patients are entitled to all treatment that is clinically needed which the patient is willing to undergo. Which dental professional delivers the treatment is a clinical matter for the practice not the NHS. Where dental hygienists are part of the team in the practice delivering NHS care that treatment will be free where either the patient is exempt from NHS charges or the treatment itself is free. This is not affected by whether the treatment is delivered by a hygienist or any other dental professional.</p>

 Dentists are required to identify all care and treatment needed that the patient is willing to undergo at the start of treatment and include this within the treatment plan. A single charge covers all the interventions identified within that national health service treatment plan. This applies whatever the gaps between appointments within that course of treatment. Additionally, if within two months of the course of treatment ending the same provider determines that the patient requires further treatment which falls within the same or a lower charging band as the previous treatment no charge may be made in respect of that further treatment. This applies whether or not the treatment is delivered within two months of the previous course of treatment ending.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="2"><i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE): A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. (Episode type used: 3&#151;Birth event 6&#151;Other Birth event)<br>
2. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
4. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
5. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in an HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
7. Down's syndrome codes used:<br>
Q90.0&#151;Trisomy 21, meiotic nondisjunction<br>
Q90.1&#151;Trisomy 21, mosaicism (mitotic nondisjunction)<br>
Q90.--Trisomy 21, translocation<br>
Q90.9&#151;Down's syndrome, unspecified<br>
8. Liveborn codes used:<br>
Z38.0&#151;Singleton, born in hospital<br>
Z38.2&#151;Singleton, unspecified as to place of birth<br>
Z38.3&#151;Twin, born in hospital<br>
Z38.5&#151;Twin, unspecified as to place of birth<br>
Z38.6&#151;Other multiple, born in hospital<br>
Z38.8&#151;Other multiple, unspecified as to place of birth<br>
8. Ungrossed Data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 The Department has commissioned research into the effects of fluoridation on health. A Systematic Review of Public Water Fluoridation published by the university of York in 2000 found no significant association between, water fluoridation and cancer, but called for further research to strengthen the evidence base. Section 58 of the Water Act 2003 placed a duty on strategic health authorities (SHAs) to monitor the effects of fluoridation schemes on the health of persons living in the fluoridated area and publish reports containing an analysis of the effects on health at four-yearly intervals. We have commissioned the West Midland Public Health Observatory to propose a set of standard indicators, which can be used by SHAs to discharge this duty. We understand that, in compiling its proposals, the Observatory is considering whether data on the incidence of bone cancer held in cancer registries could be included among the indicators.</p>

 The number of people supported by Healthy Start fluctuates from week to week as families apply or cease to qualify. The scheme supported around 35,600 families in Yorkshire and the Humber between 4 August 2008 and 31 August 2008. This is the most recent four week period for which figures are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1181"><a name="81006w0090.htm_para0"><a name="08100861001970">The Department ensures that information about Healthy Start is included in Government leaflets about the qualifying benefits and tax credits, and in the Pregnancy and Birth to Five books routinely given to first time pregnant women and new mothers by midwives. The National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services asks midwives and other health care professionals to signpost the scheme. We produce a range of posters, application leaflets, and other resources which NHS and other organisations can order in bulk for local use and we encourage our network of nominated Healthy Start contacts in every primary care trust to order these.

 Our understanding from discussions between the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the herbal medicine sector is that much of practice in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine is based on products prepared to meet individual patient needs. The main regulatory route for such herbal medicines in the United Kingdom would be through the provision of section 12(1) of the Medicines Act 1968 rather than traditional herbal registration scheme set up under European Directive 2004/24/EC.</p>

There is also a provision in the directive under which the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee at the European Medicines Agency can lower the 15 years requirement in specific cases where all other requirements of the scheme are met.</p>

evidence of usage specifically within the EU. We have received a variety of representations on this issue over a period from a number of interested parties such as businesses and practitioner representatives. These have generally argued the case that the specific requirement for evidence of 15 years use within the EU is unduly onerous. The UK is not in position to set aside the provisions of a European Directive. The MHRA presented the case for changing the European legislative requirements in responding to the European Commission&#146;s consultation in 2007 on the early operation of the directive and also alerted interested parties to the opportunity to comment. We await the outcome of that review.</p>

 Compliance costs of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme fall largely on manufacturers and wholesalers rather than retailers. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been running an extensive programme to manage the impact of the THR scheme. This has included well over 100 meetings held free of charge to help companies progress their plans and applications. The MHRA has taken a range of measures to help companies, for example publication of public assessment reports on registration granted, and has also issued a range of pragmatic guidance, for example on how companies can use monographs published by the European Herbal Medicinal Products Committee to mitigate the effects of delay in development of the Community positive list. The MHRA regularly meets the industry&#146;s Herbal Forum to discuss progress of the THR scheme and whether there is further action that either MHRA or industry itself can take to facilitate progress. Recently two specialist small or medium sized businesses achieved their first grants of THR, demonstrating the possibilities for this kind of company.</p>

 Companies are not required to notify the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of products marketed under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968, therefore no estimates are available in relation to these products. Following the expiry of the transitional period permitted under Directive 2004/24/EC manufactured herbal medicines placed on the market will require either a marketing authorisation or a traditional herbal registration (THR). As now there will continue to be some herbal products that potentially can be placed on the market either as medicinal products or under other product regulatory regimes depending on their presentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1199"><a name="81006w0091.htm_para2"><a name="08100861002065">The Government's objective in relation to over the counter herbal medicines is that the public should have access to a range of herbal medicines made to assured standards of safety and quality and accompanied by systematic information about the safe use of the product. The previous regulatory arrangements for unlicensed herbal remedies marketed under section 12(2) left companies free to decide whether to meet any standards and put responsible companies, and in particular those with specialist expertise wishing to operate to high standards, at a significant disadvantage. Consumers were unable to tell which products were made to acceptable standards. The MHRA will continue to operate the THR scheme in a proportionate way, in line with the principles of better regulation. Thereby we expect to see a competitive market offering consumers a wide range of licensed and registered herbal medicines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1200"><a name="81006w0091.htm_para3"><a name="08100861002066">Chromatographic fingerprinting is an accepted methodology in the analysis of herbal products and has been included in European Guidelines and the European Pharmacopoeia since the early 1990s. With regard to multi-ingredient herbal medicinal products it is recognised that identification and assay of individual herbal ingredients in the herbal product is difficult to perform and sometimes impossible. The European Herbal Medicinal Product Committee has recently developed a guideline, in consultation with industry, which addresses the issue of multi-ingredient herbal products. The guideline states that if testing for identity, assay or to demonstrate stability cannot be performed in the herbal product, alternative strategies may be considered. The guideline refers to appropriate fingerprint chromatograms, appropriate overall methods of assay and physical or other appropriate tests. The applicant is therefore able to select appropriate methods and justify their use.</p>

The impact assessment also recognised that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least, depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed.</p>

 Long term conditions are currently defined as those that cannot at present be cured, but can be controlled by medication and other therapies.

 All national health service bodies are subject to the Health Act 2006: Code of Practice for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (commonly known as the Hygiene Code), which came into force on 1 October 2006. The Healthcare Commission (HCC) inspects hospital cleanliness against the duties set out in the code and has the power to issue an &#145;improvement notice&#146;, when it considers an NHS body is failing to observe the code. In addition to its scrutiny of trusts' annual declarations of their own assessments of the measures they have in place to meet the code, last year, the HCC made 120 unannounced visits to assess compliance independently. To strengthen this process, since April 2008, specialist teams from the HCC have been carrying out an annual infection control inspections programme of all acute trusts in the context of the code's requirements. The HCC plans to publish a summary report of some key emerging findings from these inspections shortly.</p>

 No explicit assumption on contractors&#146; ability to secure greater efficiency has been made by the Department. What has been suggested is that the national health service annual efficiency targets should be shared by dispensing contractors as well.</p>

The infrastructure payment is intended to contribute towards the cost of elements of essential service provision which are not directly linked to dispensing a prescription item; for instance, operating within a clinical governance framework.</p>

 The Government are committed to strengthening safeguarding for adults and is consulting on a range of ways of doing so.

 The latest Health Protection Agency data for January to March 2008 shows significant progress, with a reduction in methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) bloodstream infections of 33 per cent. compared to the same quarter last year. These figures also show a 49 per cent. reduction compared to the quarterly average in 2003-04, so the national health service is on course to reach the current nationwide target to halve the number of MRSA bloodstream infections by the end of March 2008 compared to 2003-04 levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1260"><a name="81006w0095.htm_para19"><a name="08100861002745">It is not possible to eradicate health care associated infections completely as many health care interventions have some element of risk and sick people are more vulnerable to infection. However, the NHS is seeking to ensure that no avoidable infection occurs, as well as working towards the current nationwide target for MRSA bloodstream infections.</p>

This means that the annual number of MRSA bloodstream infections for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11 should be less than half of the 2003-04 figure. As we have said in the &#147;Clean, Safe Care&#148; strategy, we do not, however, expect that this should limit the ambitions of organisations that wish to go further, faster. The NHS has made extraordinary progress in reducing MRSA levels and there is no reason to think that the progress cannot be maintained.</p>

A mapping survey in 2008 established that around 80 per cent. of FE colleges now have on-site services. The scope of each service is determined locally by the college's governing body, in negotiation with the PCT which provides the necessary health professional input. In some colleges, provision is limited to condom distribution schemes, whereas in others a wider range of services are available, including pregnancy testing, STI screening, and provision of a broad range of contraception, including emergency contraception.</p>

 The NHS Operating Framework outlines a clear expectation that PCTs will pay particular attention to access for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. This should include looked after children. The framework is underpinned by guidance including the guidance on Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs) which states that looked after children should be taken into consideration when identifying the future health and wellbeing needs of local populations. The framework also states that the Healthcare Commission will specifically consider access to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) provision when carrying out performance assessment of NHS bodies. The beneficial effects of this framework will be maximised by ensuring that the forthcoming statutory guidance on the health of looked after children reinforces the framework&#146;s commitments and outlines exactly how health bodies should ensure that looked after children lead healthy lives. We will also maximise the beneficial effects by seeking to ensure that the data generated to measure the national indicator on the emotional and behavioural health of looked after children is used by local authorities and health bodies to inform how they ensure timely access to high quality mental health services for these children.</p>

 A questionnaire was issued to teenage pregnancy co-ordinators in each top-tier local authority in England, asking them to identify which secondary schools in their area provided on-site health services, which included advice on contraception and sexual health. Responses were received from 70 per cent. of local authorities. Within the local authorities that responded, 627 schools (29 per cent. of the sample) had on-site services. In addition, on-site services were being provided in 84 pupil referral units. Of the 627 schools providing on-site services, 17 were faith-based schools.</p>

 Encouraging children to read more is essential to increasing their chances of success, both at school and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1368"><a name="81006w0106.htm_para5"><a name="08100876001444">The national strategies continue to provide a wide range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure schools provide both high quality teaching and learning in reading, and promote an environment which encourages children&#146;s enthusiasm for reading and helps them achieve their potential. In primary schools and in response to the publication of the Rose Review we have ensured that all children learn to read through the use of systematic phonics. We are also now rolling out the Every Child a Reader programme for five and six-year-old children struggling with their reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1369"><a name="81006w0106.htm_para6"><a name="08100876001445">There are a range of other programmes to promote reading which are available to all schools. For instance, the Reading Connects initiative supports schools in developing a whole-school reading culture; the School Reading Champions initiative uses the motivational power of male role models to inspire boys to read more; and the Family Reading Campaign supports schools in reaching out to parents and the wider family and helping them to encourage children to enjoy reading. All initiatives provide schools with tried and tested practical ideas to promote reading and a wide range of free resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1370"><a name="81006w0106.htm_para7"><a name="08100876001446">Most recently, in June this year, I announced the extension of the Boys into Books programme to the primary sector. This project is bringing over half a million new books into public libraries from September for use on long-term loan in every state primary school in England.</p>

To assist in drawing up these syllabuses the Department, with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), has published a non-statutory framework for religious education which has been supported by all the main faith groups and the British Humanist Association. It says that pupils should learn about Christianity throughout each key stage though, by the end of key stage 3, pupils should have encountered all five principal religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism) in sufficient depth. It also recommends that all pupils have opportunities to study other religious traditions such as the Baha'i faith, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and secular philosophies such as humanism.

 The Department has not funded any research specifically to investigate the direct instruction method of teaching. However, we regularly review research evidence on effective pedagogy to inform the guidance issued by the national strategies. Overall, evidence suggests that while elements of the direct instruction method may be suitable in certain subjects and in certain circumstances, a varied and responsive teaching repertoire is most likely to engage pupils in their learning and support their attainment. The primary and secondary national strategies promote the use of whole class, small group and one to one approaches to teaching, regardless of the areas of learning including, for example, when teaching early reading based on the Simple View of Reading.</p>

 The relocation of the Training and Development Agency to Manchester is estimated to cost &#163;16 million over the three-year period from 2008 to 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1418"><a name="81006w0111.htm_para8"><a name="08100876002153">This is consistent with the Government's commitment to continuous improvement in delivery of public services and to providing value for money to taxpayers. The initial costs are balanced by longer-term benefits for the Agency in the potential for cost savings, reductions in staff turnover, and improvements in the quality of service delivery; and the wider economic benefits for the Manchester region</p>

 The Ministry of Justice collects data for England and Wales on prosecutions brought against parents under the Education Act 1996 for the offence under s444(1) for failing to secure their child's regular attendance at school; and for prosecutions under s444(1A), the aggravated offence of knowing that their child is failing to attend school regularly. It is possible, because of the way courts record data that some data are collected under the more general heading of various offences under the Education Act 1996.</p>

We will remove unnecessary bureaucracy such as demands to store paperwork for up to six years; multiple inspection visits; and minimise reporting requirements at the earliest possible opportunity. In line with the successful actions of some of Britain&#146;s leading employers, we will introduce improvements including more efficient use of electronic audit and storage, simpler and faster registration and certification processes, and more streamlined payment and reporting systems.

<p><a name="stpa_1445"><a name="81006w0114.htm_para5"><a name="08100876002595">We recognise how much older people value and enjoy their courses and the many wider benefits that taking part in learning can bring. There is good evidence that older people benefit substantially from participating in learning and acquiring new skills as part of a fulfilling and active retirement. As we set out in &#145;Opportunity Age&#146;, 80 per cent. of learners aged 50 to 71 reported a positive impact from learning in areas such as their enjoyment of life, self-confidence, and their ability to cope with events like divorce and bereavement, while 28 per cent. reported increased involvement in social, community and voluntary activities. For many older people, learning represents an important social activity, not only providing valuable opportunities for social interaction with their peers and members of other generations, but also offering valuable opportunities to share their own knowledge and skills through community volunteering activities.</p>

We are determined to identify and tackle the real and perceived barriers that face older learners and to ensure that the most marginalised and isolated older people are able to participate. We will continue the consultation dialogue with partners and stakeholders to develop a strategic and durable vision, with policy proposals that work for all older learners and potential learners.</p>

This is our response to the Thoresen Review, published in March 2008, which reports that large numbers of people from all sections of society are not taking basic steps to plan ahead, such as saving sufficiently for their retirement or putting money aside for when unexpected expenses occur. Many are unwittingly taking on significant financial risks because they struggle to choose products that truly meet their needs. Adults without basic literacy and numeracy are highly likely to struggle with their personal finances.</p>

This has been embedded into the wider national strategy to improve adult literacy, language and numeracy. The programme is run on behalf of my Department by the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Its aim is to address the needs of basic literacy, language and numeracy learners through financial literacy, and in so doing to develop their capability to make effective decisions about the use and management of money. In developing the programme NIACE have resources and pilots in several areas. These projects are testing effective ways of engaging adults of all ages and delivering financial literacy in community settings.</p>
