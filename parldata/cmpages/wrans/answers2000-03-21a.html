<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your question about the compensation levels paid and expected to be paid following widening of the M25 between junctions 8 and 9.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Compensation under part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 is awarded for the effects of the full M25 8 - 10 widening scheme, which include the provision of road lighting. The estimate of &#163;20M provided last week in reply to your Parliamentary Question 111815 relates to the full 8 - 10 scheme and we do not hold detailed information in the form you require.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are however, able to give an indication only as to the levels of compensation already paid to residents living between junctions 8 and 9. This is in the region of &#163;7.052M paid to around 680 claimants, giving an average settlement so far of some &#163;10,300.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of those, around 500 claimants live near the porous asphalt section between Leatherhead and Ashtead and have received in the region of &#163;5.9M, an average settlement of &#163;11,508 per claim.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The compensation still to be paid for the outstanding claims should be in the region of &#163;5.2M. This makes an indicative total in the region of &#163;12.25M for the 8 - 9 section.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clapham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many reported incidents involving liquid and gas spills caused by hose failures there have been in the United Kingdom in the last five years for which figures are available; what was the cost of cleaning up each incident and who met the cost in each case; what the estimated cost was of the <i>(a)</i> environmental damage and <i>(b)</i> property damage caused by each incident; and how many people sustained injuries in each incident.  [114220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> Incidents involving liquid and gas spills are reported to HSE under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. From April 1996 to date (a period of just under four years), there were 69 incidents defined as "Dangerous occurrences" and "chemical transfer" (including transfer by hose, pipeline or vehicles). Dangerous occurrences include the release of 100kg or more of flammable liquid, or 10kg of a 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2000 : Column: 466W</I><P>
flammable gas or vapour. Information that would allow us to ascertain how many were caused by hose failures and the number of people sustaining injuries is not always recorded or readily available in all cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the incidence of Mundic in housing.  [115193]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My Department has an on-going programme of research into the better understanding of the deterioration mechanism which affects housing constructed using mundic aggregate. The work is developing methods of testing and assessment to enable the maximum number of houses to be safely accepted by mortgage lenders for obtaining mortgages. Initial recommendations were made in 1994 and 1997 from which the Council of Mortgage Lenders agreed to mortgage about 80 per cent. of houses that had previously been blighted. Further recommendations covering a proportion of the remaining houses will be made in the next few months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 None. The law requires the user of a vehicle to have valid insurance cover. It does not require that he pay for it himself.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what investigation he has carried out into the use of carbon monoxide detectors in homes; and if he will make a statement.  [115028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2000]:</i> My Department, with the Health and Safety Executive and the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned the Building Research Establishment to investigate the optimal siting of electrical carbon monoxide (CO) detectors/alarms in domestic premises. The summary report of this work entitled "Evaluation of carbon 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2000 : Column: 467W</I><P>
monoxide detectors in domestic premises" was published in 1999 by HSE. In partnership with some members of the gas industry we are also currently supporting further research work by BG Technology on the sensitivity and long term reliability of electrical carbon monoxide detectors.
<P>

<a name="00321w01.html_para1">The role of these detectors/alarms is being addressed in the HSE's fundamental review of the health and safety regime for the installation and use of gas. Currently responses to a discussion document are being evaluated and Ministers should receive a report this Summer.
<P>

<a name="00321w01.html_para2">My Department's view is that carbon monoxide detectors/alarms have a role to play in reducing risks from carbon monoxide but the need to properly maintain combustion appliances is paramount.

 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2000]:</i> I understand from the London Underground that three of the five lifts at Westminster station are in service. The work required, and safe methods for carrying it out, on the remaining two are under discussion with contractors and HM Railways Inspectorate. The walls of the station are finished to the approved architectural design. The netting is to catch any foreign objects, which might be thrown by passengers. The Bridge Street underpass is currently cordoned off by contractors to allow for the permanent lighting to be installed; this may look untidy until the work is completed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the letter to him from the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham dated 18 February on sewerage agency agreements, if he will ensure that regulations are introduced to preserve local authority employees' pension entitlements; and if he will make a statement.  [115730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997, local authority employees who are members may already preserve their pension entitlements, indexed in line with inflation, on leaving. Alternatively, the regulations also allow for suitable actuarial transfers to be arranged to provide an equitable service award in any new scheme.
<P>

<a name="00321w02.html_para0">The extent to which employees in local authorities work on the delivery of privatised water company services through agency agreements, and the availability of alternative broadly comparable pension arrangements to those employed under them, is currently being established with the co-operation of the United Kingdom Steering Committee on local government pensions. The results of that survey will be considered carefully.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Commission for Integrated Transport's provisional budget for 1999-2000 had to be allocated well before its launch. A sum of &#163;1.5 million was originally allocated from within DETR's programme budget for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="00321w02.html_para1">Because CfIT was not launched until July 1999, however, it will spend much less than the &#163;1.5 million figure. Its projected spend to the end of this financial year is &#163;269,000.

The current change to London telephone numbers is the result of Oftel's wide 1996 consultation of consumers, businesses and other organisations. The new scheme ensures that there is now a large amount of additional capacity to meet new demand (for example London will now have 80 million numbers behind the 020 code). The extra capacity created is far in excess of forecast demand and will last for the foreseeable future. However, it is impossible to predict all the new services which technological change and market developments may bring into being this century. It is therefore not possible for Oftel to be certain that it will never need to change the scheme further, or that charities, including MedicAlert, will never be faced with such a

<a name="00321w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Following wide consultation with industry and the science sector, the Government concluded that the provision of an astronaut did not best meet our space priorities of commercial exploitation and good space science. Within the inevitably limited funds we have available, we must prioritise in the best interests of the British space science community and industry. A British astronaut is not therefore anticipated in the near future. It is still possible, however, for British nationals to apply for overseas astronaut training schemes.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The figures have been calculated based on the following assumptions:<P>

SERPS expenditure is based on the assumption that State Second Pension is introduced from 2002 and so any SERPS expenditure after that date is on earlier accruals.<P>

SERPS expenditure does not include the effects of the Inherited SERPS scheme and accompanying deferral announced on 15 March 2000.<P>

State Second Pension expenditure assumes the scheme becomes flat rate from 2006 onwards.<P>

From 2006 everyone aged under 40 and earning over &#163;9,500 (in 1999 earnings terms) chooses to contract out of State Second Pension. Contracting out is based on the proposals contained in the current Bill.<P>

2. Increases in contracted out rebates as a result of introducing State Second Pension and Stakeholder pensions are not included in the table.<P>

3. The figures are consistent with those in the Government Actuary Department's report on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill 1999.<P>

4. As the costs are based on long-term estimates and assumptions the figures given for early years, particularly 2000-01, are very broad brush estimates and are subject to uncertainty.<P>

5. The figures are shown rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 billion and may not sum to totals due to rounding.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 875W, on peat compost, what percentage of the compost used in his Department's estate gardens is peat; when use of peat compost will be phased out on his Department's estates; and if he will make a statement.  [115237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 No central records are kept of the amount or percentage of peat used on the Department's estate. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Department's Greening Operations Policy (published in 1998) and its Procurement Manual both state that peat free composts should be used and the current estimate is that if the Home Office makes any use of peat at all this is minimal.

 The statement made by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to Parliament on 13 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 21-24, announced transitional tariff-setting arrangements for those sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure. Under those arrangements, detainees whose tariffs have not expired will be invited to make representations to the Lord Chief Justice. Where they do so, he will consider them and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State who will then regard himself as bound to set fresh tariffs no higher than those recommended by the Lord Chief Justice.
<P>

<a name="00321w06.html_para1">The tariff-setting arrangements for adult murderers remain unaltered. The Secretary of State will continue to set their tariffs after considering a report from the trial judge, the judicial recommendations on tariff and any representations from the prisoner on the tariff information disclosed to him.

 Renderers are paid according to the tonnage of OTMS material processed.

This rate included the cost of collection of raw material from abattoirs, estimated at &#163;10-15 per tonne. Since 1998, and following a competitive tender, the average rate paid for the rendering of OTMS material is as set out in the reply given to the hon.

 The table gives end of year figures for 1979, 1989 and 1999 for red and poultry meat slaughterhouses in England. Prior to 1993, slaughterhouses in England and Wales were not licensed by MAFF, but by local authorities. The England figures for 1979 and 1989 have therefore been derived from records of State Veterinary Service visits during those years and are approximate. For poultry meat slaughterhouses in England, no figures are available prior to 1983.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the scientific areas covered by his Towers of Excellence initiative.  [114327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w08.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2000]:</i> As part of our strategy for defence science and technology, the Ministry of Defence has been developing an approach known as the "Towers of Excellence" model. The intention, in partnership with industry, is to identify areas in which technological excellence might best be concentrated and defence-specific technologies enhanced to the level required to produce world class equipment for our Armed Forces.
<P>

<a name="00321w08.html_para18">To do this on a systematic basis requires a comprehensive view of industrial capabilities and aspirations. There must be sufficiently coherent clusters of technology to enable UK industry to continue to be able to bid for a substantial proportion of UK defence equipment. These towers must therefore align with industry's own plans. We expect this alignment to be informed by the defence industries' own technology strategy which they have prepared to complement that of MOD.
<P>

<a name="00321w08.html_para19">Industry and MOD have agreed on a process for bringing their respective strategies together and defining priorities for constructing technological "towers of excellence" within available resources. Work is likely to continue through to the end of 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2000]:</i> The Hercules C130K Mk1 cannot carry the Puma helicopter. Both the Hercules C130K Mk3 and the C130J can carry one Puma helicopter and would normally require three en-route stops to complete the flight from Brize Norton to SAAF Base Heudspruit.

<a name="00321w08.html_para21">The AN124-100 is capable of carrying four Puma helicopters and would normally require two en-route stops to complete the flight.
<P>

<a name="00321w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There have been no discussions with other NATO countries about this issue. Due to the unique nature of Service life it is Ministry of Defence policy not to have a Service trade union, or federation, for members of the Armed Forces. There are no plans for change.
<P>

<a name="00321w09.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence has agreements with a number of major trade unions, as well as concessions with professional associations, whereby Service personnel may be recognised as eligible for membership. No restrictions are placed on attendance at meetings of civilian trade unions, professional associations, or courses of instruction run by them intended to enhance trade skills and professional knowledge, provided Service uniform is not worn, Service duties are not impeded and no action is taken which would bring the Services into disrepute. It is important that the Armed Forces maintain a position of political neutrality. Service personnel may not therefore participate in industrial action, or any form of political activity organised by a civilian trade union, or professional organisation, to which they belong.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your parliamentary question about the animal breeding programmes at Porton Down since the laboratories are part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As I explained in my letter to you on 19 January 1998 the animal species currently bred at Porton Down are mice, rats, marmosets, rhesus monkeys and a few pigs. Apart from the unusual circumstances arising in 1994/95, when 94 marmosets had to be culled, there has been no excess breeding of non-human primates. Any surplus pigs, as I explained previously, are sent to market.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you know, the independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC) which reviews animal care and welfare arrangements within DERA addressed the issue of animal breeding during the period of its last report (31 October 1998 - 1 November 1999). In particular, the breeding of mice and rats was considered as this leads to the largest surplus. The Porton strain of mice and rats has been used for many years and the outcome of current research programmes relies on the accumulated background data derived from these strains. For this reason, the preferred option is to continue the rodent breeding programme at Porton. The alternative would be to purchase mice and rats from a supplier, which would mean carrying out additional experiments to produce base line data for the different strain.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The scientists at Porton are, of course, mindful of the need to minimise overbreeding in this area. Porton maintains a small number of breeding pairs of mice and rats to supply ongoing research programmes. The number of breeding pairs in the colony is adjusted to meet the estimated demand of the research programmes. Research programmes, however, are not entirely predictable and on occasions there may be an urgent need for animals. Estimates for animal use 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>21 Mar 2000 : Column: 495W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>are regularly reviewed. To an extent research programmes are adjusted either by bringing forward an experiment to use a surplus or, in the case of a shortage, utilising smaller groups over a longer period or by widening the weight range where possible.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee was satisfied overall that the animals bred at Porton are well cared for and only culled when necessary. The AWAC report also pointed out that all culled rodents are donated to wildlife sanctuaries to feed wild birds and so are not wasted.</FONT></UL>

<a name="00321w09.html_para3">On under-reporting, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers in his March 1998 report concluded that there had been under-reporting, again in relation to police complaints. I note that the Special Rapporteur recommended that solicitors should lodge formal complaints and that he welcomed the steps taken by the Law Society to introduce a complaints procedure for solicitors.

 The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers referred in his March 1998 Report to complaints made by Mrs. Nelson.

 The Yorkshire Tourist Board (YTB) will receive &#163;367,000 for tourism projects in the region in 2000-01 from the English Tourism Council--an increase of 26 per cent. on the current year. These projects include development of the Yorkshire brand and sub-regional brands and developing training that is customised to meet customer needs, which will help promote tourism throughout Yorkshire. North Yorkshire, in common with all parts of England, also benefits from the promotion work of the British Tourist Authority (BTA), which 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2000 : Column: 498W</I><P>
promotes Britain as a visitor destination in overseas markets. The BTA is receiving &#163;36 million from my Department this year.
<P>

<a name="00321w10.html_para2">The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy estimates that local authority expenditure on tourism promotion in North Yorkshire in 1997-98 was &#163;1.775 million. In addition, tourism in Yorkshire has also benefited, both directly and indirectly, from the National Lottery, (649 projects in the country have received awards totalling &#163;44,710,497 according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's National Lottery Awards Database which uses information supplied by the distributing bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w10.html_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2000]:</i> From 1 April, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is introducing extended opening times. Visitors can enjoy the Dome from 09.00 to 20.00 on Sundays to Thursdays, and from 09.00 to 23.00 on Fridays, Saturdays, Bank Holidays and during school holidays and the peak summer periods--providing a maximum potential visit time of 14 hours.
<P>

<a name="00321w10.html_para3">The Government are extremely encouraged by the continuing upward trend in visitor numbers to the Dome. Ten million paying visitors will enable the Company to deliver a break even operating budget. However NMEC's target remains at 12 million.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> The contractual terms of each exhibit vary reflecting the different nature and type of exhibit--both in terms of structure and content. Similarly arrangements regarding copyright and intellectual property rights vary. As is normal practice, these contracts contain confidentiality clauses applicable to both parties. NMEC considers that publication of details, including ownership of copyright, from individual contracts runs the risk of adversely impacting on its relationships with its designers and, therefore, on its ability to operate in an effective and commercial manner.

 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2000]:</i> The policy of the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is to pay suppliers within the terms of the contractual arrangements agreed, which is usually 30 days from the day of the invoice, subject to resolution of any queries on the invoice within the 20 day period. As at 7 February, a total of &#163;1.8 million of invoices registered in NMEC's Finance Department remained the subject of on-going discussion with zone designers outside the 30 day period; a total of &#163;2.1 million overdue on the 30 day basis at 7 February--and following resolution of queries where they arose--was released for payment on 14 February.

[115755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w10.html_spnew9"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 As explained in the written reply of 14 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 155W, officials from my Department and Sport England have discussed proposals for holding the 2005 World Athletics Championships in Manchester with the Chief Executive of Manchester City Council. These discussions included a presentation by Manchester on 21 January at Sport England's offices to officials from UK Athletics, Sport England and DCMS. One of the options discussed during that meeting was the possibility of a permanent national athletics facility on the UKSI site adjacent to the City of Manchester Stadium. However, as my reply of 14 March explained, the decision by UK Athletics to submit a London bid for the 2005 World Athletics Championship and the British Olympic Association confirming that it will only consider a London based Olympic bid has effectively ruled out Manchester as a venue for staging these major events.

 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2000]:</i> Under the Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999, local education authorities (LEAs) are able to exercise discretion in three broad areas: eligibility for support, assessment of income and payment of support.
<P>

<a name="00321w11.html_para1">LEA discretion when assessing a student's eligibility for support is limited to specific circumstances relating to: the time limits for applying for support and its duration; the information required to assess eligibility; whether a student meets the residence conditions; whether support may be transferred to another course; and whether a student is unfitted to receive support. LEAs also have discretion in determining whether students meet certain conditions for receiving particular elements of support. There is discretion in determining eligibility for fee support when students have previously attended a higher education course or are repeating part of a course. There are specific circumstances in which LEAs have discretion when determining: eligibility for and the amount of disabled students allowances; the amount of care leavers grant for which a student is eligible; the income of dependants; and the maximum student load for which a student is eligible.
<P>

<a name="00321w11.html_para2">There are also circumstances in which LEAs are able to exercise discretion in determining the residual income of the student, the student's parent or the student's spouse relating to: the financial year of assessment; treatment of a student's income when payments are made as a result of previous obligations incurred; and determining which parent's income to assess when the parents do not live together. LEAs also have discretion to pay support for periods when students are absent from a course and in determining the method of recovering overpayments of support.

 LANTRA, the National Training Organisation for the land based industries, has recently carried out a Labour Market Information and Skills Foresight Survey covering the land-based industries. This exercise provides the foundation for the forthcoming Workforce Development Plan to meet the skill and educational needs of the land-based industries, including agriculture, for the short and medium term. LANTRA is also consulting the agricultural industry on the viability and value of vocational qualifications. A project is underway to revise standards of competence within the land based sector to reduce duplication and increase the relevance of vocational qualifications. The work is due to be completed by 31 December 2001.

My right hon. Friend aims to consult publicly later this year on a revised SEN Code of Practice. The revised Code is expected to come into effect in September next year. Within EIC areas pupils with SEN in mainstream schools benefit from all aspects of Excellence in Cities. In addition special schools are eligible to become specialist or beacon schools as part of the specialist and beacon school expansion under EIC.

 The capital threshold of &#163;10,000 is one of the criteria used when considering the appropriate arrangements which need to be made to protect peoples finances where they lack capacity.

<a name="00321w16.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 February 2000]:</i> The Department has not undertaken any specific studies into the effects on health that might be produced by exposure to dust generated by recycling concrete. Crushing or drilling of concrete releases silicious dust and exposure can lead to silicosis. This is uncommon, but can occur among those exposed through their work. Regulation of levels of dust in the workplace is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive while regulation of emissions is the responsibility of the Environment Agency and local authority environmental health departments. Research shows that it is very unlikely that members of the public exposed to low concentrations of dust near to concrete crushing activity would be placed at any significantly increased risk.

 We issued interim guidance on 11 August 1999 (Health Service Circular 1999/180 and Local Authority Circular (99) 30). This requires health and local authorities, in consultation with each other and, where appropriate, involving primary care groups, to satisfy themselves that their continuing and community care policies and eligibility criteria and other relevant procedures are in line with the Court of Appeal judgment on the Coughlan case and existing guidance, and to take further legal advice where necessary. The interim guidance also states that where authorities revise eligibility criteria following any review, they should consider what action they need to take to reassess service users against the revised criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00321w16.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Local authorities do not hold responsibility for the regulation of private healthcare. Private hospitals and clinics are regulated by health authorities under Part II of the Registered Homes Act 1984. Health authorities apply the Act with reference to guidance on the Registration and Inspection of Nursing Homes issued in 1985 by the then National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts. In addition, the Department issued guidance to health authorities in 1995 which was aimed at promoting a more consistent application of regulation by regulation authorities. The Care Standards Bill, currently before Parliament, seeks to introduce a new regulatory system for care homes and private and voluntary healthcare which will be administered by a single body, the National Care Standards Commission.
