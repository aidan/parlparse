<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what mechanisms her Department is developing to ensure that the proceeds of debt relief are invested in measures aimed at reducing poverty.  [79519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I strongly agree that the resources freed up by debt relief need to be invested in poverty reduction programmes if we are to achieve the international development targets, including halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. We are pressing for the link between debt relief and poverty reduction to be examined and strengthened during the fundamental review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which is underway.
<P>

<a name="90331w01.htm_para0">HIPC debt relief is available only to countries following programmes agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We are working with these organisations to ensure that programmes are designed to promote high quality growth, and that the resources freed up by debt relief are allocated to poverty reduction programmes. Following last year's review of IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), we are working with the Fund to ensure that more priority is given to the social impact of programmes, and that more attention is paid to including civil society in the design of programmes, to increase their poverty impact.
<P>

<a name="90331w01.htm_para1">In addition, following proposals put forward by the UK, the World Bank is developing a set of general principles of good practice in social policy in consultation with the IMF. We envisage these principles should be drawn upon by the IMF and the World Bank in the design of programmes, to ensure that they protect and promote spending on health and education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what support her Department is currently giving to developing countries to improve the quality of primary education.  [79531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our education programmes for developing countries in support of the international goals of universal primary education and gender equity in primary and secondary education include agreements on policies which ensure that our assistance has a beneficial and sustainable effect, and that quality is not compromised in pursuit of the quantified development targets.
<P>

<a name="90331w01.htm_para2">Where required, we provide technical assistance to address quality issues such as teacher training and the curriculum, and make substantial contributions to quality

in the form of books and learning materials. In Uganda and India, we are supporting the development of appropriate and good quality schools and classroom learning environments as part of our wider support to primary education in those countries.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what support her Department is giving to developing countries to meet the target of universal primary education by 2015; and what progress has been made to date.  [79524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In our White Paper we undertook to seek to meet the target of universal primary education by 2015. We have committed over &#163;200 million to basic education in a number of countries including Ghana, India, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and our largest ever single education pledge of &#163;67 million for Uganda. These and substantial new programmes under development will contribute to the international target for universal primary education. It is too early to report progress towards the development goals. DFID programmes cannot be measured in isolation. Progress will be monitored through international education statistics collated and published by UNESCO and other multilateral organisations, including the OECD.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans she has to increase the proportion of bi-lateral aid invested in primary education.  [79518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As we set out in our White paper, we are committed to the international development targets, including Universal Primary Education by 2015. In the Government's first year in office (1997/98), we spent over &#163;13 million of bilateral funds on primary education. This was an increase of &#163;5 million over the previous year. Subsequent major commitments of over &#163;200 million, plus new programmes currently being developed in a number of countries, amounting to at least &#163;200 million will substantially increase the proportion of our bilateral assistance invested in primary education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As we made clear in our White Paper in November 1997, we are committed to the international goals of universal primary education by 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary education by 2005.
<P>

<a name="90331w01.htm_para3">We have committed over &#163;200 million to basic education in a number of countries including Ghana, India, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and our largest ever single education pledge of &#163;67 million for Uganda. These and other new programmes under development are a reflection of our understanding--based on strong evidence--that investment in the education of girls is the single, most effective way to reduce poverty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The latest volcanic assessment was undertaken earlier this month. The review concluded that there has been no resumption of magmatic eruption since March 1998, and that risk levels of a major volcanic eruption are now similar to those in other Caribbean volcanic islands.

 On 1 April 1999 the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) will be established as a Defence Agency. The DARA will be responsible for the provision of deep aviation repair and overhaul facilities to meet the UK's Defence needs. It will enable the MOD's requirements for third line aircraft servicing to be focused on one primary provider. The DARA's Chief Executive will be Mr. Steve Hill and its Head Office will be at RAF St. Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. The Agency will employ 1,726 military and 5,099 civilian staff at four locations in the UK--Almondbank, Fleetlands, RAF Sealand and RAF St. Athan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w03.htm_wqn0"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement <i>(a)</i> on progress in implementing the Smart Procurement Initiative and <i>(b)</i> the Defence Logistics Organisation.  [79889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Smart Procurement Initiative launched in our Strategic Defence Review offers major improvements in the way in which the Ministry of Defence buys and maintains equipment, and supports the Armed Forces. Smart Procurement encompasses the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA), the formation of which we are announcing separately today, and the new Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO), headed by the new Chief of Defence Logistics. Both of these new organisations will form on 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para0">We remain committed to deliver the &#163;2 billion of savings over 10 years which we promised from Smart Procurement, and we have identified clear scope for further savings on top of that. The close working relationship between the DPA and DLO, needed to help deliver these savings, is being achieved in part through the creation of Integrated Project Teams or IPTs. These include staff from both the procurement and support organisations, as well as necessary contracts, finance, operational user and--in particular--industry expertise. We want to foster an enhanced partnership with industry, to reduce risk, encourage innovation and increase the competitiveness of defence industry.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para1">The 10 pilot projects where we have been trialling Smart Procurement techniques and the IPT concept are already starting to indicate new savings running to several hundreds of millions of pounds over their life. They have also identified significant opportunities to get equipment 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 678</I><P>
into service faster, or--for equipment already in service--improve its availability and reliability. For example, the Type 23 frigate IPT is looking to reduce the length of an upgrade programme by 30 per cent. and the VC10 IPT has already identified initiatives to achieve a 10 per cent. increase in serviceability.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para2">Soon after Easter we will launch the first wave of IPTs covering 23 projects or groups of projects in the DPA and DLO. Over the course of the coming year, the remainder of projects will migrate to this new structure, with a total of about 150 Teams forming in all, some 90 in the DPA and 60 in the DLO.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para3">We have streamlined our internal procedures for taking decisions on equipment procurement, and will be reconfiguring MOD Headquarters to ensure that there is a clear central customer for equipment.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para4">The Chief of Defence Logistics, General Sir Sam Cowan, will formally take up his post on 1 April 1999, bringing together the areas of the Chief of Fleet Support, the Quartermaster General and the Air Member for Logistics into a single Defence Logistics Organisation. This will be the largest Joint organisation in Defence, and accounts for some &#163;4.6 billion of expenditure each year. The DLO will become a fully unified logistics structure in April 2000. This offers real prospects for delivering an improved service to the front line at lower cost. A significant proportion of the savings we foresee will come from the Defence Logistics Organisation applying Smart Procurement techniques. There will also be savings in downstream support costs, by ensuring that the whole life costs of equipment are properly considered when procurement decisions are taken.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 679</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para5">We expect the DLO to make significant improvements in our logistic support, for example: in the ways we procure, manage, repair and store defence munitions; in the procurement and management of fuel; and in the use of lean support techniques. We hope to be able to make further announcements here in the coming months. We are also committed to delivering major reductions in our current holdings of non-explosive stores and to rationalisation of our stock procurement, leading to reductions of &#163;130 million a year from 2001-02 onwards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 One of the major issues addressed during the Strategic Defence Review, was how to improve the overall management of the Defence Estate, an important strategic and national asset.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para7">A number of key recommendations were made affecting the role of the Defence Estate Organisation (DEO), which was originally launched as a Defence Agency in 1997. These were, that the Chief Executive should be accountable for working to users to ensure that the Defence Estate is managed efficiently as a whole to support the deliver of Defence Capability, that the Agency 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 680</I><P>
should assume responsibility for all aspects of the surplus property disposal programme and that the Agency should develop a new model for construction procurement.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para8">The effect of these recommendations has been to place major new responsibilities on the Agency and a fundamental review of the role, processes and organisation of the DEO was undertaken and a major change programme has been put in place.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para9">A new Framework Document and Corporate Plan have been produced and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Key Targets for the Agency, which will now be known as Defence Estates (DE), are being finalised and will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para10">The work to be undertaken by DE, under the title SMART CONSTRUCTION, aims for the widest possible use of Prime Contracting. Whilst focusing on the MOD's estate requirements, it is also an integral part of the necessary reform of the UK Construction Industry which is a Government-wide initiative.

 The roles and responsibilities of the organisations involved in the provision of integrated logistic support to new projects and in-service equipments in the RAF have been reviewed in order to streamline process, remove duplication and overlap and implement efficiencies.
<P>

<a name="90331w03.htm_para11">Changes include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. combining two related functional areas already located in Glasgow into a single business unit;</FONT></UL>

 Spain maintains restrictions on all NATO military aviation movements into and out of Gibraltar, including a ban on military overflights and an air exclusion zone to the North and West of Gibraltar. By means of reservations footnoted to the relevant NATO Standing Agreement, Spain restricts access of UK and other NATO warships to Gibraltar. Discussions in June 1998 between FCO/Spanish MFA officials led to agreement on the lifting of some of the restrictions, air diversions in an emergency and the use of Gibraltar-based assets in NATO exercises.

 On 30 November, Baroness Symons, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, met senior French officials of the Ministry of Interior to discuss the handling of deaths of British Nationals and to press for more vigorous investigations by the French authorities.
<P>

<a name="90331w07.htm_para1">We have had no discussions with French Ministers specifically concerning the death of Clive Allison in France. Nor have Ministers discussed the degree of co-operation with British coroners in this case. No Ministerial discussions are scheduled to take place on either topic.
<P>

<a name="90331w07.htm_para2">The Consular Division of the FCO forwarded HM Coroners's letter requesting a police report into Mr. Allison's death to the French authorities in June 1998. The French authorities issued a report which was passed to HM Coroner on 4 September. In a letter dated 5 October, HM Coroner requested more information regarding Mr. Allison's death. His request was translated and forwarded to the French authorities on 6 November. Our Consulate in Lyon continues to press for a response.
<P>

<a name="90331w07.htm_para3">French officials have no direct contact with British Coroners. Requests from HM Coroner for reports into the death of a British national in France are directed to the French authorities through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Co-operation is good; the French authorities have to comply with their own formalities. Requests for supplementary information may take longer for the French to process.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will estimate the annual cost to <i>(a)</i> central Government and <i>(b)</i> local authorities of providing financial support to persons whose rights of appeal under immigration and asylum law have been exhausted;  [79306]

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the monetary cost in the past three years for which figures are available to <i>(a)</i> central Government and <i>(b)</i> local government of support for asylum seekers.  [79305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Asylum support costs are currently divided between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health. In 1996-97, asylum support cost &#163;407.7 million, of which &#163;395 million was borne by the Department of Social Security. In 1997-98, asylum support cost &#163;375 million, of which &#163;305 million was borne by the Department of Social Security. Department of Health costs for 1998-99 are estimated at &#163;190 million. Comparable costs for the Department of Social Security for 1998-99 are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="90331w08.htm_para0">The Department of Health has responsibility for three types of grant to local authorities for asylum seeker support. These are for asylum seekers who are supported under the National Assistance Act 1948, asylum seekers with families supported under the Children Act 1948 and unaccompanied children. As local authority expenditure above a set threshold is subject to only partial reimbursement, the full costs of asylum seeker support to local government are not known.

<P>

<a name="90331w08.htm_para1">The Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before Parliament contains a range of measures to strengthen enforcement of the immigration laws. Among proposed changes that will assist immigration officers in this respect are increased powers of arrest, and new powers to search for and seize evidence. We also intend extending the present powers to fingerprint inadequately documented passengers and immigration offenders.
<P>

<a name="90331w08.htm_para2">The Bill also provides for a new combined appeal process to prevent those at the end of the process from making further appeals in an attempt to frustrate removal, and a simplified administrative procedure to replace deportation in routine cases.

 The information requested is not available in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="90331w08.htm_para3">The available information relates to the number of failed asylum seekers, excluding dependants, who have exhausted their rights of appeal (including any who did not submit an appeal against the refusal of asylum) and who are the subject of port or enforcement action. As at November 1998, that figure was estimated to be 24,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the number of asylum applicants currently in the UK with whom the authorities have lost contact.  [79294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w08.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 As at November 1998, the number of known asylum absconders--those who have applied for asylum at some stage--was 20,000. This covers persons subject to port or enforcement action who have breached conditions of temporary admission, temporary release or restriction order, or are otherwise known to be out of contact with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). Some persons recorded as absconders may have departed from the United Kingdom without the knowledge of IND. Information is not available on the numbers of in-country asylum seekers who have not had enforcement action initiated against them but who are out of contact with IND.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w08.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of the asylum applicant to remain in contact with the Home Office. Failure to do so will result in refusal of the asylum claim for non compliance and consequent action to enforce departure, subject to any appeal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w08.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Malins: </B>

 The available information, relating to removals and voluntary departures under port and enforcement procedures of persons who have applied for asylum at some stage, is given in the table. Failed asylum seekers are only removed once all their rights of appeal in the United Kingdom have been exhausted. It should be noted that the figures may include some persons who withdrew their asylum application or appeal before a decision or determination had been reached.

<a name="90331w09.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on continued agency status for the Prison Service; if a revised Framework Document has now been finalised; when he intends to publish the Prison Service's Corporate and Business plans; and what changes he has made to the Prison Service's Key Indicators for 1990-2000.  [80077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I announced in my reply to my hon. Friend for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on 1 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>430-31</i>, that the Prison Service will remain an agency of the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para0">The new Framework Document is now complete and I am today placing copies of it in the Library. The Framework Document governs the relationship between the Prison Service and the core Home Office, setting out the roles of the principal players and bodies including the Prison Service Strategy Board to be chaired by my noble Friend, Lord Williams, the Minister with responsibility for prisons and probation, within a framework of responsibilities and accountabilities. The document reflects the Government's commitment to take proper ministerial responsibility for the service and the role of the Prison Service as a major component of the wider criminal justice system. It includes material about the planning framework and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para1">The Prison Service's Corporate Plan for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and Business Plan for 1999-2000 is published today. A copy has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para2">The Prison Service's KPIs are kept under review regularly to ensure that they reflect current key priorities for the Service. For 1999-2000, the Prison Service will introduce new performance measures arising from the Home Office Public Service Agreement. I have approved new measures for escapes from contracted-out escorts, staff sickness, cost per prisoner and the time taken to respond to correspondence.
<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para3">The KPI on overcrowding will be changed to measure the percentage of the prison population held two to a cell designed for one. This will better reflect the impact of overcrowding on individual prisoners.
<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para4">Two existing measures will be discontinued next year: time out of cell and staff training. With the emphasis now being given to regimes designed to reduce re-offending, and the gradual introduction of in-cell TV, it is becoming more important to measure what prisoners do when out of their cells than the length of time they are unlocked. Staff training will remain important. A primary focus for the Service in 1999-2000 is to gain Investors in People accreditation which requires evidence of properly targeted training and development for all staff.

<a name="90331w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Following an internal Home Office review last November (a copy of which is in the Library), I have decided to revise and extend the terms of reference of the Prisons Ombudsman. The revised terms of reference, which have been agreed with the Ombudsman, will come into effect from 1 May. They will allow the Ombudsman a wider role in considering complaints made by prisoners, by additionally including investigation of official advice upon which Ministers' decisions are made. A full copy of the Prisons Ombudsman's revised terms has been placed in the Library.

The Home Office is committed to reducing the impact that its business travel has on the environment. Before undertaking any business travel, staff and their line managers consider whether the visit/attendance at a meeting is really necessary, whether the objectives of the meeting could be met through correspondence, e-mail, fax or telephone and whether Video-conferencing facilities could be used. If it is considered necessary, staff must use public transport unless there are operational grounds for using private vehicles/hire cars, for example, carrying heavy equipment, or if the route is poorly served by public transport.There are currently two rates of mileage allowance--Standard Rate and Public Transport Rate. The Home Office operates a strict policy when considering the payment of allowances to officers who use their private vehicles for business travel, including prior authorisation from line managers when Standard Rate Mileage Allowance is claimed. This ensures that private vehicles are only used when absolutely necessary.<P>

<a name="90331w09.htm_para6">Whilst those areas which have higher than average business travel have been targeted since January 1999 in an effort to promote the switch to public transport, it is also proposed to pursue the option of a single rate of Standard Rate Motor Mileage Allowance in the new financial year. If adopted, this should encourage the use of smaller cars and further encourage the use of public transport through a reduced rate of Motor Mileage Allowance for larger engine cars. The Home Office also has allowances for the use of motorcycles and pedal cycles for official travel and increases to the rates will also be sought in the new financial year.

<P>
<a name="90331w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Security checks have never been waived in the Liverpool and Newport passport offices. The question appears to be directed at recent media reports of a suspension of security checks by the Passport Agency. Managers have allowed staff to exercise wider discretion on issuing passports if they had no significant doubt about the identity of the applicant.
<P>

<a name="90331w10.htm_para2">These instructions were withdrawn but they did not imply any suspension or relaxation in the Agency's proper security checks on passport applications.
<P>

<a name="90331w10.htm_para3">A range of automatic and discretionary checks are undertaken at different stages of the passport issuing process to prevent and detect fraud. Additional automatic security checks are undertaken under the new issuing system operating in our Liverpool and Newport offices which also require examiners to adopt a more systematic approach to confirming an applicant's eligibility for passport facilities.

<a name="90331w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The First Nolan Report set out a draft Code of Practice for public appointments procedures and recommended the establishment of an independent Commissioner for Public Appointments. The Commissioner's current Code of Practice reflects the Nolan rules. Ministers make appointments to a wide range of bodies, for example the judiciary, tribunals, boards of visitors and time-limited bodies, which are outside the remit of the Commissioner. The Commissioner's remit covers ministerial appointments to advisory and executive non-departmental public bodies, NHS bodies, the utility regulators, and the boards of public corporations and nationalised industries.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2 Marsham Street is being considered by a major Government Department as temporary decant space in a PFI scheme whilst its premises are being refurbished. The current position is that the decision on the re-use of the building has been delayed because the assessment of the PFI bids which will form the basis of Departmental funding for the programme of works is taking longer than expected. Current thinking is that the evaluation will be completed by September 1999, but re-use is integral to all the bids being considered.</FONT></UL>

 There was no single annual pay award for 1998-99. Special Advisers' pay was restructured as set out in my answer of 16 November 1998. The increases varied depending on the individuals, the work they are now doing compared with previously, and the extent to which their jobs and responsibilities had been restructured. There was also an attempt to correct anomalies created by the previous arrangements, particularly as regards the lowest paid Special Advisers. Performance pay, which used to apply, was dropped.

 Two Reports from the Review Body on Senior Salaries are published today.

Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Libraries of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and the Members of the Review Body for their work.

<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para1">The Government have decided that they will accept all of these recommendations with the exception of that for the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland. In view of the unique political situation in Northern Ireland and the joint responsibility which the Deputy First Minister is expected to exercise with the First Minister, the Government believe that there should be parity of salary between these two posts. Consequently, the salary for the Deputy First Minister will also be &#163;62,556.
<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para2">In accordance with the Review Body's recommendation on an annual pay review for the salaries in the devolved institutions, these figures will be uprated with effect from 1 April 1999 and annually thereafter by the same percentage as the average of the movements in the mid-points of the nine Senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary. This is the same mechanism as is used for Westminster Parliamentary salaries.
<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para3">On the recommendations on allowances which the Review Body makes in the two Reports, the Government has decided that they form a useful starting point for the development of comprehensive and tightly controlled 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 714</I><P>
allowance systems within the new institutions. As the Review Body itself acknowledges, it is not yet possible to know exactly what the allowances will need to cover and some of the recommendations themselves point to further work. The Government believe that further work needs to be done on the basis of the recommendations and that this is best done by the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly themselves. We would expect them to put in place as soon as possible an appropriate but closely controlled system, mindful of the need for a prudent approach and the need to justify to the taxpayer any significant divergence from the recommendations made by the Review Body.
<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para4">In both of the Reports on the new devolved institutions the SSRB noted the difficulty of judging the correct level of pay and allowances when the institutions were not yet in operation. In both cases the SSRB recommended an early review, in 2001, which would be based on the evidence of two years of operation rather than on the current basis of the anticipation of roles and responsibilities. The Government recognise the difficulty expressed by the SSRB and fully accept the arguments for a review in 2001.

<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 715</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para6">This recommendation reflects the Review Body's finding that, since the 1996 changes to the pay arrangements for Ministers in the Commons, the salaries of these posts in the Lords has fallen behind to an unreasonable extent. The proposed one-off increase of &#163;8,500 is broadly equivalent to the amount by which the MP's salary paid to Ministers in the Commons was abated prior to the 1996 changes and so restores the relativity. The Government support the arguments put forward by the Review Body that such an increase for these posts is fair and reasonable. We shall be bringing forward a draft Order for consideration by each House to implement the recommended changes.
<P>

<a name="90331w13.htm_para7">The Review Body also makes a series of recommendations relating to the central provision of IT equipment for Members' offices, both at Westminster and in their constituencies. The Government are not persuaded by the arguments put forward for enforced central provision of such equipment as this would remove Members' choice in determining what equipment they needed, and how much of the Office Costs Allowance they wish individually to spend on it. The Government agree, however, that there may be cost and other advantages in central bulk procurement of IT equipment for those Members who wish to pursue such an approach. We propose therefore to invite the Information Committee to explore this option further and report its views to the House.

<a name="90331w13.htm_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Following agreement at the Berlin European Council on 26 March, it was agreed that for the Structural Funds the budget for 2000-06 will be 213 billion euro (1999 prices). This is an 11 per cent. reduction on the Commission's original proposal, and is in line with the UK's objective of stabilising the overall EU budget.

To ask the Prime Minister what assessment <i>(a)</i> NATO leaders and <i>(b)</i> Her Majesty's Government made at the time they announced that there would be no question of ground forces of NATO being used in Kosovo of the likelihood of retaliatory action by (i) Serb armed forces and (ii) Serb militia units against unprotected persons in Kosovo; and if he will make a statement.  [79812]<P>

<P>
<a name="90331w14.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 From the beginning of the negotiations for a political settlement in Kosovo, we and our allies have been agreed that any such settlement would require the presence in Kosovo of a multi-national military force to oversee its implementation. This remains the position. NATO forces in Macedonia would deploy into Kosovo once a settlement has been concluded, and with the consent of the parties involved. We have all along made it clear that a force of the size and capability required to dictate and enforce a settlement would take a long time to assemble, and would not prevent Milosevic from carrying out his ethnic cleansing activities in the intervening period. The murderous actions of the Serb security forces against the Kosovar Albanian population began before NATO launched its air strikes. However, unless Milosevic complies with the demands of the international community, NATO airstrikes are the only way of stopping him.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w14.htm_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Child poverty is complex and can be defined in a number of ways. Below half average income is used by some as a proxy for those living in poverty, and using that proxy the last two budgets will lift 700,000 children out of poverty. But we are past the definition debate; we are tackling the causes of poverty. The most important priority is to understand and tackle the factors that damage the life opportunities of our children.

 I take the need to identify and reduce the incidence of clinical negligence very seriously. Work has been in hand for some time to achieve this aim. We have changed the funding basis of the Welsh Risk Pool so that those with bad claims records pay more. We have also implemented minimum risk standards for pool members, to identify and address potential problem areas. Failure to achieve these standards again means higher Pool contribution levels. Finally, in our consultation document, "Quality Care and Clinical Excellence" we focus on improving the quality of care, ensuring that clinical decisions are based on the most up-to-date evidence of what is known to be effective.

<a name="90331w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Council of Ministers' meeting in Berlin reached agreement on the Agenda 2000 package of reform to the EU. This package includes the next wave of enlargement of the Union, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the next round of Structural Funds programmes. The economy of west Wales and the Valleys will receive a major boost from the award of Objective 1 status which will bring around &#163;1.2 billion in aid for economic and social development over seven years. Reforms to the CAP will help the agriculture sector in Wales increase competitiveness, enhance food safety and food quality and ensure a fair standard of living and stable farm incomes.

 Good progress is being made with a range of policies to help parents take up employment. The National Childcare Strategy in Wales will create many more childcare places and the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships and the New Opportunities Fund are now getting into their stride to deliver the strategy. The New Deal in Wales is proving very effective. Take-up of the New Deal for Lone Parents is increasing and already over 800 people have obtained jobs through this programme. The Government's Employment Relations Bill contains important new provisions for family-friendly employment practices and the Welsh Office will play a full part in promoting these practices among employers in Wales.

 I am keen to see high quality rail services throughout Wales, and I have announced recently that the Welsh Office will be working closely with the North Wales Economic Forum to improve rail services between North and South Wales. The creation of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority is an important first step in ensuring that the train operators in Wales deliver the service which the public have a right to expect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w17.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 As part of the Comprehensive Spending Review I have established a Social Inclusion Fund that will provide &#163;48 million over three years to tackle some of the most intractable problems in deprived communities across Wales. It will work alongside mainstream programmes, all of which are being harnessed to promote social inclusion in support of my Department's corporate aim: to increase economic prosperity and improve the quality of life for all of the people of Wales, to promote 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 728</I><P>
social inclusion, to extend democratic accountability and to deliver better services throughout Wales. The initial tranche of money from the Social Inclusion Fund, totalling &#163;8 million for 1999-2000 will be targeted at three key areas;
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;5 million will go to a new Children and Youth Partnership Fund, to promote local initiatives to life youngsters educational attainment, engage them in creative activities in their communities and to encourage them away from crime, drugs, vandalism and truancy;
<P>
<BR>
&#163;1.5 million will go to support drug and alcohol treatment services, improving access to treatment particularly for vulnerable younger people; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90331w17.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;1.5 million will go to encourage people to participate in their communities through joining in the work of local voluntary sector initiatives.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90331w17.htm_para3">It is important to recognise the cross-cutting nature of this work. In targeting their proposals for action, local authorities and their partners will be expected to draw out the relevant conclusions from the local crime and disorder audit as well as specific measures of deprivation. They will need to be clear about the intended outcomes and to highlight both their targets and their measurements of success.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para4">In addition, I am making available &#163;1.5 million for 1999-2000 and for each of the following two years to continue and expand the People in Communities programme, which is aimed at tackling social exclusion in disadvantaged communities. &#163;1 million has been allocated to support the existing eight projects and &#163;750,000 will be available for new projects in 1999-2000. I want to see the new projects being brought forward by local partnerships, including partnerships led by the voluntary sector and development trusts, and I have asked my officials to consult the WLGA, WCVA and other key players as they develop this proposal.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para5">I am also making available &#163;25 million over three years through Sure Start to give Welsh children the best possible start in life. The programme, which has been developed in consultation with local government, the health service and the voluntary sector in Wales, will provide extra services to boost the development of very young children especially those from the most deprived communities. It will complement existing mainstream programmes and link with other social inclusion initiatives including those developed under my People in Communities programme. It will also work closely with the initiatives for early years development and child care for which I have announced over &#163;2.5 million to support local partnerships in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para6">In addition to targeting these new funds on particular groups at risk of becoming socially excluded, I am also placing a greater emphasis on social inclusion within mainstream programmes. As one example of this I am also announcing today a &#163;4.5 million Classroom Support Fund. This will provide &#163;1.5 million over each of the next three years to provide additional classroom assistance for those schools that have the furthest to travel to meet the national targets for Wales.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para7">I expect the support provided under this heading to take a variety of forms, reflecting the differing needs of LEAs. Some may choose to recruit classroom assistants to support work on literacy and numeracy. Some may wish 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 729</I><P>
to give a priority to raising levels of achievement within ethnic minority communities. There will also be flexibility to provide support for teachers in other ways.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para8">I have also introduced a new element with a focus on social inclusion within the Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) programme. The new School Improvement Fund will be worth &#163;1.5 million during 1999-2000. It is designed to enable authorities to bring a new focus to the work of achieving the targets set out in their Education Strategic Plans. I would expect authorities to give a particular emphasis to work aimed at bringing standards in the lowest performing schools up to the level of the best.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para9">Taken together these programmes will provide a foundation of seamless services for children and their families, to enrich children's lives and enable them to fulfil their potential.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para10">Further details of my analysis of the challenges facing Wales and the approach my Department is taking to ensure they are addressed effectively are set out in a statement "Building an inclusive Wales: tackling the social exclusion agenda". This will provide the National Assembly with a useful starting point from which to develop its own policies. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para11">In addition local authorities have a key part to play in responding to the needs of children who require specialist support. Too often in the past, they have failed children in their care with the result that the lives of some of the most vulnerable of our children have been damaged. That is completely unacceptable. Much has been done to implement recommendations from the Children's Safeguards Review. To build on that work and to ensure key recommendations are carried forward I have made available &#163;5 million within the local government settlement for 1999-2000 for 'Children First', a three year programme to modernise and transform local authority social services for children. This is an ambitious and far-reaching programme and one we are determined to see through.
<P>

<a name="90331w17.htm_para12">My Department is writing to local authorities and others with responsibilities for children in their care to set out the details of the improvements we expect to see and the arrangements for the National Assembly to monitor progress.

I have therefore decided that, from March 2000, as with other local authorities in the rest of Wales, Cardiff County Council and the Vale of Glamorgan authority should regain responsibility for the economic, social and environmental regeneration of the whole of their areas. As elsewhere, they will be able to rely on the services available from the WDA and other economic bodies on the basis of partnership. I have also discussed with those authorities the implementation of projects planned by CBDC which may not be completed within the lifetime of the Corporation, including the Penarth Link, Hamadryad Park, a significant environmental upgrade in the Bay area and an access road to the Cardiff Yacht Club. I have also considered the provision necessary for the new responsibilities and liabilities which each authority will inherit: and transitional support for certain local services in South Cardiff. For these purposes, I shall be making available over a period of 3-5 years a total of up to &#163;13 million to Cardiff County Council and up to &#163;8.2 million to the Vale of Glamorgan. Copies of the understandings reached with the local authorities will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para3">The Corporation's non-development assets and liabilities will be transferred to Cardiff County Council and to the Vale of Glamorgan Council respectively. Development assets and liabilities, including management of the proposed Bute Avenue PFI, will be transferred to the Welsh Development Agency. I shall invite the parties to discuss together and agree with me the timing and terms on which these transfers will take place. Land currently held by CBDC at the Ferry Road Peninsula will be transferred to Cardiff County Council, subject to terms and conditions to be agreed between the Department and the Council and taking into account the relevant provisions of the Development Agreement between CBDC and Associated British Ports.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para4">Future sponsorship of the Techniquest organisation will transfer to my Department. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Gwent Levels Bird Reserve will pass to the Countryside Council for Wales.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para5">I attach particular importance to the efficient and safe operation and maintenance of the Barrage and to the exploitation of the impounded lake for the public benefit. These responsibilities, including groundwater monitoring and control and management of water quality in the Bay, 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 732</I><P>
are also of direct and significant interest to the local communities in Cardiff and the Vale. As foreshadowed in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act 1993, I propose to establish a dedicated body with responsibility for the operation, maintenance, and management of the Barrage, the outer harbour and the inland Bay. I shall enter immediate discussions with the Corporation regarding the purpose, functions and funding of such a body and will also fully explore the opportunities for partnership between the public and private sectors. I shall consult with local authorities and other interests before final decisions are taken.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para6">On the basis of a thorough review of Barrage costs, I have decided to increase the financial cap for the project from &#163;191 million to &#163;197 million, subject to settlement of any unresolved and future claims. This is the best available estimate of the final outturn cost, subject to settlement of any unresolved and future contract claims. The increase is mainly attributable to the increased cost of the Bird Reserve on the Gwent Levels and additional costs arising from new legislation. A Budget Review report on the Barrage will also be available shortly and I shall place a copy in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para7">I am also pleased to announce a public consultation on the Corporation's proposal to install a dewatering network in the area of South Cardiff most at risk from rising groundwater. Copies of the Corporation's submission, including a report by Professor Stoner, can be obtained from Mr. D. Lowe at CBDC, Baltic House, Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff CF1 8DH. Comments should be sent by Friday 30 April to Mr. G. A. Fagan, Regional Development Division, Welsh Office, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF1 3NQ.
<P>

<a name="90331w18.htm_para8">Finally, I should like to place on record my personal admiration for the great achievements of the Chairman, Board and staff of the Corporation, in removing the legacy of dereliction in South Cardiff, transforming it into an area internationally acclaimed as a major development success and in the first rank of investment locations. I am confident that the successor arrangements I have announced today will secure the continued successful regeneration of Cardiff Bay.

 Young people who are participating in employment and training programmes funded by the Department for Education and Employment, on a non-employed basis, are not liable for income tax on any training allowance.

<a name="90331w18.htm_para11"><i>Letter from Peter Collins to Mr. John Healey, dated 26 March 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked Leigh Lewis to reply to your question about eligibility for Employment on Trial and its linked eligibility to extended payments of Housing Benefit and Council Tax benefit. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Mr. Lewis as Chief Executive of the Agency. I am replying in his absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be helpful if I begin by confirming that Employment on Trial can only be considered when a jobseeker accepts a job having being unemployed for a period of at least 13 weeks. The job must be for at least 16 hours a week and the jobseeker must stay with the employer for at least four weeks, but no more than 12 weeks, to be eligible. Jobseeker's Allowance regulations, can qualify again for Employment on Trial after a further period of 13 weeks unemployment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To be eligible for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit extended payments, the jobseeker must have been continuously registered as unemployed and in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance for at least 26 weeks before starting work. If someone has a second Employment on Trial period after having been unemployed for the minimum of 13 weeks, they will not have had the period of unemployment of at least 26 weeks which is required to re-qualify for extended benefit payments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In such circumstances, people who do not re-qualify for extended benefits may still be eligible for Housing Benefit and Council Tax reductions. This will depend on the amount of earnings and the individual's personal arrangements. Advice can be sought through the local council offices of Employment Service adviser.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 1999]:</i> In 1999-2000 we have made available additional funds through the &#163;251.5 million School Improvement Standards Fund grant to support activity designed to improve standards of pupil performance in order to meet school, local education authority and national targets. Support provided through this grant explicitly includes induction. We have made clear in the Standards Fund guidance (Circular 13/98) local education authorities' responsibilities to pass on adequate funds to schools in respect of such induction programme for newly- qualified teachers through devolvement of the School Improvement grant.

<a name="90331w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The consultation period for <i>Ingredients for Success</i> has finished and the views we have received are helping us to draw up draft regulations setting out the standards. These will be the subject of a further consultation exercise. We are on target to introduce the new standards from Autumn 1999. Until then, local education authorities can decide their own nutritional guidelines for delivering a school meals service. The Government offer more general advice on healthy eating which applies to everyone over the age of five years. This is set out in <i>The Balance of Good Health and Eight Guidelines for a Healthy Diet.</i> We plan to issue further guidance to local education authorities and schools alongside the forthcoming regulations.
<P>

<a name="90331w20.htm_para0">When the new standards take effect, local education authorities which provide meals will be under a duty to ensure that the standards are met and that prospective suppliers, selected in line with the best value legislation, can comply with them.

 Decisions on the sourcing of produce at retail level are matters for the commercial judgment of the various food retail companies. It is not the Government's role to interfere in such decisions. However, Regulations were laid before Parliament on 11 March which will significantly increase aid for farmers in England converting to organic practices. We expect that this will result in an increase in the area of land being farmed organically and potentially more organic produce available for sale to consumers.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to amend the measures to control landings by vessels of 20 metres and over landing whitefish and shellfish into the United Kingdom.  [79986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w22.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following representations from the fishing industry, the Fisheries Departments have looked at the designated port arrangements which came into operation on 5 January 1999 to see whether any changes should be made in advance of the wider review to be undertaken this Autumn.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para6">The main concern was over the lack of flexibility in providing notice of landings into non-designated ports and outside specified hours at designated ports. After careful consideration, we are allowing fishermen to give between 4 and 24 hours notice of landing and 4 to 72 hours notice where landings take place on a Sunday or Monday. The Department will also exercise discretion to waive the requirement to give 4 hours notice of landing in cases of force majeure or exceptional difficulty. Additionally, some adjustments are being made to the specified landing times for Brixham, Grimsby, Hull, Kinlochbervie, Lerwick, Lochinver and Oban and the specified landing location for Kinlochbervie.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para7">As part of the Autumn Review, the Fisheries Departments will consider the role which satellite monitoring will play in the operation of the designated port arrangements from 1 January 2000 and the provision of satellite position reports as an alternative to the prior notification of landings at non-designated ports and outside designated landing times at designated ports.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para8">The changes will take effect from 19 April and are being notified to the owners of all vessels of 20 metres and over.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he proposes to issue a consultation paper on the management of the under- 10-metre fishing fleet.  [79985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A consultation paper on steps to improve the management of the under-10-metre fleet is being published today and copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The paper is being sent to inshore fishermen and other interests for comment by 30 June this year.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 746</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para9">The paper confirms that the Fisheries Departments are looking at ways in which the management of quota allocations for this part of the inshore fleet can be developed with the objective of avoiding early or mid-year closures of fisheries. At the same time, it seeks views from fishermen and other interests on the steps that might be taken to constrain fishing effort. Action is also planned to deter unlicensed fishing activity, to prohibit the transshipment of fish between under and over-10-metre vessels, and to deal with vessels which have been shortened, re-registered and relicensed as under-10-metre vessels, and subsequently re-lengthened to fish as over- 10-metre vessels without the necessary consequential adjustments to their registration and licence status.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para10">The under-10-metre fleet is an important and integral part of the UK fishing industry. Its members hold wide ranging and diverse opinions, often reflecting local needs and conditions. The consultation process, which is now under way, will help to draw together these views so that informed decisions on the way forward can be taken later in the year in partnership with the newly devolved administrations. It is expected that any change in the present quota management and licensing arrangements will take effect during the year 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w22.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he received the report of the working group announced by him in December 1997 to review the operation of the current fishing vessel licensing arrangements; and what action he is taking to implement its recommendations.  [79984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have now received the Report of the Working Group, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. I am most grateful for the valuable contribution made by industry representatives in the preparation of this Report. They have had a difficult task to perform, balancing the complexities of the existing licensing arrangements against the wide ranging interests of fishermen throughout the UK.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para11">I am also pleased to note that the primary recommendation of the Working Group is that the overall structure of the present licensing regime should be retained. However, having weighed the arguments carefully, I have concluded that there are grounds for two small changes to the current structure, to upgrade moratorium licences and those Category B licences to which are attached individual species licences to full Category A status. These changes will take effect from 1 May 1999.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para12">Industry members of the Working Group have made a further 10 recommendations relating to various aspects of the licensing regime. These will be followed up by Fisheries Departments with one exception. The Group has recommended that there should be no further linkage between fishing licences and vessel safety certificates. This is a sensitive issue, and one which is the subject of on-going talks between Fisheries Departments and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions following the publication last autumn of the MAIB report into the sinking of the Pescado. I attach great importance to the safety of fishing vessels, and 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 747</I><P>
believe that it is essential that all ways of improving vessel safety are fully explored.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para13">As a result of recommendations from the Group, three further changes to the present licensing rules will take effect from 1 April 1999. First, we are amending the provision whereby the capacity penalty may be waived where a vessel being replaced has been destroyed or permanently disabled as a result of fire, sinking or other accidental cause, so that it is no longer necessary for the age difference between the replaced and replacement vessel to be no more than seven years. The requirement for the capacity of the replacement vessel to be no greater than that of the replaced vessel (measured in VCUs) will remain.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para14">Second, with regard to licence entitlements, the deadline for submitting a valid licence application to Fisheries Departments is extended from two years to three years from the date that the entitlement first arose. This will apply to all existing licence entitlements as well as to entitlements created after 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para15">Third, a new licence will be made available to owners of vessels fishing exclusively in external waters who have taken advantage of the arrangements announced on 31 March 1998 to replace the vessel with a vessel of larger capacity, without acquiring additional domestic water licences to cover the increase in capacity. This licence will allow them to continue to fish for non-TAC stocks in those parts of ICES Sub Areas VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XII and XIV which lie outside Community waters. All other conditions relating to the licensing of the replacement vessel remain in force.
<P>

<a name="90331w22.htm_para16">Finally, I have noted the Group's offer to give further consideration to measures to improve the present capacity penalty arrangements, and to act as a forum for the discussion of licensing issues in the future. I welcome this recognition of the value of constructive engagement of the industry in developing policy and envisage that this forum will be used in future. We shall be reconvening the Group later this year to look at the scope for improving the capacity penalty arrangements.

 Following the Krebs report, it is clear that TB in cattle is a complex problem with a multiplicity of causes. A wildlife reservoir is a significant factor, but we need to be clear why it is that some farms suffer TB incidents while others in the same vicinity do not.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para0">In order to focus our efforts on understanding these processes, and to illuminate the detailed differences between farms, we are now launching the epidemiological investigation which was piloted on a small number of farms last November.

Copies of the new questionnaire (form TB99) have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para2">As soon as there are enough entries in the database, we shall start to analyse the information to try and identify those factors which, either individually or in combination, are associated with TB incidents. Information on cattle movements, husbandry and farm management practices, wildlife on farms and the local environment will be analysed alongside other data, for example on local weather conditions and patterns of badger activity. The results will be used to develop new control strategies and will feed through into improved guidance for farmers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about the monitoring of genetically modified crops.  [74100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w23.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> Monitoring is a key requirement for the safe release of GM crops. Monitoring enables the assumptions made in the risk assessment to be verified, and any unanticipated effects of GMOs to be identified. The legislation in place is quite clear: if evidence comes to light of harm to the environment, action must be taken to restrict or suspend the release.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 749</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para4">All research releases of GM crops are monitored throughout the duration of consent, and in most cases post-trial monitoring is also required. This is carried out by the consent-holder on the basis of a monitoring plan which forms part of the application. At least once a year a monitoring report must be submitted to the Secretary of State, and a copy is placed on the statutory public register.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para5">To date, authorisations to place GM products on the market under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC have not included conditions requiring monitoring. The Directive is currently being amended, to include the introduction of provisions for post market monitoring. The Government strongly support the amendment of the Directive to incorporate these requirements.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para6">Pending the revision of the Directive, EU Environment Ministers agreed in December 1998 to use the flexibility within the existing Directive to introduce with immediate effect new monitoring provisions, based on monitoring proposals in the draft amending Directive. These take into account direct and indirect, and immediate and delayed, effects of GMOs on the environment. Monitoring requirements would be set out on a case by case basis for each product authorisation and enforced by the relevant competent authority.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para7">On top of the new EC requirements, the UK Government have introduced additional measures for the monitoring of GM crops. I announced the agreement reached with the plant breeding industry for a managed development programme for herbicide tolerant GM crops with my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, before the House of Lords Select Committee on 21 October 1998.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para8">Farm-scale evaluations will ensure that first commercial plantings of herbicide tolerant GM crops will be strictly limited and monitored for ecological effects alongside comparable plantings of conventional crops. The Government are funding ecological studies of the diversity and abundance of plants and invertebrates associated with the management of GM and non GM crops to test whether there are any significant differences, initially over a four year period. This will assist consideration of what effects GM crops may have on higher species and our agricultural landscape. If ecological monitoring reveals adverse effects then appropriate action will be taken.

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1999]:</i> Such approval is not necessary for the evaluations to begin. The farm-scale evaluations of genetically modified oilseed rape which will start this year are covered by an approval for research or other purposes issued under Part B of Directive 90/220/EEC. This year the gm oilseed rape will remain the property of the seed company concerned and will be destroyed at harvest.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the Government will allow the sale of products for <i>(a)</i> human and <i>(b)</i> animal consumption from the farm-scale field trials into the ecological effects of genetically modified crops.  [78476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w23.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1999]:</i> All genetically modified crops produced this year from the farm-scale evaluations will be destroyed. A decision on the fate of products in subsequent years has not yet been taken, but any sale for human or animal consumption will be dependent on the product receiving all the necessary consents and authorisations.

<P>
<a name="90331w23.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government aimed to establish the public private partnership (PPP) for the Underground by 2000-01, removing the need for subsidy beyond that point. We have consistently made clear, that we will not be driven by an artificially imposed timetable. The Government's overriding objective is to secure the best value solution for London Underground. In the light of this, we are keeping funding for London Underground under review with London Transport and will take decisions in the context of LT's overall financial position.

<a name="90331w23.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The immediate priorities of the Government and London Transport are to see improved reliability and increased service levels on the existing network, plus the completion of the Jubilee Line Extension. Service levels increased by 12 per cent. over the past five years, and London Transport plans a further 8 per cent. increase in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90331w23.htm_para11">In the longer term, capacity increases will be written into the performance specifications for contractors under the Public-Private Partnership, as signalling, trains and other key assets on individual lines reach the stage when they need replacing.

<P>
<UL>Ms Glenda Jackson: The forecast on which the financial modelling for the PPP has been based is for fares to rise by 1 per cent. above the rate of inflation in 2000 and 2001, and following that, for fares to rise by the rate of inflation.

<P>
<a name="90331w24.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Most of the funding for Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in 1999-2000 will be in respect of the regeneration programmes which they will inherit. The distribution of those resources is determined largely by statistical indicators of need. While sparsity is not an explicit factor, regeneration funding to rural development areas has been on the basis of a formula designed to reflect rural needs.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para2">For later years, resources will be allocated to RDAs in response to the corporate plans which they submit to the Secretary of State. Allocations will take account of the needs of the regions, the soundness of the RDAs' plans for tackling those needs and their performance in implementing their programmes.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para3">A review is currently underway of the Index of Local Deprivation, which is used in the distribution of the Single Regeneration Budget.

I am today issuing statutory guidance to advise them on what Government expects of their strategies. The guidance has been prepared in consultation with all relevant Government Departments, in particular the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Employment. Its publication follows a wide public consultation launched last October. The comments we received enabled us to refine the guidance and I am grateful to all those who responded to our request for comments.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para4">The fundamental purpose of RDAs' strategies will be to improve regional economic performance and enhance regional competitiveness. The guidance stresses the need for RDAs to develop an integrated and sustainable approach in their strategies. The aim should be to tackle business competitiveness and the need to increase productivity and to address also the underlying problems of unemployment, skills shortages, inequalities, social exclusion and physical decay. By integrating economic, social and environmental issues in this way, the strategies will set the context for sustainable economic growth in the English regions.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para5">We want the RDAs' strategies to support and enhance national policies while addressing the particular needs of regions. In this way they will be able to inform and influence national Government's economic policies and to provide a framework for the delivery of national and European programmes.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para6">RDAs' strategies will provide focus and coherence not only to the RDAs' own work, but also to the work of their regional partners. The strategies should be the product of regional dialogue, and should identify priorities for action which regional partners can buy in to and help to deliver. Only through strong and effective partnership will the RDAs ensure that their strategies command support. Their relationship with the emerging regional chambers will be of particular importance.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para7">I am also giving to the RDAs today a supplementary package of non-statutory policy and programme guidance to underpin the statutory guidance on their strategies. This will include material on regeneration, competitiveness, skills, sustainable development, rural policy, equal opportunities and working with the voluntary and community sectors.
<P>

<a name="90331w24.htm_para8">Copies of all the guidance have been placed in the Library and will also be available on the DETR website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w25.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Transport Council met in Brussels on 29 March. I represented the United Kingdom. The Council held policy debates on a number of legislative proposals. Council Conclusions were agreed unanimously on two other issues.
<P>

<a name="90331w25.htm_para1">Two of the items on the Council agenda for policy debate--proposals for a regulatory framework for the Community's railways, and a proposed package of measures designed to promote combined transport--had already been considered at previous meetings, while two--a draft Directive to regulate working time in the road transport sector, and a Commission proposal to amend the transport Trans-European Network guidelines to include ports and inter-modal terminals--had not been discussed in detail by the Council before. In each of these debates, once Member States had given their views the Presidency invited the Committee of Permanent Representatives to undertake further work, with the aim of enabling decisions to be taken at the June Council.
<P>

<a name="90331w25.htm_para2">Council conclusions were agreed on the position to be taken by Member States at the forthcoming Diplomatic Conference to modernise the Warsaw Convention on air carrier liability. The Council also agreed conclusions explaining its decision to delay adoption of the Regulation restricting the use of aircraft modified ("hushkitted") or re-engined to meet current noise standards. The Council agreed that the Regulation should be adopted, by the end of April, to allow time for discussions with affected third countries.
<P>

<a name="90331w25.htm_para3">The Commission gave a presentation of its recent Communication proposing a new European satellite navigation and positioning system, which it has named "Galileo". Delegations identified a number of questions for further consideration at an informal meeting of EU Transport Ministers in April.
<P>

<a name="90331w25.htm_para4">Under other business, the Commission reported on two legislative proposals on which it was working. One would amend the Second Directive on driving licences, to allow certain professional drivers who met the previous, but not the latest eyesight standards, to renew their licences. The other consisted of a replacement for the draft Directive on airport safety checks, on which the Council had reached a common position but which could not be adopted because of objections by Spain over its application to Gibraltar Airport. These proposals could not however be put forward formally until the new Commission was appointed.

 Together with the Welsh Office, my Department will today publish a document entitled "Taking Water Responsibly: Government decisions following consultation on changes to the water abstraction licensing system in England and Wales". Copies are available in the Library of the House. Those decisions reflect the Government's intention that the abstraction authorisation system should contribute to sustainable development by protecting and, where possible, enhancing the aquatic environment whilst facilitating economic growth and higher living standards with minimum impact on water customers' bills. These decisions relate to changes which:

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w25.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Existing policies on exports and imports of waste are set out in the United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, which came into effect on 1 June 1996. These reflect the long-standing UK commitment to self-sufficiency in waste disposal and the well-established proximity principle, namely that waste should be disposed of in, or as close as possible to, the country or origin.
<P>

<a name="90331w25.htm_para11">Since the Plan has been in force, there have been a number of changes at national and international level which have altered the arrangements for transfrontier shipments of waste. My Department, along with other Government Departments, therefore intends to begin a review of the plan in the near future. We would aim to produce a document for public consultation in the Autumn of 1999.

 The information requested is not currently available.

<a name="90331w26.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Most ratepayers have their rateable values assessed using conventional methods by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) and the Assessors in Scotland. However, this has to date been problematic for certain industries. Instead, these industries have had their rateable values prescribed by Order by the respective Secretaries of State. The industries currently in prescribed assessment are:

<a name="90331w26.htm_para7">The VOA and the Scottish Assessors' Association have been examining whether it would be feasible for these industries to have their rateable values assessed by conventional methods. Although they have concluded that conventional assessment would be possible, the results would be far from clear. Conventional assessment would lead to significant differences of opinion over possible values which in many cases, would be properly resolved by only the courts. The level of uncertainty is significantly above that which could be expected from most properties. Resolving this uncertainty could take several years.
<P>

<a name="90331w26.htm_para8">Therefore, the Secretary of State has, together with my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will provide financial assistance to Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council under the Bellwin scheme for costs incurred following the severe flooding between 25 October and 1 November 1998.  [80061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified in the case of Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council given the exceptional nature of the floods and the damage caused. A scheme will, therefore, be established under section 155 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 764</I><P>
of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant will be paid to the authority to cover 85 per cent. of eligible costs above a threshold and which have been incurred by the authority in dealing with the flooding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_wqn2"><B> Ms Ryan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent financial arrangements he has made to assist the London Borough of Haringey.  [80062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Haringey has serious short-term financial difficulties brought about by a variety of circumstances which have combined to put their revenue budget under severe pressure. After having regard to all the relevant factors, and in view of the fact that some of the Council's circumstances could not reasonably have been foreseen and planned for by the authority, I have concluded that Haringey should receive some form of assistance in order to protect the delivery of local statutory services.
<P>

<a name="90331w27.htm_para2">The most appropriate form of assistance is the offer of a Supplementary Credit Approval (SCA) of &#163;1.3 million in 1998-99. This, with a capitalisation direction, will allow the Council to spread some of its costs in 1999-2000 over a number of years and so bring its budget back to a manageable level. It will be for Haringey in the first instance to decide which costs they intend to finance through the SCA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Efford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what arrangements he is making to ensure that the Greater London Authority can discharge its responsibilities.  [80063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Subject to the passage of the GLA Bill now before Parliament, the GLA will assume its responsibilities on 3 July 2000. We have commissioned consultants, KPMG, to advise on transition arrangements for the GLA. KPMG have now completed their report and copies are being placed in the Library. Among their conclusions, KPMG recommend that a dedicated Transition Team be established under the leadership of a Head of Transition and that the latter should be recruited as a matter of urgency.
<P>

<a name="90331w27.htm_para3">The Audit Commission has kindly agreed to second to my Department Dr. Robert Chilton, Director Local Government Studies at the Commission to be the Head of Transition. Dr. Chilton, who will report to Ministers through the Director of the Government Office for London, will work closely with my officials to plan a smooth transition for the GLA and to ensure that the necessary financial controls and administrative machinery are in place. He will also be available, should the Authority so decide, to act as statutory Chief Administrative Officer of the Authority and is in a position to make a permanent appointment. I am most grateful to the Audit Commission for making this assistance available. It will be for the GLA, once elected, to make its own arrangements for permanent appointments to senior positions.

<a name="90331w27.htm_sbhd4"><H4><center>London Taxi Fares</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about London taxi fares.  [80065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State is making an Order increasing London taxi fares by 4.32 per cent. on average with effect from Saturday 24 April 1999. The new tariff will incorporate a minimum charge of &#163;1.40 (including a hire charge of &#163;1.00) for the first 438 metres (479.2 yards) or 96 seconds. The rate will then be 20p for every 219 metres (239.6 yards) or 48 seconds until the fare exceeds &#163;10.00, and 20p for each 146 metres (159.7 yards) or 32 seconds thereafter.
<P>

<a name="90331w27.htm_para4">In addition, the Order will increase the supplements for evenings, nights, weekends and public holidays, which have not been increased since the early 1980s. The supplement for hirings during weekday evenings and during the day on Saturdays will therefore go up from 40p to 60p; the supplement for night-time hirings on weekdays and hirings around Sundays and public holidays will increase from 60p to 90p; and the supplement for hirings over the Christmas and New Year period will increase from &#163;2.00 to &#163;3.00.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what performance targets have been set for the Ordnance Survey Department and Executive Agency in 1999-2000.  [80066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w27.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The following performance targets have been set for Ordnance Survey in 1999-2000:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. To achieve a revenue target of &#163;83.4 million (excluding the National interest in Mapping Service Level Agreement);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. To achieve a return on sales (excluding the National Interest in Mapping Service Level Agreement) of not less than 5 per cent.;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. To ensure that, by 31 March 2000, 98.8 per cent. of existing major detail is surveyed and available to customers in the National Topographic Database at any one time. The target will increase to 99 per cent. by the year 2001;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. In order to provide a quality service to customers, to despatch 92 per cent. of small scale products within 5 working days.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90331w27.htm_para5">These targets have been reviewed in the light of Ordnance Survey's change to a Trading Fund from 1 April 1999. They demonstrate the Agency's continuing commitment to customers whilst increasing the emphasis on key financial monitors.

<a name="90331w28.htm_sbhd0"><H4><center>Valuation Tribunals</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the conclusion of the financial management and policy review of valuation tribunals.  [80067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Libraries of the House copies of the FMPR report of Valuation Tribunals. The report has also published on the DETR's web site.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para0">This is the second FMPR of the VT service. It covers the full range of judicial, management and procedural issues. It takes account of extensive consultations with the VT service, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), local authorities and the private sector.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 766</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para1">We have decided that VTs should remain lay, independent and local bodies. A move to the private sector is considered inappropriate for such quasi-judicial bodies. A national agency is also considered inappropriate at the moment, although an efficiency scrutiny might consider the scope for rationalising jurisdictions and support services for a range of similar services.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para2">A new Management Board, supported by a new national office, is needed to set standards and spread best practice within the service. To raise the quality of the service requires a review of membership levels, new arrangements for their appointment, and a requirement for new members to attend appropriate training and to provide written certain undertakings.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para3">Significant savings are to be made by the establishment of 14 administrative units to replace the 38 offices which existed at the start of the review. New staffing arrangements are needed to support the new administration structure. Consultants have recently been appointed to bring forward detailed proposals.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para4">Effective administration needs the continued modernisation of the VT IT system, and better use of IT for communicating with the 'outside world'.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para5">The appeal procedures need reform to reduce delays, improve information and guidance to rate and tax payers, and to address the existing culture of brinkmanship. The review recommends more effective incentives and a simpler system. These proposals are the subject of a further consultation paper, which I am also publishing today (copies of which have also been placed in the House Libraries and on the DETR's web site).
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para6">The aim is to implement recommendations on judicial management and staffing aspects by 1 April 2000. Changes to office accommodation and the establishment of the 14 administrative units will be phased in over a longer period. New appeal procedures need to be developed in time for appeals arising from the non-domestic rating revaluation on 1 April 2000, though implementation may need to be phased.

<a name="90331w28.htm_sbhd1"><H4><center>Waste Management</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he intends to take in response to the consultation exercise for amending the Special Waste Regulations 1996 and Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994.  [80068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The proposals set out in the consultation paper issued by my Department, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office on 2 April 1998 were generally welcomed by both industry and the Environmental Agencies. Having analysed the responses, we intend to proceed with the proposed amendments to the Special Waste Regulations, together with some further minor changes to the format of the consignment note and to the schedule under which carrier's notify movements of multiple loads--aimed at assisting monitoring and enforcement. In response to representations from business, we also intend to amend the Regulations to enable registers of Special waste to be retained in exceptional cases at sites other than those from which special waste has been removed, subject to consent by the local Environment Agency. Two consequential changes will also be made. First, to update references in the 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 767</I><P>
Regulations to the latest versions of the Approved Supply List and Approved Classification and Labelling Guide. Secondly, the Government's powers to set fees in respect of Special waste will be repealed, in order to enable the Agencies to utilise powers to set charges under the Environment Act 1995.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para7">A number of respondents to the consultation exercise said that lower fees should apply to wastes being recycled or recovered. Although it is not feasible to consider this issue as part of the current exercise, the Environment Agencies will in the longer term be reviewing the fees for Special waste in the context of making a charging scheme. This would be subject to consultation and subsequent approval by the Government. Later this year, it is also intended to undertake a general review of the Regulations.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para8">Following advice from the Environmental Agencies, we also intend to proceed with a small number of adjustments to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 aimed at encouraging the recycling or recovery of Special waste. Exemptions from licensing will be provided, subject to various conditions, to enable:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i. storage of up to 23,000 litres of unused (waste) household paint pending re-use;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii. laundering of up to 250 tonnes of waste textiles contaminated with oil, together with associated storage;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iii. storage of up to 5 tonnes of nickel cadmium or nickel metal hydride batteries and up to 10 tonnes of lead acid batteries pending recovery;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iv. storage of up to 23,000 litres of silver-bearing waste from printing or photographic processing pending recovery.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para9">The consultation paper additionally proposed that the existing exemption for operations recovering silver from waste should be extended to include Special waste. There was very little support for this proposal and strong arguments against it which we have discussed with the Environment Agency in the context of ensuring proper protection for the environment and human health. As a consequence we have decided not to proceed. The Government have been considering the introduction of regulations to set standards for oil storage installation on which an announcement is planned later this year. The proposal in the consultation paper to amend the exemption for temporary storage of Special waste to include a separate limit for waste oil will be considered in the context of that announcement.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para10">A further announcement will be made when the amending Regulations for England are ready to be laid before Parliament. As a devolved matter, the amendments for Scotland and Wales will be for consideration by the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales.

<a name="90331w28.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Small Cetaceans</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he intends to take to minimise disturbance to small cetaceans in accordance with the United Kingdom's obligations under the agreement on the conservation of small cetaceans of the Baltic and North seas.  [80069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have today published two sets of guidelines aimed at minimising disturbance to cetaceans in UK waters. The first is aimed at those involve in whale watching, both tour operators and members of the public 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 768</I><P>
who participate in tours; the second at those involved in recreational activities in UK coastal waters who may incidentally encounter cetaceans.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para11">The Government are committed to protecting all species of whales, dolphins and porpoises and to maintaining healthy population levels for our and future generations. Where guidelines do not already exist we hope that this initiative will stimulate the development of locally targeted codes of conduct based on the over- arching principles contained in these guidelines.

<a name="90331w28.htm_sbhd3"><H4><center>Works Notice Powers</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects the works notice powers to come into force.  [80070]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w28.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have laid before the House new regulation, the Anti-Pollution Works Regulations 1999, which will enable new powers for the Environment Agency to serve works notices on polluters or potential polluters to be brought into force.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para12">The works notice powers will enable the Environment Agency to serve a notice on polluters or potential polluters requiring them to carry out works or operations to remedy or prevent water pollution. They represent a more direct regulatory measure for the Agency than its existing powers to carry out anti-pollution works itself and then recover costs from the person responsible.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para13">Works notices provide an additional regulatory goal for the Agency that will help prevent pollution incidents which in the past have occurred when a potential polluter has failed to respond to an informal approach.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para14">The Regulations are largely procedural and make provision for the content of work notices, appeals against works notices, compensation for rights of entry and entry on to the Agency's public pollution control registers of particulars relating to works notices.
<P>

<a name="90331w28.htm_para15">The Regulations have been subject to wide public consultation. In addition to comments on procedural matters some concerns were raised about the service of works notices in relation to other regulatory regimes, in particular the contaminated land powers. As a result the Environment Agency has set out its policy on the use of the works notice powers in a statement which my Department has agreed. Essentially, where other powers apply, for example the contaminated land regime, action would be taken under those powers.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will provide a breakdown by ethnic origin and grade of (1) the judiciary, (2) members of tribunals and (3) the magistracy.  [79049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w29.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The available information is as follows: (1) The Judiciary: the figures for the ethnic origin of judges are believed to be correct, but as the ethnic origin of candidates for judicial office was not sought before October 1991, the data may be incomplete. (see table).




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 769</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90331w29.htm_para0">2. Tribunals: this information is only available for the Employment Tribunal and Social Security Appeals Tribunal where it has been collected on the same basis as for the judiciary since October 1991. It is set out below. Information in respect of other tribunals has only been collected on a consistent basis since 1998. (see table).

<a name="90331w29.htm_para1">3. Magistracy: complete information is not readily available. It is held on individual records and not yet collated centrally. It could therefore only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, an ethnicity questionnaire was sent out to Lay Magistrates in England and Wales (excluding the Duchy of Lancaster) in May 1997 to which there was a 93 per cent. response rate. The details are set out in the table.

(24) A Dedicated Investment Portfolio is one which has been constructed to accommodate the specific requirements of the client and has a sufficiency of funds and duration to allow it to be adjusted in line with stockmarket or client circumstances.<P>

<P>

(25) The formal investment review is a full consideration of the overall investment strategy being pursued for a particular portfolio. It is complemented by PTO policies of unitising smaller funds and benchmarking larger portfolios against stock exchange models. The investment media held in the funds are subject to on-going review as company announcements or relevant research material becomes available and actioned at any time.<P>

<P>

(26) The target includes two new standards for the review of receivership accounts, they are to:<P>

<P>

complete a review of 80% of receivers' accounts within 12 weeks of receipt;<P>

review 80% of the Receiver's accounts within 12 weeks.<P>

These standards will be reviewed on receipt of the Committee of Public Accounts' recommendations on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report 'Protecting the Financial Welfare of People with Mental Incapacity'.<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

Fuller details of the Office's performance targets will appear in the PTO Plan, which will be available from the Public Trust Office later in the year.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gorrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what was the initial budget for converting and fitting out the Church of Scotland Assembly Hall and adjacent buildings as a temporary home for the Scottish Parliament; and what is the latest estimate of the cost.  [70210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The current estimates are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Converting the buildings: &#163;4.5 million</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fitting out (including IT, telecom, security equipment, furniture, office equipment): &#163;3.1 million.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90331w30.htm_para0">The initial estimate was given in my answer on 12 May 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>88</i>, to the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), and included rent and rates. This was a provisional estimate and I made it 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 776</I><P>
clear then that it did not include fitting out costs, which were still being assessed. The estimate of building conversion costs at that time was &#163;2m. Full building condition surveys were carried out on the CEC office buildings when the Scottish Office took occupation at the end of November 1998. These surveys revealed that significantly more work would have to be carried out in these building than was previously envisaged. In particular, work was required to ensure that lighting throughout the office buildings complied with current statutory requirements and to improve electrical systems, fire alarms and emergency lighting to meet current building regulations. In addition special services to meet the needs of the Parliament such as IT networks, security measures and provision for broadcasters have had to be provided.
<P>

<a name="90331w30.htm_para1">The costs of these items could only be properly assessed once the Scottish Office had occupation of the buildings.
<P>

<a name="90331w30.htm_para2">All of these costs will be met from the financial provision made for the establishment of the Parliament in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gorrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the estimated cost of those roadworks made necessary by the siting of the new Scottish Parliament building.  [77939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 1999]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him earlier today.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gorrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the estimated cost in relation to the new Scottish Parliament building of <i>(a)</i> VAT, <i>(b)</i> fees, <i>(c)</i> site purchase, <i>(d)</i> site clearance and preliminary works and <i>(e)</i> road works; and which of these are included in the &#163;50 million cost referred to in his answer of 28 January 1999, to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>385</i>.  [77438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w30.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1999]:</i> The figures requested (with the exception of <i>(e)</i>) are shown in the table, along with the estimated construction cost of &#163;50 million (excluding VAT and fees) referred to in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) on 28 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 385-86.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many deaths, where hypothermia was mentioned on the death certificate as the main or contributory cause of death, took place in each <i>(a)</i> region and <i>(b)</i> parliamentary constituency of Scotland in 1997, amongst those (i) of all ages, (ii) aged 60 to 74, (iii) aged 74 to 84 and (iv) aged over 85 years; what were the winter mortality rates in each of those areas for (1) the population as a whole, (2) people aged 60 to 74, (3) people aged 75 to 84 and (4) people aged 85 years and over; and what the percentage increase was in each group in each area compared to non-winter deaths in 1997-98.  [72593]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> The information requested is presented in the following tables.
<P>

<a name="90331w31.htm_para0">There is no universally recognised definition of winter mortality. The information presented in the second table is based on a formula that has been used in recent years by the Office for National Statistics when presenting data for England and Wales. This defines 'excess' winter deaths as the difference between the number of deaths during the four months December to March and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). A negative figure occurs when the average non-winter deaths exceed the winter deaths. As this is a crude measure of the increase in mortality associated with winter conditions the numbers of excess deaths have been rounded to the nearest ten.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many deaths, where hypothermia was mentioned on the death certificate as the main or contributory cause of death, took place in Scotland in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1992, <i>(c)</i> 1987, <i>(d)</i> 1982 and <i>(e)</i> 1977 amongst those (i) of all ages, (ii) aged 60 to 74, (iii) aged 74 to 84 and (iv) aged over 85 years; what were the winter mortality rates for (1) the population as a whole, (2) people aged 60 to 74, (3) people aged 75 to 84 and (4) people aged 85 years and over; and what the percentage increase was in each group compared to non-winter deaths in 1997-98, 1992-93, 1987-88, 1982-83 and 1977-78, respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> The information requested in presented in the following tables.
<P>

<a name="90331w31.htm_para4">There is no universally recognised definition of winter mortality. The information presented in the second table is based on a formula that has been used in recent years by the Office for National Statistics when presenting data for England and Wales. This defines 'excess' winter deaths as the difference between the number of deaths during the four months December to March and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). As this is a crude measure of the increase in mortality associated with winter conditions the numbers of excess deaths have been rounded to the nearest ten.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The number of Ministers in the Scottish Executive will not be known until after the election on 6 May 1999. However, the question of private office support for the First Minister and other Ministers is currently being considered as part of the general planning associated with devolution. No estimate of the cost of funding the private office has yet been made. The cost will be met from within the overall provision made for expenditure on administration of the Scottish Executive.

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1999]:</i> Trainees in Skillseekers who are designated as having special training needs (STN) and who are on placement with an employer do not receive a training allowance from the employer. The training allowance is paid by the training provider at a level set by the LEC. An employer who is delivering the training under contract to the LEC and is, therefore, acting as the training provider, would be responsible for managing the training allowance. If an employer has chosen to employ an STN trainee, then he will pay the trainee a wage, not a training allowance.

<P>
<a name="90331w34.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 March 1999]:</i> This information is not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Since the beginning of the Highlands and Islands Objective 1 programme in 1994, more than 80,000 separate payment claims have been processed. The processing of individual claims may have been delayed for various reasons, including the need to clarify with the project sponsor the information provided in the claim. Until recently, payments could only be made when the relevant funds had been transferred from the EU Commission. New arrangements have now been introduced to ensure that payments are no longer delayed for this reason.

<P>

<a name="90331w34.htm_para6">The <i>Herald</i> newspaper carried extensive extracts from the Select Committee's report on 26 November, together with a feature and a leading article on the subject. The newspaper confirmed to my office that it had a leaked copy of the entire report. The story was followed up by many Scottish and UK newspapers and by the broadcast media.
<P>

<a name="90331w34.htm_para7">As a result of that coverage, I received many requests for a response from journalists and complaints from members of the Select Committee who felt that the press reports misrepresented their position. This led me to comment, when approached by journalists during an unrelated engagement on the morning of 26 November, that the report appeared to have been subject to selective quotation.
<P>

<a name="90331w34.htm_para8">I spoke to my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) later that day.

<P>

<a name="90331w34.htm_para9">At the time of our conversation, the report had already been made to the House, was at the printers, had been leaked in its entirety, had been extensively quoted and commented on in the press and was the subject of many requests for comments made to my office. It was already in the public domain, and the possibility of influencing its contents, which would have been wholly improper, could not arise.

<a name="90331w34.htm_para10">My conversation with my hon. Friend was on that basis.

He told me he would do so after consulting the report, which he did not then have to hand. Relevant extracts were sent by fax to my office a short time later.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement about the prior options review of the Registers of Scotland Executive Agency.  [80169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w35.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 A prior options review of the Registers of Scotland Executive Agency was carried out recently for my Department. The review concluded that there will continue to be a need for a function to maintain a register of title to land with the power to make independent decisions in cases of dispute, and recommended continuation of both Agency and Trading Fund status.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para0">Extensive recommendations on issues such as governance and target setting were made to enhance the strategic management of the Agency and to improve its commercial approach.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para1">I have accepted the recommendations on Agency status and on improvements to the coverage and stringency of the Agency's targets, which will be revised as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para2">I have not, however, accepted the review's recommendation that decisions on the Agency's accommodation strategy should be brought forward. As recently as last November, I agreed that the Agency should maintain its presence in its existing, or similar, locations in Edinburgh and Glasgow until 2007. This option will have the least impact on the Agency's productive capacity at a time when it will be undertaking the major task of completing the extension of the Land Register to the whole of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para3">The recommendations on Trading Fund status, governance arrangements and the future strategic management of the Agency will be considered by Ministers of the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w35.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Eric Clarke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he will issue finalised planning policy guidance on opencast coal.  [80170]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w35.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The Government's planning policy for opencast coal is being published today in National Planning Policy Guideline 16: Opencast Coal and Related Minerals. This NPPG, which replaces NPPG 4: Land for Mineral Working as the relevant guidance for opencast coal and related minerals, indicates the considerations which planning authorities should take into account in framing development plan policies and in determining planning applications for the extraction of opencase coal and related minerals. NPPG 4 continues to provide policy guidance for all other minerals.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para5">The new guidance takes account of the Ten Point Plan prepared by the Government before the Election, the outcome of the Energy Fuels Review and the responses made to consultation on the draft revised guidance which I announced to the House on 22 October 1998. The guidance ensures that a robust framework is in place to protect communities and the environment from any 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 798</I><P>
potential harm caused by proposed opencase coal developments. It will ensure that all proposals are subjected to tough scrutiny and if consent is granted the highest environmental standards will apply.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para6">As a result of the new guidance, planning authorities will need to review existing development plan policies for controlling opencase coal and related mineral extraction. To ensure early action, the Secretary of State is issuing a direction requiring all the relevant planning authorities to prepare and submit an alteration to their structure plan policies to bring them into line with the guidance. The Direction relating to the notification of certain applications to the Secretary of State, issued on 22 October 1998, remains in force, although it will be reviewed once the new guidance is reflected in planning authorities' structure plans.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para7">The Government do not envisage a prohibition on the working of opencast coal. However, NPPG 15 properly puts concern for communities and the environment at the heart of decision making by seeking to apply a sustainable approach in determining where extraction may take place. Full weight should be given to the effect and potential disturbance on local communities as well as other environmental considerations including nature conservation and the impact on the landscape. Where a proposal would cause demonstrable harm, the guidance is clear that permission should not be granted except where the benefits of the development proposal to the community would out-weigh the potential harm. The Government look to planning authorities to steer proposals to environmentally acceptable sites and, where necessary, to refuse consent where they judge such developments would not be in the overall best interests of the affected local communities and environment.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para8">A copy of the guidance is being placed in the House Library. Copies are also being widely circulated to those with an interest including planning authorities, the industry and environmental interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the outcome of the review of the operation of the Packaging Waste Recovery Note system to demonstrate compliance with the Packaging Regulations.  [80171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w35.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 I have considered the conclusions of the Advisory Committee on Packaging together with representations made in the course of the review of the Regulations. Obligated parties are keen to see greater transparency in reprocessors' treatment of Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) revenue so that they know that the resources they are putting in are being used as intended. I therefore propose the following changes to the PRN system in Scotland:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) that as a condition of accreditation, reprocessors should provide an annual return to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) showing PRN revenue for the previous year; the proportion of PRN revenue that has been passed to others to develop the collection infrastructure; and what proportion was directed at either developing reprocessing capacity or at developing end-use markets for recycled materials. Details 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 799</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>should also be provided as to what additional capacity is planned and what steps have been taken to develop markets for recyclate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) that PRNs should be issued to obligated parties only or to those representing them. In addition, individual businesses who are obligated members of the packaging chain and bring waste for reprocessing, should be given first refusal on the PRN when such waste is accepted for reprocessing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para10">Reprocessors should therefore make reasonable forward provision for such obligated parties who wish to have PRNs, and I would expect the obligated parties also to do what they can to ensure that the reprocessors are informed as soon as possible about their PRN requirements.
<P>

<a name="90331w35.htm_para11">I will be asking SEPA to amend their Guidance Note to reflect these changes.

[79551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w35.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Work is currently in progress to ensure that all the necessary arrangements are in place to allow the tax varying powers to be used with effect from 6 April 2000 if the incoming Scottish Executive wishes to do so. If that work continues, therefore, all of the set-up costs for Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security will have been incurred by then. It will, however, be a matter for the incoming Scottish Executive to decide whether or not this preparatory work should continue.

 The Government's proposals for the 2001 Census of Population set out in the White Paper (CM 4253) published on 4 March were made after extensive consultation. Potential users were asked to submit business cases setting out the uses and value of collecting information from the Census for each topic. The criteria against which these cases were judged included an assessment of the resources that are distributed on the basis of the information, the value of the information for very small areas (which the Census in particular can provide), the existence or otherwise of alternative sources, the acceptability of the question to the form-filler, the quality of the information obtained, and the costs of collection.
<P>

<a name="90331w36.htm_para0">The main reason for the proposal not to include a question about religious affiliation in Scotland was that no strong case has been made by users in central and local government or elsewhere that the uses to which information from such a question would be put require a Census question (rather than obtaining the information from alternative approaches such as a sample survey). A change in primary legislation would also be required to ask a religion question in Scotland.

 Retiral ages for all Sheriffs are set by statute and no changes have been made, or are proposed, in relation to permanent sheriffs. Temporary Sheriffs are appointed for one year at a time and commissions are subject to review annually in the light of the needs of the courts. On the recommendation of the Lord Advocate, a number of Commissions of older Temporary Sheriffs have not been renewed to make way for the appointment of younger recruits who can be tested on their ability to move on to permanent posts. This policy has been discussed on two occasions with the Temporary Sheriffs Association. Individuals affected by the ruling have been invited to make representations and some Commissions have been extended where exceptional cases have been put forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w36.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The UK renewables industry currently employs some 3,500 people in 700 companies. The British Wind Energy Association estimate that of these there are around 2,600 full-time equivalent jobs currently engaged in the production of electricity from wind power. As I said in my recent announcement of the publication of our Renewables Review Document, on 30 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>577-78,</i> through creating an export drive, and by further developing the industry and the UK market, up to 45,000 jobs could be created.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w36.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 In 1979 less than one third of a per cent. of the inland consumption of primary fuels in the United Kingdom were met from renewable sources, that is less than &#190; million tonnes of oil equivalent. This rose to 1.0 per cent. by 1997, equating to 2.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent.
<P>

<a name="90331w36.htm_para8">Currently, approximately 2 per cent. of UK's electricity is generated from renewable sources. We expect this to rise to 5 per cent. by 2003.
<P>

<a name="90331w36.htm_para9">The Government are working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent. of UK electricity supplies as soon as possible. We hope to achieve this by 2010.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the Low Pay Commission's Review of the National Minimum Wage Accommodation Offset.  [80124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w39.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 During the drafting of the National Minimum Wage regulations 1999 the Government received a number of submissions from employers and intentional communities about the operation and amount of offset that may be allowed to count against the National Minimum Wage where a worker is provided with accommodation, and its long term future. The Government fully recognise that the offset is an important factor in pay in some sectors, such as hotel and catering, and that if set at the wrong level it would have a detrimental impact for those sectors and their employees.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para5">Because the offset in the regulations reflects the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission, the Government asked the Commission to look again at this issue as a matter of urgency and report to Government. The Government is today publishing its report and copies are available in the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para6">The Government would like to thank the Commission for looking at this matter so quickly.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para7">The Commission has made three recommendations:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) There should be no immediate change to the rate of the accommodation offset in the national Minimum wage regulations, but the Commission should monitor the use and impact of the accommodation offset on business and employees.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The Commission should monitor the administration of the accommodation offset and, in the light of practical experience, report on its future application in their second report.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(3) Members of intentional communities should be regarded as volunteers rather than workers, and not covered by the National Minimum Wage.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para8">In considering the matter the Commission looked again at the evidence and basis for their earlier recommendation and took further oral and written evidence. They also looked at current practice through collective agreements, arrangements under the Agricultural Wages Boards, previous practice under the Wages Council and arrangements in other countries. The Commission concluded that there was little evidence at this stage that businesses could not cope with the level recommended and that therefore no changes should be made at this time. 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 813</I><P>
However, it recognised that it would be important to monitor the operation of the offset in light of practical experience and the application of the National Minimum Wage Regulations. It proposes that it should do this as part of its remit to monitor and evaluate the introduction and impact of the national minimum wage. The Commission has agreed with the Office for National Statistics a trailer question to the 1999 New Earnings Survey which it is hoped will provide a clearer insight into the practice of providing an accommodation allowance.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para9">The Government agree with the Commission's conclusions and accept their recommendations not to change the offset at this time. However, the Government are keen that the Commission should closely monitor the practical effects of its application. The Government also note the Commission's acknowledgement that the continuation of the offset is of significance for a number of businesses and workers and welcome its intention to undertake a full review of its next Report.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para10">The Commission also looked at the position of individuals who follow a particular lifestyle living and working as members of a religious or charitable community--intentional communities--in receipt of board and lodging and a small amount of subsistence. The Commission concluded that the position of members of intentional communities was similar to that of volunteers, who are specifically excluded from the National Minimum Wage, and that they should be treated as such. The exclusion of volunteers in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which was agreed with the support of all parties and the voluntary sector, is drawn very narrowly and does not cover members of intentional communities. It will therefore be necessary to amend the 1998 Act to provide an exclusion.
<P>

<a name="90331w39.htm_para11">The Government accept the Commission's recommendation that members of intentional communities should not be covered by the National Minimum Wage and propose to introduce a suitable amendment to the 1998 Act through the Employment Relations Bill which is currently before Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what is the Government's policy in relation to trademarks and the effects on parallel imports; and if he will make a statement.  [80126]<P>

<P>
<a name="90331w40.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Silhouette Judgment of the European Court of Justice last July confirmed as a matter of law that the European trade marks Directive does allow trade mark owners to use their rights to prevent import of their goods into the Community after they have been marketed elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="90331w40.htm_para0">The Government are keen to ensure that European legislation gives high priority to the interests of consumers, whilst recognising the legitimate interests of producers in securing reasonable protection for their intellectual property. Parallel importing can apply downward pressure on prices in some markets to the advantage of consumers, but producers' investment in innovation and in developing product quality and reputation could be impaired to the detriment of consumers. Price differences in some consumer sectors now indicate that there is a need to consider the effects of the current law, and whether any change would be of benefit.
<P>

<a name="90331w40.htm_para1">The effects of trade mark rights and parallel imports vary greatly between market sectors and this would have to be taken into account. In particular, there are sectors where special factors apply, for example where there are material differences between products for different international markets sufficient to lead to consumer confusion or where there is risk to health or safety.
<P>

<a name="90331w40.htm_para2">The Government have considered the recent report from the European Commission on the results of a study it has had made into the economic effects of the present trade marks regime, and is pleased that this will be discussed at the next meeting of the Internal Market Council. We are also aware of recent research conducted in Sweden, which indicates net benefits from a change in the law. We will be looking closely at the methodology and results of this Swedish study, and will be analysing the benefits and costs that could accrue to the United Kingdom.

 No. My Department received three times as many bids for support from the available budget and I regret it was not possible to assist a group at this event in that year. We are ready to consider a bid for support in the 2000-2001 programme.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 1999]:</i> The information is in the following tables. Figures for trade in goods have been provided on an Overseas Trade Statistics (OTS) basis. Figures for trade in services are on a Balance of Payments (BOP) basis. The main difference between trade on an OTS and BOP basis is that BOP figures exclude goods not changing ownership. In 1998 this resulted in a difference of less than 1 per cent. in the export values. Import figures on a BOP basis also exclude the cost of insurance and freight. In 1998 this resulted in a difference of just under 3 per cent. in the import values.

<a name="90331w41.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what preparations are being made by Oftel in respect of his responsibilities under the Competition Act 1998; what increase in staff is required; and what action is being taken to co-ordinate policy with the Director General of Fair Trading.  [77686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> Oftel is a member of the Concurrency Working Party, which is chaired by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and is working to ensure that a consistent approach is being taken by all regulators. A guideline "Concurrent Application to Regulated Industries", which deals with how regulators work with the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) and with each other, has been produced by the Concurrency Working Party and issued by the DGFT. Oftel has also published draft guidelines on how the Competition Act will be applied in the telecommunications sector, and the final version is to be published in May. A compliance forum for the industry is to take place at the end of April 1999. In February, the DTI issued a consultation document, "Concurrency: consultation on the possible need and scope for regulations".
<P>

<a name="90331w41.htm_para0">Oftel has put in place a structured training programme to ensure that staff are prepared for the coming into force of the Act, and is also participating in the training programme organised by the OFT. The issue of whether additional staff are required is reviewed regularly. Oftel has not yet bid for more staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations have been made by the British Government to the European Space Agency about the environmental risks of the Cassini space probe; and when such representations were made.  [77935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The British Government have been in close contact with the European Space Agency in both the preparation and elaboration of the Cassini-Huygens mission and have discussed all aspects of the mission with ESA on a number of occasions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Fitzpatrick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the British Government have obtained a copy of the European Space Agency's evaluation of the Cassini space probe.  [77936]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and its moon Titan is a collaborative programme between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). Within this collaboration, NASA was responsible for developing 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 820</I><P>
the Cassini spacecraft. NASA commissioned two independent safety assessments and has produced a document summarising the findings which is available on the internet.
<P>

<a name="90331w41.htm_para1">ESA was responsible for developing the Huygens space probe. Senior ESA Directors attended major NASA programme reviews during the development of Cassini and reported to member states on major milestones. These reports were given orally during the course of the Agency's normal programme board meetings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Fitzpatrick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations have been made by the British Government to the Government of the United States about the environment risks of NASA's Cassini space probe; and when such representations were made.  [77933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The BNSC has examined the two independent environmental impact statements commissioned by NASA prior to the launch of the Cassini-Huygens mission. Both of these endorsed the use of plutonium on the mission. In addition, under US law, NSA has a duty to minimise the risks associated with its work, as well as a responsibility to conform to the United Nations Principles on the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992), an initiative in which the UK took a leading role.

<P>
<UL>(2) by what date he expects that a handling agreement will be concluded in respect of bronchitis and emphysema care involving Scottish miners;  [78759]
<P>
(3) if he will ensure that exposure to coal dust in the period before 1954 is not discounted for the purposes of compensation in any handling agreement concluded in respect of claims for compensation by Scottish miners for bronchitis and emphysema.  [78757]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 1999]:</i> Officials held constructive and positive talks with Scottish solicitors on 30 March, and are due to meet in April, to discuss handling arrangements for the 5,000 or so claims from Scottish miners. Although we offered the handling arrangements that were agreed on 26 March for England and Wales, we recognise that there are differences in Scottish law and we discussed with the Solicitors how 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 1999 : Column: 821</I><P>
those differences might best be dealt with in any Scottish handling arrangements. We hope to finalise the arrangements for handling Scottish claims shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which members of his Department had discussions with GJW, and on how many occasions and what dates concerning the wish by Cape plc to amend the Access to Justice Bill [Lords] to ban foreign workers of British companies obtaining legal aid; and whether the statement by officials that they would not be keen to see any developments which discouraged multinationals from locating their headquarters in the United Kingdom was made with the knowledge of Ministers.  [78747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 One of my officials recalls receiving a telephone call in early March from a Mr. Weeks, who did not identify himself as being from GJW, about inward investment. During this conversation the point was made that HMG supports inward investment into the UK. Cape plc were not mentioned during the conversation and it was not reported to Ministers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what criteria he uses in relation to a multinational's conduct and working practices abroad to assess the desirability of the company locating its headquarters in the United Kingdom.  [78743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Multinationals who choose to locate their headquarters in the UK do so because the UK provides the right business environment in which they can flourish. Key features of top performing companies are the effectiveness and quality of their management and the commitment which that inspires in their workforce. Whilst the Government seek, through international bodies such as the UN, to improve working practices abroad they do not seek to vet the practices of individual companies that wish to establish headquarters in the UK. The Government are committed to creating a corporate culture in the UK where fairness is second nature. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998, the Working Time Regulations and the Employment Relations Bill will ensure that workers have minimum standards of protection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are unable to make meaningful estimates for such a small area. Nationally, we estimate that about 21 million people are eligible for free National Health Service sight tests and, from 1 April 1999, some 6 to 7 million more people aged 60 and over will become eligible. The number of people aged 60 or over in 1997 in the North and Yorkshire Regional area was 1,321,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w41.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Based on the Department's August 1997 Earnings Survey, uprated to take account of pay settlements up to and including 1 April 1999, the estimate of average gross earnings for all nursing and midwifery staff in 1999-2000 is &#163;361 per week (equivalent to &#163;18,800 per annum) and for qualified nurses alone &#163;400 per week (equivalent to &#163;20,800 per annum). It is not possible to express this estimate in April 1998 prices until inflation data are available for the 1999-2000 period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the five most frequent sources of reported allergies deriving from <i>(a)</i> food, <i>(b)</i> over the counter medicines and <i>(c)</i> prescription only medicines and the number of recorded cases in each category during the last 12 months for which figures are available.  [78996]<P>

<P>
<a name="90331w42.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 It is not possible to list the five most frequent sources of reported allergies deriving from food because information on the number of cases is not available. However, foods which can induce allergic reactions in some individuals include peanuts and nuts, wheat, eggs, fish, shellfish, milk and seeds.

<P>

<a name="90331w42.htm_para1">The five drug substances for which suspected allergic reactions to medicines have been reported most frequently through the Yellow Card Scheme since 1964 are: amoxycillin, diclofenac, trimethoprim, bacillus clostridium tetani and measles virus vaccine. These drug substances were included in both single constituent and multi-constituent products and are only available on prescription.
<P>

<a name="90331w42.htm_para2">For drug substances which may be supplied over the counter, the five most common drug substances for which these suspected reactions have been reported through the Yellow Card Scheme since 1964 are: ibuprofen, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, riboflavine and nicotinamide. These drug substances were included in both single constituent and multi-constituent products.
<P>

<a name="90331w42.htm_para3">This information should not be used to compare the drugs. It is not possible to determine the incidence of a particular adverse drug reaction from spontaneous reporting data because neither the total number of reactions occurring, nor the number of patients exposed to the drug in known. The number of suspected adverse drug reactions reported for a particular drug substance depends on various factors, including the extent of use of the drug and the reporting rate for the drug.

<P>
<a name="90331w43.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department has not issued any guidelines to health authorities regarding schoolchildren's dietary needs. However, the Department offers general advice on healthy eating which applies to everyone over the age of 5 years. This is contained in "The Balance of Good Health" which shows the different types and proportion of five categories of foods, including fruits and vegetables, which make up a well-balanced and healthy diet. "Eight Guidelines for a Healthy Diet" extends this advice to cover the important dietary changes needed to eat healthily.

 I can confirm that from 1 April responsibility for National Insurance contributions (NICs) operations and policy will pass from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security to the Board of the Inland Revenue and the Chancellor of the Exchequer respectively. A new Executive Office of the Inland Revenue to be called the National Insurance Contributions Office (NICO) will be formed from those Contributions Agency (CA) units based in Newcastle, amounting to about 4,500 staff in all. Some 3,500 CA staff working in field offices in locations around Great Britain will be integrated into Inland Revenue regions.

<a name="90331w43.htm_para1">This change is important in two ways. It marks a step towards more modern and effective Government and also towards improved service to the public. Our aims for this transfer are to reduce burdens on business; give better customer service; strengthen compliance; and over time promote greater alignment of the rules for income tax and National Insurance.

<a name="90331w43.htm_para2">For instance from 6 April, through the New Enterprise Support Initiative based in the Inland Revenue, new employers will have access to a telephone helpline which will provide help and guidance on both NICs and tax.

<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para3">As a result of the transfer of responsibility for NICs policy to Treasury Ministers correspondence and parliamentary questions on NICs policy issues should in future be addressed to them. Parliamentary questions on NICs operational issues will also be for reply by Treasury Ministers. The Board of Inland Revenue will be responsible for NICs operations and, where appropriate, replies to correspondence on operational issues will be provided by Inland Revenue officials.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para4">The Inland Revenue and Treasury Ministers will respond to correspondence and parliamentary questions on NICs in just the same way as they deal with their other responsibilities.

<a name="90331w43.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 On 10 December we published the consultation paper "Supporting People: A new policy and funding framework for support services". This proposed replacing the current complicated funding arrangements with one single budget targeted specifically at support services for vulnerable people, which would be administered by Local Authorities. The new arrangements will encourage coherent planning at a local level to deliver more cost effective and high quality services to many thousands of vulnerable people.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para7">Consultation ended on 5 February, and we received a substantial number of responses which have helped inform our decisions on the way forward.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para8">We are pleased to announce that the consultation shows that there is strong support for the principles underlying the Supporting People proposals, and the fact that, for the first time, the provision of support services for vulnerable people is being given the priority it deserves. We have therefore decided to proceed with implementing the long-term proposals from April 2003.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para9">Some respondents had concerns about whether the new arrangements were suitable for sheltered housing. We have looked carefully at these concerns and concluded that including sheltered housing in the new single budget will enable greater flexibility in service models, and bring the benefits of a joint commissioning approach.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para10">In taking work forward, we will work closely with interested parties to develop the detail of the new arrangements to ensure that the long-term objectives become a workable and effective reality.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para11">The new single budget will be preceded by a time-limited transitional Housing Benefit scheme. Although there was a convincing welcome for the proposed transitional Housing Benefit scheme, there were a number of concerns expressed about the date of its introduction. In direct response to these concerns, we have decided to extend the current interim scheme thereby delaying the introduction of the new transitional scheme until April 2000. Aligning the start date of the transitional scheme with the beginning of the financial year will help local authorities in their financial planning.
<P>

<a name="90331w43.htm_para12">I am placing a list of the organisations and academic bodies who responded, excluding those who requested confidentiality, in the Library. Copies of the list and specific responses are available on request from the Department of Social Security, by contacting The Inter- Departmental Review of Funding for Supported Accommodation, 5th Floor, The Adelphi, 1-11 John Adam St, London WC2N 6HT.

<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
1. These figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland.
<BR>
2. The financial year 1995-96 was the basis for the figures quoted in paragraph 5 of the consultation paper on bereavement support. The financial year 1996-97 is the latest for which data are available. Sample sizes for the requested cross-section of the population are small and therefore liable to a large degree of year on year variation due to sampling error. The estimate for both years is subject to this error.
<BR>
3. The figures quoted refer to the gross amount of occupational pension payments where they are received by widows who are both under the age of 60 and in receipt of widow's benefit. All monetary values are given in April 1998 prices.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Means-tested benefit offsets are not available as the Family Resources Survey which is used to calculate these cannot differentiate between married women who receive a Category A pension on their own insurance (and would require a 12.4 per cent. increase) and those who receive a Category B pension based on the their husbands' contributions (these would require a 4.1 per cent. increase). Offset calculations cannot therefore be made where, as here, different percentage changes are made to different categories of Retirement Pension.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> It is proposed that Bereavement Allowance will be paid for six months only to widows and widowers aged 45 or over on bereavement who have no dependent children.

<a name="90331w44.htm_para2">It would be very difficult to establish who were "partners". As a result, there is limited information available on the circumstances of cohabiting partners and we are able to provide only broad estimates of the gross costs of extending it to unmarried cohabiting partners.

 All responses to the consultation were read and the results were fed into a qualitative analysis of respondents' views, which provided the basis for my previous answer to my hon. Friend. A record was kept of the policy areas on which each respondent commented but this did not include a record of the detailed points made in each case. To provide a list of individuals and organisations that made the particular points identified would involve re-examining every response and would incur disproportionate cost.

<a name="90331w46.htm_para1">Claimants for Jobseeker's Allowance are required to be capable of, and available for, work. However, jobseekers may restrict their availability in any way if the restrictions are reasonable in the light of their physical or mental condition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w46.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 When a claim for Incapacity Benefit is made, entitlement for someone with a recent work record depends on the person satisfying the Own Occupation Test for the first 28 weeks of incapacity. In most cases, this is satisfied by the provision of a GP's medical certificate. After 28 weeks of incapacity, or from the start of the claim if the person has no recent work record, the All Work Test applies (though in both cases benefit continues in payment on the basis of a medical certificate pending a decision under the test).
<P>

<a name="90331w46.htm_para2">If a person is found capable of work under either the Own Occupation Test or the All Work Test, Incapacity Benefit is disallowed. The person may however be entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance.

<a name="90331w46.htm_para3">During the period 1 March 1998 to 28 February 1999 there were 112,858 disallowances of Incapacity Benefit for the reasons set out.

 From April 2000, we plan to implement new legislation to make it a condition of receiving benefit that people take part in interviews to talk about their prospects of finding work. This requirement will initially affect only the 12 Single Work-Focused Gateway pilot areas and will be introduced in ways that take account of individual circumstances. The evaluation of the pilots will enable us to consider whether to extend this approach more widely.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the operation of the Adapt 98 Scheme in the Yorkshire area; what is the reason for the delay in the introduction of CAPS; and by how much the private sector estimate of cost has exceeded the set target.  [79179]<P>

<P>
<a name="90331w46.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The ADAPT Partnership period ended on 12 November 1998. We are currently considering the way forward for this project.
<P>

<a name="90331w46.htm_para5">The Customer Accounting Payment Strategy (CAPS) project is a Benefits Agency initiative that is developing the systems that will change the way the Agency records customer's details and accounts for benefit expenditure. It also supports payment of benefit by way of the payment card that is being introduced as part of a PFI project to automate Post Offices and benefit payments. The CAPS project has met all its contractual obligations and is proceeding to plan.
<P>

<a name="90331w46.htm_para6">Information about the cost to the private sector of the payment card and Post Office Automation Project is confidential to the PFI supplier, ICL Pathway.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what representations he has received on the eight day maximum application period for extended payments under the Housing Benefit Regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [79692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w46.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have received a number of letters from members of the public about the eight day application period. We are currently considering ways of easing the transition into work. We know that worries about housing costs are crucial to people when thinking about moving into work. The Extended Payments scheme, which eases the transition from benefit dependency to working, is one of a number of areas which we are looking at with the aim of improving incentives provided by the Housing Benefit Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the mileage rates applicable from January 1999 to staff, indicating changes which have been made to encourage staff to switch from cars to public transport and other less polluting forms of travel.  [79522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90331w47.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 For some years the Department has operated a single mileage rate based on the average of the bands set by the Inland Revenue Authorised Mileage Rates. This acts as a disincentive for the use of larger engine capacity cars (over 1500 cc).
<P>

<a name="90331w47.htm_para0">The rates are payable irrespective of the type of fuel used thus benefiting staff driving alternative fuelled vehicles.
<P>

<a name="90331w47.htm_para1">We are currently revising the pedal cycle rate to encourage the use of bicycles.
<P>

<a name="90331w47.htm_para2">The tables give details of the current rates.
