<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he expects work to commence on the installation of car-parking facilities adjacent to Derryboy Primary Schoool in the South Eastern Education and Library area.  [106126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_spnew9"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The South Eastern Education and Library Board are responsible for capital development at Derryboy Primary School. The Board has advised that additional land is required to enable the provision of car parking facilities at the school. The Board has identified a site and is awaiting a valuation from the Valuation and Lands Agency. When the valuation is available, the Board will be able to seek the approval of the Department of Education for the purchase of the site and to consider the project for inclusion in its minor works programme.

<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many procedures were postponed at hospitals in Northern Ireland in the last 12 months; and how many of these postponements resulted from emergency pressures.  [106617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Information is not readily available in the form requested and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what criteria are used to assess the level of activity at hospitals in Northern Ireland.  [106618]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Activity levels are assessed in terms of the number of beds and their usage, the number of sessions held and the number of attendances. Detailed definitions of all of the specific measures can be found in the DHSSPS annual Hospital Statistics publication which is available in the Library and from our website http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/stats&research/order.html.

<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2003 : Column 250W</I><P>
assessment has been made of the impact on other Hyster plants in the UK as a result of grants given to support the expansion of manufacturing at its Craigavon plant.  [108117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 My officials at Invest NI are in the process of finalising an agreement with NACCO Materials Handling Group, which manufactures a full range of forklift trucks under the Hyster and Yale brands. As that agreement has not yet been signed or approved by the Board of NACCO, I cannot provide you with specific financial information. I can, however, state that this project is not an expansion of current activities, but is aimed at securing and safeguarding current employment levels at Craigavon and an integral part of the appraisal process is to ensure that any proposed assistance does not disadvantage any other area of the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on neurosurgery services in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to the availability of elective surgery.  [107478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Neurosurgery services in Northern Ireland are managed on a regional basis by the Royal Group of Hospitals Trust. Currently, the service is under significant pressure and limited elective neurosurgery is being carried out, the majority of cases being emergency and clinically urgent cases.
<P>

<a name="30409w02.html_para0">The pressures on the Regional Neurosurgery service have arisen mainly as a result of shortages in experienced nursing staff, which is not a phenomenon particular to Northern Ireland; there are similar problems with this service throughout the NHS. Considerable efforts are being made by the Royal Group of Hospitals to address the current problems. These include the provision of additional theatre lists, the recruitment of nurses to allow additional neurosurgical beds to be opened, and treatment provided outside Northern Ireland for a small number of suitable patients.Work is also ongoing at the Royal Group of Hospitals in conjunction with the Health and Social Services Boards to consider proposals to further improve the service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland which schools in the South Eastern Education and Library Board area will lose funding as a result of the Department of Education's decision on the changes to payment of the threshold award; and what the shortfall will be for each of the schools affected.  [106125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w02.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 As the increase in schools' delegated budgets in 2003&#150;04 is greater than in 2002&#150;03, the South Eastern Education and Library Board provided the schools it funds with threshold figures for planning purposes only. The Board compared the actual costs of the threshold salary uplift in 2002&#150;03 with the nominal position had the threshold budget been included in the Aggregated Schools Budget that year. However, as the Board has increased its Aggregated Schools Budget by 9 per cent. in 2003&#150;04, it is more appropriate for schools to consider their entire salary expenditure against their total budget before a budget shortfall can be inferred. It is also the case that the Board is proposing to its Finance and Property Services Committee to make &#163;165,700 available to assist those schools with particular levels of threshold salary costs. In these circumstances, the final position will not be known until schools have completed their expenditure plans against their whole budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many awards from the <i>(a)</i> Talented Athlete, <i>(b)</i> Talented Athlete Next Generation and <i>(c)</i> Talented Junior programmes have been made to cyclists who are members of the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation.  [106364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 One award has been made to a cyclist, who is a member of the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation, under the Talented Junior Programme in 2002&#150;03. To date no awards from the Talented Athlete or Talented Athlete Next Generation programmes have been made directly to cyclists who are members of the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation.

<a name="30409w02.html_para2">All athletes and riders currently in receipt of Lottery Funding will, if selected, represent Ireland at the 2004 Olympic Games. However, as yet, selection for competition at the 2004 Olympic Games has not taken place, and it would therefore be premature to state that any of the individuals in receipt of awards will be competing. Furthermore any funding awarded is to assist towards preparation and training for major competition in general rather than specific competition such as the 2004 Olympic Games.

 Since year 2000, allocations under the Local Transport Plan procedures (and prior to that their predecessor Transport Policies and Programme) have been made by my Department to local transport authorities, in this case Essex county Council. LTPs identify individual schemes costing over &#163;5 million as 'major schemes'; make a block allocations for integrated transport measures each costing less than &#163;5 million; and make an allocation for maintenance based on a common formula. Figures are kept only for the Tendring district council area as a whole and so it is possible to identify expenditure falling solely within the Harwich constituency only for major schemes, by reference to their location.

 I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to the right hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="30409w04.html_para0"><i>Letter from David York to Mr. Greg Knight, dated 9 April 2003:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Tim Matthews has been asked by the Transport Minister, John Spellar, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about roadworks on the Ml Motorway between Junctions 23 and 25. I am replying as Tim is currently away on Highways Agency business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are two schemes currently being undertaken on the M1 north of Junction 23. which are expected to continue until Spring 2004. The first, involving major maintenance work to resurface the carriageways with low noise material and renew drainage installations between Junctions 24 and 25, began in January. That work is expected to be complete by June. (Phase 1, about which I wrote to you in March last year following a previous Parliamentary Question, was completed in early summer 2002.) The second involves upgrading the motorway communications in this area and extends from Junction 24 to Junction 27.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wherever practicable, the Agency seeks to combine roadworks, as is being done here, in order to minimise disruption to road users. For the resurfacing/drainage work a contraflow system is in operation with three lanes of traffic running in each direction between 6 am and 8 pm (10 pm Friday and 9 pm Sunday) and a 50 mph speed restriction applies for safety reasons. When lane closures are required, work is normally scheduled either overnight or outside peak periods, in accordance with the target set for us by ministers to ensure that at least 98.5% of running lanes are available for use during peak hours. The majority of the communications upgrading work is being carried out at night with closure of lane one and the hard shoulder.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should add that further minor works art planned at Junctions 23A and 24 but, due to the nature of the work and the potential disruption that would be caused to the surrounding road network, these will not go ahead until the current -major works are completed. They are programmed for completion during this financial year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a particularly heavily used length of motorway. The Agency is doing all it can to keep disruption to a minimum but I am afraid there will inevitably be some delays at peak times.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will estimate <i>(a)</i> the number of people who would benefit from a rise in the national minimum wage to &#163;6 per hour, <i>(b)</i> how much Government expenditure would be saved by the consequential reduction of means tested benefits and <i>(c)</i> what the economic consequences would be of such a rise, with a statement of how she arrived at her estimate; and if she will make a statement.  [105105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w05.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> DTI estimates that around six million people would be directly affected by an increase in the National Minimum Wage (NMW) to &#163;6. The balance between workers who would benefit and those who would not benefit would depend on the extent of employment reductions following such a large increase.
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> The impact of an increase in the NMW was estimated by the Government and provided in the Low Pay Commission's fourth report (table 6.5, p195). The effect of a 30 pence increase in the adult rate of the NMW in 2003&#150;04 is estimated to provide net savings to the Exchequer of &#163;260 million for a full year. The effect on the Exchequer of a &#163;6 per hour NMW rate for adults cannot be estimated in this way because the assumption of no behavioural change in response to the change in the NMW rates which underlies the estimate would not be plausible.
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para5"><i>(c)</i> A 6 NMW would see over one-fifth of the UK workforce receiving wage increases of up to 43 per cent., without any offsetting gains in output. That is likely to sap company profitability, add significantly to price pressures and prompt employers to cut employment levels.
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para6">The Government are determined to help the low paid, but not at the cost of damaging the economy or creating increased unemployment for the very people we want to help. Following advice from the Low Pay Commission, we recently announced substantial increases to the minimum wage to take place in October 2003 which will help between 1.3 and 1.6 million low-paid workers, more than ever before.

<P>

 Around 60,000 adults were eligible for the older workers' Development Rate in both 2001 and 2002, according to data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). There are no LFS figures for 2003 available yet.
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para7">Use of the older workers' Development Rate remains small. According to a survey of employers in low-paying sectors by the Low Pay Commission, 4 per cent. of 



<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2003 : Column 263W</I><P>
employers said they used it. This is likely to be an over-estimate of the use of the Development Rate among employers in the economy as a whole. However, the Commission recommended in their recent report that, on balance, they thought the older workers' Development Rate should remain in place for the time being.
<P>

<a name="30409w05.html_para8">Guidelines on the operation of the minimum wage are contained in the booklet, "A Detailed Guide to the National Minimum Wage", which is available from the Inland Revenue's National Minimum Wage helpline 0845&#150;6000&#150;678, and is also available on the Department of Trade and Industry's website at: www.dti.gov.uk/er/nmw.

Chiefly, this concerns inquiries into the tax returns of individuals, businesses and companies, and reviews of employer compliance.

 Over-30-month scheme (OTMS) meat and bone meal storage facilities are subject to regular control visits, which are carried out by the Rural Payments Agency. The Agency undertakes quarterly Technical Inspectorate visits to such stores to check the integrity of the store, and that the scheme controls and paperwork are being correctly administered. In addition the Agency's OTMS operations team also carry out periodic site inspections on an ad hoc basis. This is the team responsible for the ongoing storage and disposal arrangements relating to OTMS meat and bone meal.

 Meat and bone meal is stored in heaps and it is not possible to be precise about the age of that which remains in store. However it is likely that some of this material produced in the earliest weeks of the scheme (May 1996) remains in store pending incineration. To date the Rural Payments Agency has incinerated (for the most part with energy recovery) some 593,465 tonnes out of 736,797 tonnes of the material produced under the over-30-month scheme since its commencement in May 1996, this equates to 79 per cent. of the material produced. All of the storage sites are currently outloading the material to incineration plants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will estimate the impact of extending the Government's children's centres to cover 30 per cent. of the most disadvantaged wards in England by 2006.  [105311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w12.html_spnew11"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Government's long-term aim is that all young children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards have access to children's centre services. These centres will promote the physical, intellectual and social development of young children; they will also help to reduce child poverty by enabling parents, including lone parents, to maximise their chances to work, and to build stronger, safer communities. By March 2006 we plan to reach at least 650,000 pre-school children&#151;and to create nearly 43,000 extra child care places for them. We recognise that pockets of extreme disadvantage exist outside of these wards, and the Sure Start Unit will consider proposals from local authorities to locate children's centres in such areas.
<P>

<a name="30409w12.html_para4">In the long-term, providing access to children's centre services will reach approximately one million children under five in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards. Extending this provision to cover the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged wards would reach approximately 340,000 additional children. We recognise that all young children would benefit from children's centre services, and the Sure Start Unit is promoting the wider adoption of this integrated approach. However the &#163;435 million available to meet our targets by 2006 is focused on areas where need is greatest.

<P>
<a name="30409w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify precisely how much additional funding has been given to Harwich schools since 1997. The following table shows how much recurrent and capital funding was allocated to Essex primary and secondary schools between 1998&#150;99 and 2002&#150;03, the years for which data are available on a like-for-like basis. The Department allocates capital funding for schools at local education authority level (LEA) level, without specifying separate amounts for primary and secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="30409w13.html_para0">This is equivalent in 2002&#150;03 to an average of &#163;82,377 revenue for a primary school and &#163;306,329 revenue for a secondary school, but funding for individual schools depends on decisions taken by the local education authority.

 The Department organises a large number of events for different target audiences and purposes each year, ranging from small scale workshops to introduce practitioners to new procedures or initiatives, to larger scale events to promote policy initiatives or present the bigger picture of the Department's activities to external partners and opinion formers.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not keep a central record of expenditure on educational materials. We support a variety of programmes and initiatives to enhance education about health and healthy living. For example, with the Department of Health we have jointly funded the National Healthy Schools programme, providing &#163;27 million since it began in 1999. We have also produced a number of good practice booklets for teachers to help them ensure the health of pupils; for example, on healthy school lunches, first aid and health and safety. The Department has not produced education materials specifically about diabetes.

 There is good evidence that Investors in People supports school improvement. An NFER study in June 2000 found a clear positive link

between achievement of the standard and Ofsted's assessment of teaching quality. For this reason, Investors enjoys the support of key national partners, including Ofsted. The great majority of schools which have achieved the standard say that it has directly contributed to raising pupil achievement, through a more focused approach to training and development. This view seems to be shared by schools of all shapes and sizes.

[107200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My Department has not given any specific guidance to schools about military action in Iraq because advice is already available to them through a range of relevant material from the Department, the Service Children's Education Agency (SCE), and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Advice on dealing with racist incidents can be found in the updated pack "Bullying&#151;don't suffer in silence" (first issued in December 2001) and at www.qca.org.uk/ca/inclusion/respect for all/. Citizenship coverage of issues surrounding war can be found at www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/schemes2/citizenship/cit117. The SCE provides advice to forces personnel on education issues and has recently issued a deployment pack to local education authorities in areas, including Shropshire, where there are likely to be numbers of children from service families.

We propose to allocate PFI credits from 2005&#150;06 as part of this wider, strategic targeting of groups of schools. I also announced on 31 March, as part of the allocation of PFI credits for 2004&#150;05, four Building Schools for the Future pathfinder projects in Bradford, Bristol, Greenwich and Sheffield&#151;worth &#163;290 million in total.

 The military campaign is crafted around the principle of minimum use of force. We attack only military objectives and combatants subject to the constraints of proportionality.

That approach folly reflects our obligations under international law.

 One of the key military tasks in the Government's Military Campaign Objectives was that of securing Iraq's economic infrastructure to prevent its wilful destruction by the Iraqi regime. The success of Coalition forces in securing the southern Iraqi oil infrastructure intact has prevented Saddam Hussein from repeating the acts of environmental vandalism on the scale we saw during 1991. Explosive Ordnance Disposal units and specialist teams of Royal Engineers from the United Kingdom armed forces have made safe facilities in the Rumaylah oil fields, enabling the relatively small number of fires, started before Coalition forces took control, to be extinguished.

 Territorial Army (TA) personnel mobilised for operations in the Gulf are entitled to the same welfare allowances as Regular soldiers. Within the overall Operational Welfare Package there is a specific communications package to allow the soldiers in theatre to communicate with families and dependants at home. This is achieved through the use of welfare telephones and British Forces Post Office (BFPO) mail. Welfare telephones have been provided in theatre and each soldier is entitled, subject to operational constraints, to a 20 minute per week publicly funded allowance. Free BFPO letters, known as "Blueys" are available to all soldiers in theatre, with current delivery times ranging from between three to six days. Electronic versions,

Analysis suggests that fitment to seven Type 23s will provide the most cost-effective way to introduce the UK CEC capability at the earliest opportunity. This will provide a sufficient force to develop the usage and tactics of the system and also to provide a robust network to interact with CEC in the Type 45 Destroyer.

 The Government are disappointed that the 31 March deadline to establish modalities for a new Agreement on Agriculture was not achieved. Agricultural trade reform is critical for developing countries and central to the wider Doha Development Agenda. WTO members must now redouble their efforts to reach consensus by the fifth meeting of the WTO Ministerial Conference in September this year and the UK will continue to play an active part in seeking to bring this about. Regarding the 31 March deadline for WTO members to make initial market access offers under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), we welcome the tabling so far of offers by 13 WTO members, including some developing countries, and encourage other members to follow suit. As to the EU's initial offer, the Government have been working hard within the EU to agree an offer that will be meaningful for both developed and developing countries. Although the offer has not yet been finalised, it is well advanced and we expect it to be presented to the WTO very shortly.

 The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU Institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether the cost <i>(a)</i> of humanitarian aid distributed from (i) HMS Sir Galahad and (ii) other sources associated with the UK and <i>(b)</i> assumed to have been incurred by the use of UK troops in distributing the aid will be charged to the UN Oil for Food Programme; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w16.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Humanitarian supplies being provided and distributed by UK forces will not be paid for by the Oil for Food Programme (OFF). The Ministry of Defence has been allocated &#163;30 million by HM Treasury to help it carry out its humanitarian obligations under the Geneva Convention and The Hague Regulations.
<P>

<a name="30409w16.html_para0">The UK does not otherwise provide significant bilateral humanitarian assistance; our assistance is channelled mainly through UN and international aid agencies.

 It is estimated that the changes to employers' national insurance contributions announced in the Budget will increase pay costs on average by 0.7 per cent. next year.

<P>
<a name="30409w16.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The World Food Programme's $507 million appeal in July 2002 is now 76 per cent. funded. Both the Prime Minister and I have written to other donors to urge further contributions. The international communities response to the crisis has funded enough food and other supplies to avoid a major catastrophe. DFID officials meet regularly with WFP and other donors, including USAID and the EU, to monitor the food security position in southern Africa. The UK has contributed more that &#163;106 million in humanitarian assistance to Southern Africa since September 2001. The UK share of EU assistance was over &#163;21 million.

<P><I>9 Apr 2003 : Column 304W</I><P>
for variable but generally improved crops. If these forecasts are accurate, then there should be a significant reduction in the scale of the crisis in the region. There will be little need for food aid in Malawi and Zambia, but continuing pockets of need in Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland.
<P>

<a name="30409w16.html_para1">However, there continues to be a major crisis in Zimbabwe. There is likely to be a 1 million tonne shortfall in maize production, and although the number needing food aid in the coming months may drop from the present level of 7 million, this figure is almost certain to climb again by the end of the year.

 The Department for International Development currently operates three principal websites: the departmental site (www.dfid.gov.uk), a site providing access to development education resources (www.globaldimension.org.uk) and a site relating to DFID's quarterly magazine, 'Developments' (www.developments.org.uk). For the launch of the 2000 White Paper on International Development, DFID supported the creation of an additional site (www.globalisation.gov.uk). All sites are active, although the 2000 White Paper site is treated as dormant for the purposes of uploading new information. It would not be possible to list all start-up and annual running costs since inception without disproportionate effort. However, operating and associated costs for each of the websites for the last three financial years are as follows:

 Politically motivated violence in Zimbabwe has increased, predominately against opposition supporters. The MDC organised a successful stayaway on 18 and 19 March. Following the stayaway there were over 500 arrests and over 250 people required hospital treatment. We joined our EU partners in condemning the violence and called on the Government to ensure that by-elections in two Harare constituencies on 29 and 30 March were free and fair. Despite violence and intimidation ahead of these elections, the MDC retained both seats.

<a name="30409w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Sperm donation is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA code of practice expects clinics recruiting donors to take all reasonable steps to prevent the transmission of serious genetic disorders by taking a thorough medical history from the prospective donor. Where the medical history of a prospective donor indicates there may be a risk of the transmission of alpha-antitrpsin (AAT) deficiency, screening for the disorder will usually be carried out.

<a name="30409w19.html_para0">Guidelines on appropriate genetic tests for sperm donors have been produced by the British Andrology Society and incorporated into the HFEA code of practice.

The MRC has supported a number of research projects looking into the genetics and function of alpha-lantitrypsin (AAT) in the past few years and is currently providing a programme grant to examine new therapies for AAT deficiency and associated diseases. This is "Strategies to prevent cirrhosis and dementia by blocking serpin polymerisation in vivo", by Professor David Lomas at the University of Cambridge.

<a name="30409w19.html_para3">The report on the quantification of the effects of air pollution on health in the United Kingdom, published in 1998, concluded that the levels of air pollution in 1996 contributed to the earlier deaths of up to 24,000 people. Air pollution is thought to worsen the condition of those that are already ill with heart and lung disease and to bring forward the dates of their deaths. The average loss of life expectancy is unknown but is thought to be days, weeks or months rather than years. The report also concluded that air pollution could contribute to a similar number of respiratory hospital admissions. Levels of air pollution have declined since 1996.

<a name="30409w19.html_para4">In its report published in 2001, the committee concluded that it was more likely than not that a causal association exists between long-term exposure to particulate air pollution and mortality although the Committee also emphasised the uncertainties.

<sup>(33)</sup> These figures are likely to underestimate the true mortality related to hepatitis C for several reasons:<P>

<P>

the certifying doctor may not always know about the existence of a hepatitis C infection, contracted many years earlier, that had given rise to another fatal liver disease.<P>





where several other factors (e.g. alcohol, other blood-borne viruses) contributed to fatal chronic liver disease, the certifying doctor may judge that one of the other factors is more important.<P>

deaths with an underlying cause of primary liver cancer are not included, even if certified as being the result of hepatitis C infection. This is because international coding rules in use at this time do not accept cancers being due to infections, except in the case of HIV/AIDS.<P>

<a name="30409w20.html_para3">Our inquiries show that the benefits of a national fitness assessment for 11-year-olds would be limited and such an assessment would be difficult to implement. Fitness testing in children and young people reflects genetic and maturational factors rather than providing a meaningful measure of individual fitness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent assessment he has made of the provision of NHS dentistry in Buckinghamshire.  [106194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w20.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 No recent assessment of the provision of national health service dentistry has been made by the Department. However, the provision of dental services in Buckinghamshire is routinely monitored by primary care trusts (PCTs).
<P>

<a name="30409w20.html_para12">In the forthcoming Health and Social Care Bill, the Government propose to legislate for far-reaching reform of NHS dental services. It is proposed that each PCT be given a duty to provide or secure the provision of primary dental services in its area to the extent that it considers reasonable to do so and be given the financial resources to do this. This will give PCTs the flexibility to address access issues in their area. Dentists who contract with a PCT will have a secure income in return for making a longer-term commitment to the NHS.

<i>[holding answer 20 March 2003]:</i> Poverty is a complex multi-dimensional concept, affecting many aspects of people's lives, including their inability to access an affordable healthy diet. Diet is assessed through a series of surveys: the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys, the Expenditure and Food Survey and the Health Survey for England. For example, the results of the 2001 Health Survey for England on the consumption of fruit and vegetables were analysed by the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC), equivalised household income and area deprivation; the results are published in "Health Survey for England 2001: Fruit and vegetable consumption".

 The Department does not keep a central record of specific expenditure on educational materials in schools.

Alongside the Department for Education and Skills, we jointly fund the national healthy schools programme, which has provided a total of &#163;27 million since it began in 1999. We have also supported a number of good practice booklets for schools and teachers to help them ensure the health and well being of their pupils. Together, these initiatives have an important role in the prevention of many conditions, including diabetes. The Department has not produced education materials exclusively about diabetes.

 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requires the storage of donor sperm and its use in the provision of fertility treatment services to be carried out under a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The Act does not cover sperm donor services that provide sperm only, and not treatment, except where the sperm is stored.
<P>

<a name="30409w22.html_para0">Where the HFEA becomes aware that an organisation in the United Kingdom is offering services that may be covered by the Act, a thorough investigation is made to establish the nature of the service. If licensable, the HFEA will require that activity to cease until such time as a licence may be granted.
<P>

<a name="30409w22.html_para1">Women wishing to have a child using donor sperm are strongly advised by the HFEA to seek treatment from a licensed clinic, where they can be sure that the services will be provided in a safe and ethical environment. Patients obtaining fresh donor sperm from the internet for personal use, which is not subject to a licence from the HFEA, cannot be sure that the sample has undergone the same rigorous health checks to prevent the risk of transmitting HIV or serious genetics disorders.

<i>[holding answer 1 April 2003]:</i> As of 1 April, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) is responsible for producing culture media for microbiology laboratories in the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and some parts of the national health service. The funding for this will come mainly from the purchase of media by the NHS and the HPA, plus some central funding from the Department. The NHS and the HPA have been asked by the Chief Executive of the NHS to continue utilising this media service at existing levels in order to protect the continuity of supply and ensure stability.
<P>

<a name="30409w23.html_para0">The staff of the four units where this function is carried out remain employees of the PHLS. The employment prospects of all the staff involved will be protected by the change management protocol, which applied to those staff transferring from the PHLS to the HPA or to NHS trusts. An early review of media services is planned which is expected to make recommendations for the longer term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w24.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 A total of 327 local authorities have taken up the Verification Framework (VF) so far. They include those who are fully compliant, those who have taken up one or two modules and those who are in the process of implementation. To date, 81 local authorities have not applied to take up VF.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para1">At present 74 per cent. of housing benefit expenditure is processed through VF. We aim to have 100 per cent. of housing benefit expenditure processed through VF by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para2">We are developing a more targeted method of identifying high-risk cases for VF interventions. This will replace the routine checking that is currently carried out on all claims as a matter of course when a claim reaches the end of its benefit period. We want local authorities' efforts to focus on more cost-effective activities and therefore we expect the VF to become more attractive.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para3">Management information returns indicate that local authorities who operate VF procedures identify 6 per cent. of new claims as being fraudulent or in error and
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para4">identify in 5 per cent. of renewal claims and at 5 per cent of VF visits an actual or potential overpayment. It is not possible to measure directly how much of this incorrectness would have been found had the local authorities hot been VF compliant.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para5">The Departmental funding for VF is in the form of a one-off payment for set-up costs and on-going funding for the running of the scheme. The set-up cost is intended for costs incurred in the implementation phase and would cover such areas as training, IT changes, staff recruitment, etc. Each local authority's capacity to implement the scheme would dictate how they would need to spend the set-up costs and it is left to their judgment. Purchase of document imaging systems would be one of their options. The funding is not ring-fenced but conditional upon the local authority delivering the specified outcomes.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para6">A total of &#163;223 million is available for the VF scheme for three years from April 2003. This represents a 50 per cent. increase on the 2002&#150;03 allocation for set-up costs and on-going funding. This is the biggest increase since the VF was introduced and will help to increase take-up even further.
<P>

<a name="30409w24.html_para7">The VF was designed specifically for use by local authorities. However, there are already procedures in place to check evidence for other DWP benefit claims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w25.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what measures she is taking to speed up the anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) application process; what proportion of ASBO cases in <i>(a)</i> 2001 and <i>(b)</i> 2002 required <i>(i)</i> one court hearing, (ii) two court hearings and (iii) three or more court hearings to reach a decision; and what steps she is taking to reduce the number of court hearings required in ASBO cases.  [105371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30409w25.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Changes to ASBOs, which help speed up the application process, were made under the Police Reform Act 2002. These were accompanied by guidance to all practitioners and the courts. This advises specifically that adjournments should be avoided unless 



<P>
<P><I>9 Apr 2003 : Column 337W</I><P>
absolutely necessary; and that in order to minimise delays, courts should be forewarned of applications. Courts are being encouraged to consider rigorously requests for adjournments (whilst always acting in the interests of justice), and to use pre-trial reviews in appropriate cases. Figures were only collected for the first time in 2001 and the figures for 2001 are incomplete. In 2001, for 32 per cent. of ASBO cases it was not known how many hearings they took. 10.5 per cent of ASBO cases were recorded as requiring one court hearing; 15.0 per cent. two court hearings; and 42.5 per cent three or more court hearings in order to determine the application. Up to 30 September 2002, the corresponding figures are 2.25 per cent. not known, 16.25 per cent. for one hearing, 22.50 per cent. for two hearings; and 59.0 per cent. for three or more court hearings.
<P>

<a name="30409w25.html_para2">As set out in the recent White Paper on anti-social behaviour&#151;"Respect and Responsibility" we are taking steps in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill to improve further the operation of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders which remain a valuable tool in tackling anti-social behaviour. For instance. Housing Actions Trusts will be able to apply for ASBOs to protect persons who reside in or are in the vicinity of their premises, instead of having to rely on other authorities to seek ASBOs on their behalf. It will also be possible for relevant persons to be joined to proceedings in the County Court with a view to obtaining an ASBO against them where their anti-social behaviour is material to these proceedings. This would enable courts to make more effective use of time by removing the need for a separate hearing for an ASBO.
