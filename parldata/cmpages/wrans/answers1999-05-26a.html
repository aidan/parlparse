<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress being made by the Armed Forces to implement the partnership agreement between his Department and the Commission for Racial Equality.  [85666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Chief of Defence Staff signed a five year Partnership Agreement with the CRE in March 1998. It provides an unambiguous foundation for Service racial equality policies, committing the Armed Forces to reflecting more closely the rich ethnic balance of our society, and developing a culture which positively welcomes diversity. It also calls for clear lines of accountability in tackling discrimination and racist behaviour and in ensuring that all personnel embrace a personal responsibility to implement the spirit of the Agreement.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para0">The Armed Forces have made considerable efforts to implement the Agreement's principles and I am pleased to report excellent progress over its first year of operation.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para1">All the Services continue to attach the highest priority to recruiting and retaining more ethnic minority personnel. Recruitment advertising campaigns targeting ethnic minorities have proved attractive, with career applications doubling over the last two years. All three Services now have specialist recruiting teams dedicated to increasing awareness of Service careers amongst ethnic communities, and a new long-term "Community 



<P>
<P><I>26 May 1999 : Column: 144</I><P>
Partnerships" campaign has been launched to build bridges between the Services and black, Asian and other non-white communities across the nation. The proportion of intake to the Services in 1998-99 which was from ethnic minorities was 1.8 per cent., about a 40 per cent. increase on 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para2">Significant emphasis has also been attached to equal opportunities and cultural awareness training. The Tri-Service Equal Opportunities Training Centre at Shrivenham was launched in September 1998 and has already trained over 1,000 Service Equal Opportunity Advisers to provide specialist advice and training to their units. Similar training is now mandatory for senior military officers, and over 300 have already passed TSEOTC courses.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para3">The Services are continuing to develop a culture which not only holds zero tolerance to any form of racist behaviour, but which also positively welcomes racial diversity. Individual Service efforts in the field of equal opportunities are now co-ordinated through the Corporate Framework announced in March 1999, which encourages a sharing of best practice across the Armed Forces. Service recruitment, promotion and management procedures are objectively reviewed to ensure that they do not unwittingly discriminate against ethnic minority personnel.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para4">All personnel are regularly reminded of their own personal responsibility not just in combating racism, but in ensuring a harassment-free serving environment. The Chief of Defence Staff has formally declared "war on racism", and the Service Chiefs have reminded their Commanders, as recently as March this year, that any form of racist behaviour is incompatible with military service. Any incidents or accusations of racism or harassment are taken very seriously and will be promptly and thoroughly investigated--guilty parties face the severest penalties up to and including dismissal.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para5">Progress is regularly reviewed, with representatives from all three Services meeting with the CRE Commissioners on a regular basis. I also met with Sir Herman Ouseley, the CRE Chairman earlier this year, and will be doing so again in the future. The Chief of Defence Staff, who has overall responsibility for implementation of the Partnership Agreement, will be reviewing our progress with the CRE shortly.
<P>

<a name="90526w01.htm_para6">In the year ahead, the Services will consolidate their successes to date and continue to drive forward equal opportunity initiatives. Complacency is not an option; this is a long-term process and the Armed Forces remain committed to implementing the spirit and letter of the Partnership Agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The recently published Education and Training Action Group report proposes the establishment of an all-Wales all-age careers information, advice and guidance service by April 2001. Under this proposal, the existing Careers Service companies would be branded together as 'Careers Wales' and would take on responsibility for providing careers information and guidance to adults as well as to young people. The ETAG report also suggests that there may be advantage in reducing the number of Careers Service companies and re-aligning their boundaries to match those of the four economic regions of Wales. These proposals will be for the National Assembly of Wales to consider.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The draft Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance Convention in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union requires the requesting Member State to obtain authority for interception under its domestic law before making a request. The requested Member State is also required to obtain a warrant in accordance with national law where the 



<P>
<P><I>26 May 1999 : Column: 149</I><P>
subject of the request is on its territory. Any interception on the United Kingdom public telecommunications network will, therefore, continue to require a warrant issued by the Secretary of State in accordance with the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The cost of transmitting the intercept product in response to such a request falls to the requesting Member State.
<P>

<a name="90526w02.htm_para6">The draft Convention also provides a legal basis for the "service provider" solution to satellite interception. It places an obligation on Member States not to prevent satellite telecommunication operators from making their facilities available for the purpose of complying with an interception warrant issued by another Member State, provided that the subject of the interception is on the territory of the Member State ordering the interception. It does not, however, impose any obligations or costs on satellite operators to make such facilities available.
<P>

<a name="90526w02.htm_para7">The draft Convention also contains a number of non-interception provisions. These are not expected to have any significant financial implications for the United Kingdom. Indeed, simpler and quicker procedures for seeking and providing legal assistance under the draft Convention could result in some cost savings.
<P>

<a name="90526w02.htm_para8">The draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of communications in respect of new technologies is intended to supplement an existing 1995 Council Resolution. Its purpose is to make clear that law enforcement agencies have similar interception requirements for traditional telephony and new technologies such as the Internet and satellite communications.
<P>

<a name="90526w02.htm_para9">The 1995 Council Resolution has not been incorporated in United Kingdom law, and, therefore, does not place obligations on telecommunications operators. Similarly, the draft Resolution is not legally binding and will not impose any obligations or costs on satellite operators or Internet Service Providers.
<P>

<a name="90526w02.htm_para10">The draft Convention and draft Council Resolution remain under Parliamentary scrutiny in both Houses in accordance with the normal procedures. I am aware of representations from Justice and Liberty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w02.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answers of 27 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>110</i> and 18 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>295</i>, on home detention curfews, how many of the 14 curfewees referred to in the replies committed offences during their period of curfew <i>(a)</i> punishable with imprisonment and <i>(b)</i> punishable with four years or more imprisonment.  [85247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Of the 14 curfewees referred to, 13 were charged with offences which were imprisonable. It would not be appropriate to comment on the sentences likely to be imposed by the courts in any individual case. Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the aggravating and mitigating factors. However, in seven of the cases, the maximum penalty is more than four years' imprisonment.

 It is important that all police forces in England and Wales take every measure to ensure year 2000 compliance. The Home Office has commissioned an Independent Assessment of all forces, including Lancashire, by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The results of this survey will be published at the National Infrastructure Forum on 13 July.

 The UK Passport Agency is taking a number of measures to ensure that its customers' needs are met. It is prioritising applications received in the post and made in person by customers' declared travel dates, and is meeting these dates for 99.99 per cent. of passports issued. The Agency is employing additional staffing resources, and optimising the efficiency of its examination processes consistent with the need to maintain the integrity and security of its issuing procedures. In order to clear quickly straightforward applications, certain existing passports are being extended for two years.
<P>

<a name="90526w03.htm_para0">The Agency is currently experiencing very high seasonal demand for passports and its aim is to continue to meet customers' travel dates and to reduce its turnround time for straightforward applications to ten days by September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The current delays in processing passport applications by the UK Passport Agency have arisen as a result of problems with the implementation in the Liverpool and Newport passport offices of new high technology driven passport issuing arrangements, together with high seasonal demand for passports. This has increased the processing times for straightforward non- urgent applications.
<P>

<a name="90526w03.htm_para1">My assessment of the present operational situation is that it is extremely serious, particularly in the Liverpool passport office. I am receiving reports weekly from the Agency's Chief Executive on the operational position, and the measures being taken to improve it.

 National guidance on mentally disordered offenders was issued to the police and other agencies in the criminal justice system in September 1990 and a revision issued in April 1996. Chief officers were asked to ensure that all their officers were aware of the circular. Information is not held centrally on the number of chief officers who have issued other guidance on mentally disordered offenders to their officers, but some are known to have done so.
<P>

<a name="90526w03.htm_para5">In respect of Cheshire Constabulary, detailed policy and guidance to operational officers on dealing with mentally disordered offenders was issued in 1994 and was last revised in 1998.

 As part of their probationer training, all recruits to the police service in England and Wales receive awareness training on persons suffering from mental disability. This training is supplemented by practical role play exercises which can be used to reinforce learning. In addition to the content of the former probationer training curriculum, forces may provide further training on the needs of mentally disordered persons, if there was a particular local need for this. Sergeants who act as custody officers receive further, more detailed, training in the Custody Officer Training Programme which, although

<P>
<a name="90526w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In the last ten years, between 20 May 1989 and 20 May 1999, there have been a total of 2,408 adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the combined oral contraceptive pill received through the United Kingdom's Yellow Card adverse drug reaction reporting scheme. A fatal outcome was reported in 104 of these reports as listed in the table. The 104 deaths reported over ten years need to be taken in the context of around three million women taking the Pill each year in the UK.
<P>

<a name="90526w04.htm_para7">Not all deaths suspected to be related to the use of the combined oral contraceptives are reported to the Medicine Control Agency/Committee on Safety of Medicines via the Yellow Card spontaneous adverse drug reaction scheme; we therefore cannot provide the total number of deaths. It is also essential to bear in mind that a report of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not mean that the reaction/death was caused by the medicine concerned. Many other factors are likely to contribute.
<P>

<a name="90526w04.htm_para8">The Pill is highly effective in preventing pregnancy. The risks of fatal adverse reactions associated with combined oral contraceptive Pills are very small; and are much smaller than those associated with pregnancy.
<P>

 Officials from the Department contribute to the work of the Council of Europe on issues related to the welfare and protection of children, through the formal Committee structure of the Council of Europe. I am due to participate in a Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Family Affairs in Stockholm on 14-16 June, where the theme will be "Towards a Child- Friendly Society". In preparation for the Conference the United Kingdom has provided a National Report on "child-friendly" initiatives.

<P>
<a name="90526w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are no data specifically relating to the incidence of Alzheimer's disease in England and Wales. The overall incidence rate after the age of 65 across Western Europe is 18.3 cases per 1,000 person years.
<P>

<a name="90526w05.htm_para0">It is estimated that approximately 600,000 people over 65, or 5 per cent. of that population in the United Kingdom, suffer from dementia. Alzheimer's Disease accounts for just over half.

<P>
<a name="90526w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 1999]:</i> In 1991 the General Medical Services Council of the British Medical Association issued guidance to general practitioners through Local Medical Committees, reminding them of their obligations under their terms of service. That guidance remains extant and GPs who have a conscientious objection to abortion should refer the patient to another doctor as soon as possible.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many acres of land in the UK were cultivated as trial sites of genetically modified crops in each of the last five years; and how many acres of land will be cultivated as trial sites of GM crops in 1999.  [83283]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In 1998, the area cultivated as trial sites of genetically modified crops was approximately 300 hectares. In the current year, the total figure, including the farmscale evaluations, is expected to be about the same. These are approximate figures because consents for releases are granted on the basis of a maximum area that can be grown and companies do not necessarily sow all the area for which they have approval. Figures for earlier years are not available, but were no more than the 1998 levels.

<P>
<a name="90526w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 1999]:</i> There are no differences in policy, the growing of all GM crops must be covered by a valid consent issued in accordance with Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. Before a consent is granted the applicant must have carried out an assessment of the risks posed to the environment and demonstrated compliance with all aspects of the directive. Those crops planted as part of the farmscale evaluations will in addition be studied for ecological effects in comparison with equivalent non- GM crops.

Kingdom Presidency, and detailed negotiations took place in the Council Working Group under the Austrian Presidency in the second half of last year. At the December Environment Council, Ministers agreed that while substantial progress had been made, further detailed negotiations were required to resolve many of the outstanding issues. The German Presidency has indicated it will seek to reach a common position at the June Environment Council.
<P>

<a name="90526w06.htm_para2">The position of the Government with regard to the original Commission proposal has been laid out in Explanatory Memorandum 6378/98, submitted to the House of Commons on 23 March 1998. In response to a request from the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, I wrote to the committee on 27 November with details of the Government's priorities in the negotiations. A Scrutiny debate was held in the House of Commons European Standing Committee A on 24 March 1999, and the Government submitted a further Explanatory Memorandum (7138/99) on 30 April following the publication of the Commission's amended proposal taking account of the publication of the European Parliament's Opinion.
<P>

<a name="90526w06.htm_para3">The priorities of the Government are to ensure that the revised Directive meets growing public concerns regarding ethical, environmental and social issues and achieves a more transparent regulatory regime. In addition, the Government support many of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament and incorporated into the amended Commission Proposal. In particular, the Government welcome changes to clarify the requirements for the environmental risk assessment, the stronger requirements for public information and consultation, and a new Article on consultation of the Commission's ethical committee.

<a name="90526w07.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the cost per heavy goods vehicle of the fitting of an exhaust system incorporating a particulates trap in order to attract the reduction in vehicle excise duty announced in his Budget statement.  [83824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government's assessment of the current cost of retrofitting a particulate trap to a heavy goods vehicle is between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,500, compared with the maximum Vehicle Excise Duty reduction of &#163;1,000 when vehicles meet the emissions standards required to receive a Reduced Pollution Certificate. The cost for smaller vehicles is at the lower end of this scale, increasing to the upper figure for the largest and most powerful lorries. It is expected that the cost of emissions reduction technologies will fall as the market for them grows, leading to competition between manufacturers and economies of scale in the production of devices.

 The Government's statutory advisers on radiological protection matters are the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).

distances from equipment, and is related to established health effects of EMFs, such as effects on perception, central nervous system effects and the heating of tissues.
<P>

<a name="90526w07.htm_para1">The NRPB advise that radio waves at ground level and in regions accessible to the public tend to be many times below guideline levels and should present no health risk. Telecommunications operators have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Management of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992 to ensure that their work activities, which would include the operation of their apparatus, do not present a risk to employees and the general public. The practical effect of the combination of the NRPB guidelines and health and safety legislation should be that people are kept at a safe distance from sources of EMFs.
<P>

<a name="90526w07.htm_para2">The NRPB also advise that there is no convincing evidence of a causal effect between exposure to EMFs and other health effects, such as cancer, and that published human health studies relating to these do not provide a basis for advice on setting exposure standards.

We shall continue to take international practice and research results into consideration in taking forward policy on this matter, including in developing guidance on land use planning and electromagnetic fields.

The increase between 1997 and 1998 was associated with delays in commissioning and starting up combined cycle gas turbine power stations, planned maintenance at nuclear plant and some reduction in imported electricity.

 Following the introduction in Sweden of Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) in 1994, an increase in engine component wear was identified by engine repairers. The problems focused upon engine valves and on turbochargers and appeared to have been caused by a phenomenon known as hot corrosion reportedly due to the use of sodium in the fuel. With the emergence of this information, LRP in Sweden was changed to a potassium-based product and once the changeover was complete the incidence of engine damage

Most new social housing is provided by Registered Social Landlords supported by the Housing Corporation, either through its Approved Development Programme or through Local Authority Social Housing Grant, in areas where such developments are seen as a priority in local housing strategies.

 The precise figure will depend on the proportion of domestic flights within the UK which contain a return leg.

<P>
<a name="90526w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 On coming to office, it was clear that the Government would have to give a strong lead to this work in order to see it successfully completed. I commissioned a report from the then DGES on the status of the programme soon after taking office. That report and one from his programme manager was published on 29 May 1997 and provided a sound way forward upon which the industry was prepared to commit to delivery.
<P>

<a name="90526w16.htm_para5">Among the difficulties which have been faced have been the sheer size of the task and the level of technical complexity involved. The task of putting in place the vital IT infrastructure which is required to make the competition process work was one of the largest and most difficult in the world. I have worked hard to ensure that competition was introduced in a sensible, systematic way which ensured that customers were paramount and have conducted a series of meetings with the companies, the Regulator, the Electricity Pool and the programme managers to ensure that any difficulties were ironed out.
<P>

<a name="90526w16.htm_para6">It was intended by the previous Government that supply competition would be introduced from April 1998. However, a realistic programme of work had not been put in place to support delivery by that date. Despite the efforts of the industry during 1998, the April date proved unachievable with fully tested systems. At a meeting I held on 22 January 1998 with the DGES, representatives from the electricity industry agreed to accept a target of rolling out competition between September 1998 and June 1999. The first areas to open to full competition did so on 14 September last year. Competition was introduced in each PES area in three planned stages over six months. A comprehensive testing programme was put in place to establish whether systems could interact effectively. The market was declared fully open on 24 May, a month ahead of schedule, by the DGES. The DGES will be monitoring for some time to come to ensure that the mechanics supporting the change of supplier process are working effectively and that the companies adopt a reasonable approach to doorstep selling. Consumers across the country should now benefit from lower prices and a better level of service.

 The latest Whitehall Foresight progress report was published on 26 May. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The report provides examples of what Departments are doing to promote Foresight and to respond to Foresight priorities and recommendations. It also outlines Departments' initial plans for participation in the new round of Foresight which started on 1 April. Overall, it reflects significant forward progress since the last report published in June 1998.

[85317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90526w18.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In DTI and some of its agencies a birth certificate is one of a variety of documents which applicants for jobs may choose to offer as proof of identity and of age, for pension services, prior to or at recruitment. It is a mandatory requirement in the Radiocommunications Agency, the Patent Office and the National Weights and Measures Laboratory. In the event of the death of a Departmental employee in service, his or her children's full birth certificates are required in order to verify dates of birth for dependants' benefits under the relevant pensions arrangements. Contractors are responsible for establishing proof of the identity of their employees. Birth certificates are not required routinely for any other Departmental purposes; however, they can be offered by claimants under the Enemy Property Compensation Scheme to help establish the validity of such claims in particular lines of inheritance; and they may, in very limited circumstances, be demanded under a number of statutory powers of investigation, for example under Section 434 of the Companies Act 1985.
