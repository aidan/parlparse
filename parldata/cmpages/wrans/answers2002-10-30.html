 <i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> The medal is being issued to the living holders of the Victoria Cross and the George Cross, to serving members of the armed forces and Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and to the '999' emergency services. The Prison Service is not an emergency service. Accordingly, it is not eligible to receive the medal. There are no plans to re-open the matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My Department has announced our intention to establish an England-wide database of sports facilities. Information on sports facilities in England is currently held by a variety of organisations, and a single database will enable more strategic Government investment in those areas and facilities 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 791W</I><P>
which are most important. My Department is currently assessing the scope, content and cost of the proposed database and how the project will be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="21030w01.html_para1">Local authorities are key providers of sport and recreation and play a central role in the delivery of sport for local communities. XNew Planning Guidance for Sport, Open Space and Recreation", issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, provides robust guidelines to help local authorities to plan positively for the provision and assessment of open spaces, sports and recreation facilities in their areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> representations were received and <i>(b)</i> environmental impact assessment was made concerning the decision to instal the antenna in the Akrotiri SBA, Cyprus; and if he will make a statement.[R]  [77919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Representations about the decision to install the antenna have been made by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, the Akrotiri Co-ordinating Committee, the Green Party of Cyprus, local authorities, non government organisations and major landowners within the proposed site and surrounding area.
<P>

<a name="21030w01.html_para2">An environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the likely environment impact of the project was undertaken in 1997. The EIA was updated in 2001. The EIAs were reviewed by an independent, international panel of experts from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA), who found that there were significant deficiencies in the original assessment, when judged against today's best practice standards. They recommended that, in the event that a decision was taken to proceed with the project, we should adopt a comprehensive strategy to ensure that adverse impacts are avoided or, where this is not possible, reduced to the absolute minimum. The panel's recommendations were accepted in full and are being implemented.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Consideration was given to locating the antenna elsewhere and a number of alternative sites were investigated. The alternative sites were judged unsuitable for technical reasons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment was made of the likely impact on wildlife including migratory birds, of the new antenna at Akrotiri SBA Cyprus.[R]  [77921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A team of experts under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence gathered data on wildlife as recommended by an independent, international panel of experts from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA). This work was published in a Supplementary Environmental Work Report in June 2002. A copy of the report has been 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 792W</I><P>
placed in the Library of the House. Proposed mitigation measures have been implemented or are being progressed within a Ramsar Management Plan. Data collection is continuing.
<P>

<a name="21030w01.html_para3">The environmental work on migratory birds has continued beyond the publication of the Supplementary Environmental Work Report. The Ministry of Defence is currently collecting additional data. Survey protocols have been agreed between the MOD, Republic of Cyprus, and the IEMA Panel for day and night time flight line surveys to record the passage of birds through the proposed Pluto site, bird collision monitoring of the existing antenna and monitoring of the migration behaviour of Demoiselle Cranes. MOD and ROC staff have jointly staffed the surveys.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment was made of the possible impact on the health of the local Cypriot population of the new antenna installed at Akrotiri SBA, Cyprus; and if he will make a statement.[R]  [77922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The possible impact of the new antenna on the health of the local Cypriot population has been considered carefully. It has been assessed that levels of electromagnetic emissions from the new system will be no greater than those from the system it will replace and will be well within EU safety limits. Following tests carried out last summer by its own experts and by experts from France, the Ministry of Communications and Works of the Republic announced that exposure of the public to electromagnetic radiation from the existing antenna on the Salt Lake is at least seventy six times smaller than the limit recommended by the European Union and that the installation of the new antenna is not expected to result in a significant increase in the level of emissions in the area. This confirms the results of our own assessments.
<P>

<a name="21030w01.html_para4">As a further measure of reassurance the two governments are carrying out a study into the health of the Akrotiri villagers. It is also our intention to set up permanent monitoring equipment in the village to confirm that emissions remain at the very low levels demonstrated in last summer's tests.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what consultation was held with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus over the decision to build the new antenna at Akrotiri SBA; and if he will make a statement.[R]  [77923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Extensive consultations have taken place between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Cyprus about the decision to build a new antenna at Akrotiri.
<P>

<a name="21030w01.html_para5">These consultations led to a joint statement in August 2001 by the two governments about the steps necessary to address concerns about the possible impact of the antenna on the health of the Akrotiri villagers and on the environment. The British Government has fulfilled the key undertakings set out in the joint statement.

: The review of L21A1 baton round performance after one year in service was completed and provided to the Sub-committee (SC) of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC) as requested in June of this year.
<P>

<a name="21030w02.html_para5">The SC, DSAC have considered the review and have issued a statement, which is reproduced below. I am also placing a copy of the statement in the Library ofthe House.

<P>
<a name="21030w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As I explained in my answer of 15 October to the hon Member, the FCO Green Paper entitled XPrivate Military Companies: Options for Regulation" published on 12 February 2002 highlighted the problem of defining a private military company. I noted that in practice, a wide spectrum of people and companies may be involved in the supply of military and security services. The Green Paper also notes that the distinction between combat and non-combat operations is not always clear. Companies may employ only a relatively small core of full-time staff and recruit personnel for individual contracts on a case-by-case basis. United Kingdom nationals could also potentially operate overseas on a freelance basis, but such activity is difficult to monitor. Given these difficulties, it is not possible to provide any meaningful estimates of the number of companies that provide forces for combat or how many United Kingdom nationals are so employed. The absence of any register of companies describing themselves as Private Military Companies further undermines any attempt to produce a meaningful estimate.

<a name="21030w04.html_para5">Smart cards have great potential to help improve people's experience of public transport by facilitating through-ticketing and Xseamless" journeys. In some parts of the country projects are already well advanced. We are organising Xshowcase" demonstration examples to promote their wider take-up, to encourage scheme integration and help put the UK firmly in the lead in this area. My Department is working closely with the Integrated Transport Smart Card Organisation (ITSO) to create common specifications for ticketing systems to ensure smart cards introduced in one area are capable of working with ticket machines in other areas.

However, under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, the Security Industry Authority has been given powers to regulate all persons in England and Wales who immobilise vehicles in such places, in part because of concerns about the unscrupulous behaviour of some clamping companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many meetings officials have attended to discuss progress towards meeting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child <i>(a)</i> with organisations and Government departments within the UK and <i>(b)</i> with organisations in other countries.

<P>
<a name="21030w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Children and Young People's Unit has lead responsibility for monitoring the UK's implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since March 2001, when the Unit took over responsibility from the Department of Health, officials have held the following formal meetings which include discussion of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child:
<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para1"><i>(a) Within the UK</i>
<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para2">Quarterly meetings with the devolved administrations

<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para7">In addition, the Unit holds ad hoc bilateral meetings both at home and abroad with lead policy makers on Convention issues. For example, there was regular contact across Whitehall in the preparation for the UK's second report to the UN Committee. Information about the precise number of such meetings can only be gathered at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w05.html_wqn2"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment she has made of the UK's contribution towards achieving the goals of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; and what representations she has received about the UK contribution.  [78011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) does not require signatories to work towards achieving certain objectives or 'goals', nor does it give enforceable rights to individual children. Rather, it imposes obligations on the State to "respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 808W</I><P>
child within their jurisdiction". Each signatory, therefore, is responsible for implementing the UNCRC in their own country.
<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para8">The UK signed the Convention on 19 April 1990 and ratified it on 16 December 1991. It came into force in the UK on 15 January 1992. To allow monitoring of implementation, the CRC requires State Parties to report to the UN on their progress against the Convention 2 years after ratification, and every 5 years subsequently.
<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para9">The UK's Second Report under the CRC was submitted by the Department of Health in 1999 and, due to backlogs at the UN, was only considered by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in June this year. A UK delegation comprising senior officials from across Government attended an oral examination in Geneva on 19 September. UK NGOs also submitted a report, and gave oral evidence. The Committee published its concluding observations on 4th October and this document, as well as copies of the UK's Second Report and a summary of the UK NGO reports have been placed in both Libraries.
<P>

<a name="21030w05.html_para10">The Government is under no formal obligation from the UN to respond to the report, but lead Departments across Whitehall, together with the Devolved Administrations, are considering how to take the Committee's comments into account. Although there are areas where we expect to take a different view from the Committee over our obligations under the Convention, we will consider its recommendations in developing our overarching strategy for children and young people, a development which the UN Committee welcomed. We will continue to involve the voluntary sector in this work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assistance has been given to local authorities to educate residents on the dangers to livestock from illegally imported meat.  [75926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A campaign to raise public awareness of the dangers posed by illegal meat imports has been co-ordinated centrally by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A variety of methods have been used in the campaign, including posters, leaflets, and radio fillers. Two Government information videos have just been produced. A leaflet on the importance of biosecurity has been issued to farmers. At the level of local authorities, in this financial year, Defra is funding jointly with the Food Standards Agency to provide additional training for enforcement officers on import rules.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what she is doing to encourage trading standards officers to prosecute those who trade in illegally imported bushmeat.  [75930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My officials have discussed with local authority officers on a number of occasions the circumstances in which prosecutions are brought 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 809W</I><P>
against those importing meat illegally. We have made clear that prosecutions are an important aspect of deterrence which we would like to see used where there is clear evidence of a serious breach of the rules. We are willing to work with local authorities to produce further guidance if this would be helpful. In addition the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is matching funding with the Food Standards Agency to provide additional training for officers from local authorities, including trading standards officers, on import requirements. One of the key aims of the training will be to raise awareness of the illegal meat trade and give officers advice on which cases should be prosecuted.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ruffley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many penalties have been imposed on illegal meat importers since May.  [76009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 According to data held on the Illegal Imports Animal Products Seizures (ILAPS) database, there have been 984 seizures of illegally imported meat from 1 May to 30 September 2002 inclusive. The penalty in 983 of these cases was destruction of the produce, and in the other the produce was re-exported. In addition, one successful prosecution was brought by Crawley Borough Council in July 2002 and six cautions were issued by the London Port Health Authority in October 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about the animal welfare standards in <i>(a)</i> pig and <i>(b)</i> poultry farms.  [76959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is comprehensive legislation in place to protect the welfare of all farmed animals. In particular, the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000, as amended, include detailed requirements for pigs and laying hens. There are also species-specific welfare codes. Arrangements are in place to implement new EU directives on pig welfare and to update the existing welfare code. New codes for laying hens and meat and breeding chickens were introduced in July.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on banning the use of animals in circuses; and whether she will include a ban on animals in circuses in the new Animal Welfare Bill.  [77492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The proposed new Animal Welfare Bill will be an enabling measure under which the Secretary of State would be able to bring forward detailed proposals to regulate or prohibit certain practices in order to promote the welfare of the animals concerned. It is through this mechanism that any move to restrict or prohibit the use of animals in circuses would be made. This particular issue is complex, with strongly held opinions on all sides. Any decision on the future of animals performing in circuses would only be taken after the most thorough consultation.

<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]:</i> The Government's policy on the commission's proposal to cap subsidies for individual farms is that it goes against the grain of proposals that are intended to encourage increased efficiency.

<P>
<a name="21030w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are in favour of decoupling in principle. It helps to reconnect farmers to markets, removes perverse incentives to environmental damage through overproduction and should contribute to a successful conclusion of the WTO development round and discharging our obligation to the poorest countries. However, there are a lot of issues to resolve before we can introduce a workable system.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]:</i> The Government's view is that the Commission proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy do not go far enough.

<i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]:</i> The Government supports a shift from production linked support to agri-environment and rural development measures. However, we do not believe that the Commission's proposals for achieving this through modulation go far or fast enough. In particular, the proposals would not deliver real budgetary savings which are necessary to put the CAP budget on a more sustainable footing. In addition, the Commission's proposal includes a franchise excluding very small farms and ceiling on payments to the largest farms which would be unnecessarily complex to administer, and could introduce distortions in farm

 The European Commission have forecasted the annual cost of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the EU budget until 2006, as set out in the table. These estimates assume the continuation of current policy and exclude expenditure on rural development. Without knowing how a decoupled payment system would work in detail any assessment of its impact of the EU budget would be purely speculative.

 Sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) are covered by the provisions of the Water Framework Directive to the extent that they are also "protected areas" which have been designated as requiring special protection under specific Community legislation for the conservation of habitats and species directlydepending on water. These areas will include relevant Natura 2000 sites designated under the Birds and Habitats Directives.

Since the Government has a target to bring 95 per cent. of SSSIs into favourable condition by 2010, implementation of the Directive will not have a direct bearing on elivering the Government's commitment on SSSIs by 2010. However, in the long term, through its emphasis on a holistic, river basin based approach to water management, using water quality criteria based on ecological parameters, implementation of the Directive will benefit SSSIs

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under section 105 of the Water Resources Act 1991 the Environment Agency has a general supervisory duty over all flood defence matters. Section 106 of that Act requires the Agency to carry out all of its flood defence functions (except certain financial functions) through Regional Flood Defence Committees.

<a name="21030w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At present, there is no list detailing areas not protected by flood relief schemes. Indicative flood plain maps published by the Environment Agency show areas of known risk, including those where the risk is reduced by defences. However the Environment Agency with Defra support are working on a Flood and Coastal Defence Database for England and Wales and a risk assessment that is developing zoned maps of these floodplain areas that will show the residual levels of risk

 There are approximately 1.8 million domestic properties in the indicative flood plain and which must therefore be considered at risk from periodic flooding from watercourses and the sea. However the vast majority of these properties are protected by flood defences.

<a name="21030w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the Hares Preservation Act 1892 it is a summary offence to sell a hare or leveret between the months of March to July inclusive. The prohibition does not extend to foreign imported hares. The Act does not specify an enforcement authority. The usual procedure would be for an Information to be laid before Magistrates following which a summons would be served on the alleged offender. The police would normally lay an Information, following which the Crown Prosecution Service would take over the conduct of the prosecution from the police. Alternatively a case could be conducted by any other prosecutor such as, for instance, a local authority trading standards officer, or a private individual.

 There is no requirement for hire bulls to be licensed in Great Britain and no central records detailing their geographical distribution. Therefore the detailed data required to answer the question is not available.

It must also confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of disease. The meat is also subjected to post mortem veterinary inspection.

 We set targets in a way which meant all authorities would have to improve their performance over their rate in 1998[en rule]99, no matter what their starting point. For that reason, when tracking local authorities' recycling performance, we consider how much the recycling rate has increased, rather than looking simply at the rate.

<a name="21030w08.html_para3">I have written to the leaders of the local authorities listed about recycling. In these authorities, preliminary (unaudited) performance data for 2001&#150;02, taken from 2002&#150;03 Best Value Performance Plans, shows that the authority's recycling performance has decreased, stayed the same or only increased by 1 per cent. between 1998&#150;99 and 2001&#150;02. I have invited the relevant leaders to identify work that is already in hand to meet their 2003&#150;04 Statutory Performance Standard for recycling and composting of household waste and to consider the need for further action where this is relevant.

The purpose of the meeting was to hear the views of leading individuals on future priorities and actions at UK level, in the light of the conclusions of the summit. The meeting focused on three issues that emerged clearly from the summit as priorities for action at national level in the developed world: the role of business in delivering sustainable development; energy and, in particular, renewable energy; and sustainable production and consumption. No paper was produced for this meeting.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of farmers suffering TB outbreaks in their herds have adequate isolation facilities in which to house infected cattle; and if she will make a statement.  [76510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information on stock isolation facilities is not routinely gathered by Defra. When TB reactors or animals that react inconclusively to the TB test are disclosed, farmers receive verbal guidance on isolating those animals from the rest of the herd while awaiting slaughter or re-test. In addition, Defra has provided farmers with free guidance on reducing the risk of TB in their herds either by means of cattle to cattle spread, or from a wildlife reservoir.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are no plans to provide financial assistance to farmers to help them to establish new isolation facilities, either in respect of <i>(a)</i> TB or <i>(b)</i> other infectious animal diseases.

 As a biosecurity measure Defra has advised farmers purchasing cattle to ascertain when the animals being bought in were last tested for TB. There are no plans to include TB test dates on cattle passports.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> Between 11 February 2002 and 23 October 2002 the Animal Movement Licensing System identified 7,616 apparent infringements of the 20 day standstill, which were subject to investigation by the appropriate local authority. This compares with approximately 650,000 recorded movements over that period. Most of the apparent infringements are likely to have been minor, such as an incorrect address entered into the movement report. Where however, an apparent infringement is found to be a breach of the movement legislation in force, this is dealt with, in most cases, by means short of prosecution. This can include verbal or written warnings or requiring a farmer to obtain an Individual Movement Licence before moving livestock.

Provisional figures for the current year to end September indicate that 23 prosecutions have been taken.

 The Government published a consultation paper, on July 31; "Extending Opportunities for Competition in the Water Industry in England and Wales". This proposed competition only in the non-household sector, with an eligibility threshold of a minimum of 50 Megalitres (Ml) a year. The consultation period closed on 1 October and we are now considering responses.
<P>

<a name="21030w09.html_para2">In preparing the proposals, assessment was made of the broad cost breakdown between the main elements of the supply chain, the likely scope for making savings on these, and the ranges of charges paid by users. Experience shows that the market will determine financial viability in a competitive environment.
<P>

<a name="21030w09.html_para3">These issues will be taken into consideration as we balance the need to create opportunities for competition whilst continuing to secure the Government's wider objectives for the water industry, which include protecting public health, the environment, social and economic goals, and safeguarding services for household customers.

<a name="21030w09.html_para6">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. Following the publication of the CMO's working group report on CFS/ME, the MRC was asked to develop a broad strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on CFS/ME. The MRC has appointed an independent scientific advisory group which includes scientists with expertise in such areas as epidemiology, physiology, immunology, infections, clinical trials, paediatric neurology and psychological medicine. The advisory group will draw on the working party report and recent expert views of the field. It will also take into account the concerns of patients and carers and the interests of consumers generally. Details of the advisory group and a note of the first meeting are now available on the MRC website, at www.mrc.ac.uk.

GDS. Total revenue available for DACs in 2002&#150;03 is #35 million. It is anticipated that around 300,000 patients will be treated in these centres during the course of this financial year. Final allocations will be adjusted to take account of the overall performance of each centre.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to raise the retirement age for general dental surgery principals; and what his policy is on retention of seniority payments for such principals. [76247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 At present general dental services (GDS) principals are removed from dental lists on 1 April following their 65th birthday, but can continue to work as assistants, or privately. We plan to amend the GDS regulations to increase this age limit to 70 years at the next available opportunity, which is likely to be in the spring of 2003. Principals who continue to work beyond the age of 65 will retain entitlement to claim seniority payments in accordance with the conditions set out in Determination III of the Statement of Dental Remuneration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2002]:</i> The latest Gallup Survey commissioned by the National Kidney Patients Association in 2000 indicates that 28 per cent. of the population carry a donor card. This equates to about 16.5 million people in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21030w10.html_para2">Since 1997 we have launched a number of publicity campaigns and initiatives encouraging people to join the national health service organ donation register (ODR), to carry a donor card, and to discuss their wishes with their relatives. Advertising on television, radio and press at time of launch was supported by public information leaflets which contain donor cards and forms to join the ODR.
<P>

<a name="21030w10.html_para3">The organ donation literature line, 0845 60 60 400, and the campaign website (www.nhs.uk/organdonor) complements and supports this activity as do very successful partnerships with the voluntary sector, the general practitioner surgery network, Boots, Goldfish and other banks, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, the Passport Agency and GlaxoSmithKline.
<P>

<a name="21030w10.html_para4">In addition, United Kingdom Transplant's 2002 initiative with local authorities, encouraged people to join the ODR when they enrol on the electoral register.
<P>

<a name="21030w10.html_para5">The Department also runs two separate campaigns specifically targeting Asians and African Caribbeans as people from these communities are more likely to suffer from conditions that lead to kidney failure, resulting in a need for a transplant.

 None. All doctors must work within the limits of their professional competence, as required by General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, Good Medical Practice. Doctors should not, therefore, be given or take on responsibility for patients if they are not competent to do so. This is to ensure that patients receive the highest quality of care and have the best chances of making a full recovery.
<P>

<a name="21030w11.html_para3">Nevertheless all National Health Service patients in hospital are likely to have some contact with a doctor who is not a fully trained specialist. The NHS in England employs about 31,700 doctors, not yet qualified to work independently, in training grades and about 11,800 staff grade doctors, some of whom are trained specialists. 24,400 NHS consultants supervise the work of all of these doctors and are responsible for the care patients receive. Consultants are all trained specialists included on the specialist register held by the GMC.

 The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust is currently carrying out a countywide review of ophthalmology services. No decisions have been made on changes to ophthalmology services in Worcestershire, and no detailed cost analysis has been undertaken on the relocation of ophthalmology services to Kidderminster from other acute hospitals. All factors, including any financial implications, will be evaluated fully in determining the nature of future developments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on donor shortage; and what he proposes to do to increase the number of donors available.  [77158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2002]:</i> There is a world-wide shortage of organs for transplantation. There are a number of reasons for this not least that there is a welcome reduction in the numbers of people dying in circumstances in which organ donation would have been possible, for example, the decreasing number of fatal road accidents and improvements in neurological surgery.
<P>

<a name="21030w12.html_para0">We are taking specific action to increase the number of donors available by investing in initiatives to raise public awareness and the benefits of organ transplantation, particularly in the ethnic minority populations where there may be a greater need for transplantation, implementing measures to help ensure that potential donors are identified and that we increase the use of both living and non-heartbeating donation. Nearly #4 million is being invested in the national health service through United Kingdom transplant to boost the number of life-saving organ transplants. This is funding 35 donor liaison schemes to improve procedures for identifying possible organ donors and the steps to take so that relatives are approached and given the opportunity to decide about donation. It is also supporting 25 living donation programmes, 10 additional transplant co-ordinators and six non-heartbeating donor programmes.

[76215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w13.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The competition commission appeal tribunal's (CCAT) judgment in the Bettercare case stated that the Competition Act 1998 applied in the particular circumstances that were presented. One implication of this is that potentially local councils' commissioning of care services could be subject to the Competition Act, but each case would need to be considered in the context of its facts. The judgment did not comment on whether the particular health and social care board involved in the case or other councils are presently contravening the Act. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will now reconsider the issue of the alleged anti-competitive conduct of the board involved in the case. Beyond this, no general assessment of the implications of this ruling can be made. I understand that in deciding not to appeal the judgment the OFT had in mind that the European Court is currently considering a similar case (case T-319/99 FENIN <i>v.</i> European Commission). The outcome of this case is expected before the spring of 2003. This may assist in clarifying further whether the Act applies to the commissioning functions of public bodies.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2002]:</i> We have made substantial funding available to local crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs), under the safer communities initiative, the communities against drugs programme and the partnership development fund, to enable them to tackle their crime problems. The Worthing and Adur CDRPs have been allocated #155,072 and #104,154 respectively for 2002&#150;03 under these initiatives.

 The fight against drugs involves co-ordinated action to deal with the supply of drugs and drug-related crime, as well as strengthening communities to resist drugs, and providing treatment, harm minimisation and education services. Resources for all these services are targeted according to local needs, so they can target the drugs which do the most harm, problematic users and the most vulnerable sections of society. We will continue to review the way that the available money is allocated to ensure that it is easily accessible and reaches the areas where it can be most effective.

: The national firearms certificate holders register is being developed on the police national computer (PNC) by the police information technology organisation (PITO) using its own internal resources. An integral part of the project is to provide a link between the local systems used by forces and the national database on the PNC. The procurement exercise to engage contract support to develop and implement the necessary interfaces failed to provide a satisfactory solution. PITO estimate that the manpower costs associated with this part of the project totalled some #21,000. I understand that PITO have recently issued a non-binding expression of interest for a re-tender to provide a single firearms licensing management system and to build the interface to the PNC. It is unlikely that the register will now be operational before summer 2004 and work is already being developed to achieve that aim.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the number of victims of people trafficking who have been removed from this country and then been subsequently trafficked back to the UK or to other EU destinations in the last five years.  [77382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21030w15.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As people trafficking is not yet a criminal offence, there are no figures currently collected on the number of cases of trafficking. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before Parliament creates a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of prostitution, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years. This will enable us to tackle the worst forms of exploitation pending the introduction of more comprehensive legislation when parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="21030w15.html_para3">The only available estimates of the levels of trafficking are based on a Home Office research study XStopping Traffic" (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000), which indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year, but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries. The report did not attempt to estimate the number of people who were trafficked a second time, having previously been removed.

 Spending Review 2002 has made additional resources available for policing. By 2005&#150;06, spending on the police will amount to around #1.5 billion more than in 2002&#150;03. The final grant position for individual police authorities will take account of the allocation of resources for 2003&#150;04 and the outcome of the recent consultation process on Local Government Finance Formula Grant Distribution.

<P>
<a name="21030w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 28 October 2002]:</i> Information is not collected in the form requested. Courts are required to notify court results (in conviction and other cases) to police forces within three working days of completion of the case. Under performance standards set by the Association of Chief Police Officers, police forces are required to input court results (in conviction and other cases) onto the Police National Computer within 72 hours of the receipt of information from the court about the case disposal. We are determined that such key information should be recorded on the Police National Computer in a timely fashion- We therefore commissioned Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to manage and monitor a 12-month programme of work for every force to improve the timeliness of the inputting of key data. As regards court results, the primary purpose was to clear backlog of outstanding cases. The Inspectorate's first report showed considerable progress. Its second report, on the programme overall, which indicates substantial further progress, is under consideration.

Under a scheme currently being rolled out nationally, however, fixed penalty fine revenue from enforcement by the use of speed and red-light traffic cameras can be re-invested to meet the costs of such enforcement. Deployment of cameras so funded is subject to strict conditions, including that sites must have a history of speed related casualties and that the cameras must be clearly visible and conspicuous, in order to deter speeding. Money left over goes, as before, to Her Majesty's Treasury.

 The Court Funds Office (CFO) is the Office of the Accountant General of the Supreme Court. One of the functions of the CFO is to administer funds paid into court on behalf of children when an award of damages is made by the court. The CFO will hold money until the child's 18th birthday unless a Court Order instructs otherwise.
<P>

<a name="21030w16.html_para2">Money is invested in one of two ways:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the CFO seeks the advice of its investment service based at the Office of the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee (OSPT), on the investment of money in stocks and certain unit and investment trusts; or
<P>

the money is placed to the CFO special account that pays a competitive gross rate (before tax) of interest with instant access.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21030w16.html_para3">The investment approach to be applied depends upon the investment policy set by the court, the requirements of the fund, the age of the child and the amount of money held. Smaller sums held for shorter periods are placed on deposit and the principal sum will be secure. Larger sums held for longer periods are invested for the long-term usually, with equity exposure. In these cases, no absolute guarantee of capital value can be given.

 Magistrates courts committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by the magistrates courts and the Crown court. Debt collected includes not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not possible to separate out only fines from the total.
<P>

<a name="21030w16.html_para5">Greater Manchester magistrates courts committee was unable to provide a monthly breakdown of figures. Data are collected from each of the 11 court houses in their estate on a quarterly basis. The figures for the last four quarters are set out in the following table. The percentages in the debt paid and debt written off columns include amounts that have been imposed in previous quarters. It is not possible therefore to isolate the amounts imposed that have been paid and written off in any particular quarter.

The proposals being developed take into account the recommendations from the South Coast Multi Modal Study (SOCOMMS).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The safety issues with the level crossing are long standing and are likely to increase in future due to possible increases in train services along the south coast line. Traffic management measures have been installed with some beneficial effect but the Agency, Railtrack and the Health and Safety Executive (HOUSE) do not see these as the solution. The HSE (Railway Inspectorate) consider that whilst the number of incidents has reduced the crossing is a high risk site and the highest in the south east. Without grade separation soon the Executive will instruct Railtrack to install full barriers at the crossing instead of the existing half barriers. Should this happen the lost time to road traffic will rise to approximately 20&#150;24 minutes in any hour. This would have a dramatic effect on road capacity and result in a significant increase in the delays that already occur and the amount of queuing currently experienced during peak periods along the A27 in both directions. This in turn would lead to greater pressure on parallel routes as traffic sought to avoid the delays.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>XI have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your recent parliamentary question about safety on the A59 trunk road at the Pendle Road/Sabden Road staggered junction in Lancashire.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency has been monitoring accidents at the junction following the improvements that were undertaken in 1999. The analysis of this accident data indicates a common factor in all of the accidents, namely, collisions between vehicles emerging from the side roads and traffic travelling through the junction on the A59. A number of options have been identified to address this type of accident, and a detailed traffic count and analysis of turning movements is currently under way.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are in discussion with the Lancashire Police and plan to meet with them again early next month to agree a strategy for implementing any changes. Our provisional view is that the most appropriate solution would be to make modifications to the existing junction. Our preferred options involve introducing right turn bans, to limit the risk of conflicts occurring, and measures to narrow the A59 carriageway through the junction to restrict opportunities for overtaking and to reduce speed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you may be aware, the A59 is one of a number of routes identified for transfer to local highway authorities in the 1998 White Paper, XA New Deal for Trunk Roads". Under this process, known as detrunking, we are working to a programme for transferring responsibility for the A59 to Lancashire County Council in the spring of next year. This process allows for a fair and equitable transfer of funds to local highway authorities that the Agency would have spent on these roads, including finance for possible schemes such as this.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Depending on the extent of the changes that are adopted to this junction, it may be possible for the Agency to undertake the work within funding allocated for this financial year. Should this not be the case, then it will be for Lancashire County Council as the new highway authority to decide on the improvements they wish to take forward from the funds that they are allocated.</FONT></UL>

<a name="21030w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Enforcement of road traffic law is an operational matter for the police. I understand from the Association of Chief Police Officers that the police do not make any specific provision for checking the driving documents of overseas drivers entering the UK. Police require drivers to produce their driving documents routinely after most police stops and following road accidents and traffic offences. The nationality of a driver does not make any difference to this process: all drivers are subject to the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Census 2001 results are the first to represent the entire population. This was achieved through a new strategy known as the 'One Number Census'. One of the key elements was an independent follow-up survey. The Census Coverage Survey (CCS), as it is known, involved an intensive face-to-face survey of a sample of over 16,000 postcodes containing 320,000 households covering every local authority in England and Wales. By combining the results of the Census and the CCS, it was possible in 2001 to estimate the total resident population-the 'one number'-to a high level of precision, plus or minus 0.2 per cent., and to provide information on the characteristics of those persons missed by the Census.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 862W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thus in 2001, the Census results represent 100 per cent. of the population. Census response, that is the proportion of people returning a form in England and Wales, was 94 per cent. The 6% of people estimated to have been missed by the Census have been added to the counts using a statistical process that was subject to extensive consultation, and based on the results of the CCS.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am confident that the approach we have taken to the 2001 Census provides the most accurate estimates of the population both nationally and for each of the 376 local authorities in England and Wales. No census ever gets responses from 100 per cent. of the population. The 2001 Census was designed from the outset to take full account of this to provide what users of statistics really want&#151;figures representing everyone.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the 2001 Census has undergone rigorous testing and quality checking throughout both the fieldwork and processing. Census tests were carried out in 1997 and 1999 and a survey designed to measure the accuracy of response to each question has been completed. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of verification and validation checks were built in to the processing of the data, and data quality played a key role in all aspects of processing the forms. All information on accuracy will be contained in a Census Quality report to be published in 2003.</FONT></UL>

 The Government are working actively with other members of the Financial Action Task Force to help jurisdictions on the FATF list of non-cooperative countries and territories to strengthen their anti-money laundering systems. An FATF delegation will visit Grenada in December to review progress, and an IMF mission in 2003 will provide technical assistance to the Cook Islands.

However, in December 2001, the FATF decided to implement counter-measures against Nauru in view of its lack of progress. These counter-measures involve enhanced surveillance and reporting of financial transactions with Nauru.

 Emergency cover in Essex, as with the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddess crews, breathing apparatus teams, rescue teams equipped with specialist equipment and the police. The provision of MOD emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to maximise call-out response times and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.
<P>

<a name="21030w23.html_para2">Personnel have been trained and equipped to provide basic emergency fire and rescue cover. The level of training is dependent on the skills already held by personnel and the role that they would perform in the event of a strike. Drivers and basic crew only require a short training package because of the simple nature of 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2002 : Column 873W</I><P>
the equipment and because of the basic level of cover given. Fire Rescue Teams fulfil a more difficult role, which utilises technical equipment in dangerous situation. Some Fire Rescue Teams are already trained and experienced in the use of breathing apparatus and other specialist equipment but additional personnel have also been trained in these techniques. Other support training as well as driver training includes first aid training and specialist equipment maintenance training. Basic training lasts up to five weeks, depending on skill levels and role, plus any other necessary follow on training.
<P>

<a name="21030w23.html_para3">The command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, whether from within a county or from assets deployed nearby in neighbouring counties. The fire crews will use a number of temporary stations across the country but the deployment of fire fighters will be based on the assessment of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible.
<P>

<a name="21030w23.html_para4">Retained Firefighters provide a very valuable service to their communities. We anticipate that in the event of industrial action, many retained firefighters will continue to protect the communities in which they live and work.
<P>

<a name="21030w23.html_para5">The MOD's emergency cover will not replicate the fire fighting capabilities of the Fire Service, but will minimise, as far as possible, the danger to human life. Service personnel will provide basic fire and rescue cover.

The cornerstone of this framework is the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) which will provide local people with clear and concise information about their council's performance. The Government is also committed to giving local authorities greater freedom to deliver by removing unnecessary bureaucracy. In addition to the action taken for all authorities, CPA will be used as the basis for offering extra freedoms to the best performers. We expect that such authorities will use these freedoms to deliver sustainable improvements to the quality of life of their communities. We intend to announce the details shortly.

A total of eight demining NGOs, including two British (HALO Trust and Mines Advisory Group (MAG)) are active in Angola. The cessation of military hostilities earlier this year has allowed them access to areas previously inaccessible because of insecurity.
<P>

<a name="21030w24.html_para1">According to data available from the Angolan Government, NGOs, and UNICEF/UNDP sources, humanitarian demining agencies in Angola have in 2002 collectively worked on a total of 35 minefields, of which 29 have been completely cleared. This work has involved clearing a total of 1.5 million square metres of mined/suspect land and more than 500 km of road. A further 3.5 million square metres have been surveyed during the same period in the provinces of Cunene, Benguela, Bie, Huambo, Kuanza Norte, Luanda, Malanje and Moxico. Throughout the course of the year demining NGOs have uncovered and destroyed over 2,000 anti-personnel landmines, 176 anti-tank mines and 28,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO).

We therefore welcome the statement by the Iranian MFA spokesman on 15 October that Iran would not reject a two state solution provided it was acceptable to the Palestinians and Israelis.
