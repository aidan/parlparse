 Under the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s Food Supply contract the prime contractor, Purple Food Service Solutions, sources the majority of pig meat products from British suppliers, although bacon is currently sourced from other EU suppliers. This is because when the requirement was originally competed in accordance with EU and MOD procurement regulations British suppliers were unable to demonstrate sufficient value for money for supplying bacon.</p>

These discussions are aimed at assisting British companies to better compete for MOD food contracts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para54"><a name="10071331000023">Further information is available to both officers and businesses through the Overseas Security Information for Business service, hosted by the UKTI website. This provides UK business with country-specific information relating to the security related risks, including bribery and corruption risks, which companies face when operating overseas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para55"><a name="10071331000024"><i> Script f</i><i> or Business</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para56"><a name="10071331000025">Foreign bribery is a business risk that needs to be actively managed, like fraud or embezzlement. Corruption adds up to 10% to the total cost of doing business globally, and up to 25% to the cost of procurement contracts in developing countries. Moving business from a country with low corruption levels to a country with medium or high corruption levels is found to add costs equivalent to a 20% tax on foreign business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para57"><a name="10071331000026">There are a lot of useful, free resources available to help businesses manage this risk. For example, as part of the Government's efforts to support business integrity, the UK is funding the Business Anti-Corruption Portal, which is of particular use to Small and Medium Enterprises<sup>(1)</sup>, providing summaries of international studies and knowledge about particularly exposed markets, sectors and regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para58"><a name="10071331000027">One of the first steps in managing the risk of bribery is for a company to implement a robust anti-bribery policy through training and disciplinary procedures. A clear and consistent message from the top is the essential core of successful anti-corruption policy, backed up by a robust internal audit programme. Recent enforcement action against UK companies has demonstrated that companies need to look beyond written corporate policy, to ensure effective implementation and monitoring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para59"><a name="10071331000028">There are a number of business guides for designing and implementing an anti-corruption policy, such as Transparency International's Business Principles<sup>(2)</sup> and the International Chamber of Commerce's Rules of Conduct<sup>(3)</sup>. A number of industry sectors have also developed sector specific guides, specialist codes of practice and transparent procurement agreements<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para60"><a name="10071331000029">UK exporters and investors should also ensure that their management control systems meet international standards for anti-corruption. The Government encourages UK businesses to follow the voluntary OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises<sup>(5)</sup>, which includes specific anti-corruption guidelines. Companies should also consider additional due diligence when engaging foreign agents or operating in weak governance zones<sup>(6)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="100713w0001.htm_para61"><a name="10071331000030">The Government is aware that petty corruption and bribe solicitation remain a problem for UK exporters and overseas investors. The best defence against bribe solicitation and demands for 'facilitation payments' is good preparation and participation in local integrity pacts or other anti-corruption initiatives. There is also a growing body of specialised anti-corruption risk management for these problems, including international initiatives such as RESIST<sup>(7)</sup> (Resisting Extortion and Solicitation in International Transactions).</p>

 Magistrates courts have a national jurisdiction, but the guiding principle is that cases are heard at a magistrates court for the local justice area in which (i) the offence is alleged to have been committed or where the subject of complaint originated or (ii) the person charged with the offence resides or where the person subject of the complaint resides or has their principal place of business. Local justice areas were established by order made by the Lord Chancellor under section 8 of the Courts Act 2003.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 12 July 2010]:</i> New versions of the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) are published to support planned amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations (Conservation of fuel and power) for England and Wales. In 2006 the amendment to Part L was expected to last for five years. As SAP is frozen for the period the amendment is in force it was, therefore, necessary to set the carbon dioxide emission factor for electricity based on a projected level of decarbonisation for five years. Government's decarbonisation projections, based on an average value, were used for this purpose. The same procedure was used to determine the factor listed in SAP 2009.</p>

 There are no estimates of the effects of participation by businesses in the CRC scheme on numbers of jobs. However, by 2020 we estimate that the scheme will save participants around £1 billion per year through cost effective energy efficiency measures. This money could be used to sustain or create jobs but that will be a decision for participants. In addition the increased demand for energy efficiency advice and installation of equipment together with wider Government energy efficiency measures will stimulate opportunities the energy efficiency sector.</p>

This will give authorities more flexibility to provide additional support where needed, for example to provide rent deposits to help people to move to more affordable accommodation.

 The Department has funded the national health service sickle cell and thalassaemia screening programme since 2001 to develop and implement a linked antenatal and newborn screening programme. Both antenatal and newborn screening has now been implemented throughout England. The profile of the conditions continues to rise due to the success of the screening programme.</p>

The programme has rolled out an extensive programme to engage the public in areas with a high prevalence of sickle cell and thalassaemia. This has been evaluated and the programme is planning to continue and extend this work. It is also using its experience working with the public to develop materials to specifically engage men in the screening journey.</p>
