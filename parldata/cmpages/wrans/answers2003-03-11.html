<P>
<a name="30311w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No detailed assessment of the costs and benefits of privatising England's motorways has been made.
<P>

<a name="30311w01.html_para2">In 1999 the Next Steps Review of the Highways Agency looked briefly at the possibility of privatisation as part of the 'prior options review' that re-examined the case for Agency status. These reviews are routine. The report (published in July 1999) concluded that privatisation could only be an option for the future when a number of issues had been resolved including the identification of a secure revenue stream.

 There are currently 170 stations accredited under the Secure Stations Scheme.

<P>

<a name="30311w01.html_para3">An investigation into a general criminal act on (i)-(iv) above would normally be undertaken by the Home Office police, rather than the BTP. An investigation in to a general criminal act on (v) would normally be undertaken by the BTP if it took place on the national rail network.

 The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) decision to accept an exemption application from three South East train operators to run Mark 1 stock without an 'override preventing' safety modification was taken in light of the accelerated Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) fitment programme that was agreed between the HSE and the industry. TPWS mitigates some of the risks associated with this type of rolling stock by reducing the risk of collision caused by signals passed at danger.
<P>

<a name="30311w02.html_para0">The Strategic Rail Authority is currently discussing the delay in replacing some Mark 1 stock with the HSE, including the safety implications.

The Government has no official target regarding the uptake of ISAs in the UK. However, ISAs are intended to give plenty of scope for people to begin saving, and for those who already save to save more. Since ISAs began in April 1999, over &#163;100 billion has already been subscribed to them and within three years of their introduction an estimated 14 million individuals&#151;some one in four adults&#151;had an ISA. This is six million more than had either a TESSA or a PEP in 1998&#150;99, their last and most successful year.<P>

The Inland Revenue is currently analysing administrative data collected for compliance purposes to see if it could be used to give further detail on individual investors, including whether or not they previously held a TESSA or PEP. It is hoped that further estimates may be available later this year.<P>

 Savings provide individuals with security, independence and opportunity throughout life. A number of barriers may prevent individuals, particularly those from low and moderate-income households, from making optimal saving decisions. These include factors such as lack of trust in financial services providers, complexity of products resulting in a costly system of advice and sales regulation, lack of clear financial information and the capability to process the information. The Government's saving strategy takes these factors into account and is focused on:

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the fine imposed by the European Commission on her Department for administrative errors.  [100961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 By decision 2003/102/EC of 14 February 2003 the European Commission excluded 14.84m of UK expenditure from reimbursement by the European Community, on the grounds that it was not effected in accordance with Community rules. Of this, 14m was due to shortcomings in the operation of the beef subsidy schemes, 492,000 to shortcomings in checks on carcases accepted into public storage and 55,000 to failures to comply with payment deadlines. These sums relate mainly, but not entirely, to CAP schemes administered by the Rural Payments Agency, which is an executive agency of Defra.
<P>

<a name="30311w05.html_para0">The livestock penalties largely relate to a lack of cross checks between bovine subsidy claims and the computerised cattle registration database in the marketing year 2000&#150;01, coupled with an incomplete programme of on-farm inspections. The FMD outbreak was a factor in both cases. Automatic cross checks between the computerised cattle database and bovine subsidy claims have now been established.
<P>

<a name="30311w05.html_para1">The shortcomings in public storage relate to the acceptance for intervention storage of certain incorrectly classified carcases by Livestock and Meat Commission (LMC) inspectors in Northern Ireland in 1998. It has since been arranged that LMC inspectors liaise more closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland (DARDNI) inspectors. Unannounced on-the-spot controls by RPA technical inspectors have also been introduced, in agreement with DARDNI.
<P>

<a name="30311w05.html_para2">The remaining penalties relate to the failure to make within the regulatory deadlines some payments for maize during the marketing year 2000&#150;01 and some payments for set-aside during the marketing year

However, in the most recent report of the European Court of Auditors, relating to the calendar year 2001, the UK was the only member state to receive a net credit from disallowance decisions.

 Ashford is served by Mid Kent Water. Along with the other water supply companies, Mid Kent Water produces a water resources plan, which looks forward 25 years. The plan is updated annually by the Company, and is reviewed by the Environment Agency for consistency with the national and regional water resources strategies. The planned expansion of Ashford will be factored into this process.

 It is open to water companies to set unmeasured charges on the basis of rateable values, or to propose another basis, subject to the approval of the Director General of Water Services. The Government remain ready to discuss any proposals with those interested in devising a practicable alternative to rateable value as the basis for unmeasured charging. Any such scheme would need to address how to deal with transitional effects and how to ensure an acceptable outcome for different groups of customers, particularly vulnerable consumers. Household customers have the statutory right to opt for a measured charge if they prefer.

 In the new Cabinet Office guidance Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment, consideration of the potential dynamic benefits of higher environmental standards is required when assessing the benefits of proposed policy. The importance of considering these potential benefits was raised by Defra during the consultation period. The new guidance also states that quantifying these benefits is difficult, given the high level of uncertainty surrounding them in the future. For this reason the Department's approach in implementing the Cabinet Office guidance will focus on promoting good practice in policy making, giving particular emphasis to the importance of undertaking early informal consultation with stakeholders. This is entirely consistent with the new Cabinet Office guidance which gives increased emphasis to stakeholder consultation and to integrating into the policy process those who have an informed understanding of the potential economic benefits of a particular policy.

 Environment Agency data shows that there have been 10 incidents of water and air pollution since 1997 involving perchloroethylene. The Agency's database is only accurate from 2001.
<P>

<a name="30311w08.html_para1">All of the recorded incidents were of a minor nature, although one did attract enforcement action of a "site warning nature". None attracted fines or legal action.

<a name="30311w08.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to de-designate <i>(a)</i> starlings and <i>(b)</i> house sparrows as pests.  [99617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 all birds are protected. There is no legal definition of wild birds as pests. However, under Section 16 of the 1981 Act general licences are issued that allow the killing or taking of certain birds for the purposes of public health and air safety, conservation of wild birds and to prevent serious damage to crops. Both the starling and house sparrow are currently listed on some of these licences. Research conducted on behalf of my Department last year into the declines of both these species showed that control under the general licences has an insignificant effect upon their conservation status and their population numbers.
<P>

<a name="30311w08.html_para2">All general licences are reviewed annually and re-issued only after seeking the advice of our statutory advisor, English Nature. Officials are currently examining all the general licences, including those for killing or taking of certain birds, and will be discussing with stakeholders any relevant improvements.

The EU review programme will result in many substances being withdrawn for commercial as well as safety reasons. By the end of 2003, about 50 per cent. of the 850 substances currently used in agricultural pesticides throughout the EU will have been withdrawn because companies did not support them. The review of the outstanding supported compounds are due to be completed by 2008.<P>

 Government have not yet carried out an assessment of the potential role of biodegradable plastics bags in improving environmental protection. The Environment Agency has however been asked to include a project on impacts of replacing supermarket plastic bags with biodegradable alternatives in its 2003&#150;04 research programme.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para0">The Government support the development of biodegradable plastics from non-fossil fuel sources. The Government Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops was set up in March 2001 to provide strategic advice to Government and industry on the development of non-food uses of crops. The Forum has examined the UK potential to produce compostable packaging materials from mainstream agricultural crops and has concluded that there is a clear opportunity for both UK agriculture and industry to develop these materials. The Forum is encouraging industry to respond to this opportunity and develop products to supply an expanding market.

<P>

 No assessments have been made of the costs or benefit of plastics recycling.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para1">Our highest priority is to increase recycling and composting rates for biodegradable waste (i) to meet the Landfill Directive targets and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated when biodegradable waste is landfilled, (ii) because biodegradable waste comprises 53 per cent. by weight of the waste fraction and (iii) because at present, the economics of plastics recycling are much more difficult.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para2">We do, however, take plastics recycling seriously, and as local authorities have to meet increasingly demanding recycling targets, they will have to start tackling the more difficult waste streams, including plastics.

<a name="30311w09.html_para3">Under the 1997 Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended), obligated businesses which handle plastic must recover or recycle a designated amount of plastic each year. This has led to a substantial amount of plastic packaging waste being recycled and the quantity is expected to increase further, partly as a result of revisions to the European directive on packaging waste, which are currently being negotiated.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para4">The amount of plastic packaging waste being recovered and recycled has increased significantly in recent years from 125,539 tonnes in 1998 to 269,962 tonnes in 2001.

<a name="30311w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The agenda for sustainable consumption and production (SCP) agreed at WSSD last year is a very ambitious one, in terms of the scope of the issues to be addressed, the range of actors involved, and the range and inter-dependence of the measures that could be considered. The Government have been actively building up the knowledge base to support this agenda: in particular, substantial research and analysis has been carried out over the last three years as inputs to the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit reports on resource productivity ("Making More With Less") and waste ("Waste Not, Want Not") and the Energy White Paper published last month. The Government now plan to draw some of the main threads together in a strategy document on Sustainable Consumption and Production, to be published in the summer. My Department is co-ordinating this work, which will itself feed into the review of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy and its associated sustainable development indicators, to be completed in 2005.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para7">We will be considering what further research the Government may need to commission as part of this evolving work on a longer-term strategy. In addition, organisations outside central Government are also looking at issues connected with the SCP agenda and we shall be making full use of such material where we can.

<a name="30311w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set water companies annual leakage targets. This mechanism has achieved a significant reduction in leakage, both on the distribution network and customers' supply pipes. The Government also asked water companies to make a further commitment to reduce leakage in customers' supply pipes. As a result, all companies offer some degree of free or subsidised repair and replacement for domestic customers' supply pipes. This activity is undertaken as part of water companies' statutory duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers. Ofwat has a responsibility to enforce this duty, and annually reviews water companies' policies and activities in this area.
<P>

<a name="30311w09.html_para8">Details regarding water company activity on water efficiency, the number of supply pipes replaced and repaired annually, and the supply pipe policies can be found in the Ofwat report 'Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water 2001&#150;02', a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="30311w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set water companies annual leakage reduction targets, which cover the distribution network and customers' supply pipes. Companies submit details each year on progress with their leakage control activities, including information on supply pipe leakage. Water company leakage data is published annually by the Director General of Water Services in the 'Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water' reports, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.

<a name="30311w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All water companies offer some degree of free repair for domestic customers' supply pipes. The exact nature of the repair policy and any restrictions to that policy are dependent on the water company and its operating conditions, although many companies also offer free or subsidised supply pipe replacement. Further details of the supply pipe policy for each water company are provided in Appendix 5 of the Ofwat report 'Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water 2001&#150;02', a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

 Following the votes in both Houses last month, the Joint Committee is now considering options for the way forward. I understand they are to meet again on 25 March 2003. It will be for the Joint Committee to decide what, and when, they wish to report to both Houses. As I told the House on 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 969, I think that it would be premature to bring the matter back to the House until there is at least the makings of a majority in this Chamber for a particular way of reform.

 The Government made it clear in its November 2001 White Paper "The House of Lords: completing the reform" (Cm 5291) that it wished to consider the question of disqualification for membership of the House of Lords. Bringing the rules into line with those for the House of Commons, under which MPs convicted of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months lose their seats, was one of the options proposed. Such a change would require primary legislation, as would any change to deprive a convicted peer of his or her title.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps he took, in establishing formula spending share, to ensure that compensation for sparsity in the education formula did not benefit urban authorities with a large number of small primary schools; what proportion of the aggregate national education FSS allocation was distributed on the basis of sparsity; and if he will list the authorities which benefited from the education sparsity factor.  [101547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The issue of sparsity was addressed in three papers to the Education Formula Strategy Group. Sparsely populated authorities face higher costs as they have higher proportions of small schools than non-sparse authorities. The education formula uses sparsity as the funding factor, rather than the actual number of small schools so that authorities are compensated for the need they have, rather than the way they choose to organise their provision. Therefore urban authorities with a large number of small primary schools will not benefit from this factor. 1.8 per cent. (&#163;440 million) of Education Formula Spending for 2003&#150;04 was distributed on the basis of sparsity. The authorities that benefit are listed in order of decreasing sparsity:

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what options are available to parents of children attending schools which teach forms of sexual education that they deem inappropriate for their children to be exposed to on moral or religious grounds.  [101969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Parents should be consulted by their child's school about its sex and relationship education (SRE) policy and informed about what is taught in SRE lessons. Policies should be culturally appropriate and inclusive of all children. Consulting pupils and their families will help establish what is appropriate and acceptable to them. Where schools work within the SRE guidelines that the Department published in July 2000, and consult effectively, parents should be reassured about the content of lessons.
<P>

<a name="30311w14.html_para0">Parents do have the right to withdraw their child from some, or all, SRE lessons, but not statutory science lessons. Parents who are considering such a step should talk it through with their child and then with either the headteacher or another senior teacher at the school. The schools should provide information about the lessons being missed and ideas for other sources of support for the parent to fulfil the task of educating their child.

 The recent eruption of fighting, apparently between Liberian opposition groups and Liberian armed forces, around Toe Town in Grand Gedeh County, has seriously affected the UNHCR transit centres in Toe Town itself and in Zwedru. There are reports that the Liberian opposition groups involved are operating from within Cote d'lvoire.

On 4 March, following rumours that the town would be attacked, many people left Zwedru.

<P>
<a name="30311w14.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The vulnerability of the Iraqi people to humanitarian crisis should not be underestimated. People's private coping strategies have been worn away by years of misrule. 60 per cent. of the population are totally dependent for food on the UN Oil For Food Programme which is likely to be disrupted in the event of military action. A majority live in urban areas, with a dependence on electrically-powered water and sanitation systems which might also be disrupted, leading to a number of potential health problems. My Department is in regular discussion with the Ministry of Defence, the UN, partner Governments and other humanitarian actors about minimising the humanitarian risks of any conflict to the Iraqi people, and responding to any crises which might arise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w14.html_spnew11"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Current annual expenditures under the UN oil for food programme run at around $10 billion, the largest elements of which are the food allocation ($3 billion) and basic service delivery supplies (health, education, water and sanitation, and electricity&#151;$2 billion). In the event of military action, we will work with others to minimise disruption to the programme and re-establish it as quickly as possible. During any period in which the programme was not able to function, the responsibility to provide immediate humanitarian relief would fall to those best placed to help, and my Department has been working with the Ministry of Defence and other partners on how best this might be done. The potential scale of this task, for a population of whom 60 per cent. are dependent on the programme, is enormous. The costs involved would obviously vary depending on the length of any disruption, but the ability of the international community to meet them will be greatly enhanced if a lead role for the UN is put in place for the relief and reconstruction of Iraq following any conflict.

 Although UNHCR is providing shelter and food for many of the estimated 12,000 third country nationals in Liberia, most of whom are from Burkina Faso and Mali, it is not part of its mandate to do so. They are unable to return to their countries of origin because of the closure of the Guinean border by the Guinean authorities. UNHCR has agreed with IOM

<a name="30311w15.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Due to the serious deterioration of the security situation in Grand Gedeh County, and the movement of people in response to attacks or fear of attacks, distribution of food rations has been difficult. UNHCR has issued one month's rations to refugees and third country nationals in Zwedru transit camp. Those who are not in reach of the transit centre are almost certainly very short of adequate supplies of food. Third country nationals are prevented from leaving Liberia through Guinea to return to their countries of origin by the closure of the Guinean border by the Guinean authorities. We are keeping closely in touch with UNHCR and IOM on efforts to address this issue.

 My Department has held several discussions in recent weeks with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) at their Headquarters in Geneva and with regional representatives in Jordan, Cyprus, Kuwait and Egypt. These discussions have focused on IOM's planning for possible outflows of third country nationals from Iraq. They are preparing for a wide range of scenarios. In the event of movements of large numbers of people, IOM is likely to be the lead agency responsible for the support and transfer of up to 70,000 third country nationals from border areas or from neighbouring countries to their countries of origin, and would assist UNHCR with the movement of asylum seekers from border areas to designated camps. The largest group of third country nationals in Iraq are Egyptians, many of whom might be expected to try to leave the country through Jordan in the event of military action.

 DFID does not support any projects or programmes with the specific objective of providing pre-natal scanning technology to health facilities. At country level, DFID supports maternal health services through safe motherhood programmes, and as a part of wider health sector development. While in some circumstances improving the quality of maternal health care may include the provision of pre-natal scanning, use of such advanced technologies in most of the DFID focus countries would not be the most appropriate use of scarce resources, and therefore would not be provided.
<P>

<a name="30311w15.html_para1">My Department also funds other organisations involved in maternal health care, including the International Planned Parenthood Association (IPPF) and the United Nations Family Planning Association (UNFPA). These organisations, when appropriate, provide equipment for pre-natal scanning to the ante-natal care facilities they support in order to better diagnose and manage complications of pregnancy. Because the funding they receive from DFID is in the form of a core contribution, it is not possible to identify how much (if any) is channelled into provision of scanning equipment.

 Cleaning of Royal Navy Vessels and glass-fibre reinforced materials in Royal Navy vessels is undertaken as part of larger packages of work carried out during a vessel's regular maintenance and refit period, known as Upkeep Periods, undertaken by one of the three dockyards at Devonport, Portsmouth and Rosyth. The Ministry of Defence would not, therefore, have issued invitations to tender for cleaning direct to Farrow Systems.

 Over 11.1 million winter fuel payments have been made so far for this winter, and the vast majority of these were paid automatically before Christmas. There will of course be circumstances where, because of a variety of reasons, payment cannot be made without further inquiries. We seek to resolve these as soon as we can.

<a name="30311w19.html_para6">However, some customers reported not receiving a payment for this winter. This was promptly investigated and it was found that, because of a system fault, some further 936 people should have been considered for an automatic payment. All of these people who were entitled to a payment for this year have now been paid. We are taking steps to ensure that this does not happen for the next winter.

The latest figures, which relate to magistrates' courts, show that for all probation areas in 2001&#150;02, 79 per cent. of reports were provided within the 15-day target.

The Criminal Justice Bill contains provision for the establishment of a Sentencing Guidelines Council. The Council will be responsible for setting guidelines for the full range of criminal offences and will be established as soon as possible after the enabling legislation is enacted. It is too

 In 2002 Work Permits (UK) made decisions on 26,373 applications for work permits under the arrangements for intra-company transferees (ICTs). Of these 26,005 were approved and 368 were refused. 110 applications were refused on grounds of insufficient skills and experience, 21 on the grounds that no genuine vacancy existed, 78 on grounds of inadequate salary and 159 for other reasons.
<P>

<a name="30311w21.html_para8">All applications for work permits for ICTs are checked against the criteria of the work permit arrangements, which require that the company making the application is a UK-based employer with a direct link by common ownership with the overseas company; that both the post and the worker meet the skills, qualifications and experience requirements of the work permit arrangements; that the worker is an established employee with essential company knowledge and at least six months experience of working for the company; and that the pay and conditions of employment are equal to those that would be offered to a resident worker doing similar work.

Similarly, there was a significant increase in last year use of cannabis in England between the 1996 and 2000 British Crime Survey. From the 1996 British Crime Survey to date, there has been no significant change in the proportion of people in Wales having used cannabis in the last year.<P>

The 1998 British Crime Survey estimates that the proportion of 16 to 59 year olds using cannabis in the last year in the North West was statistically higher than in England (9.8 per cent. and 10.4 per cent. respectively).

<a name="30311w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 My noble Friend (Lord Filkin) represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in Brussels on 27&#150;28 February.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para2">The A points were approved as in document PTS A 8 (6756/03) (a copy has been placed in the Library) with the exception of point 3.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para3">The Council discussed the draft Council Decision on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection. Member states remained divided on whether refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should receive equal treatment on family unity (Article 21), access to employment (Article 24), social welfare (Article 26) and health care (Article 27). The Presidency reminded member states of the undertaking made at the Seville European Council to adopt the text by June.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para4">The Council reached a general approach on the draft Council Directive on the right to family reunification subject to consideration of the European Parliament's opinion and one parliamentary scrutiny reserve. The UK has not opted in to the adoption of this measure.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para5">The Commission set out its ideas for strengthening of the procedures for passport control at the Schengen entry points, designed to tighten existing controls on the entry of third-country nationals at Schengen borders. Two member states presented a joint paper on the future use of biometrics in visas and residence permits. Lord Filkin stressed the importance of work in this area being carried out in line with existing international standards. He also invited the Commission to examine ways of using Eurodac data to assist in identifying those who overstayed in the Schengen area.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para6">The Commission gave a short presentation of the forthcoming feasibility study on improving sea-borders control, proposing the creation of three maritime zones covering the Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para7">This was followed by an orientation debate concerning the effectiveness of financial resources available at Community level for dealing with migration issues. Lord Filkin called for appropriate budget and burden sharing mechanisms and urged the Commission to produce its report on burden sharing before June. One member state called for an increase in the Community budget to support JHA-related work on burden sharing, whilst two others argued for re-structuring of the European Refugee Fund to allow money to be used for repatriation measures.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para8">During the open debate on fighting organised crime in the Western Balkans the Presidency underlined its commitment to action in the Balkans and the need for concrete follow-up to the London Conference on organised crime in South East Europe. The Presidency also reiterated the view that responsibility for change

<P><I>11 Mar 2003 : Column 205W</I><P>
rested with Governments in the region. Lord Filkin focused on the need to move from rhetoric to action, to implement the commitments made at the London Conference and to develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor progress. He also underlined that countries in the region must co-operate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Other member states highlighted the importance of reinforcing the rule of law, the creation of stable institutions and of increased police co-operation in response to the trafficking of drugs and people through the Balkans.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para9">The Council suspended negotiations with the US on the draft Agreements between the EU and USA on Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters and on Extradition which remained subject to a reservation by one member state. The Presidency undertook to prepare documents for member states' use for the purpose of consulting their national parliaments on the proposed Agreements.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para10">The Council discussed the outstanding issues on the draft Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. There was agreement that the scope of offences in Article 1 should not include acts directed against a group of persons defined by reference to their "belief". However a recital was proposed explaining that the use of the word "religion" could include persons "defined by reference to their religious convictions or belief".
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para11">Member states remained divided on the scope of criminal liability in Article 8. Four delegations favoured the inclusion of a provision obliging member states to derogate from dual criminality for mutual legal assistance in relation to offences of racism and xenophobia if they applied the stricter test for criminal liability. The UK and five other member states opposed. Lord Filkin reiterated the need to strike a balance between effective measures on racism and xenophobia and freedom of speech; he noted that improvements to judicial co-operation arrangements should be pursued through mutual recognition initiatives.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para12">The Council discussed a list of offences for which cross-border fines would be enforced in the absence of dual criminality in the draft Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. A majority of delegations, including the UK, were content to use the list adopted for the European Arrest Warrant, adding road traffic offences and six other types of conduct. However, one member state said that the European Arrest Warrant list was unsuitable for this instrument and three others had reservations on the inclusion of specific offences.
<P>

<a name="30311w23.html_para13">The Council reached a general approach on the draft Framework Decision on attacks against information systems subject to consideration of the Recitals, the European Parliament's opinion and parliamentary scrutiny reserves from five member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what role the Audit Commission plays in <i>(a)</i> auditing custody suites and <i>(b)</i> monitoring the cost of transfer of prisoners between custody cells and Court.  [100387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w25.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The task of transferring prisoners between custody cells and the courts is carried out by private contractors on behalf of the Home Office, which pays the costs. The Audit Commission would only become involved in monitoring these costs and in the auditing of custody suites if specific concerns were discovered by the Commission's auditors during the annual risk-based planning process for each individual police authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what estimate he has made of the total operational capacity of prisons in England and Wales by 2006, based on current trends;  [101211]
<P>
<UL>(2) what extra capacity the new prisons at Ashford and Peterborough will provide the Prison Service by 2006; and if he will make a statement;  [101210]

(3) if he will make a statement on the Prison Service's Operation Container initiative.  [101217]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w25.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Operation Container was the name given to the arrangements by which Prison Service prisoners were held in police cells in the early 1990s. Operation Container is no longer in force and the Prison Service now operates the holding of Prison Service prisoners in police cells under the name Operation Safeguard. Operation Safeguard was last activated between 12 July and 20 December 2002 and at present no Prison Service prisoners are held in police cells.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para0">The two new prisons at Ashford and Peterborough will together provide 1,290 places by 2004&#150;05. It is planned that the prison at Ashford will accommodate 450 females and the prison at Peterborough is planned to have 840 places in total: of these, 480 will be for males and 360 for females.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para1">Current projections for the Prison Service anticipate a total useable operational capacity of 77,500 by 2006. This is an average figure, which is used for the purpose of planning the Prison Service estate. The Prison Service continues to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years, as part of the Government's prison modernisation strategy. This is based on a combination of expanding capacity in existing prisons that we want to keep in the long term, and a programme to build new concept large multi-functional prisons.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para2">The work of the Correctional Services Review is looking at what measures can be taken in the short term to reduce the prison population. We are committed to managing any rise in prison population through the provision of additional capacity and reform to the Criminal Justice system.

Since then the performance of the establishment has been unsatisfactory and a rectification notice has been issued requiring Premier to rectify failures to comply with contractual requirements. Premier's programme of rectification is currently being audited.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para3">The performance of Premier at its other three establishments Doncaster prison and young offender institution, Dovegate and Lowdham Grange prisons has been generally satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w25.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 2003]:</i> Private sector prisons are subject to the same assessments of their performance as that of public sector. These assessments include the following: inspections by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons; annual reports by the Independent Monitoring Boards (formerly Board of Visitors) of each prison; and regular audits made by the Prison Service on each prison in terms of compliance with Prison Service performance Targets and Standards.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para4">The Prison Service is looking to further develop its existing performance management framework as part of a performance improvement programme that will build on the success of Performance Testing. Consultations are underway and an announcement will be made shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w25.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B>

 Two-year 'un-adjusted' reconviction rates for prisoners discharged from custody are available for 1987 to 1998. These were 57 per cent. in 1987, 55 per cent. in 1988, 53 per cent. in 1989, 52 per cent. in 1990, 53 per cent. in 1991, 51 per cent. in 1992, 53 per cent. in 1993, 56 per cent. in 1994, 58 per

cent. in 1995, 57 per cent. in 1996, 58 per cent. in 1997 and 59 per cent. in 1998. These rates are published in 'Prison Statistics&#151;England and Wales 2001'.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para5">The change in rates over the years will mainly be explained by changes in the underlying demographic and criminological characteristics of the offenders sentenced to custody over this period of time. These include gender, age when sentenced, number of previous convictions, type of offence and other factors. Due to this and other reasons custodial and community penalty reconviction rates should not be directly compared.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para6">Reconviction rates for offenders discharged from custody have also been published according to the requirements of the Governments Public Service Agreement (PSA) 10 target. These are adjusted to take out convictions for offences committed prior to discharge, giving a reconviction rate of 55.3 per cent. for the first quarter of 1999. The equivalent figures for the first quarter of 1997 and 1998 are 56.8 per cent. and 55.7 per cent. respectively.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para7">Neither set of rates indicates trends in rates over time, as they make no allowance for changes in the characteristics and criminal histories of offenders given custodial sentences. To do this a predicted rate is used. Comparisons between the actual and predicted reconviction rates for 1999 show that the actual rate was 3.3 percentage points lower than predicted relative to the 1997 baseline.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para8">Reconviction rates for more recent periods are not yet available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department of those arrested for alleged terrorist offences since 11 September 2001, how many <i>(a)</i> have been charged with offences under anti-terrorism legislation, <i>(b)</i> were not charged but were handed over to immigration officials for alleged breach of rules; and how many of those not charged but handed over to immigration officials (i) have been deported and (ii) await deportation (A) in custody and (B) at liberty; how many have been detained without charge under anti-terrorism legislation; and if he will make a statement.  [99620]<P>

<P>
<a name="30311w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 335 people have been arrested in total since 11 September 2001 of whom 53 have been charged and 42 have been released into Immigration Service custody. Fifteen people have been detained under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 of whom two have left the country. Figures on deportation are published quarterly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners at Wakefield Prison have had their status reduced from enhanced to standard in the last 12 months; and how many prisoners are in each category.  [101379]<P>

(IEP) scheme at Wakefield prison in the past 12 months. The number of prisoners on each level is currently: Basic 11; Standard 357; and Enhanced 202.
<P>

<a name="30311w25.html_para9">There have been significantly higher numbers of prisoners downgraded from Enhanced to Standard IEP level across the prison estate this year. This is because of changes to the way in which incentive level reviews are now carried out. Under the revised procedures, prisoners who refuse to comply with their sentence plan and therefore to attend offending behaviour programmes, do not now progress as quickly towards enhanced status. In the case of Wakefield, prisoners not complying with their sentence would not gain as many points, under the local arrangements, towards progression to enhanced status. This has also resulted in larger numbers of this type of prisoner been downgraded from enhanced to standard.

 There were 40,888 in-country work permits issued in 2002, and a further 24,506 authorised extensions to previously issued work permits. Applications can be made in respect of overseas workers already in the UK where there has been a change of employment or a technical change of work. The Immigration Rules also make provision for students who have obtained a degree whilst studying in the UK, and postgraduate doctors, nurses and dentists who have remained in the UK after becoming qualified, to "switch" to work permit status.
<P>

<a name="30311w26.html_para0">The right hon. Member may have been misled into thinking that work permits can be issued to asylum seekers. Asylum seekers cannot apply for work permits, and are not in the categories of those allowed to "switch" into work permit status.

However, for the last two completed financial years, expenditure on immigration and asylum was &#163;81 million in 2000&#150;01 and &#163;130 million in 2001&#150;02, We estimate that at least 90 per cent. of that expenditure related to asylum matters.

 In April 1998, the Institute of Legal Executives joined the Bar Council and the Law Society as an authorised body in its own right and as a fully fledged part of the legal profession. In November 1999, the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents was similarly designated. These developments represent a small, but important, increase in the number of people

qualified to appear before the courts, widening the availability of legal services to the public. Reform of the law relating to conditional fees agreements has also allowed innovative products to be developed, which have increased the funding options available to individuals with winnable cases.
<P>

<a name="30311w26.html_para4">The Government remain keen to remove restrictive practices not in the public interest. The removal of such practices could provide an incentive for lawyers, or other providers, to introduce innovative, high quality and affordable services to the public. In most cases, open and competitive markets are the best way to ensure that consumers get the best possible service, while continuing to protect consumers and ensuring probity. The Government have consulted on matters that fall to it following on from the Office of Fair Trading's report on competition in professions. We are currently considering the responses to that consultation.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it a requirement that when local authorities draw up section 106 agreements with developers <i>(a)</i> consideration is given to any increased flooding risks caused by the developments and <i>(b)</i> developers should be obliged to meet the financial burdens caused by this flooding risk.  [101341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Planning policy guidance note (PPG) 25 "Development and flood risk" already advises that Section 106 agreements, entered into before permission is granted, may be an appropriate means of ensuring that the provision and future maintenance of any necessary flood defence or flood alleviation works required because of a development are fully funded by the developer as part of the development. It also advises that similar arrangements may be needed in respect of the maintenance and renewal of culverts or of sustainable drainage systems.
<P>

<a name="30311w27.html_para2">The primary responsibility for dealing with flooding issues lies with the landowner under common law. In particular, individual property owners are responsible 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2003 : Column 220W</I><P>
for managing the drainage of their land to prevent nuisance to neighbouring property. Where a person's actions, such as acts of development of land, cause flooding that would not have occurred otherwise then that person may be liable in negligence for damages caused. However, proving the causal link may not be straightforward and that is a matter for the courts to determine. It is, therefore, very much in the interests of developers to ensure that the sites they build on are not vulnerable to flooding and do not add to flood risk at other properties.

 Specific information on the number of homeless people without regular shelter is not held centrally.

 The March 2002 report, "More than a roof", set out the Government's approach to tackling and preventing homelessness. Specific measures included investment of &#163;125 million in 2002&#150;03 to support local authorities and the voluntary sector to support new approaches to preventing homelessness. Further support of &#163;70 million is available in 2003&#150;04. These resources will help to support the Government's commitment that by March 2004 no homeless family with children will have to live in bed and breakfast accommodation, except in an emergency, but for no longer than six weeks.

The figures cover housing annual capital guidelines (which include an element to be financed from authorities' capital receipts); the major repairs allowance; support for disabled facilities grants; the Capital Receipts Initiative; and ring-fenced support for a number of housing schemes, e.g. Cash Incentive Schemes. Estate Action scheme funding is excluded. The 



reduction in 2003&#150;04 mainly reflects a change in the local government capital finance system, which means the allocations no longer include an element assumed to be financed from authorities capital receipts.<P>

<i>[holding answer 4 March 2003]:</i> Funding for alcohol treatment services is spent via the general budgets of primary care trusts and local social service departments, which is consistent with provision being determined following a local consideration of need. This method of funding means that it is not possible to give details of the amount spent on the prevention and treatment of alcohol misuse. However, latest estimates 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2003 : Column 230W</I><P>
indicate that &#163;95 million per year is spent on alcohol treatment in England on a variety of types of treatment, and that most of this funding is provided by the Government. This estimate does not cover the cost of psychiatric in-patient treatment, which may be the first destination for people who need compulsory treatment.
<P>

<a name="30311w29.html_para2">It is absolutely not our intention significantly to increase the numbers of people who are subject to compulsion by virtue of mental disorder. The definition of mental disorder in the draft Bill, coupled with the strict conditions that must be met before compulsory powers can be used, will ensure that only people for whom compulsory treatment is necessary can receive it. There should therefore be no need to make substantial provision for additional alcohol rehabilitation services.

 The national alcohol harm reduction strategy is currently being developed by the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit, and will include an analysis of the costs that alcohol misuse incurs for the English economy. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has therefore had no recent discussions with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer which touched on the cost to the British economy from alcohol related deaths and illnesses.

 Initial survey work has been undertaken internally within the pilot scheme to obtain feedback from patients who have already received treatment under the cataract choice scheme in London.

So far for cataracts, of the 2,247 patients offered the choice of earlier treatment, 1,685 have accepted.

<i>[holding answer 7 March 2003]:</i> The Government are committed to providing national health service dentistry for all who need and seek it. We recognise, however, that there are some areas of the country, including parts of Dorset, where it is difficult to find a NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="30311w30.html_para12">I am advised that North Dorset Primary Care Trust (PCT) and South West Dorset PCT have recently formed the West Dorset dental planning group, which held its first meeting in February.

<P>

<a name="30311w30.html_para13">Osborne House, a new NHS dental practice in Yeovil, was opened in October 2002 and has recently registered 8,300 individuals within an overall capacity of 10,000. Some individuals living in the Sherborne area wishing to access NHS dental provision have been advised to register with Osborne House, which lies approximately six miles from Sherborne. Individuals within the Sherborne area who approach the Dorset Dental Helpline for routine dental treatment are currently also referred to general dental practitioners in Dorchester or Blandford Forum.
<P>

<a name="30311w30.html_para14">In the forthcoming Health and Social Care Bill, the Government proposes to legislate for far-reaching reform of NHS dental services. It is proposed that each PCT be given a duty to provide or secure the provision of primary dental services in its area to the extent that it considers reasonable to do so and be given the financial resources to do this. This will give PCTs the flexibility to address access issues in their area. Dentists who contract with a PCT will have a secure income in return for making a longer-term commitment to the NHS.

 The national health service is first and foremost for the benefit of people who live in the United Kingdom. A person who is not ordinarily resident in the UK, but who requires NHS hospital treatment is subject to the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended (in 1991 (SI No: 438), 1994 (SI No: 1535), 2000 (SI No: 602), 2000 (SI No: 909)).
<P>

<a name="30311w31.html_para1">These regulations place a duty on NHS trusts to establish the residential status of all patients. Where a NHS trust identifies a person who is not ordinarily resident in the UK and is not otherwise exempt from charge then the regulations provide for the making and recovery of a charge by the trust for most types of hospital treatment.

 The Department has not issued specific guidelines on the use of national health service Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners on animals, but the local rules of any MRI unit would ensure that scanning of animals did not contravene either health and safety or infection control policies.
<P>

<a name="30311w32.html_para2">The Medical Devices Agency publication, "Guidelines for Magnetic Resonance Equipment in Clinical Use (Dec-02)", is available to all NHS hospitals and these guidelines cover important aspects of MRI equipment in clinical use, with specific reference to safety.

 Data on the number of interpreters used by the National Health Service to assist staff working with patients is collected as part of the broader clerical and administrative function, which includes several other staff groups. As a result, it is not possible to identify the number of interpreters separately.

<a name="30311w33.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Pharmacists</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w33.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are being taken to increase the number of people becoming qualified and taking up pharmacist roles.  [101667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30311w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There were 258 or 15 per cent. more undergraduate students starting pharmacy training in 2001 than there were in 1997. Furthermore, new schools of pharmacy will provide additional graduates from 2007 onwards.
<P>

<a name="30311w33.html_para0">Between September 1997 and 2001, there has been an increase of 2,140 or 26 per cent. in the number of qualified pharmacists employed in the national health service. As at 30 September 2001 there were 10,630 qualified pharmacists employed in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30311w33.html_para1">The Government are looking to achieve an increase in staff numbers across all scientific, therapeutic and technical staff groups, including hospital pharmacists. Delivering the NHS Plan published in April 2002 set out the Government's latest forecast for growth. By 2008, we expect the NHS to have net increase over the September 2001 staff census of at least 30,000 therapists and scientists. This includes pharmacists. This will include increasing the number of preregistration pharmacy training places in NHS hospitals. Over 550 were planned for 2002&#150;03&#151;at least 60 per cent. more than were available 10 years ago.
<P>

<a name="30311w33.html_para2">The Department of Health published a Pharmacy Workforce and Training Working Group Report in 1997. It outlined the actions necessary for the NHS to increase training places, to review skill mix and working practices, to reduce demand, and to improve the recruitment and retention of pharmacy staff. Many local initiatives have been taken as a result. Following this up, the Department has taken a number of actions to help improve the recruitment and retention of hospital pharmacy staff. These include the publication of the Improving Working Lives for Pharmacy document in July 2001, extension of NHS Careers to pharmacy staff, the development of a hospital pharmacists1 recruitment advertisement and targeted higher than average pay rises.
<P>

<a name="30311w33.html_para3">Community pharmacy employers have also taken action. Some pharmacy multiples have taken pro-active steps to increase staffing, eg recruiting pharmacists from abroad and by moving staff around.

The system will be rolled out across the NHS from summer 2003. This will, in time, enable us to understand the true nature and extent of medical errors in the NHS and take action to prevent them being repeated. The reporting system will be anonymous and confidential in order to encourage local reporting and thereby enable the NHS to learn as much as possible to make systems safer. It will not therefore identify the number of incidents occurring in an individual hospital.

One of the greatest performance challenges of the National Health Service is to improve the speed at which patients can gain access to orthopaedic services. We are addressing long waits for orthopaedics through the NHS Modernisation Agency's Action On Orthopaedic programme. The programme aims to significantly improve this access to care by working with local health communities, developing and sharing good practice.<P>

The Gloucester Hospitals Orthopaedic Departments are one of 37 trusts in the NHS Modernisation Agency's Programme, "Clinical Priorities&#151;First And Fast", within which trusts are redesigning their systems so that all clinically urgent cases are admitted within six weeks and all others are admitted ahead of the Governments target. The programme has just started and is intended to run until next spring.<P>
