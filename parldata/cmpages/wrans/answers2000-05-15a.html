To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the published and pre-reviewed studies that the Government have assessed to date on the safety of GM crops.  [117029]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There are hundreds of published and peer-reviewed scientific papers and studies that inform the safety assessments of GM crops. It is not possible to list them all here but some examples considered recently by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) are as follows. This body of knowledge on GM crops which is contained in the scientific literature is brought to bear on risk assessment not only through the individual experts on Government advisory committees, such as ACRE, but also via the Government's own scientists and Non-Governmental Organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he took to notify district and parish councils about the GM crop trials in <i>(a)</i> St. Osyth and <i>(b)</i> Wivenhoe in Essex. [121276]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> Information about the Farm Scale Evaluations of GM crops is widely available. I announced the programme on 17 March and wrote to the hon. Member and other MPs with constituencies in England, outlining the aims and nature of the research.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para7">A full list of proposed site locations is available on my Department's website, along with more detailed information about the programme and GM crops in general. The Cabinet Office website also contains further information.




<P>
<P><I>15 May 2000 : Column: 2W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para8">My Department has organised a series of regional meetings, to which district and local councillors in areas where GM crop trials are proposed have been invited. There is also a DETR leaflet, "GM Crops--Take a Closer Look", which is on the website and available at public meetings.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para9">The proposed trial of oil seed rape at St. Osyth (which is now not going ahead) was advertised locally by Aventis. Officials from my Department wrote to the local parish and district councillors to invite them to attend a public meeting in Ipswich on 13 April and I understand that several councillors were able to attend.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para10">The proposed trial of GM maize at Wivenhoe has not been advertised locally, because the crop involved has a European Part C marketing consent which means that it can be grown in the UK without my Department being notified. However, the biotechnology industry has agreed that this crop should be grown in the Farm Scale Evaluations and have agreed to provide my Department with the grid references of the fields involved. Details are on the DETR website.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received from Herefordshire about the siting of the GM trial sites in Kempley, Gloucestershire, and Preston Wynne, Herefordshire; and if he will make a statement.  [122039]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Following notification of the proposed Farm Scale Evaluation of oil seed rape at Kempley, Gloucestershire, my Department has received 18 letters from those objecting to, and seeking further information about, the Evaluations programme.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para11">My Department was told about the GM maize at Preston Wynne on 26 April, at which time details were placed on the Department's website. To date, no letters have specifically referred to this field site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in each of the last five years, how many times the Health and Safety Executive has investigated hygiene and food safety standards in hospitals through <i>(a)</i> spot checks, <i>(b)</i> pre-arranged inspections and <i>(c)</i> legal action for the enforcement of standards.  [120990]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive has not, in any of the last five years, investigated any hygiene and food safety standards in hospitals.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para12">These matters are properly the responsibility of Environmental Health Officers employed by local authorities for the districts in which the premises are located.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the cost to his Department of converting air conditioning and refrigeration equipment from using HFC refrigerants to using <i>(a)</i> hydrocarbons and <i>(b)</i> ammonia. [120427]

<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> My Department's local property managers are asked to assess the practicality and cost-effectiveness of such measures in drawing up plans to reduce the environmental impact of our estate.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para13">Estimating the costs of converting from HFC refrigerants, consistent with the draft UK programme on climate change, requires studies by appropriate specialists to determine on a case by case basis the practical and economic options. These studies address the size and costs of replacement plant and associated works as well as the cost of replacement refrigerants.

<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has for improving the management of programmes for disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  [121453]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government's plans for the future management of regeneration programmes, targeted at deprived neighbourhoods, will take account of the recommendations in the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (the framework document of which was published for consultation on 12 April) and the Urban and Rural White Papers (scheduled for publication later in the year). The National Strategy framework document proposes a significant number of recommendations for overcoming the problems of deprived areas, including ideas for improving the way regeneration, and other, programmes are managed and delivered centrally and regionally.

<a name="00515w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to make the installation on buses of safety equipment designed to alert drivers to faults in bus wheels mandatory.  [121491]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Faults in wheels of commercial vehicles and buses are identified during normal maintenance checks depending on a particular operator's maintenance schedule. My Department's Guide to Maintaining Roadworthiness, which is issued to all vehicle operators, emphasises the need for a daily "walk round" check by the driver. My Department is aware of several proprietary devices intended to give a visual indication of loosening of wheel retaining nuts, which could assist the driver in this check, but there are not any plans to introduce these as a mandatory requirement. Certain wheel faults such as cracks or excessive wear are only apparent on close inspection which is not normally expected to be within the competence of the driver.

<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A survey carried out in early 1998 showed that at least 200 organisations (excluding local authorities) were implementing plans. The provisional Local

<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pollard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent research he has undertaken on the impact of upward-only rent reviews on town centre property markets.  [121483]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning published a research report on 19 April about the impact of the property industry's Code of Practice on Commercial Property Leases. This considered, among other things, the extent of upward-only review clauses in the property market generally. The research did not look specifically at town centre property markets.
<P>

<a name="00515w01.html_para14">The study, by the University of Reading, found that upward-only rent review clauses still predominate in longer leases. We have asked the property market and professions to consider how the market could best promote alternatives to upward-only rent review clauses. We recognise that landlords may seek a higher initial rent to offset the greater risk of letting without such a clause. It will therefore be important for market promotion to draw the tenant's attention to the offsetting advantages of renting without an upward-only provision, as well as to any higher rent.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There have been six separate representations on this matter. In addition to the reply that the then Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) sent the hon. Member on 19 August 1998 in response to representations on this issue, one further representation was received from Winchester City Council in September 1999. Representations were made by three local members of the public between April and June 1999. More recently, representations have been received from one further member of the public.

 <i>[holding answer 12 May 2000]:</i> The Computers for Teachers Initiative was launched on 12 January 2000. Due to high teacher take-up, the first phase of the scheme was closed on 30 April, with a deadline for receipt of applications of 5 June. Some 17,000 applications have been received, with over 2,200 teachers already having received their subsidies. The Department has put in place a range of measures to answer teachers' inquiries, including the recruitment of extra staff, opening further telephone lines and arranging a dedicated Computers for Teachers e-mail address.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment for what reason changes were made to the calculations for parental income in assessing liability for student support contributions whereby MIRAS relief was disapplied in 2000-01; and for what reason life assurance premiums were similarly disapplied. [121339]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 May 2000]:</i> The removal of the disregard of parental income in student support for mortgage interest that attracts tax relief follows the wider Government decision to abolish tax relief for mortgage payments from April 2000. The abolition of MIRAS has been public for some time and the families of students entering higher education this year will be well aware of it. We will ensure that the families of students already in higher education are not asked to pay any more as a result of the abolition of MIRAS in the 2000-01 academic year. From the 2001-02 academic year, we are raising the contribution threshold from &#163;17,805 to &#163;20,000, as announced by the Secretary of State on 25 January. This increase is well above the rate of inflation and will benefit both mortgage payers and those who do not have mortgages.
<P>

<a name="00515w02.html_para1">The Government keep the student support system under review to ensure that support is targeted at those students who need it most. The disregard for life assurance premiums which attract tax relief has been removed because it gave a limited group of parents with certain life assurance policies a double benefit of tax relief on payments and a disregard from their income in determining their contribution to their children's support.

 The shooting of certain 'pest' bird species is permitted under the terms of general licences issued by MAFF and DETR under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The general licences allow authorised persons, such as the landowner or occupier, or a person acting with the owner or occupier's permission, to kill or take certain bird species. This control is permitted for the purposes of preventing damage to agriculture (licensed by MAFF) and to preserve public health or public or air safety (licensed by DETR) and does not cover sporting events.
<P>

<a name="00515w03.html_para4">The populations of the species concerned are monitored and there is no evidence that their conservation status is currently threatened by any of these control measures.

It is the nature of the work proposed in relation to the cost/benefit assessment, rather than the source of funding, which is the key consideration in deciding whether a project should be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

 Food Aid is the responsibility of the EC's DG-Development rather than ECHO. The EC pledged some 150,000 metric tonnes (MT) of food aid in 1999 and delivered about 190,000MT. EU pledges against Government of Ethiopia Emergency appeals are effectively multi-annual. Food pledges one year may not be delivered in the same year. The process is in effect a rolling programme of support with food from the year before filling gaps in the food pipeline. We do not have details of where the food was distributed.

 Food aid is the responsibility of the EC's DG-Development rather than ECHO. The EC has committed 432,526 metric tonnes (MT) of food aid this year. A further 110,000MT will be provided by July 2001. Britain contributes 17 per cent. of the cost. Two shipments carrying 46,500MT of cereals have arrived. We do not have details of where the food was distributed.

<P>
<a name="00515w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We recognise the importance of updating the legislation governing discipline in the armed forces. It has been the intention for some time to consolidate the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957. We have been taking stock of the consolidation in the light of the changes to the present legislation made by the Armed Forces Discipline Bill and the likelihood of further changes in the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill in the next Session.
<P>

<a name="00515w05.html_para0">A further consideration is the Government's intention, indicated in the Strategic Defence Review, to replace the three present Acts with a single tri-Service Act. It is planned that the substantive development of this important project should get under way as soon as the quinquennial Bill is enacted and that, when the work is complete, the resulting legislation should be introduced when the parliamentary timetable allows. As a consequence, legislation consolidating the present Acts would be likely to have an effective life of only a few years.
<P>

<a name="00515w05.html_para1">We have therefore concluded that the most sensible approach would be to subsume consolidation within the development of the tri-Service Act, the purpose of which will be to provide legislation that better meets the requirements of the three Services in an increasingly joint environment.

 The review of South Staffordshire health services commenced in July 1999 and has involved the health authority, National Health Service trusts, primary care groups and social services serving the health community. To date the review has spent &#163;65,000 on specialist advice and consultants support and an additional &#163;8,000 in respect of materials and publications to keep staff and the public informed (these costs exclude normal staff and professional time). It is anticipated that expenditure for the assessment and recommendation phases will not exceed &#163;100,000.

 <i>[holding answer 11 May 2000]:</i> Our White Paper, "Modernising Social Services", recognised that the scale of variation in discretionary charges for non-residential care is unacceptable.

<P>
<a name="00515w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 May 2000]:</i> The Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) for personal social services comprises four elements: SSAs for children's services, residential care services for older people, non-residential care services for older people, and services for adults aged 18 to 64 years.
<P>

<a name="00515w06.html_para0">The SSA formula for residential services for older people includes an estimate of the actual amount of income collected. The SSA formula for non-residential services for older people reflects differences in the potential to raise charge income in different councils.

The Department does not set targets for recoupment rates, nor make assumptions regarding the monetary value of cost recoupment.

 Respite care is already available for families with disabled children. Availability of respite care is being boosted by two important Government initiatives. First, the Carers National Strategy, which gives a strong commitment to improving services and support for all carers, including parent carers of disabled children. The Carers Grant in 2000-01 includes &#163;10 million for services for families with disabled children.

 Civil nuclear material at UK reprocessing facilities became subject to the safeguards provisions of the Euratom Treaty on 1 January 1973. Such material became subject to the terms of the United Kingdom's safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Euratom (INFCIRC/263) when that agreement entered force on 14 August 1978. All reprocessing in the UK since March 1996 has been performed under Euratom safeguards and been liable to inspection by the IAEA under the terms of the INFCIRC/263 agreement.

 The number of jobs lost within UK companies in the targeted sectors will depend on a number of factors, including the length of time that the retaliatory measures remain in place, and the ability of affected companies to find alternative customers for their goods.

 In 1998, the Government worked with Ofgem in introducing a licence condition governing the sales and marketing practices of gas and electricity suppliers. Under the condition, suppliers are, among other things, required to make all reasonable efforts to confirm that individual customers wish to proceed with a change of supplier. Ofgem recently renewed the condition for a further two years, and is currently consulting on enhancing it by requiring suppliers to have effective management of their sales agents; ensuring that gas, as

well as electricity, suppliers provide customers with copies of the terms and conditions of contracts entered into over the telephone; extending coverage of the condition to sales undertaken in public places and to certain sales over the internet; and requiring suppliers to take steps to ensure that the customer understands that he has entered into a contract.
<P>

<a name="00515w08.html_para0">The Government support these proposals to give additional protection to consumers. The Utilities Bill currently before Parliament would allow Ofgem to impose financial penalties for breaching the licence condition, including infringements relating to involuntary transfer.

<P>
<a name="00515w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 One of the Government's main objectives is to encourage people to save more for their retirement where they can afford to do so, while at the same time providing extra State support for those who cannot save.
<P>

<a name="00515w10.html_para3">We are introducing new stakeholder pensions and reforming SERPS through the State Second Pension. These reforms will mean that, in future, people with a lifetime of working behind them will get a large enough pension to take them above the MIG, even if they have been on low earnings throughout their life. However, it takes time to build up pension entitlements, so for many, particularly those who have already retired or who are close to retirement age, these reforms come too late. That is why we introduced the MIG to make sure that the poorest pensioners are guaranteed a basic decent income in retirement, even before stakeholder pensions and the Second State Pension mature.
<P>

<a name="00515w10.html_para4">We recently announced an increase in the MIG capital limits to make sure that people with relatively modest savings do not lose out. We want to do more to encourage savers. In the last Budget, the Chancellor announced that we propose to consult on a new Pensioner Credit which will do just that.

 Heads of State and Government agreed at the Lisbon Special Summit in March that social protection systems should be adapted as part of an active welfare state to ensure that work pays, and that they should be sustainable in the long-term in the face of an ageing population. It was agreed at the Summit that the High Level Working Party on social protection, of which the Commission is a member along with representatives from all member states, should arrange a study on the future long-term evolution of social protection, with particular attention on pensions. The Commission has indicated it will produce a new Communication on modernising social protection, concentrating on pensions, later this year. The High Level Working Party is due to produce a progress report on social protection by December at the Nice summit; and a more substantial report for the Spring Council 2001.

<P>

<a name="00515w12.html_para10">

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about compensation payments paid by the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
In common with other DSS Agencies, the CSA operates a discretionary "special payments" scheme to compensate customers for actual financial losses, or any suffering and distress caused in cases of maladministration. For CSA these arrangements cover maintenance lost to a parent with care (PWC), as well as expenses incurred by PWCs or non-resident parents (NRPs) in dealing with the Agency. It is also possible to make consolatory payments in recognition of the less tangible effects of maladministration, such as inconvenience, embarrassment and the worry and distress that can result from delay and errors.
<BR>
The largest individual amount of compensation paid was &#163;27,393.60. This figure did not include any consolatory element but represented monies due to a parent with care, which would have been paid by the non-resident parent, had it not been for the Agency's maladministration. It also included a payment for loss of use of monies (interest). Each case is considered on its own merits and payments of this magnitude are particularly exceptional. The average payment during 1998/99 was &#163;795.
<BR>
The largest individual consolatory payment is &#163;1,150, however, on average this type of payment is around &#163;133.
<BR>
Since its inception, the Agency has made compensation payments to a value of &#163;8.6 million (figure to end February 2000). During 1998/99 the Agency paid out &#163;4.3 million in compensation payments. Evidence this year shows that this amount is falling. From April 1999 to the end of February 2000 the Agency had paid out &#163;2.4 million for the 1999/2000 financial year. The main reason why this figure was so high in recent years is that the Agency has been clearing the backlog of cases that had built up during the early years of its operations. As the Agency is now more up to date with its work, payments of this scale are unlikely to recur.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w13.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many representations he has received from hon. Members with regard to constituents who had been awarded disability benefit for life but have subsequently had it withdrawn or downgraded; and if he will make a statement.  [121927]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Prior to 12 January 2000 the legislation that applied to Disability Living Allowance (DLA) allowed awards to be made for life or for a limited period. Although some awards were therefore given "for life", this terminology was misleading because the law has always allowed for awards of DLA to be altered where, for example:
<P>

<a name="00515w13.html_para0">

<BR>
(a) a person's care or mobility needs had increased or reduced;
<BR>
(b) there had either been a mistake, or ignorance regarding the relevant facts; or
<BR>
(c) there had been an error of law.
<BR>


<P>

<a name="00515w13.html_para1">These rules are the same as those that apply to changes of almost all Social Security benefits. However the "life award" terminology in DLA was in this respect anomalous and created uncertainty. As a result, many representations were received from hon. Members on behalf of constituents who had been given life awards which were subsequently withdrawn or downgraded.
<P>

<a name="00515w13.html_para2">To help clarify the nature of these awards, references to awards made for life were removed from the legislation by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, and replaced with the words "indefinite award". 



<P>
<P><I>15 May 2000 : Column: 43W</I><P>
This made the language used consistent with that which applies to other benefits. This change was welcomed by the Social Security Select Committee in its third report of the 1998-99 session.
<P>

<a name="00515w13.html_para3">Although the terminology has been changed to help clarify the situation, indefinite awards are made in the same circumstances in which a life award would previously be made. The rules that apply when an indefinite award is altered are the same that applied to life awards.

 Authority for payment of UK contributions to the EU is contained in the EC (Finance) Act 1995. Contributions are calculated in accordance with the Decision of the Council of the European Communities on the system of the Communities' Own Resources (31 October 1994). Further information on the Own Resources system can be found at Section E: Community Revenue of the White Paper European Community Finances (Cm 4382).

 None. There has been an 80 per cent. drop in the use and acceptance of eurocheques in the 1990s. This has been matched by significant growth in the use of alternative methods--automated teller machines, debit cards and credit cards--of making payments and obtaining cash abroad. The Association for Payment Clearing Services, the industry body for the UK's banks and building societies which oversees money transmission systems, have advised that the majority of UK banks are able to offer cost effective alternatives to eurocheques.

<a name="00515w15.html_para33">The Government have made it clear that some agreed safeguards would be necessary in order to protect civil rights; for example for any changes to extradition arrangements between member states. The need for common minimum standards, respecting the fundamental legal principles of member states, was also recognised at Tampere.

 In March 1999, I published an Action Plan detailing the Government's response to all 70 recommendations of Sir William Macpherson's Report on

the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. Details of progress on these recommendations can be found in my First Annual Report on Progress on this Action Plan, published in February this year, a copy of which is in the Library. None of the recommendations of the report were specific to particular ethnic or cultural groups, and the action taken has accordingly been targeted equally at all minority ethnic communities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what mechanism he has established to collect data concerning human rights abuses documented against Roma, by country; how many Roma <i>(a)</i> sought asylum in the United Kingdom, by country of origin and <i>(b)</i> had their asylum claims (i) upheld and (ii) denied in the United Kingdom in the last five years.  [121519]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Country Information and Policy Unit in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate obtains from a wide variety of sources information on issues which are raised in the asylum process, including the question of human rights abuses against Roma. Country assessments based on this information are published on the top 35 asylum-producing countries. The assessments are revised and updated every six months.
<P>

<a name="00515w15.html_para34">The majority of Roma asylum seekers in the United Kingdom come from the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. During the period January 1995 to January 1999, there were 2,600 asylum applications from nationals of the Czech Republic. 6,110 asylum applications were received from nationals of Poland and 1,250 received from Slovakia. A visa regime was introduced on 8 October 1998 in respect of Slovakia. During the period January 1995 to May 1999, 490 Czech and 910 Slovak asylum applications were refused. There were no grants of asylum during this period. During the same period 3,355 Polish asylum applications were refused. One or two Polish applicants were granted asylum in each of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 although our information does not show on what basis asylum was granted. It is not possible to give decisions with a nationality breakdown after May 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 4 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 209W, on the Schengen Information System, what part that system can play in the fight against crime, fraud and drug trafficking in the European Union; and what constraints exist in the use of this system by member states not within the Schengen arrangements.  [121639]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00515w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Schengen Information System exists to support the substantive provisions of the Schengen Implementing Convention, which include police and judicial co-operation between participating member states.
<P>

<a name="00515w15.html_para35">Only those member states which have acceded to the Schengen acquis have access to the Schengen Information System. In accordance with separate arrangements with the European Union member states, Norway and Iceland are also associated with Schengen co-operation, including access to the Schengen Information System.

<P>
<a name="00515w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 To meet section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, any application to use protected animals in research must be subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work.
<P>

<a name="00515w16.html_para1">Section 24 of the Act currently prohibits the release of an application and the cost/benefit assessment. The status of the inspectors' advice to Ministers, on the basis of the cost/benefit assessment, is being examined as part of our review of section 24 and freedom of information. An electronic database of precedents and key cases is maintained by the Inspectorate for internal reference. This comprises material that has been provided in confidence and its status will also be considered as part of our review.

We have no reason to believe they were not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.

I further understand that the Coldstream Guards and possibly some other English regiments normally celebrate the Day, at the expense of regimental funds rather than the defence budget.

<a name="00515w18.html_para4">The Government have made available &#163;20 million in 2000-01 and &#163;40 million 2001-02 under the Comprehensive Spending Review to fund Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs). Most of this money is being channelled through probation services, ring-fenced for the purpose, and each area has been advised of its allocation. Services have been instructed to prepare for roll out of the order subject to the final evaluation, and their preparations are well under way.
<P>

<a name="00515w18.html_para5">We have indicated to probation services that, subject to satisfactory evaluation, the roll out should commence in October 2000. Although the final evaluation is not yet to hand, it is clear that the overall impact of DTTOs in the pilot areas has been very positive: both offending and expenditure on illegal drugs by those subject to the order has reduced markedly. In order to allow both probation services and their partner treatment agencies the maximum time to prepare with certainty, we have decided that, as we are confident as to the outcome of the final evaluation, we should make an early decision on national roll out. The Government have, therefore, decided that the order will be rolled out to all areas in England and Wales with effect from 1 October 2000.
