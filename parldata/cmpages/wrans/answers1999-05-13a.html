To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what performance targets have been set for 1999-2000 for the Northern Ireland Health and Social Services Estates Agency.  [84333]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The targets, which have been set for 1999-2000, are based on the corporate aims and objectives of the Agency as set out in section 5 of its Corporate and Business Plan and reflect in part a refinement of the previously set targets. The targets are in line with the Government's policy of seeking to improve the service provided to clients in terms of both quality and value for money and I am satisfied that they present a demanding challenge for the Agency. A copy of the Corporate and Business plan will be placed in the Library.
<P>

 Mr. Rowe's Report is being published today and copies are being placed in the Library. I note that Mr. Rowe recommends that the legislation be renewed.
<P>

<a name="90513w01.htm_para2">The UK's counter terrorism legislation is currently under review. The Government intend to bring forward, as soon as possible, new UK-wide legislation to replace the existing temporary provisions.
<P>

<a name="90513w01.htm_para3">In December last year, the Government published a consultation paper entitled, "Legislation Against Terrorism". Around eighty responses have been received. The process of examining each contribution and preparing the Government's legislative response is well underway. The Government have made clear that during the period the new legislation is being prepared it will not leave the people of Northern Ireland without the protection of necessary counter-terrorism measures. For that reason I propose to continue the EPA in force for a temporary period and I shall lay before the House as soon as possible a draft Order for consideration which would have that effect.
<P>

<a name="90513w01.htm_para4">The Government are committed to steadily transforming the security environment in Northern Ireland and achieving complete normalisation as part of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole. In such circumstances, the Government's position is that there will be no need for any temporary Northern Ireland specific powers. The Government will make a judgment about that nearer the time the new UK-wide legislation is introduced.

<P>

<a name="90513w01.htm_para7">I am placing a copy of the Report in the Library today. Work will continue on a revised Framework Document and this will become a matter for the devolved administration in Northern Ireland to approve in due course.

 Lord Whitty announced on 23 March 1999 the start dates for the programme of multimodal and roads based studies. The West Midlands to North West Conurbation Study will begin in Summer 1999. Consultation with the Regional Planning Conferences in both the West Midlands and the North West will start before then, initially on the preparation of the consultants' brief, and will continue throughout the life of the study. As part of the multimodal study, consultants will develop a full range of options to tackle the traffic problems of the corridor, including the possibility of modal shift.

<a name="90513w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The sudden upsurge in media and public interest in genetic modification technology earlier this year resulted in a very substantial increase in the volume of Ministerial correspondence, Parliamentary Questions and correspondence from members of the public needing to be handled by officials. My officials have also been required to handle significantly increased levels of briefing resulting from several Select Committee appearances and the general increase in Ministerial activity in this area. This increased level of activity coupled with the need to provide full and considered replies to the large number of sometimes detailed and complex Parliamentary Questions tabled has inevitably resulted in some increase in response time, which I regret.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he plans to put in place to ensure that local authority transport schemes which currently exceed the proposed minimum standard of half price concessionary bus fares for older people do not reduce their benefits to older people when the proposed national scheme is implemented.  [83845]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Beyond the terms of our national standard minimum for concessionary travel schemes for elderly people, local authorities will continue to have full discretion to decide on the terms of their concessionary travel schemes. Local authorities will therefore remain entirely free to provide concessionary fare schemes which are more generous than our proposed statutory minimum. We believe that it is right to maintain the principle that locally elected authorities should consider these matters in the light of local needs and circumstances and their overall financial priorities, and to be locally accountable for the decisions then made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B>

There is little statistical information at this stage to support any conclusions as to the extent to which this results from a reduction in the amount of waste generated as opposed to being diverted to different outlets.

 Section 3 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 makes provision for the appointment of auditors by the Audit Commission. There is no prescribed maximum period, but it is the commission's general policy, in accordance with good professional practice, to change a council's auditor at least once every seven years. The Audit Commission may terminate an appointment where the auditor fails to comply with the statutory Code of Audit Practice, or other statutory obligations. Where an auditor is not a Commission employee, section 3(8) provides for the appointment to be on such terms and for such period as the Commission may determine. Such terms include the personal fees payable by the commission to the individual auditor or the firm of individuals.

(5) Mature entrants are defined as students in their first year of study aged 25 and over on postgraduate courses and aged 21 and over on undergraduate courses. The numbers cover home and overseas domiciled students and are taken from HESA December Student Record datasets.<P>

<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

Comparisons between 1997-98 and 1998-99 are affected by a change in the basis for identifying first year students used by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Adjusting for this change gives a growth rate of -4 per cent. in full-time entrants (rather than -1 per cent. suggested by the unadjusted numbers) and +5 per cent. in part-time (rather than +8 per cent. suggested by the unadjusted numbers).<P>

The figures show that the numbers of mature students have increased since the introduction of tuition fees. The tendency for more mature students to opt for part-time rather than full-time study began before tuition fees were introduced for all categories of student and has continued since.<P>

 I have now received from my Permanent Secretary the report of the independent investigation into the leak, carried out following longstanding practice by a member of the panel maintained by the Cabinet Office. The summary findings of the report are as follows:




<P>
<P><I>13 May 1999 : Column: 188</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90513w04.htm_para2">Information deriving from the draft report of the Judicial Inquiry was leaked to the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 21 February. The most likely route for the leak was not the draft Report itself but a summary of its findings and associated commentary which were internal to Government. The leak is not, therefore, thought to have come from the Inquiry team or from the printers.
<P>

<a name="90513w04.htm_para3">Appropriate security arrangements were instituted by the Home Office to control tightly the handling of the draft Report and related papers. They excluded advance briefing of the media. The handling procedures and the restriction on briefing of the media were observed. All copies of the relevant papers were accounted for. No-one was found who had had unauthorised access to the material. Despite intensive investigation, it has not been possible to establish who deliberately leaked the story to the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>.
<P>

<a name="90513w04.htm_para4">I regret that it has not been possible to trace the originator of this deplorable leak. I had access myself to the papers, and I have already given in my Statement to the House on 22 February 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 21-34, my personal word that I was not responsible. The only other Minister with relevant access was my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) who has asked me to relay to the House a similar absolute assurance which he has given me and which I fully accept. The number of officials and advisers who also had access to the relevant papers is small, and I do not intend therefore, to publish their names which would only serve to throw suspicion unfairly on them as a group when there is no evidence that identifies any individual as responsible.

The figures do not include policing of the bomb scenes themselves.

<a name="90513w04.htm_para5">These policing operations were of the character for which the funding of the Metropolitan Police already provides.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Lay visiting to police stations is a non-statutory function which is the responsibility of police authorities. The National Association for Lay Visiting (NALV) is an independent voluntary organisation which works to support and promote lay visiting to police stations. The Home Office has issued guidance to police authorities on the operation of lay visiting schemes.




<P>
<P><I>13 May 1999 : Column: 190</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para2">This guidance states that visitors should be independent persons of good character, able to make informed judgments which the community and the police will accept, and that as far as possible they should be representative of the community in terms of age, gender, race and so on.
<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para3">The Home Office guidance makes no reference to any age limits for the appointment of lay visitors. However, the separate guidance issued for the Metropolitan Police area currently states that persons who are under the age of eighteen or over the age of seventy will not normally be appointed. This guidance is shortly to be reviewed and the upper age limit likely to be removed.
<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para4">Although the guidance for police authorities outside London does not mention age limits, it suggests that lay visitors should be appointed for a fixed term. The reason for this is the desirability of lay visitors not becoming too closely associated or over familiar with their local police stations. On the other hand, it is necessary to take into account the need for lay visitors to gain sufficient experience to make an effective contribution. By way of example, the guidance mentions that in London, lay visitors are appointed for a three-year term of office, with the possibility of renewal for a further final three-year term.
<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para5">The implementation and interpretation of guidance issued by the Home Office is a matter for individual police authorities. In practice, it has been recognised from the earliest days of lay visiting that individual schemes must evolve to suit local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para6">There have been no recent discussions between the Home Office, NALV and police authorities regarding lay visiting, but the Home Office shortly expects to discuss with NALV the recommendations arising from research commissioned by the Home Office on lay visiting. The Home Office will then consider the issue of fresh guidance to police authorities. The research report has already been copied to police authorities.
<P>

<a name="90513w05.htm_para7">The Home Office has become aware of proposed changes to the lay visiting scheme operated by the West Midlands Police Authority through correspondence from Members of Parliament.

I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question about live firing experiments using animals. My reply refers to the arrangements at DERA as we undertake, on behalf of MOD, the majority of work involving the use of animals.




<P>
<P><I>13 May 1999 : Column: 191</I><P>

<BR>
DERA, or one of its predecessors, has conducted research into the prevention and treatment of physical injuries certainly since the mid 1970s. Over the course of the last year live firing experiments using anaesthetised animals were carried out in the UK involving UK personnel during May, June, July, September and November 1998 and February 1999.
<BR>
Recent areas of research include:
<BR>
the use of anaesthetised pigs to develop enhanced blast protection for military personnel and to validate physical and computer models of chest injury from blast waves.
<BR>
work on anaesthetised rats to determine the pathophysiology of abdominal and thoracic injury from blast waves and the development of treatment strategies for injured military personnel.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 1999]:</i> I meet my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on a regular basis to discuss a range of issues including the Assisted Areas Map.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w06.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Kemp: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the outcome of the recent Ministerial Council of the European Space Agency.  [84387]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w06.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My noble Friend the Minister for Science and Space was invited to chair the Ministerial meeting held in Brussels. At the meeting the UK led its partners in the European Space Agency (ESA) to embark on a new &#163;400 million programme of environmental research. The "Living Planet" programme will help scientists to understand and predict the Earth's environment and humankind's effects upon it. For example, it will monitor the effect of global warming on the polar ice caps and measure soil moisture and other factors that are essential to the accurate modelling of climate systems.
<P>

<a name="90513w06.htm_para10">We have announced &#163;67 million investment in the programme by the British National Space Centre (BNSC). The UK has taken a strong lead in devising this programme. Our scientific community has worked closely with the BNSC in identifying how to deliver a challenging value-for-money initiative, using state of the art equipment and know-how. The agreement we secured is the first step towards providing an assured long-term programme of scientific research which looks at the Earth and its environment from space. We are putting Earth sciences on an equal footing with ESA's traditional areas of scientific research--astronomy and planetary exploration.
<P>

<a name="90513w06.htm_para11">We also announced further commitments of around &#163;40 million to other new ESA programmes in satellite multimedia and global navigation satellites. These were coupled with renewed commitments of around &#163;46 million per year to existing science and facility investment programmes.
<P>

<a name="90513w06.htm_para12">The Government's support for space has allowed the UK to make major commitments not only to science, where the substantial increase in funding in the recent Comprehensive Spending Review is already bearing fruit, but also to the continued health of the UK space industry. Our subscriptions to the satellite multimedia and navigation programmes will position our companies at the forefront of the knowledge-driven economy and give them the opportunity to maximise their share in global markets that will be worth around &#163;65 billion a year within the next decade.
<P>

<a name="90513w06.htm_para13">I am confident that, with the current spirit of co-operation between the member states of ESA, we will now be able to press ahead with the exciting missions of ESA's Horizons 2000 programme, such as Planck/FIRST, and that we will be able to include the unique Mars Express mission. This is a new chapter, opening a period of great potential for European space.

 Regrettably, a small number of recording errors and omissions have been identified. These errors were identified in the course of work carried out to compile certain information requested by the quadripartite committee established to carry out a joint inquiry into the Government's first Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of sub-postmasters' remuneration is accounted for by <i>(a)</i> sale of postal services and <i>(b)</i> payment of benefits.  [84058]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that around 25 per cent. of sub-postmasters' remuneration is accounted for by the sale of postal services and around 35 per cent. is accounted for by the payment of benefits. The remainder of their post office remuneration derives from banking, bill payment and other financial and licensing transactions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what is the current hourly target rate of remuneration for sub-postmasters.  [84057]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Sub-postmasters are not employees of the Post Office but are independent business people who provide post office service on an agency basis.
<P>

<a name="90513w07.htm_para7">The Post Office makes payments to sub-postmasters based on the amount of transactions they perform, plus some core payments and allowances. The concept of an hourly rate of remuneration is therefore not applicable.




<P>
<P><I>13 May 1999 : Column: 197</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90513w07.htm_para8">Because of their contractual position, sub-postmasters are able to--and typically do--operate a private retail business from the same premises as the sub post office. This enables them to gain income from the private business as well as from the post office, whilst sharing overheads.

<a name="90513w07.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Working Time Directive</center></H4>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which employment sectors are currently excluded from the 48-hour week provision of the Working Time Directive; for which of them Her Majesty's Government have tabled alternative proposals; and what maximum hours respectively are suggested in these proposals.  [83839]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The employment sectors currently excluded from the Working Time Directive are air, rail, road, sea, inland waterway and lake transport, sea fishing, other work at sea (essentially the offshore oil and gas industry) and doctors in training.
<P>

<a name="90513w07.htm_para9">It would not be appropriate for the Government to discuss specific details of its negotiating position. However, the Government are not opposed to the extension of working time in principle, although we want to ensure the new measures accommodate our concerns and do not adversely affect the competitiveness of industry or the delivery of healthcare within the NHS.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will modify the Working Time Regulations to take into account hours at work spent not continually working on account of machine breakdown, supply difficulties or for other reasons beyond the direct control of management.  [83840]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 There are no plans to amend the definition of working time in the Working Time Regulations. Under the Regulations working time is defined as time when a worker is 'working, at his employer's disposal and carrying out his activities or duties'. For time to be working time all three elements must be satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The targets for the percentages of first class mail delivered the next working day after posting and second class mail delivered within three working days of posting are set by the Post Office in consultation with the Post Office Users' National Council. The targets to achieve first delivery in urban areas by 9.30am and to achieve delivery in rural areas by 2.00pm are set internally by the Post Office.
<P>

<a name="90513w07.htm_para10">A key element of the package of Post Office reforms announced last December is the creation of an independent regulator to protect consumers' interests including standards of service. It is also planned to give the Post Office Users' National Council a more central role and increased powers. Together with the other

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 It remains my expectation, as I told the Trade and Industry Select Committee on 9 December, that the White Paper will be published in the first half of the year.

<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices and <i>(b)</i> sub-post offices have shut during the last 12 months.  [84055]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I understand from the Post Office that there has been a net reduction of one Crown post office and 232 sub post offices in the 12 months to the end of March 1999.
<P>

<a name="90513w07.htm_para11">The Crown office reduction was the net result of merging two nearby offices in London when the opportunity was taken to open a new flagship Crown office in their place.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90513w07.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of sub-post offices is located in rural areas.  [84053]

 We can find no record of Mr. Pritchard's correspondence from January and March. The last recorded correspondence for Mr. Pritchard was in November 1998 in response to a letter from the hon. Member.

 I consider that a better rail service between North and South Wales is essential for the economic and social cohesion of Wales. The Welsh Office is now working in partnership with the North Wales Economic Forum to secure two return services a day via Wrexham, and to reduce the fastest journey time between Bangor and Cardiff by half an hour. I expect to see the new services in place by the summer timetable next year.

As a result of the budget measures, 700,000 children will be lifted out of poverty. The tax rate for a family on average earnings with two children will be cut to its lowest level since 1972.

 One of the benefits of transferring the Contributions Agency and policy responsibility for National Insurance to the Inland Revenue is that the Departments will be able to combine their efforts in detecting and preventing artificial avoidance of National Insurance which cost the National Insurance Fund hundreds of millions of pounds a year in lost revenue.

 In March 1998 the Chancellor announced the most radical restructuring of the National Insurance system for 20 years, in line with the recommendations of the Taylor Report, 'The Modernisation of Britain's Tax and Benefits System'.

 Duty free sales on journeys made wholly with the European Union are due to end from 30 June as a result of a decision taken by the Council of Finance Ministers in 1991. The Government are pressing for an extension to allow time to work out better duty paid arrangements. However, we have never underestimated the difficulty of this task as it requires unanimity among member states. The Government will continue to press for the best and most sensible deal possible for the UK. Duty free sales on journeys made to countries outside the EU will continue unaffected after 30 June 1999.

 The estimated coin requirement set out in the Outline National Changeover Plan relates to the initial quantities needed to launch euro coins on the first day of their circulation, should the UK decide to join the single currency. The higher figure quoted in 1997 was the estimated total needed to replace all the coins in circulation. The preferred timing for the introduction of euro coins would be when coin demand is seasonally low, and for up to six months euro coins would be circulating in parallel with sterling coins.

 MAFF commissioned two major studies on rendering processes. One examined the inactivation of the BSE agent by rendering procedures (see D. M. Taylor et al. Veterinary Record 1995. Vol. 137, 605-610) and the second examined the effects of rendering procedures on the scrapie agent (see D. M. Taylor et al. Veterinary Record 1997. Vol. 141, 643-649). The results of these experiments resulted in European Commission Decisions 94/382 and 96/449 being made, which set standards for the rendering of mammalian animal by-products throughout the European Union. This European legislation is currently implemented in the UK in the Specified Risk Material Regulations 1997 and the Animal By-Products Order 1999 and all approved UK rendering plants operate to these standards.

 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> Since last July's Integrated Transport White Paper, which sets out targets for the introduction of green transport plans for Government Departments, my Department is finalising four plans covering all of our London headquarters buildings and our York building, which houses two of the Ministry's Executive Agencies. We are developing plans for our remaining 19 sites in line with the target for March 2000 set in the Integrated Transport White Paper.

 <i>[holding answer 11 May 1999]:</i> Over 27,000 tonnes of MBM from OTMS animals has now been burned in the high temperature waste incinerator at Fawley.
<P>

<a name="90513w12.htm_para1">The Intervention Board announced the first contract for the large scale incineration of MBM with energy recovery in October 1998. Burning under the contract is subject to the company, Fibrogen Ltd. obtaining the necessary planning and environmental consents in accordance with normal procedures. Following a detailed technical assessment of, and extensive consultation on, Fibrogen's application, the Environment Agency granted an authorisation to burn waste MBM under Section 6 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 on 26 April 1999. Fibrogen are considering whether to mount an appeal following the decision by North Lincolnshire Planning Committee on 12 March 1999 to refuse planning permission to change fuel from poultry litter to MBM, which has delayed tangible progress.
<P>

<a name="90513w12.htm_para2">The Intervention Board has completed its evaluation of the costed proposals received for the balance of its OTMS MBM incineration requirement and contract negotiations are on-going. Details of the companies will be announced when contracts are signed. These companies will also need the necessary planning and environmental consents from the relevant authorities before the burning of MBM can commence.
