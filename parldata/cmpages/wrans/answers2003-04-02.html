<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The SERAS study included a preliminary assessment of the risk of birds colliding with aircraft at Cliffe. Details of this work are contained in appendix four of "The North Kent Marshes Ecological Study" (phase 1 report), copies of which are available in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para1">The Central Science Laboratory and British Trust for Ornithology were jointly commissioned in September 2002 to conduct further research to assess more fully this risk and identify possible mitigating measures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what guidance his Department issues to civil servants on how to deal with claims from organisations that the information they provide to the Department is commercially confidential.  [105561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is not standard practice in my Department to verify claims of commercial confidentiality on receiving information from organisations, as this is normally only relevant if the question arises as to whether such information should be disclosed to another party. My Department follows the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The Code, and the guidance on the operation of the Code, helps officials determine whether such information should be disclosed.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para2">The Code provides a specific exemption for a third party's commercial confidences. In deciding whether or not information should be withheld under this exemption, officials must consider whether "unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party". While it is ultimately up to the Department to decide in accordance with the Code whether to disclose the information, the third party whose interests may be adversely affected is normally consulted in order to inform the Department's decision. Even where the exemption prima facie applies, the information in question may still be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest in disclosure, but disclosure of commercially confidential information without consent will usually be appropriate only where the risk to public health, public safety or the environment is substantial and specific.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para3">A decision to refuse requested information may be made without consultation with the supplier of information where the case for confidentiality is obvious and overwhelming.

<P>
<a name="30402w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department for Transport (central) currently provides six subsidised child care places, costing approximately &#163;26,000, covering staff in London and Hastings. This amounts to 45 per cent. of the cost of these places.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para4">The former DTLR provided 12 subsidised child care places as part of an inter-departmental nursery scheme administered by the Home Office, and the places have been split between ODPM and DfT.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para5">DfT also participates in the Westminster Holiday Playscheme, which provides holiday care for children of school age. The Department subsidies 50 per cent. of the &#163;26 per day cost of each place. The contract is with DTLR, and it is therefore not currently possible to identify DfT costs only.
<P>

<a name="30402w01.html_para6">The review of child care (originally begun by the former DTLR) has been jointly conducted with ODPM. The Departments are separately considering recommendations in the review, but the aim is to provide an enhanced package of provisions that will benefit more staff including central Department staff outside London.

 The overall policy is to provide drivers with sufficient information to reach their intended destination safely and efficiently, but not more information than they can readily absorb or which would require the use of excessively large and environmentally intrusive signs. Local transport note 1/94, based on the results of research into the assimilation of information on directional signs, recommends a maximum of six destinations on any one sign on an all-purpose road, which may include a mixture of primary, non-primary and local destinations. The Highways Agency would normally consult the local traffic authority on traffic management priorities for signing local destinations from the trunk road, to ensure that there will be continuity of signing on the local road network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No noise preferential routes have been determined for any of the possible additional runways in the consultation document. Aircraft arrival and departure routes were developed for various airport locations to assist with the modelling of noise exposure and local air quality, so that the relative impacts of the many runway development options could be compared.
<P>

<a name="30402w02.html_para2">Routes to and from new runways in all the airport options were derived in essentially the same manner. Routes to and from existing runways were left unchanged wherever practical, and routes for new runways were based on the existing airspace structure of airways, waypoints, holding areas etc.




<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2003 : Column 703W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30402w02.html_para3">Arrival routes to all runways were assumed to be straight in on the runway heading. Departure tracks for new runways at an airport, and existing runways where necessary, were based on existing departure routes as far as practical.
<P>

<a name="30402w02.html_para4">In practice, the development of one or more new runways in the south east would require substantial changes to the region's airspace structure which could affect thefinal configuration of routes. It was not feasible to predict in detail how airspace in the south east might need to be reorganised in the long term to cater for increased activity. As part of the SERAS study, CAA and NATS did carry out a high level assessment of the overall pressures on airspace of sample combinations of new airport capacity up to 2030 and concluded that the increase in air traffic could be accommodated.

<P>

<a name="30402w02.html_para5">The Council reached a general approach on a proposal to further accelerate the phase-out of single hull tankers and to ban the carriage of heavy grades of oil in such ships sailing to and from EU ports. The regulation will apply to all ships calling at or leaving Community ports and to all ships carrying Community flags anywhere in the world. The final date for phase-out of single-hull tankers is 2010, with an exemption until 2015 for certain vessels under specified conditions. A presidency compromise date of 2008 was agreed for the coming into effect of a ban on carriage of heavy oil intankers below 5000 tons deadweight. The definition of heavy oils was agreed as those having a density at 15oC higher than 900kg/m <sup>3</sup> . I would have preferred a transitional period to 2010, and a definition of 950kg/m <sup>3</sup> , but these compromises are acceptable to the UK so, together with other Member States, I was able to support them as part of an overall package.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 A full council tax bill assumes that at least two adults have their sole or main residence in a dwelling. There is a 25 per cent. discount for a dwelling that is the sole or main residence of only one person. Service personnel are treated in the same way as anyone else who is working away from home when determining their sole or main residence. When a person is employed overseas, the dwelling in which their spouse lives remains the main residence unless it can be shown that there has been a change of sole or main residence. A single person discount will not therefore apply.

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made a written ministerial statement concerning the firefighters' dispute and emergency fire cover on the 25 March 2003. He announced that the armed forces personnel deployed on firefighting duties have been stood down on the grounds that no further strike dates will be announced before the Fire Brigades Union re-called conference on 15 April. The Fire Brigades Union would then be required to give seven days notice of any further strike.

<P>
<a name="30402w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Statutory undertakers have certain permitted development rights set out in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (SI 1995/418) ("the GPDO") that enable them to carry out development for the purposes of their undertaking without the need to make a planning application. Parts 15, 16 and 17 of Schedule 2 (development by the Environment Agency, sewerage undertakers and statutory undertakers) are likely to be relevant. These permissions generally do not permit the installation of pipes above ground, and they are subject to exceptions and conditions. Any development that goes beyond what is permitted by the GPDO requires planning permission. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of specific restrictions that apply to the laying of pipes under bridges. Under the New Roads and Street Works Act there is a notification procedure between the statutory undertaker and the highways authority that deals with proposed works under the bridges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The costs to public service pension schemes of making changes to benefits for future service are normally assessed by estimating the percentage points of pay which would need to be added to contribution rates on an on-going basis from the date of the change to cover the long run costs which the change would impose on the scheme. The Government's policy 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2003 : Column 716W</I><P>
is that the introduction of entitlement to survivor pensions for unmarried partners in public service pension schemes should be covered by members of schemes who want the change to be made. But the same estimates of additional percentage points of pay to be made in contributions would apply to employer contributions if the costs were to be met by employers. The figures provided by the Government Actuary are given in the following table. In the schemes where the Exchequer provides the benefits, which are unfunded schemes, the annual net cash cost to the Exchequer would build gradually over a number of years before reaching a steady state. The Government Actuary has not made estimates of the profile of this build-up. In the pension schemes where local authorities provide the benefits (Local Government Pension Scheme, Police Pension Scheme and Fire Pension Scheme in the table below) the costs of benefit improvements financed by employers would fall to Council Tax payers rather than the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="30402w05.html_para4">No estimates are available for the total public sector, as this would need to include a number of non-statutory pension schemes in the wider public sector on which data is not held centrally. The figures in the following table cover all survivor pensions including those where the death of the scheme member occurred after they had left active service; separate estimates identifying survivor pensions following death-in-service are not available. The table includes costings for making married partner survivor pensions payable for life (instead of ceasing on remarriage of the survivor) as this is conventionally assumed to be a change which should be associated with the introduction of unmarried partner survivor pensions for life, as in the new Civil Service Pension Scheme. The costs of making the benefit changes retrospective to cover the past service of active members at the date of the change are shown as the capitalised one-off additions to scheme liabilities which the Government Actuary estimates that this would create.

 A contingency reserve of &#163;1.75 billion was set aside to meet the cost of security and military preparations. Now that UK armed forces are in action in Iraq the Chancellor has announced a further &#163;1.25 billion to increase the special reserves to &#163;3 billion, to be drawn on as necessary. It is too early to make an assessment of the final costs of our involvement in Iraq. The Treasury does not estimate costs for such operations in the manner requested.

 The information is not available in the format requested. HM Treasury and Defra published a joint consultation on the Landfill Tax Credit scheme last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 I understand that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) have undertaken an analysis of the pension projection basis set by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for Statutory Money Purchase Illustrations (SMPIs).
<P>

<a name="30402w06.html_para5">Following consultation in April 2002, the FSA decided that the assumptions, including mortality rates, annuity interest rates, and other data, used by firms to compile point of sale projections should be amended to bring them into line with the DWP basis.
<P>

<a name="30402w06.html_para6">SMPIs will be in real value terms, while projections at the point of sale, which are governed by FSA rules, are in monetary terms, although firms have the option to show real value figures. The FSA are currently consulting on a new disclosure regime. This proposes SMPI based projections should be mandatory at the point of sale.

<sup>(8)</sup> Income related benefits are IS, JSA (IB), HB, CTB, excluding all overlaps between benefits.<P>

<P>

For 1997, overlaps with FC and/or DWA have not been considered.<P>

For 2001, overlaps with Working Families Tax Credit and/or Disabled Persons Tax Credit have not been considered.<P>





In May 1997: income related benefits were Income Support (IS), Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA (IB)), Housing Benefit (HB), Council Tax Benefit (CTB), Family Credit (FC) and Disability Working Allowance (DWA). However, in October 1999 FC and DWA were replaced as Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit. Therefore, as the figures for 2001 will only include IS, JSA (IB), HB and CTB, figures are provided for May 1997 both including and excluding FC and DWA to enable comparisons to be made.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures for beneficiaries have been rounded to the nearest ten thousand.<P>

2. Percentages for May 2001 are derived from the mid-2001 ONS population estimates.<P>

We published "Opportunity for all&#151;Fourth Annual Report" (CM 5598) in September 2002, which contains information on a range of indicators of poverty for children and young people.

 In the answers I gave earlier I explained that separate figures for staffing and costs for most filestores are not available for some or all of the years in the table. The available information included data from just 13 filestores in 1997&#150;98, rising to 62 filestores in 2001&#150;02. The figures for each year are therefore not comparable and there is no evidence that staffing numbers or costs have increased.

1. The data refers to households, which may be a single person or a couple.<P>

2. Management information data is not available for all local authorities. The figures include estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures have been rounded to 2 significant figures.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proportion of the 2003&#150;04 Education Formula Spending Share funding each local education authority is passported directly to its schools.  [105575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Education Formula Spending Share is divided into two main funding blocks: one for Schools and one for LEAs. Earlier this spring, the Department carried out an exercise to obtain information on how much of the increase in schools funding had been passported into the Schools budget, which covers all provision for pupils including under-fives education and provision for pupils with special educational needs outside the maintained sector. 124 authorities passed on the increase in funding in full or more. A further six did so when allowance is made for the fact that they are affected by the ceiling for increases in revenue support grant. The remaining authorities did not passport in full. Following intervention by the Secretary of State in two authorities, the amount of funding being passported to their Schools Budgets was increased.
<P>

<a name="30402w09.html_para0">The division of the Schools Budget between the Individual Schools Budget and centrally retained items is a decision for local education authorities, after consultation with their schools forum. Local education authorities have until 31 March 2003 to submit their actual budgets to the Department for 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="30402w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There is no Public Service Agreement (PSA) target for the number of individual schools achieving 85 per cent. The Spending Review 2000 set a target to increase the percentage of children who achieve level 4 in each of the Key Stage 2 English and maths tests to 85 per cent. This PSA has been rolled forward as part of Spending Review 2002, with a view to sustaining this level of performance to 2006. In the 2002 tests, 75 per cent. of pupils nationally achieved level 4 or above in English and 73 per cent. did so in mathematics.

<a name="30402w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government are currently undertaking a Review of the Funding of Adult Learning. The Review is exploring how to best use Government funded provision to ensure that it meets the business needs of different sectors. The outcome of the Review will be set out in the Government's Skills Strategy to be published in June. Our recent statement "14&#150;19: opportunity and excellence" announced the introduction (from 2004&#150;05 onwards) of an entitlement for all young people to continue studying up to age 19 until they reach the standard of a good GCSE or the corresponding Level 2 key skill qualification in IT skills.
<P>

<a name="30402w09.html_para1">The Government are supporting the teaching and development of the skills required for IT jobs in a variety of ways, including a wide range of further education provision and specific Modern Apprenticeships. We are seeking to put employers at the heart of meeting skill needs through the establishment of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). The new bodies will help to ensure that government funded learning opportunities meet particular sectoral needs. A recent joint initiative of Jobcentre Plus and the National Employment Panel has been the Ambition programme designed to engage industry expertise in the design of demand-led programmes to get unemployed and disadvantaged jobseekers into good jobs that pay well and have real career potential. Participants in the Ambition: IT programme train for work primarily in the areas of systems support and software development.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the system of education grant distribution in recognising the additional costs associated with educational provision for children with special needs;  [105867]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the extent to which additional financial support provided to <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> primary and secondary schools reflects the costs of providing for children recognised as being on the autistic spectrum.  [105863]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The new system for distributing education grant is known as Education Formula Spending Shares. The distribution formula recognises the additional costs associated with educational provision for children with special needs in two ways. Firstly there is an uplift of &#163;1,300 in the under five, primary and secondary formulae for pupils with additional educational needs. This draws on evidence from research by PricewaterhouseCoopers (a copy has been placed in the Library) on the costs schools face for pupils with additional educational needs. Secondly, there is a separate funding block recognising the costs associated with provision for high need pupils. This uses a formula to estimate how many children in each authority have very high costs, using measures of the proportions of children with parents on income support and of low birth weight, and distributes &#163;6,801 per high cost pupil. This figure is based on historical evidence of what local educational authorities spend on average on such pupils.
<P>

<a name="30402w10.html_para0">The additional financial support provided to primary and secondary schools for children in general with special needs and in particular for those on the autistic spectrum is for local education authorities to decide: many have factors in their local formulae for such provision.

 When information is marked as commercially sensitive it is treated as such and protected and managed in accordance with the relevant security guidelines, any contract conditions and other departmental processes. The need to verify any claim of commercial confidentiality will generally arise only when considering whether the information should be disclosed to a third party. Ministry of Defence guidance requires officials to comply with the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information in deciding whether to disclose information. Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice relates to a third party's commercial confidences. In deciding whether or not to withhold information, officials must consider whether "unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party". While the decision ultimately rests with MOD, the third party whose interests may be adversely affected will normally be consulted. Even where, prima facie, the Exemption applies, the Code of Practice says that information should be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest in doing so and no statutory restriction or legal obligation to prevent this.

<P>
<a name="30402w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I welcome this report which adds to the body of evidence on the environmental effects of Depleted Uranium (DU) ammunition. Officials have made a preliminary assessment of the main body of the report including the conclusions and recommendations. The findings of this study are consistent with previous United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) studies in Kosovo (2001) and in Serbia and Montenegro (2002). We note the UNEP assessment that the recorded contamination levels are very low and do not present immediate radioactive or toxic risks for the environment 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2003 : Column 736W</I><P>
or human health. We note also that anecdotal reports of rises in cancers in the Balkans were not substantiated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as part of this project. UNEP say that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"WHO concludes that, due to the lack of a proper cancer registry and reporting system, claims of an increase in the rates of adverse health effects stemming from DU cannot be substantiated. The existing scientific data on Uranium and DU health effects indicate that it is highly unlikely that DU could be associated with any of the reported health problems".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30402w11.html_para0">We have stated previously that any DU contamination will be limited and localised and that actions to reduce any potential intakes will only be necessary in some extreme cases, and we note the findings of this report are consistent with that view. Specifically, the report concludes that DU contamination occurs at low levels, detectable with radiation monitors up to two metres around an impact at the surface, but also detectable in laboratory chemical analysis of soil up to 200 metres away in some cases. The report states that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the corresponding radiological and toxicological risks from such low-level contamination are insignificant."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30402w11.html_para1">Where Depleted Uranium has been detected in air and water, it has still been within normal levels of naturally occurring Uranium. The concentrations are described as very low and the resulting radiation doses insignificant. The report recommends that further work is carried out on the corrosion and dispersion of DU in the soil and possible subsequent uptake by groundwater. The Ministry of Defence's independent research programme on DU, announced in March 2002, already includes such work.
<P>

<a name="30402w11.html_para2">We support the view that sensible pragmatic precautions should be taken to protect the civil population in areas where armed conflicts occurred and that these precautions should address all potential hazards. In particular UNEP has drawn attention to the fact that past ammunition production and current ammunition destruction activities have produced surface concentrations of heavy metals above levels at which precautions should be taken. The report also draws attention to the fact that industrial radiation sources present a greater health risk than DU contamination. UNEP makes recommendations to raise awareness, train personnel in decontamination, strengthen the radiation safety infrastructure and to investigate health claims. This will be achieved initially by improving data capture of health statistics, particularly with regard to cancer registration and to improving knowledge of basic epidemiology and interpretation of clinical findings in clinical staff. We support these recommendations. The press release on the UNEP website gives a good summary of the findings.

<P>

<a name="30402w11.html_para3">Gurkha terms and conditions of service are unique and reflect the status of Gurkhas as Nepalese citizens, recruited and discharged in Nepal. In a recent High Court ruling, Gurkha pay and pensions arrangements were judged to be fair and non-discriminatory. Inter alia, the Court noted that Gurkha remuneration is broadly in line with the pay of British personnel and that Gurkha pensions, available after only 15 years of service, compare favourably with professional salaries in Nepal. Although claims relating to Gurkha accompanied service provisions were also dismissed, we recognise that the current arrangements are a cause for concern and are therefore studying these aspects of the ruling very carefully.

 With one exception the Ministry of Defence, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are not responsible for any funded pension schemes.

Again, the schemes have no assets and are not subject to actuarial valuation. The RAF Museum supports a money purchase stakeholder pension to which it does not contribute and there is no designated pension scheme for the Royal Marines Museum. The one funded scheme is run by the Oil and Pipelines Agency. The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was 5 April 2001 at which the value of the assets was &#163;2.11 million.

particularly concerned by recent statements and actions by North Korea whom we believe to have ambitions to manufacture nuclear weapons.
<P>

<a name="30402w13.html_para0">We have also noted information which has recently become available on the nature and scale of Iran's nuclear programme. It is a matter of concern that Iran did not make the information available to the International Atomic Energy Agency earlier.

 As winter ends and spring starts in Kabul, there is now a 24 hour supply of electricity again in Kabul. However, the demand for electricity is greater than the supply. And for many people, the distribution network is unreliable. Availability is intermittent. The Transitional Administration has set a target of eliminating power outages progressively over the next three years by increasing generating and importing capacity.

<P>
<a name="30402w14.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Six countries in southern Africa (Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi and Mozambique) have been suffering food shortages since late 2001. Food aid and other assistance has been provided to over 14 million people, half of these in Zimbabwe. This international effort has avoided a major catastrophe.
<P>

<a name="30402w14.html_para0">Harvests are due across the region in April 2003. Early forecasts are for variable but generally improved crops. If these forecasts are accurate, then there should be a significant reduction in the scale of the crisis in the region. While further assistance will be needed in Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland, there should be little need for food aid in Malawi and Zambia.
<P>

<a name="30402w14.html_para1">However, there continues to be a major crisis in Zimbabwe, where over seven million people are likely to continue to need assistance during the next 12 months. This is largely the result of disastrous economic management in the country.
<P>

<a name="30402w14.html_para2">DFID has provided over &#163;106 million in response to the crisis since September 2001, as well as over &#163;21 million as the UK share of EU assistance.

 In 2002, my Department spent &#163;43,395 on the commissioning of two studies of UK public attitudes. This is a long term exercise with regular surveys on an annual basis. The first, carried out by MORI, records attitudes amongst school children and cost &#163;11,515. The other, undertaken by the ONS, monitored the UK adult population at a cost of &#163;31,880. Both surveys monitor public attitudes towards and support for international development in the UK.

<i>[holding answer 1 April 2003]:</i> The UK has the necessary plans in place in the interests of national security and the protection of the public. The Government's preparations include a series of classified contingency plans for responding to a wide range of terrorist threats. These plans are regularly tested, reviewed and updated in the light of changing circumstances. The response to any terrorist incident relies upon a co-ordinated approach and the Government draws upon the resources of other Departments, the security and intelligence agencies, the police, the military, scientific and other specialist advice, local authorities and the emergency services. In addition to the national contingency plans, the London Resilience Forum under the chair of my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) examines resilience and preparedness of London for major emergencies including those caused by terrorism.

 The information requested is not available.

immigration control and must therefore satisfy the immigration officer that they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
<P>

<a name="30402w17.html_para2">Unaccompanied children and young people under the age of 18 are no exception to this requirement, and will be seen by an immigration officer on arrival at United Kingdom ports and airports. Their age and the fact that they are travelling alone mean that special care is taken when they are interviewed. In seeking to establish whether entry is appropriate, the immigration officer may make checks with any relatives or sponsors in the United Kingdom, and against any address the child might have given as their intended residence whilst in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30402w17.html_para3">Should the unaccompanied minor seek asylum on arrival in the United Kingdom then there are well established procedures in place to ensure that the child is dealt with where possible by immigration officers specially trained to interview children. Social services are notified so that adequate care can be arranged in the absence of any family in the United Kingdom and the Refugee Council's Children's Panel act as the independent advisor to the child during the processing of the asylum claim.

<P>
<a name="30402w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The National Video Identification System (NVIS), a system using video images of suspects and look-alike volunteers to crate identification parades, is in the process of being implemented.
<P>

<a name="30402w17.html_para4">Video Identification Parade Electronic Recording (VIPER) is a system developed and operated, on a non-profit basis, by west Yorkshire police. The Home Office subsequently funded the development of a new VIPER Bureau in west Yorkshire. The Home Office subsequently funded the development of a new VIPER to sites in each of the ten street crime forces and the British transport police. A total of 17,000 compilations have been completed since the system was introduced in April 2002. Plans are in place, subject to appropriate funding, to roll out VIPER to all forces by the end of March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30402w17.html_para5">A national standard for video identification has been drawn up to ensure the NVIS&#151;VIPER and other suitable commercial systems are capable of passing images to the national database. The NVIS aims to increase the number of parades held and the number of positive identifications made.
<P>

<a name="30402w17.html_para6">Video identification has shown marked benefits in the street crime forces and there are numerous examples of this process playing a significant role in bringing perpetrators for serious forces to justice within timescales previously unthinkable. For example, while 51 per cent. of live ID parades may be cancelled before witnesses can eve attend, with video ID that cancellation rate can be as low as 5 per cent.

<a name="30402w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department pursuant to her answer of 20 March, <i>Official Report,</i> column 908W, on Court of Protection (portfolio holdings), what proportion of funds are retained in the Special Account; what the average number of portfolio holdings held by the Public Guardianship Office was between February 1999 and February 2003; what the total value of portfolio holdings was at the end of February <i>(a)</i> 1999 and <i>(b)</i> 2003; and what scrutiny procedures are in place for the work of private fund managers under contract to the PGO.

 The precise information requested is not available.
<P>

<a name="30402w18.html_para1">As at 31 March 2002, holdings in the Special Account stood at approximately 65 per cent. of total funds, compared with 62 per cent. in March 2001 and 60 per cent. in March 2000.
<P>

<a name="30402w18.html_para2">The total number of receivership cases handled by the Public Guardianship Office (PGO) was 37,000 in early 1999 and is now about 18,000. This reduction reflects the switch to the use of Enduring Powers of Attorney and the introduction of a higher capital threshold for receivership.

 UK fisheries laboratories send observers to sea to record the quantity of fish discarded and retained by fishing vessels. Systematic data over five years for a representative sample of the UK fleet is only available for some fisheries. The tables show estimates for the proportion of catch discarded of cod, haddock, and whiting and total discarding of these species by the UK fleet in the North Sea. These estimates are obtained by raising the observer data to the total number of recorded days-at-sea.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will permit local authorities and private companies to contribute to the costs of flood reduction work in tandem with the Environment Agency when the cost benefit analysis of the project by the Agency is less than one.

<a name="30402w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Private companies and local authorities can and do make contributions towards the cost of flood defence projects but it is often incorrect to deduct these contributions from the cost of the project. Generally these contributions only affect the distribution of funding of costs and not the total resources required for the project. Hence an uneconomic project will remain uneconomic no matter the source.

 There are no hard and fast rules as to how often an operating authority should re-evaluate the benefits of a flood alleviation scheme. It is important, however, that in the preparation of a cost benefit analysis that the base year for evaluating cost and benefits should be the same.

<P>
<a name="30402w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 On 11 March I wrote to the three people listed as follows and asked them to serve as members of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme Sustainable Waste Management Legacy Fund Independent Assessment Panel. They have agreed to do so; the three members are:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Dr. Jane Beasley from the Chartered Institute of Waste Management.
<P>

Dr. Tariq Ali from the Imperial College Environment Office.

<a name="30402w19.html_para5">The panel has been set up to approve eligible applications to the Legacy Fund to ensure that the process is transparent and cannot be criticised on propriety grounds or allegations of bias. Members of the panel should, therefore, have no direct link with any organisation that may benefit from the fund. In any instance where, contrary to intention this turns out not to be the case, the panel member concerned will declare an interest and not take part in any discussion/decision relating to the project in question.

<a name="30402w19.html_para7">Decisions on projects requiring continuing funding under the Legacy Scheme need to be taken very quickly. It was not possible therefore, to run an open competition for panel members. Their appointment has, however, conformed to Nolan Principles to the extent that they are independent of Government, are accepted leaders in their field and represent different elements in society.
<P>

<a name="30402w19.html_para8">The possibility of having a representative of the waste management industry on the panel was considered, but was thought to be inappropriate given the role of the panel. Before appointing the panel members checks were made to ensure as far as possible that they were not connected to (i) Object C and (ii) CC projects that were likely to apply for Legacy Funding. However, as an additional protection the requirement to declare an interest and not take part in the decision was included in the operating procedures.

Although the Railways Act 1993 Section 122 subsection 3, Part A exempts authorised railway undertakers from action at civil or criminal law for nuisance, it does not exempt them from the element of statutory nuisance that covers being prejudicial to health. For such a case to succeed, it would be necessary to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that the nuisance was above and beyond what might be expected from the normal operation of a railway.

 Our policies to improve general hospital care, especially through the new single assessment process, will ensure that the health care needs of older people&#151;who are the main sufferers from arthritis&#151;will be properly targeted. This will ensure that the services that are provided are most appropriate to older people's needs, including people with arthritis.
<P>

<a name="30402w20.html_para8">People with arthritis will benefit from the expert patients programme, which will see the national health service provide training in self-management skills for people with long-term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase has begun in selected primary care trust (PCT) sites, with activity to take place both on a generic and a disease-specific basis.
<P>

<a name="30402w20.html_para9">In the past year, two new classes of drugs, Cox II inhibitors and anti-TNF therapy, have been made available to arthritis patients following reviews by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).

<P>

<a name="30402w20.html_para10">We have issued directions obliging health authorities and PCTs to provide appropriate funding for recommended treatments. This is in line with our commitment to ensure that patients receive drugs and treatments recommended by NICE on the NHS if deemed appropriate by their clinicians.

<a name="30402w21.html_para1">In 2001&#150;02, the gross expenditure by councils in England on children's homes was &#163;716.7 million. In 2002, 89 per cent. of the 59,700 children looked after in England were in alternative placements to children's homes. The Children Act 1989 is based upon the belief that children are generally best looked after within the family, with both parents playing a full part and without resort to legal proceedings. When a child is being looked after by the local authority, the local authority is required to make arrangements for that child to live with a member of his family unless to do so would be impractical or inconsistent with the child's welfare. If they cannot live with their family, their placement should be best suited to their needs. The "choice protects" review focuses on the way in which placement options for looked after children are commissioned, and on support for fostering services.
<P>

<a name="30402w21.html_para2">The "quality protects" programme has focused on ensuring children looked after gain the maximum life chance benefits from educational opportunities, health care and social care. The Department of Health recently announced a new public service agreement target for the education of children in care, to improve life chances for children by substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006. Joint Department for Education and Skills/Department of Health Guidance on the Education of Young People in Public Care (May 2000) sets out clear steps for local authorities to take to improve attainment. The Department of Health also published new guidance in November 2002 on "Promoting the Health of Looked After Children".
<P>

<a name="30402w21.html_para3">National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Children's Homes were published in April 2002. They set out standards covering provision of healthcare, education and life skills to children looked after as well as the training and qualifications of care staff and registered managers. A new grant, the National Training Strategy Grant, is to commence this year. A proportion of this grant (&#163;17.9 million) will support the completion of National Vocational Qualifications required under the NMS.

<P>
<a name="30402w21.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B>

<P>
<a name="30402w21.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Drug therapy is an option in the treatment of childhood enuresis. There are four drugs that can be used to treat children with enuresis listed in the British National Formulary (BNF 6.5.2 Desmopressin Acetate, 4.3.1 Amitriptyline Hydrochloride, Imipramine Hydrochloride and Nortriptyline).

<a name="30402w21.html_para4">Information on the number of children with enuresis and on those who receive the drugs listed above is not collected centrally. However, it is estimated that around 180,000 prescription items for these drugs were dispensed in the community in England for children in 2001. This relates to prescription items rather than numbers of children. Also this does not take account of prescription items dispensed in hospitals or private prescriptions.

 Early development of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services has shown that the standards set will be relevant to, although not specifically about, the management of enuresis. One key theme being developed is improving the management of common childhood illnesses and health concerns. The new standards will help to ensure that children and young people are able to access appropriate services at the right time and that they can take an active part in making decisions about their care.

 Independent hospitals caring for young people detained under the Mental Health Act are required to register as independent hospitals with the National Care Standards Commission under the Care Standards Act 2000, and are required to comply with the Private and Voluntary Health Care Regulations made under that Act.
<P>

<a name="30402w21.html_para7">Inspections are carried out annually. In considering whether an independent hospital complies with the Regulations, inspectors take into account the extent to which it meets the National Minimum Standards. There are two types of standards: Core Standards, which apply to all establishments, and Service-specific standards, which apply to the particular services provided. There are service-specific standards for all mental health hospitals, additional ones for those hospitals that treat children and adolescents, and a further set of standards addressing hospitals that take people who are liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w22.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC is not currently funding any research on overmedication in care homes. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for research into any aspect of human health, and these are considered in competition with other demands on funding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to revise his Department's targets for recruiting <i>(a)</i> occupational therapists and <i>(b)</i> physiotherapists as a result of the recommendation of the National Audit Office in its report on hospital discharge.  [105391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30402w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan acknowledged that there was a shortage of staff in the national health service and set challenging targets for increasing the NHS work force. The Government are committed to increasing the numbers of therapists and other health professionals, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists, by 6,500 by 2004 over a 1999 baseline. By September 2001, there had been an increase of 3,400.
<P>

<a name="30402w22.html_para2">Occupational therapy and physiotherapy are two of the fastest growing professions in the NHS, increasing by 2,030 or 20 per cent. and 1,970 or 14 per cent. respectively since 1997.
<P>

<a name="30402w22.html_para3">Occupational therapy training places have increased by 605 and physiotherapy training places by 687 since 1997 and are set to rise further as part of the NHS Plan commitment to provide 4,450 more training places for therapists and other key professional staff by 2004.

<a name="30402w22.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Councils are asked to implement eligibility criteria in accordance with Department of Health guidance on 'Fair access to care services', by 7 April 2003. Through implementing the guidance, councils will fulfil the first stage requirement of standard one of the national service framework for older people with respect to rooting out age discrimination. This is because the eligibility framework focuses entirely on needs and risks and makes no reference to age. Implementation of the guidance will also assist councils to review wider policies for, and access to, adult social care in pursuit of standard one.

 The Government's policy, as set out in Changing the Outlook a Strategy for Developing and Modernising Mental Health Services in Prisons, December 2001, is that prisoners who were on the care programme approach (CPA) before coming into prison should be able to have their programmes of treatment continued as far as possible within the prison setting. Prisoners whose clinical profile would precipitate CPA in the community should commence on CPA in prison. The NHS Plan included firm commitments that, by 2004, all prisoners with severe mental illness will be in receipt of treatment and no prisoner with a serious mental illness will leave prison without a care plan and a care co-ordinator.
<P>

<a name="30402w22.html_para6">Implementation of the prison mental health strategy will have the effect of applying the aftercare arrangements required under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to prisoners who, having been transferred to hospital for in-patient treatment, are subsequently returned to prison.
