To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent representations he has made to the Government of Angola about the reintergration of demobilised soldiers.  [141374]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The reintegration of demobilised soldiers is a key issue in the UK's regular discussions with the Government of Angola.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para1">Since the end of the war in April 2002, over 88,000 ex-combatants have benefited from the Government of Angola's own disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para2">DFID is supporting the World Bank's Multi-country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (MDRP) for the Great Lakes region of Africa with a contribution of $25 million. The specific programme for Angola (ADRP) is an integral part of the MDRP and is worth $180 million over the next two years. The programme formally starts in January 2004 and will focus mainly on providing social and economic reintegration assistance including training and employment opportunities for 138,000 former combatants from UNITA and the government's own forces. My department has actively participated in each of the World Bank missions held over the last 18 months in order to design and set up the ADRP. DFID was also one of two donor countries (together with the Netherlands) to participate in the executive committee of the ADRP Special Project that aimed to provide 50,000 ex-combatants with seeds and tools for the autumn 2003 planting season and training in basic livelihoods skills for another 3,000.

<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_wqn6"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress is being made with supplying food to vulnerable people in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  [141372]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DRC is considered as one of 38 countries requiring exceptional external assistance by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, as a result of the effects of civil strife and the presence of large numbers of displaced people and refugees. However not all vulnerable people in DRC require food aid, and the UN's assessed requirement for food aid in DRC is low relative to chronically food insecure countries such as 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2003 : Column 115W</I><P>
Sudan or Ethiopia. In these circumstances emergency help with health and nutrition can be more effective in reducing mortality than food aid.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para3">Between 2000 and 2003 the World Food Programme delivered 259,081 metric tonnes (mt) of food for DRC. WFP began a distribution of 46,000mt of food aid in the east of the country in June this year in response to high levels of malnutrition there. This project is due to finish on 15 December. Just under 40per cent. of the requested food aid (17,237mt) has been distributed. DFID has not made a specific contribution to this, although it is supporting food aid distribution in the same area through the International Relief NGO, CESVI.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para4">DFID has steadily increased its humanitarian programme in DRC over the past five years.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para5">This year we will spend over 10 million on emergency humanitarian relief. Much of this is for emergency medical interventions, rather than food aid. We are also committed to supporting the new transitional national government and the political transitiongenerally in DRC. It is only with a lasting political solution that the needs of vulnerable people can be properly addressed.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether the &#163;60 million being held in the Treasury to be drawn down to assist humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq has been <i>(a)</i> drawn down to contribute to the Madrid pledge and <i>(b)</i> withdrawn.  [141512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The &#163;60 million is included in the UK's total Madrid pledge of &#163;544 for the three years from April 2003.&#163;30.8 million of it has already been allocated, primarily towards meeting the costs of UK secondments to the Coalition Provisional Authority. The allocation of the remainder is under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_wqn8"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action is being taken to prevent the assault and rape of civilians by gunmen in Liberia.  [141371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The international community has put in place a peacekeeping force under the direction of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). UNMIL has successfully created an arms free zone in Monrovia, and plans progressively to extend its influence over the entire country as it builds up to its full complement of 15,000 peacekeepers by March.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para6">The most effective way to provide security and protection for Liberian civilians is for all factions to implement the Accra Peace Agreement, signed in 17 August, beginning with instructions to their followers to disarm and demobilise. The UK, as part of the international contact group on Liberia, is supporting the implementation of the agreement. Plans to support the process and to reform the security services, including the police, as part of the reconstruction of Liberia are being taken forward by the UN and donors.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the humanitarian situation in Sool Plateau in Somalia; and what assistance he has offered.  [141369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w01.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
: Approximately 90,000 pastoralists are at risk from the failure of the autumn rains in northern Somalia. The global malnutrition rate for the Sool plateau is just under 14 per cent., which indicates the need for close monitoring rather than immediate intervention.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para7">The humanitarian response includes: greater use of targeted family rations by WFP alongside UNICEF's supplementary feeding programme to screened children, monitoring of the health and nutrition situation; cash assistance to allow communities meet their non-food needs especially water, transport for livestock and/or people and to some extent pay up for accumulated credit; emergency water provision; emergency health services provision and veterinary services.
<P>

<a name="31204w01.html_para8">A United Nations assessment found a difficult situation although not yet a humanitarian crisis. We are envisaging a contribution to a UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs emergency response fund that is likely to appear as an amendment to the 2004 Consolidated Appeal for Somalia. The UN's Children Fund received &#163;1 million from DFID for its health and nutrition work in Somalia in March 2003. We will be making some further contributions to meet humanitarian needs in Somalia very soon.

 From commencement of 2003&#150;04 flu vaccination campaign to 31 October 2003, 56.7 per cent. of the over 65 population in NI have received flu vaccination. This is up on the same period of 2002&#150;03, when the figure was 56.3 per cent. In the under 65 "at risk" group for the period to 31 October, 41.4 per cent. of these have received flu vaccination.

<P>

<a name="31204w02.html_para1">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety ran the Influenza Immunisation Campaign. This included a TV advertisement and the vast majority of those eligible for immunisation also received a personal invite from their GP along with a detailed information leaflet. In October the Department also issued a second letter to GPs, Boards, Trusts advising that the influenza virus was circulating and exhorting them to take urgent action to encourage uptake of the vaccine, in particular among at risk children. Additional interviews for TV and radio encouraged those eligible to get the flu vaccine. At local levels, HSS Trusts and GPs took action to increase the uptake.

 Boeing and BAE Systems (with SERCO and Spectrum Capital) make up the Tanker and Transport Service Company (TTSC), one of the bidding consortia for MOD's Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) competition. The competition is on-going and it would therefore be inappropriate to make a statement. I have, however, recently met with both consortia concerned (AirTanker and TTSC) to discuss the UK industrial implications of their respective bids.

 Legal responsibility for energy security is shared by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Ofgem. The Secretary of State is responsible for setting the overall regulatory framework for the supply of electricity. A key part of that framework is set out in section 3A of the Electricity Act 1989 as amended by the Utilities Act 2000 and includes the objectives "to protect the interests of consumers". To this end the Secretary of State has made a new statutory instrument (The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002) requiring electricity distribution companies to prevent interruption of supply as far as is reasonably practical.
<P>

<a name="31204w02.html_para6">Electricity for domestic consumers is provided through their contracts with electricity supply companies, which are trading organisations, not responsible for the electricity infrastructure such as overhead lines. The local infrastructure is the responsibility of electricity distribution companies. In each electricity distribution region the physical supply of electricity to customers is the responsibility of a monopoly Distribution Network Operator (DNO), regulated through an Ofgem licensing system. The Secretary of State lays down the Standard Licence Conditions. Enforcement of the licence conditions is for Ofgem.

 The Euratom programme covers both fission and fusion research and includes areas of research, like radiation protection, that the Nuclear Skills Group (NSG) <sup>1</sup>  indicated might face a domestic skills shortage in the future. It allows the UK to be part of large scale cutting edge international projects like the fusion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The programme provides opportunities for UK researchers to collaborate with other EU research groups encouraging the spread of best practice. It has a role to play in maintaining expertise and attracting younger scientists in a sector currently facing considerable change.

 The cost of managing Britain's civil public sector nuclear waste is included within the estimated total of nuclear liabilities which currently stand at around &#163;48 billion. Reliable estimates of annual costs are hard to identify as there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding both the total of the liabilities, and the ongoing operational imperatives and constraints at individual nuclear sites. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which is intended to be operational from April 2005, will need to establish more certainty on the overall liabilities and annual costs. To this end the government has already started preparation of lifecycle baselines for NDA sites that will provide the basis for estimating the costs of clean up going forward. The NDA will be operating within the overall framework of Government policy on decommissioning and waste management and will need to manage the clean up programme accordingly.

 The DTI has received a number of reports and recommendations from stakeholders about the draft Directive. The majority of these have been against the proposals. Since we believe that the draft Directive would effectively weaken consumer protection, and there was little support for a change of system, the UK did not support the Directive in Council Working Group discussions. At Coreper (Committee of Permanent Representatives to the EU), it was decided that the draft Directive and Progress Report would not go forward to the Council of Ministers on 27 November because of the lack of agreement.

<a name="31204w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The information in the table. shows the number of hours flown on average by pilots based at RAF Marham, by month. These figures include hours flown by exchange pilots from foreign air forces serving with RAF Squadrons based at the Station, as these are not recorded separately. On average there are two such pilots at the Station, and they would normally fly at the same rate as RAF pilots. The figures include hours flown by Marham-based pilots deployed on Operation TELIC, hence the increase in March and April 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the original target date for the completion of work on surge capacity was; what the reasons were for the delay; and if he will make a statement.  [140983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 We had planned to advise the Defence Committee of the results of the work on the need for a surge capability by the end of 2002. It took longer than anticipated to obtain all the relevant background information, but this meant that we were able to take account of the Ministry of Defence Police's experience in meeting extra commitments during Operation TELIC. The work resulted in recommendations for a modest increase in capability, including improved co-ordination and responsiveness.

 No research has been undertaken into the reasons for inter-departmental differences in the cost of answering parliamentary questions. The Treasury update the averages cost figures annually, the basis of the calculation having been explained by the Chief Secretary in a written answer on 22 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 417W.

 There are no estimates below the national level for the take-up rate of Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), or for the number of families entitled to claim it.

<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what research has been carried out by the Treasury into the likely impact of the Child Trust Fund on attitudes to savings.  [141704]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Child Trust Fund is an initiative with multiple objectives:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to help people understand the benefits of saving and investing;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to encourage parents and children to develop the savings habit and engage with financial institutions;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to ensure that in future all children have a financial asset at te start of adult life to invest in their futures; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to build on financial education to help people make better financial choices throughout their lives.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para1">The Government first consulted on the Child Trust Fund in "Saving and Assets for AH", published in April 2001. The Government received a large number of responses from a wide variety of sources, including financial services providers, consumer organisations, academics, charities and other interested parties. Respondents broadly supported the principles underlying the Child Trust Fund, as reported in the follow-up document "Delivering Savings & Assets", which was published in November 2001. Both of these documents are available on the Treasury website.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para2">Recent surveys by non-Governmental organisations have also shown that the Child Trust Fund is likely to be a popular initiative with families and has the potential to improve attitudes towards savings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the impact of the Child Trust Fund on the incomes of the <i>(a)</i> poorest quintile of 18-year-olds, <i>(b)</i> the richest quintile of 18-year-olds and <i>(c)</i> other quintiles.  [141706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 CTF funds are accessible on their holder's 18th birthday and they might have an impact on income at that point because of investment returns, or indirectly thanks to enabling young people to take up opportunities which enhance their incomes. The magnitude of the indirect impact on incomes would depend on a variety of factors.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para3">It is not possible to give a definitive figure for the impact of the CTF on incomes of the identified groups.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to extend aspects of the Child Trust Fund scheme to children born before 1 September 2002.  [141708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Eligibility for the Child Trust Fund is already back-dated from its expected launch date in April 2005 to 1 September 2002 to include as many children as possible in the school cohort being born at the time of the Budget 2003 CTF announcement.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para4">There is already a wide range of savings and investments parents can make for older children. Extending particular aspects of the Child Trust Fund to children born before 1 September 2002 would create another savings product and the risk of confusion. Financial providers will also be in a position to respond to any demand for certain aspects of the Fund.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what ethical restrictions will be placed on the kind of investments which Child Trust Funds can make.  [141709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government understand that people may object to certain types of accounts because of their ethical or religious beliefs. In recent years there has been a growth in 'ethical' investment funds and there is increasing interest in funds compliant with Islamic Shariah law.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para5">The Government would welcome CTF providers including products which are compatible with ethical or religious beliefs. We are not proposing to prohibit investment in non-ethical funds&#151;as this would be hard to police, and consumers will be able to exercise their choice.

<a name="31204w07.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Saving Gateway is at the pilot stage and is being evaluated for its effect on savings behaviour. The final evaluation report is expected in February 2005 and an update will be provided following the pre-Budget report.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B>

<P>
<P>

 A decision on the charge cap for the CTF will be announced shortly.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the expected cost is to the Exchequer of child trust funds for each of the next 25 years.  [141712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew11"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Estimates of the cost in the first three years were published in Budget 2003 and will be updated in the pre-Budget report. The bulk of the cost to the Exchequer consists of the Annually Managed Expenditure for the initial Government endowments, which varies with birth cohort size and is therefore expected to be relatively stable after 2005&#150;06. Costs to the Exchequer due to the tax loss from the small proportion of savings that would otherwise have been in taxable savings vehicles are negligible in the initial years and may then rise slowly, until the first accounts mature in 18 years. After this the cost of the tax loss is expected to remain stable. Tax loss will be small or negligible compared to the costs of the endowments. Estimates are not available for the cost of any further Government contributions at age 7 as the value of these has yet to be decided.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew12"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The proposed arrangements build on the structure that operates effectively for ISAs.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para6">CTF providers will be FSA authorised. The FSA ensures that all FSA&#151;authorised firms are run in a prudent and financially sound way and regulates their business practices, including the sales process.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the expected cost is of the planned information programme about child trust funds.  [141714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w07.html_spnew13"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 One of the key aims of the CTF is to improve financial literacy and help people make better financial choices throughout their life.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para8">The Government has commissioned research into how best to communicate information about the CTF and the financial decisions involved, with a view to addressing the needs in particular of parents with little or no experience of savings and investment.
<P>

<a name="31204w07.html_para9">Until this research is completed and the information programme is fully specified and finalised, it is not possible to provide an exact figure for the expected cost of this programme, although it forms part of current forecasts of the overall Revenue implementation costs for the CTF.

 Defra provides funding for capital flood defence schemes in England which meet set criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score.

<P>
<a name="31204w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I understand that to date, the Environment Agency has paid Atkins Water fees totalling &#163;145,000 in relation to the Hereford Flood Alleviation Scheme. The work carried out includes feasibility studies, environmental investigations, hydraulic river modelling, design, public consultation and liaison with other public bodies. A further &#163;155,000 will be paid to Atkins Water by the Agency for completion of the project appraisal report. Detailed design of the scheme will cost an estimated &#163;200,000 which will bring the total expenditure on fees to Atkins Water to approximately &#163;500,000, a sum that the Agency believes reflects the particular complexities associated with the scheme, which is currently forecast to cost some &#163;4.2 million.

 The Rural Land Register digitisation project does not change the designation of land parcels but it is intended to increase the certainty and accuracy of Defra's records. A small number of farmers have queried changes to the eligible area of their land made as a result of a change to the gross field size. These have been dealt with on an individual basis.

TNA also provides digital copies of other records on demand over the internet. Many of TNA's online services are free of charge, including the award winning Learning Curve gallery, which provides online content for school teachers and pupils working on Key Stages 2 to 4 of the History National Curriculum, and the Pathways to the Past section of the website, which includes a wide variety of online material aimed at lifelong learners.

<P>
<a name="31204w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 December 2003]:</i> The Secretary of State sets no targets for the number of detectives. The number of detectives for any given Basic Command Unit or specialist unit is ultimately a matter for chief officers of police and will depend on factors such as local crime patterns and the strategy to address them.

 <i>[holding answer 1 December 2003]:</i> We have no such plans. However, under the provisions of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2004, which we intend to bring into effect early next year, it will be an offence to have an imitation firearms in a public place without reasonable excuse. We shall be looking closely at the whole question of controlling imitation firearms as part of a comprehensive review of the firearms legislation, starting with the publication of a consultation paper in January.

 None. Both the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 and the Knives Act 1997 deal with the sale of knives. Section 6 of the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 makes it an offence to sell knives to persons under 16 and section 1 of the Knives Act 1997 makes it an offence to market a knife in a way which indicates, or suggests, that it is suitable for combat or is otherwise likely to stimulate or encourage violent behaviour involving the use of a knife as a weapon.

<P>
<a name="31204w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2003]:</i> My officials have consulted Treasury colleagues on the possible use of tax incentives to encourage the installation of physical security measures by businesses. However, we are not convinced that a tax incentive scheme is the best way to help small retailers facing crime problems. In particular, it could be perceived as unfair in that it would offer no assistance to businesses (arguably those in most need of help) that do not make enough profit to pay corporation tax. We also understand that the administration and compliance costs of such a system (to both businesses and the Government) would be high.
<P>

<a name="31204w12.html_para3">However, the Home Office has received &#163;15 million funding from the Treasury's Capital Modernisation Fund for the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas initiative. By the end of this year, this scheme will have provided security measures and environmental improvements to over 12,500 small retailers and businesses in some of our most deprived areas. Part of the evaluation of this scheme will assess the effect this funding will have had in promoting the benefits of crime reduction and encouraging the recipients and others to take forward further crime reduction activity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport under what legislation private operators of <i>(a)</i> local authority car parks and <i>(b)</i> privately owned car parks may pursue (i) civil action and (ii) criminal action for unpaid fines levied on late and non-payers of car park charges; and when guidance on these matters was last issued by the Department.  [141876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 On entering a local authority owned car park or a private car park a user is effectively agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of its use, which should be displayed clearly. Paragraphs 14&#150;16 of Local Authority Circular 1/90 dated 14 May 1990 covered information at car parks and drew attention to the need for local authorities to provide adequate information to users of their car parks, particularly about such matters as charges.
<P>

<a name="31204w12.html_para9">Section 32 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 empowers local authorities to provide off street car parks and section 35 enables them to impose conditions on their use, including charges. Failure to comply with such conditions is an offence under section 35 A of the Act.
<P>

<a name="31204w12.html_para10">A local authority may pursue non-payment of any charges incurred in connection with use of one of their car parks through a magistrates court. Alternatively, if they have obtained decriminalised parking enforcement powers, a penalty charge for non-compliance with the conditions of use may be issued by the authority under section 76 of the Road Traffic Act 1991. Under Schedule 6 to that Act an authority may take steps to enforce payment of a penalty charge through the Traffic Enforcement Centre at Northampton County Court.
<P>

<a name="31204w12.html_para11">Privately owned car parks are private property and charges and conditions for their use are a contractual matter between the owner and users. This is not a matter that is the subject of public legislation and it would be for the owner to pursue any unpaid charges as a civil rather than criminal matter.

 Local roads are a matter for the relevant local authority. As far as the strategic road network in England is concerned low noise surfaces will generally be used as a matter of course when maintenance is due. And the Secretary of State announced to the House on 1 April 2003 that we expect quieter surfacing to have been installed on over 60 per cent. of the trunk road network, including all concrete stretches, within the period of the 10 year plan. Following consultation, we announced that four criteria would be used to prioritise the resurfacing of concrete roads. They are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wherever possible, the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;
<P>
<BR>
Priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;
<P>
<BR>
The works will be carried out in such a way as to minimise disruption to the general public and other users of the network; and
<P>
<BR>
Priority will be given to roads opened since June 1988 where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the public inquiry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department's view is that road markings make an important contribution to road safety on inter-urban rural roads by clearly defining the path to be followed, by separating conflicting movements and by delineating the road edge on unlit roads at night.
<P>

<a name="31204w13.html_para3">The Department has collaborated in a joint European project on road markings and their effect on driver behaviour, in which 15 countries pooled their research resources. This established, among other findings, that drivers on inter-urban rural roads find it difficult to steer accurately at night if they cannot see the road markings sufficiently far ahead.
<P>

<a name="31204w13.html_para4">With regard to rural villages, the Department commissioned TRL to monitor a traffic management scheme in Stiffkey, Norfolk which included the removal of centre lines. We have also commissioned the "Drivers and Traffic Calming" project to examine the effect of psychological (non-physical) traffic calming measures in both urban and village locations, some of which involve the removal of white lines.

<P>
<a name="31204w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Extensive research was undertaken during the 1980s, which contributed to the decision to introduce central reserve barrier onto the trunk road network in 1986. The majority of product placed on the network at that time was tensioned steel barrier. More recently, different types of barrier have been placed on the network, including wire-rope and concrete barrier. Data obtained from the in-service performance of these

products over time is now being used to support research into the cost and safety-effectiveness of different types of central reserve barrier.
<P>

<a name="31204w13.html_para5">The research is considering the performance characteristics of different barrier types, as well as the whole life construction, maintenance, repair and replacement costs, including traffic delay costs and safety risks to operatives carrying out the work. This research is expected to be completed in early 2004 and will help in the understanding of how to prevent cross-over accidents.

Mandatory maritime security requirements were first introduced under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990, and the industry has been subject to security regulation since then. Inspectors carry out monitoring and compliance inspections, both in the UK and overseas, to ensure that security measures are properly implemented.
<P>

<a name="31204w14.html_para0">Following the events of 11 September 2001 all transport security programmes were reviewed and enhanced and they are kept under continuous review in light of the prevailing threat. While we can never be complacent, we believe that the core policies, baseline measures and the current levels of security required are appropriate to the current situation. For obvious reasons, it is not our practice to detail the required security measures.
<P>

<a name="31204w14.html_para1">The national regime will be augmented next year with the implementation of the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global maritime security regime. The security assessments and security plans that are required by the IMO's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) are designed to identify and address existing vulnerabilities.
<P>

<a name="31204w14.html_para2">The UK's existing maritime security regime, the ISPS Code requirements and a forthcoming EU Regulation are being drawn together to form the basis of a new National Maritime Security Programme. This programme will include both mandatory security measures and industry best practice guidelines and will provide a consistent, holistic approach to further enhance the security of the maritime sector.

 Quasi-judicial powers are administrative powers which must be exercised in accordance with the rules of natural justice. In taking quasi-judicial decisions, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister must act and be seen to act fairly and even-handedly, by bringing an unbiased and properly directed mind to his consideration of the matter. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister must take into account all relevant matters and not take into account irrelevant ones. These factors do not necessarily differ from the factors to be taken into account in other decisions but there may be a different degree of scrutiny by the courts.

In addition, it noted improvements in the management of the agriculture budget, especially in the area of payments and in the Integrated Administration and Control System.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the range of funding available through the formula spending share per pupil in local education authorities.  [141772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government funds a basic amount per pupil, which is the same everywhere, plus top-ups for deprived pupils,again the same amount per pupil wherever they live, and further top up for areas with high recruitment and retention costs. Authorities receiving more through the top-ups receive a higher level of funding per pupil, reflecting their relatively greater need.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Flat rate fees force all students to pay the same fee, regardless of the quality of their course, the demand for it, and the return they get from it. Fixed fees mean that there would be no Office for Fair Access, no progress on widening access and no bursaries for poorer students; and they continue to subsidise rich students at the expense of poorer ones. Flat fees would also require universities to charge the required amount even where they wished to offer a course at a lower charge. Variable fees suffer none of these drawbacks: they are fairer than flat rate fees.

 In March 2002 we launched the Choice Protects Programme which aims to improve placement choice and stability for looked after children. The first tranche of the three year &#163;113 million grant was given to local authorities to expand and strengthen their fostering services. At national level we have taken action to improve foster carers' pension entitlement and tax position. We have commissioned the Fostering Network to produce recruitment guidelines and are developing a publicity pack to help local authority recruitment of foster carers. Both of these will be available early next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has received few recent representations about school funding issues in North Yorkshire. On 29 October he announced proposals to restore stability to school funding. Further information about funding for next year was announced on 19 November as part of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement. In 2004&#150;05 all authorities will see an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of at least 5 per cent. per pupil: North Yorkshire's increase is 6 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The School Admissions Code of Practice states that, exceptionally, admission authorities for schools under special measures or those that have recently come out of them may refuse to admit a challenging child, outside the normal year of entry and where there are places available, on the grounds that admission would prejudice the provision of effective education or the efficient use of resources. This will normally only be appropriate if they already have a particularly high concentration of pupils with challenging behaviour, or the child is particularly challenging,

<a name="31204w20.html_para2">Last month I launched the schools' anti-bullying Charter for Action at the first of a series of regional DfES anti-bullying conferences. We hope primary and secondary schools will adopt the Charter or adapt it to create their own. The Charter includes good practice suggestions. We are also producing audit and training materials for primary schools which deal with bullying as well as other aspects of managing behaviour and attendance. These supplement the DfES guidance pack "Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence" which helps schools develop and implement their anti-bullying policies.

The figure for 2004&#150;05 is lower than that in previous years because the Department invested additional funds in excess of the allocated budget in the spending period.

 The impact of the decision to fund support for Millennium Volunteers through Connexions will be significant. It will ensure that the programme will be more responsive to the needs of young people and their local communities and that the programme will be marketed and supported alongside a range of support for young people. The early pilots of Connexions delivery have demonstrated that additional investment in the programme can be achieved as well as economies of scale in areas such as data collection, marketing and celebration events.

At that stage, repayments are credited to the student's loan account as at the date they were collected. Interest on student loans is calculated annually, set every year from 1 September based on the Retail Prices Index published in April for the previous year.

Of the maximum 12.5 per cent. channel management fee, 10 per cent. is performance-related, designed to reward excellence by the channel supplier in meeting channel objectives. An independent governance authority, drawing on the work of an independent research agency where appropriate, will evaluate supplier performance.

 The Education (Special Educational Needs) (England) (Consolidation) Regulations 2001 set out the actions that an authority must take to comply with a Tribunal order. If the authority does not comply within the appropriate period, the parent may complain to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. It will then be open to him to issue a direction under sections 496 or 497 of the Education Act 1996. Section 496 applies if the local education authority has acted unreasonably with respect to the exercise of any power or duty. Section 497 applies if the authority has failed to discharge a duty imposed on them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures the Department has taken since 1997 to reduce truancy in secondary schools; and what the cost was of each programme. [R]  [140583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31204w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Departmental expenditure on attendance-specific measures includes around &#163;700,000 on publicity materials aimed at parents, practitioner conferences and research into truancy, &#163;11.25 million for electronic registration systems in secondary schools and around &#163;500,000 for intensive expert support for education welfare services in 60 local education authorities.
<P>

<a name="31204w22.html_para12">This is in addition to funding for a wide range of measures to improve behaviour and attendance provided by the School Inclusion: Pupil Support Grant between 1999 and 2003, through the Behaviour Improvement Programme since 2002 and through the behaviour and attendance strands of the Key Stage 3 Strategy and the Primary Strategy from 2003. Because many of these measures relate to both behaviour and attendance, expenditure on reducing truancy in secondary schools cannot be disaggregated.

<P>
<a name="31204w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The level of truancy is properly expressed as the percentage of all available half days missed due to unauthorised absence. The data for unauthorised absences from secondary schools in 1997/98 and 2002/03 are in the following table:
