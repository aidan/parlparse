 To ask the Secretary of State for Wales whether the draw-down by the National Assembly for Wales of its allocation under EU structural funds on top of its Barnett-determined budget resulted in a reconciliation deduction in the overall block grant for Wales in each year since 2005. [287273]</p>

 Until 2005-06 departmental expenditure limits only included the expenditure element of EU structural funds and additions were made to the Wales departmental expenditure limit beyond the Barnett Formula. The receipts were paid separately to the National Assembly for Wales and were therefore identified separately in the calculation of the block grant.</p>

Thus no deduction is now necessary. The receipts continue to be paid into  the Welsh Consolidated Fund and are additional to the block grant.</p>

 We constantly strive to maximise the positive and mitigate the negative effects of all agricultural production by working closely with industry to ensure our food is produced in a sustainable and affordable way. We are also keen to maintain a thriving farming and food sector which can improve its net impact on a healthy, resilient, productive and diverse natural environment.</p>

Each activity aims to target the reduction of environmental and climate change impacts and assess the positive benefits to the landscape and biodiversity of animal husbandry while also highlighting any areas for further research and improvement.</p>

The only significant burial of animals occurred during the 2001 Foot and Mouth emergency where there were 992 on-farm disposals of carcases in England and Wales. Due to the precautions taken at the time to identify suitable sites and the removal of material in some cases, very few residual risks were identified in the comprehensive review that was subsequently undertaken by DEFRA. Monitoring was found to be necessary at approximately 3 per cent. of the original burial sites. No unacceptable impact on the environment has been found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"><a name="90716w0005.htm_para14"><a name="09071664001154">Following the outbreak, DEFRA, in consultation with the Environment Agency, commissioned an independent review of each site using a source&gt;pathway&gt;receptor staged approach. The consultants concluded that none of the 992 sites posed an unacceptable risk to the environment but recommended that 32 of the sites be subject to ongoing water quality monitoring. Monitoring of these sites commenced in 2003 and is ongoing. The results are made available to the Environment Agency on a quarterly basis. This ongoing monitoring has identified that although there have been occasional exceedences of the precautionary threshold levels at a number of sites, they are often one-off spikes and are not consistent. These exceedences are considered to reflect the fact that samples are obtained from natural bodies of water in agricultural settings and reflect agricultural practice in the vicinity rather than results from the carcase disposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_527"><a name="90716w0005.htm_para15"><a name="09071664001155">Since 2001, DEFRA has retained and managed four animal burial sites. Of these sites, only one (Watchtree, Cumbria) releases processed water into the watercourse. This is treated water from the burial cells finished using reed-bed technologies which is subject to a managed discharge consent issued by the Environment Agency. While there have been isolated instances of permitted levels being breached, these have almost been exclusively due to unseasonal rainfall which increases the suspended solids content, and none have resulted in poor river quality being reported. The three remaining sites (Tow Law, Co Durham, Ridgeway Ground, Worcestershire and Birkshaw Forest, Dumfries and Galloway) are closed sites with water products been stored and tanked to an appropriate location for treatment. Ground water run-off surrounding the sites is also monitored with the results shared with the Environment Agency, no recurring breaches have been reported and any isolated breaches have been actively resolved in conjunction with the appropriate regulatory agencies.</p>

 In 2005, DEFRA introduced further provisions within The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act to tackle nuisance parking. Specifically, section 3 of Act makes it an offence for a person to place two or more vehicles for sale (for the purposes of a business) on roads where they are within 500 metres of each other. The offence is not intended to target individual private sellers of single vehicles, rather the nuisance that is caused by the presence of numbers of vehicles being offered for sale by the same person or business. Any person found guilty of such an offence can be fined up to £2,500.</p>

 As detailed in the Help Scheme Agreement, the £603 million estimated cost of the help scheme will be divided into annual amounts for the purpose of funding the scheme. The ITV Yorkshire region (covering the Vale of York and North Yorkshire) does not switch until 2011, therefore to date there has been no spend in this region. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of running the scheme to date in England since a large proportion of the costs are fixed costs that are associated with developing and running the scheme across the UK as a whole.</p>

 The Digital Britain White Paper made clear our intention that the Digital Radio Upgrade programme should not result in listeners losing access to radio. We have also been clear that before the upgrade can begin DAB coverage must be comparable to the existing FM coverage, particularly for the BBC's services. In the case of Wales, we are also examining closely the impact of ceasing radio broadcasts on MW, which many listeners in Wales rely upon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_559"><a name="90716w0010.htm_para4"><a name="09071664001918">Therefore we are not, at this time, planning specific provisions to address residential properties in <i> (a)</i> Powys; <i> (b)</i> Wales; <i> (c)</i> each region of England; <i> (d)</i> Scotland; and <i> (e)</i><i> </i>Northern Ireland which are not able to receive digital radio signals once services migrate to digital.

 Those eligible for the help scheme can only be broken down by ITV regions. The Help Scheme estimates around 640,000 people in the ITV Yorkshire region will be eligible to receive help, although this number is likely to change between now and when the region switches in 2011.

 There are already 44,000 workers employed in the civil nuclear industry in the UK. New nuclear build in the UK has the potential to require thousands of workers and Government are working to ensure that the contribution of UK workers to nuclear new build projects is maximised. The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan and Low Carbon Industrial Strategy published yesterday (15 July) explains this in more detail.</p>

Specifically we are improving science provision in schools, have charged the Sector Skills Council with taking forward a training strategy, and have helped set up the National Skills Academy for Nuclear to improve the supply of specialist skills at all levels. In addition, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) is conducting a review of productivity and skills in the engineering construction sector which will establish whether there is anything more Government or industry can do to ensure British firms and workers are fully equipped to fill vital jobs in nuclear new build and other large scale engineering construction.</p>

 The Central Department completed an equality impact assessment of its new probation policy and assessed it as having low negative impact.

This is because deaths registered after a coroner's inquest usually state the immediate physical condition which caused death as the underlying cause, and not any mental or behavioural disorder which may have led to that condition.</p>

 All Government Departments seek to ensure that their dealings with the public are as helpful and productive as possible. Central Government Departments are required to declare the levels of avoidable telephone contact in their Departments as assessed at April 2008 and to halve these values by March 2011. The Cabinet Office has focussed its attentions on the Department for Transport (DFT), Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and NHS Direct. These Departments account for around  90 per cent. of telephone contact with central Government.

This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999-2000), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Figures prior to 1999-00 exclude any expenditure on service, strategy and regulation.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Denotes figures are not available or have not been scored on a consistent basis.<br>
<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. The expenditure data to 1998-99 are drawn from the annual 'R01' spending returns which local authorities submitted to the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) (now CLG). Figures for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the then DFES (now DCSF). Figures for 2002-03 onwards are taken from Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is marked by an empty row.<br>
2. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DCSF Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
3. From 2002-03 onwards the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002-03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately £70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately £50 per pupil of the England total in 2002-03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded from the school based expenditure calculation, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
4. Expenditure was distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sector until the inception of Section 52 for the 1999-00 financial year. Consequently we have provided a combined figure for pre-primary and primary schools for 1996-97 to 2001-02 financial years.<br>
5. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables.<br>
6. Secondary school based expenditure includes all expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained secondary schools. It is not possible from existing sources to distinguish this expenditure between expenditure on 11 to 16-year-olds and expenditure on 6th form pupils attending maintained secondary schools.<br>
7. The expenditure data for 1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
8. Figures are rounded to the nearest £10. As reported by York local authority as at 10 July 2009.<br>
9. Cash figures are converted to 2008-09 prices using the 30 June 2009 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families with reference to paragraph 2.25, page 32 of his Department's publication, "Your child, your schools, our future", what is the research evidence referred to. [286886]</p>

<p><a name="st_339"><a name="0907172001299"><a name="90716w0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="0907172006588"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 The following is a summary of the research evidence referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 2.25 of "Your child, your schools, our future, building a 21<sup>(st)</sup> century schools system":</p>

<p><a name="stpa_667"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para0"><a name="0907172001300"><i> Summary of research evidence on the importance of high quality teaching and teachers:</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_668"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para1"><a name="0907172001301">1. Having high quality teachers and teaching is essential to the achievement of whole-school success. Improvements in teaching have been facilitated by organisational factors, for example, careful recruitment, quality assurance schemes, support for teachers to focus on teaching and sharing of good practice (Rudd et al., 2002).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_669"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para2"><a name="0907172001302">2. Barber and Mourshed (2007) at McKinsey and Company, argued that the biggest driver of variation in pupil learning is teacher effectiveness and present a strong argument for focusing on recruiting high quality teachers in order to raise attainment of pupils. In particular, they refer to a US study by Sanders and Rivers (1996) that showed that two average eight-year-old pupils placed with different teachers diverged in their performance by more than 50 percentile points within three years. However, this study needs to be treated with caution as the research was conducted in a small number of schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_670"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para3"><a name="0907172001303">3. Slater et al. (2009) estimated the effect of individual teachers on pupil outcomes, and the variability of teacher quality, which they refer to as teacher's impact on test scores. They used a unique primary dataset linking over 7,000 pupils, their exam results and prior attainment to the individual teachers who taught them. They found that a high quality teacher (75<sup>(th)</sup> percentile) compared to a low quality teacher (25<sup>(th)</sup> percentile) can add 0.425 of a GCSE point per subject to a given pupil, or 25 per cent. of the standard deviation of GCSE points. This further demonstrates the importance of having effective teachers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_671"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para4"><a name="0907172001304"><i> Summary of research evidence suggesting that pupils from deprived backgrounds are less likely to experience good quality teaching:</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_672"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para5"><a name="0907172001305">1. There is evidence to suggest that pupils from deprived backgrounds may be less likely to experience good quality teaching. Sammons et al. (2006), in an analysis of teaching practice in 125 year 5 classes, found that the quality of teaching tended to be poorer in schools with higher levels of pupils eligible for free school meals. Differences were apparent in areas such as basic skills development, depth of subject knowledge, social support for learning, pupil engagement and classroom routines. Cabinet Office (2008a) cited evidence that teachers in schools with more than 20 per cent. FSM eligibility were more likely to be rated worse in their teaching, and less likely to have come from an outstanding teacher training institution. Furthermore, Thrupp and Lupton (2006) reported that unchallenging work was evident among schools with deprived intakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_673"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para6"><a name="0907172001306">2. Also, secondary schools with higher proportions of pupils eligible for FSM have, on average, teachers with lower levels of qualifications than other schools.  <br>

Charles et al. (2007) found that schools in the higher FSM quintiles had fewer teachers with degrees in the subject they taught, compared with schools in the lower FSM quintiles. This was true for most subjects analysed, with the exception of ICT and design and technology, in which teacher qualifications were higher in schools with higher proportions of FSM.</p>

 Existing exclusions guidance already contains strong messages on special educational needs (SEN) exclusion issues. The existing version of this guidance, last revised in September 2008, states that schools should try every practicable means to maintain a pupil with SEN in school, seeking local authority and other professional advice as appropriate. It goes on to state that this might include seeking local authority and other professional advice at "School Action Plus", or where appropriate, asking a local authority to consider carrying out a statutory assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_690"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para23"><a name="0907172001371">In addition, the guidance sets an expectation that, following a permanent exclusion, the head teacher should use the period between his or her initial decision and the meeting of the governing body to review the exclusion and to work with the local authority to see whether more support can be made available or whether the statement can be changed to name a new school. If either of these options is possible, the head teacher should normally withdraw the exclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="90716w0023.htm_para24"><a name="0907172001372">We will also be reinforcing the focus of behaviour and attendance partnerships on a range of outcomes, including the need to reduce disproportionately high exclusions of pupils with SEN in a new guidance due to be published later this year.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 9 July 2009]:</i><i> </i>The HPA carries out research on radiofrequency radiation, monitors other studies, and conducts comprehensive reviews of the scientific evidence. The independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) also prepares reviews for the HPA of the evidence for health effects. AGNIR published a review of health effects in relation to radio waves in 2003 (see documents of the NRPB, volume 14, number 2: "Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields: Report of an independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation"), and the HPA in 2004 (see documents of the NRPB, volume 15, number 3: "Review of the Scientific Evidence for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (0-300 GHz)"). These publications are both available on the HPA website. AGNIR is commencing another review of the health effects of radio wave exposures, which is expected to take two to three years to complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_720"><a name="90716w0026.htm_para0"><a name="0907172001568">A copy of the report "Report 2007" from the independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR), funded by Government and industry, has been placed in the Library. None of the studies completed demonstrated that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones or base stations. Further research is being carried out to address longer-term exposures and to assess whether hypersensitivity symptoms can be caused by exposure to terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) signals. Further information on these studies is available on the MTHR website at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_721"><a name="90716w0026.htm_para1"><a name="0907172001569">The HPA has concluded that there is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio waves from wireless networks adversely affects the health of the general population. Radiofrequency exposures are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones and well within the internationally accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The HPA keeps the situation under ongoing review. The HPA is carrying out a systematic programme of research into wireless local area networks and their use, expected to be complete in 2010.

These folders were stored at Wellington house, a Department of Health building. While preparing an inventory of these folders in July 2008, departmental officials became aware that they also contained documents relevant to the period before 1985 and a full assessment of the content of all the folders was therefore undertaken.</p>

All recipients of blood from the donors to these cases were traced and those living notified of their risk status. Some recipients of plasma products manufactured from United Kingdom sourced pooled plasma between 1980 and 2001 were identified as being potentially 'at risk' for vCJD as a result of their treatment in line with risk assessment advice from the CJD Incidents Panel in 2004.</p>

This will mean that people can have their symptoms assessed either over the phone or online. Those symptoms will be checked against an algorithm-a list of the key symptoms and factors that determine whether the patient in question has been exposed to the infection. If it is established that they have developed swine flu, they will if appropriate, be issued with an authorisation number that they will then need to access antivirals.

It is open to men, women and children with one day each week being set aside for women's exclusive use. One of the first major events hosted there was a US-funded agricultural fair to promote legal livelihoods attended by 1,700 Afghans.

 Civil legal aid covers a number of different areas of civil and family justice, and the extent to which applicants' financial circumstances are taken into account in granting legal aid varies considerably across these areas. It is therefore not possible to give figures for the number of people eligible for civil legal aid as a whole. However, some estimates of the likely number that would be eligible are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_779"><a name="90716w0030.htm_para11"><a name="0907172002013">The estimated proportion of the population of England and Wales who were eligible for civil legal aid, for categories in which financial circumstances were taken into account, was 29 per cent. in 2007. We do not have a figure for 2008. In 2009, we estimate that the figure for categories in which financial circumstances are taken into account is 36 per cent.. This increase in the eligible proportion of the population is likely to be due to the effects of the recession plus the 5 per cent. increase in the civil legal aid financial eligibility limits in April 2009. In 2007-08 civil legal aid helped over 1 million people with their civil and family legal problems.</p>

increasingly hard to justify the use of public funds in this way. They have therefore proposed the introduction of a fee to use their visitors' car park. The organisation is in the process of assessing the full extent of the car park running costs, and it is their intention that the income from the fee enables them to fully recover the costs. They are consulting with users, to gather their views on the level and structure of the charge. They will continue to provide free parking for holders of 'blue badges'.</p>

At the end of March 2009, an estimated 27,500 cases which remain on the computer system also require partial clerical action to keep maintenance flowing to children. As the Agency continues to improve its client service, increasing the number of cases receiving maintenance, any additional cases identified are immediately investigated and either progressed clerically or the issue is resolved to allow the case to be wholly managed by the Agency's computer system.</p>

1. Movement in arrears components is based on an estimate from internal figures and is only available from March 2007, so only two years of information can be provided.<br>
2. Arrears on each case have been calculated in the year to March 2007, March 2008 and March 2009. From this, each case has been classified as seeing an increase or a decrease in arrears across each year. The value of this increase or reduction has also been calculated.<br>
3. This will only take into account the net arrears movement across the year and may miss some payments that have subsequently been cancelled out by further increases in debt within the year.<br>
4. The figures for March 2009 are at the time of answering this question un-audited internal figures and are subject to revision which will be published in the CSA Annual Report and Accounts for 2008-09.<br>

 All police forces use a mixture of in-house services and those provided by external forensic suppliers to carry out forensic work. For example, crime scene investigators, who will generally be employed by a force, may find fingerprints and material which may carry traces of DNA. The fingerprints are compared with IDENT1, the national fingerprint computer system, which produces a shortlist of possible matches. The shortlist is then examined by fingerprint experts who work for the force Fingerprint Bureau to confirm a match. Analysis of material to produce DNA profiles is done by forensic suppliers rather than in-house. In other areas of forensic work, the balance between in-house and external services will vary depending on the nature of the material examined and decisions made by forces. Details of the position in each police force are not held centrally.</p>
