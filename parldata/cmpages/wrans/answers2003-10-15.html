To ask the Prime Minister how much was spent on food by his office in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; what proportion of that food by value was produced in the United Kingdom; what guidance he has issued to encourage the procurement of home-produced food; and if he will make a statement.  [129375]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Expenditure on food in the Prime Minister's Office is limited to official entertainment. For the total cost to my office for all official entertainment at 10 Downing Street and Chequers, I refer the hon. Member to the answers I gave the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on 28 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1444&#150;48W, and the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on 27 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 564W. Information on the total cost for 2002&#150;03 is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="31015w01.html_para0">Information on the proportion of food by value produced in the UK is not held and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="31015w01.html_para1">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has provided guidance for Government Departments and their agencies on local sourcing and how to remove obstacles to tendering faced by local and UK suppliers.

To ask the Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 18 September, <i>Official Report</i>, column 870W, on Iraq, whether the <i>(a)</i> chairman and <i>(b)</i> members of the (i) Intelligence and Security Committee, (ii) Defence and (iii) Foreign Affairs Select Committees were invited to comment on the content of the Iraq dossier before it was published.  [131915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As I said in my reply to my hon. Friend on 18 September, all three chairmen were briefed on the content of the Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction dossier by the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee on 19 September 2002, shortly before it was published.




<P>

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement about the advice which he received before the conflict on the impact of a military offensive against Iraq on the incidence of terrorism.  [131993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The assessment I received was that the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests came from al-Qaeda and related groups, and that this threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq. This assessment informed the Ministry of Defence's planning for military action, as well as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's consular planning and in the published Travel Advice.
<P>

<a name="31015w01.html_para3">When I took the decision that military action would be required to ensure that Iraq complied with United Nations Security Council Resolutions, I had to weigh all the factors, including the possible short term risk of increased terrorism, against the longer term risks of rogue states developing weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government are concerned by persistent reports that Syria is pursuing a programme for the development of weapons of mass destruction and believes that the best way to pursue those concerns is in a frank and critical dialogue with the Syrian Government.
<P>

<a name="31015w01.html_para4">We regularly urge all states to sign and ratify all the treaties and conventions covering the development of such weapons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The agreement reached at the WTO will enable poor countries with no, or insufficient pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity to import copies of patented medicines. The agreement is a very significant step which should help to reduce the price in poor countries of patented medicines that come onto the market after 2005.

 DFID provided &#163;161 million of bilateral development assistance to India in 2002&#150;03. In the New Delhi Declaration of January 2002 the Prime Minister looked forward to expenditure of over &#163;300 million.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what measures are in place to reduce the production of heroin in Afghanistan.  [132051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Afghan Transitional Administration have produced the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy and the UK Government are working in support of that strategy. The UK has committed to provide &#163;70 million over the next three years to target opium poppy cultivation and heroin production. This funding will be used for law enforcement, alternative livelihoods, institution building and research. DFID are providing funding for a range of alternative livelihoods activities designed to provide those involved in opium poppy cultivation with other ways of earning a living.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the impact on developing countries of the outcome of the fifth ministerial round of the World Trade Organisation meeting at Cancun.  [132052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w02.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The failure of the WTO ministerial talks in Cancun was a setback for the Doha Development Agenda and a blow to developing and developed countries alike. I believe that this failure will disadvantage the world's poorest countries most. Developing countries stand to get a better deal through multilateral negotiations in the WTO&#151;where developing countries make up two thirds of the membership&#151;than through a multitude of regional and bilateral agreements with bigger economic players.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31015w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 In setting up the Steering Group the Arts Council of Northern Ireland invited nominations from Foras na Gaeilge, Iontaobhas Ultach/Ultach Trust and Tha Boord o Ulster Scotch. These are the bodies partnering with the Arts Council in funding the research. A nomination was also invited from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as the Arts Council's sponsoring Department.
<P>

<a name="31015w02.html_para0">The Steering Group consists of seven members: three nominees of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and one nominee from each of the above organisations.

 The new traffic arrangements at the various sites in north Holland were not, principally, introduced as casualty reduction schemes. The information that has been provided by the Dutch shows that casualty figures at all the revised sites are at the level of one or none per year. We are happy that, in the context that they are being used in Holland, these ideas do not result in increases in casualties.
<P>

<a name="31015w03.html_para0">The Department for Transport is aware of two authorities in this country that have been considering applying some of the measures used in north Holland, but as redevelopment rather than accident reduction measures. From informal discussions with the authorities, it is understood they are now considering more familiar techniques such as 20 mph speed limit zones. We have not been approached by any authorities planning to remove traffic signals.

They will take forward the work started in May by the secondee from my Women and Equality Unit, in supporting Iraqi women and to help determine a national policy for women. I continue to meet with a group of Iraqi women to listen to their concerns and experiences, as well as discuss ways to support Iraqi women during this critical phase.

 While it is certainly most regrettable, Iceland's decision to undertake a programme of lethal scientific research on whales is perfectly legal and our only recourse is thus to diplomatic protest. I met the Icelandic ambassador to London in September and left him in no doubt as to the UK Government's views on Iceland's unjustified and unnecessary plan to kill 38 minke whales this year; (the actual take turned out to be 36). On 10 September the UK Government, represented by the UK ambassador to Iceland, led a demarche of 23 countries urging the Icelandic Government to reconsider its decision to proceed with so-called "scientific" whaling. A demarche on this scale is significant, and I hope that the Icelandic Government will reflect on it before deciding how to take matters forward for next year.

 Standards of safety in the maintenance and repair of nuclear submarines are ensured by the appointment of Radiation Protection Supervisors as defined by the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 (IRRs99). These Radiation Protection Supervisors ensure that the legally mandated local rules, written by the MOD or site operator as appropriate, are adhered to. The Naval Base Commanders employ Radiation Protection Advisers and Radiation Safety Officers to provide assurance and advice that these safety systems are being observed. In addition, MOD's internal regulatory body provides assurance on nuclear safety to senior functional safety boards and the independent Defence Nuclear Safety Committee. The Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installation Inspectorate (NII) also regulates MOD activities under IRRs99.

<a name="31015w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 IPM-7 type detectors are not suitable for use onboard submarines due to space constraints. Alternative procedures are therefore in place to ensure all personnel are thoroughly monitored for contamination on completion of their work before going ashore.
<P>

<a name="31015w04.html_para0">The safety regime for workers on nuclear submarines complies fully with legal requirements. Safety arrangements are regularly audited and inspected by naval base assurance personnel and regulated by both MOD's internal nuclear propulsion programme regulator and the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). As a responsible employer the MOD acts immediately on any advice or findings from these audits and inspections. The Department strives to adopt best industry practice and continues to invest in improvements in all forms of personal radiation monitoring equipment in order to ensure that all workers exposures are kept as low as is reasonably practicable.
<P>

<a name="31015w04.html_para1">A programme to replace the existing equipment used to monitor personnel leaving reactor compartments of nuclear submarines is currently under way. It is planned to start issuing the new equipment to submarines from October this year. This adds to the modern monitoring equipment that was introduced by the naval bases during the 1990s.

 The Ministry of Defence does not generally record the details of the settlements of personal injury cases brought by members of HM forces by individual service. This information could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. However, the information sought in relation to members of HM forces since 1990 is shown as follows. The increase in compensation payments reflects the fact that prior to May 1987, service personnel were prevented from pursuing claims for compensation from the MOD by section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. The increase in the value of settlements in recent years is mainly attributable to changes in the level of general damages recommended to the courts by the Judicial Studies Board and a change in the multiplier used to calculate future losses as directed by the Lord Chancellor and set out in the Damages Act 1996.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for each school which was a city technology college or city college for the technology of the arts on 1 September 2002, whether <i>(a)</i> he has agreed under section 68 of the Education Act 2002 that the institution shall be known as an academy, <i>(b)</i> an application has been made to him that the school be known as an academy and <i>(c)</i> no application has been made to him for the school to be known as an academy; and in the case of <i>(a)</i>, when the decision takes effect.

<a name="31015w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Section 68 of the Education Act 2002 allows a city technology college (CTC) or city college for the Technology of the Arts (CCTA) to convert into an academy, where the governors agree that the college should take on the characteristics of an academy. To date one CTC, Djanogly in Nottingham, has converted into an academy with effect from August 2003. The Department has also received an expression of interest from Haberdashers CTC in Lewisham to convert into an academy with effect from September 2005. Other CTCs are involved in the academies nine programmes as sponsors or in federation with academies, but have not formally expressed an interest in conversion.

 The Student Loans Company (SLC) manages student loan accounts. However, the loans are funded by and repaid to DfES, once Inland Revenue has collected and accounted for the loan repayments. The flow of loan repayments monies does not affect SLC's financial position in any way. Therefore, the question of credit to SLC for any delays in transmission of loan repayments does not arise.

 We recognise the positive impact of participation in training courses offered by the Sea Cadets, Army Cadets, Air Training Corps and other out of school activities on pupils' leadership skills, self esteem and motivation. They also significantly reduce the risk of vulnerable young people drifting into crime as well as improving their school attendance, as I observed when I visited Project Outreach run by the Army Cadet Force Association in February.

 This Department has not made an assessment of the effect on the skills base if those on low incomes choose not to seek new employment. The recent Skills Strategy White Paper sets out a number of measures aimed at ensuring individuals have the skills they need to be employable, and work productively in a flexible labour market. In addition, the Department for Work and Pensions is committed to making work pay for all those who are able to work, and to supporting households, including low-income households, in sustaining employment.
<P>

<a name="31015w06.html_para5">The Department for Work and Pensions believe that most people moving from one job to another will be able to manage until they receive payment from their new job, as wages are paid in arrears. For those in receipt of Working Tax Credit, continuity of payment is maintained when people move from one job to another, as long as the gap between jobs is no more than 7 days. The new Working Tax Credit has been extended to people aged 25 and over without children. If people receive the Child Tax Credit, this continues to be paid direct to the main carer throughout any changes in employment. People in low paid employment may also be entitled to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
<P>

<a name="31015w06.html_para6">People who are unable to manage whilst waiting for payment of wages, leading to a serious risk to their own health or safety or that of their family, may be able to get an interest free Crisis Loan.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the police, having gained access to communications data, have the powers to disclose such data to the Inland Revenue for the purposes of collection of tax or duty; and what plans he has to withdraw the draft Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Communications Data) Order 2003 to make specific reference to section 22(2)(f) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

<a name="31015w07.html_spnew11"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The draft Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Communications Data) Order 2003 makes specific reference to section 22(2)(f) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. It provides that only the Commissioners of Customs and Excise and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue may grant an authorisation or give a notice requiring disclosure of communications data for the purpose of assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a Government Department. The police having obtained communications data for another purpose have no power to disclose that data to the Inland Revenue for the purposes of collecting tax or to Customs and Excise for the purposes of collecting duty.

: The Commission's communications strategy concentrates on promoting awareness and understanding among its stakeholders. It disseminates widely an information pack and other materials that clarify its role and powers. These include press releases and feature articles, an audiotape and videotape ("Open to Question", which has received an international award). It also operates the website http://www.ccrc.gov.uk and a 24-hour media inquiry service. Commission staff frequently give lectures and presentations on the Commission, and visit other agencies in the criminal justice system. A second workshop for selected stakeholders was held in July 2003.

 Efforts are continually being made by the Commission to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the case review process, without compromising its commitment to reviewing each case thoroughly. For case review, as for any of its processes, the Commission's goals must satisfy five distinct criteria. They must be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>specific, i.e. define a precise process modification to be made, or numerical performance standard to be reached;
<P>
<BR>
payoff-oriented, i.e. be defined to achieve improvements in effectiveness, efficiency and/or economy;
<P>
<BR>
intrinsically rewarding, otherwise staff will not be motivated to achieve them; realistic, otherwise staff are likely to be demotivated by them; and
<P>
<BR>
observable, i.e. it must be possible to determine unambiguously whether or not they have been achieved.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31015w08.html_para0">These are stringent requirements, and imply that the necessary planning, resource allocation and monitoring processes are implemented to achieve and observe them. Much of the Commission's routine managerial effort is directed to continuous improvement of its processes by the definition and implementation of process goals. Whenever special process review seems appropriate, the Chairman convenes an internal Process Improvement Group (PIG), which may then set up specific Process Improvement Projects (PIPs).

 The Government are keen to see all areas and groups receive a fair share of Lottery money.

It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the reasons for <i>(a)</i> taking into consideration tax credit payments for absent parents and <i>(b)</i> not taking into consideration tax credit payments to the parents with care when assessing maintenance payments through the Child Support Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the need for people disabled after their 65th birthday to benefit from the Motability scheme.  [132374]<P>

<P>
<a name="31015w12.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Motability scheme helps severely disabled people who are physically unable, or virtually unable, to walk to obtain vehicles on favourable terms by using their payments of the Disability Living Allowance higher rate mobility component, or a War Pensioners Mobility Supplement paid by the Veterans Agency of the Ministry of Defence, to service a leasing or hire-purchase agreement.
<P>

<a name="31015w12.html_para0">The vast majority of people can expect to have some restrictions on their mobility as they get older and it is reasonable to expect them to make provision for this. However, disability is more financially disruptive, in terms of lost opportunity to earn and save, for people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled relatively early in life. This is why the Disability Living Allowance mobility component is available only to severely disabled people who claim help with their disability-related extra costs before age 65.
<P>

<a name="31015w12.html_para1">The Government believe that these arrangements are fair and sensible and, in particular, that it is right to give the most help to those who are severely disabled early in life and who may face limited opportunities to work and save. We therefore have no plans to change the upper age limit for claims to Disability Living Allowance.

<P>
<a name="31015w12.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Borough of Redcar and Cleveland is not among those 26 of the existing 88 Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) areas that will receive allocations from the residual NRF resources of &#163;175 million for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. This is because Redcar and Cleveland is not ranked in the lowest 10 areas against two or more indicators that act as a proxy for the achievement of key national floor targets, i.e. the Borough is not one of the 26 areas that have the furthest distance to travel to meet these floor targets and tackle multiple deprivation.

 Since the Everything But Arms (EBA) agreement came into effect in February 2001, there has been a rise in exports from countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This increase in export opportunities should help the growth of these countries and lead to a reduction in poverty. It is however, difficult to quantify the actual effect EBA will have on poverty, given the many factors that can influence changes in poverty levels.
