 Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70 is an auditing standard issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. It contains the professional standards for auditors to report on the controls of a service organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="80220w0009.htm_para20"><a name="08022128001244">A SAS 70 report is primarily an auditor-to-auditor communication and is designed to provide information and assurance to the auditors of the financial statements of user organisations to enable those auditors to obtain an understanding of the service organisation's internal control.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="80220w0009.htm_para21"><a name="08022128001245">Organisations do not, therefore, &#147;meet&#148; the standard, although reports issued under the standard contain the auditor's opinion on control objectives and activities. The standard is not specifically designed as a data privacy or security audit mechanism, although it has applicability in these areas. The standard is recognised in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="80220w0009.htm_para22"><a name="08022128001246">Although SAS 70 audits may have been performed at the Department&#146;s external contractors, the Standard does not specify a pre-determined set of control objectives and activities that service organisations must achieve. HMG has its own detailed manuals and guidelines for controlling data security, and the data exchanged with the Department&#146;s contractors should have been subject to those control standards.</p>

 Issues identified during internal audits are reported to management responsible for the business area subject to the audit. Line managers are responsible for implementing actions to address recommendations arising from the audit, and should maintain lists of issues to enable them to do so. Because these responsibilities are decentralised across the Department and its Agencies, a standard management process for the retention of lists of audit issues centrally has not been adopted. Audit reports retained by management may, however, effectively fulfil this purpose.</p>

 The north east London district was one of the six Jobcentre Plus districts that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement Demonstration project (ERA), which operated between October 2003 and November 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="80220w0013.htm_para4"><a name="08022138000180">ERA was evaluated using a random assignment research method and customers in the six districts were allocated on a voluntary basis to either a group that received the ERA service, or to a control group that did not. The impact of the programme was determined by comparing the subsequent behaviour and outcomes of both groups. It was not possible to offer the in-work credit to customers in the districts participating in ERA until the programme was complete without invalidating the evaluation.</p>

If customers had been eligible to receive the in-work credit payment in addition to ERA, it would not have been possible to identify which effects resulted from receiving ERA, and which resulted from receiving the IWC. This form of evaluation is dependent on the two groups being identical in every aspect other than receiving the programme being tested, so it was not possible to offer the IWC to the control group alone.</p>
