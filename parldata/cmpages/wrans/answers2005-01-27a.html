 The financial services industry is a vital sector for the UK economy, contributing over 5 per cent. of total output and generating a trade surplus of &#163;15.6 billion in 2003. The Government recognise the importance of this sector and take steps to maintain their competitiveness, both domestically and internationally, through a number of different routes; including principally by building and maintaining an effective regulatory model, especially in view of initiatives under the EU&#039;s Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP); encouraging a skilled work force; and, by delivering a strong, stable macroeconomic environment. In this context, the Government are committed to a dialogue with the financial services industry to ensure that FSAP and other measures are implemented in an effective, proportionate and consistent way.

Consequently, the new service will be trialled over a longer period (10 weeks) and installed at a larger number of sites (4,000) before moving to live running. VOSA has always made it clear that the system will only go live when it is satisfied that, in all respects, it will provide a robust and effective service. In this we have the garage trade&#039;s full support. The final phase of trials will start on 7 February 2005 and we expect the system to have been installed at all MOT garages by end October 2005.

 The Government&#039;s consultation paper&#151;Devolving Decision Making: A Consultation on Regional Funding Allocations&quot;&#151;set out our proposals to establish regional transport funding allocations. The consultation paper explained that funding decisions on routes of national and international significance would continue to be made on a national basis. To be regarded as such, a route has to satisfy all of the following criteria:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">To have average daily traffic flows, along the length of the route, of more than 60,000 vehicles</p>

<p>

<a name="stpa_9">In some marginal cases we applied these criteria with a degree of flexibility. However, the A3 satisfies just one of the criteria: it provides a link between London and the port of Portsmouth. Consequently, for the purposes of future regional decision-making, the consultation paper proposes that it should be regarded as a route of regional significance.

<i>[holding answer 25 January 2005]:</i> My officials have not undertaken any direct research into the 2004 German Flood Control Act.

 To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs what the reasons were for the decision not to make negotiation compulsory in disputes between divorced or separated parents.  [210230]</p>








<p><a name="st_38"><a name="50127w05.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Government published Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities, Next Steps&quot; on 18 January, which sets out plans to implement a range of measures to help separating parents in dispute about future parenting arrangements, reach agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_43">The Government&#039;s plans include improvements in the information available to parents and greater use of methods such as the Collaborative Law model, mediation, in-court conciliation and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project. The Government intend strongly to promote these methods as better ways to reach agreement than through contested court hearings. All publicly funded clients will have to show that they have considered mediation. Lawyers will not be funded by legal aid if out of court settlement is not reached under the collaborative law scheme. In addition, the Government, senior judiciary and Rules Committee plan to review court rules and practice directions so that the strongest possible encouragement is given to parties to participate in forms of dispute resolution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_44">We do not plan to make these schemes compulsory in every case, as an essential part of the process is that people come to them voluntarily and are therefore willing to participate. Further, in some cases, including those where domestic violence has been an issue, it would not always be appropriate to impose mediation on separating parents.

Despite consulting 18 local authorities, the Local Government Association and the Improvement and Development Agency for Local Government, it proved impossible to produce robust evidence of any additional street cleansing costs.

<p><a name="st_58"><a name="50127w08.html_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Recorded crime figures, which are used to measure the extent of crime in local areas, include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on property crimes, such as burglary, but do not contain information on the offender&#039;s drug habits. It is therefore 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Jan 2005 : Column 470W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
not possible to estimate the proportion of all crime in Hartlepool which is linked to the need to support a drug habit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_62">However, since April 2004 offenders in Hartlepool charged with certain trigger offences known to be commonly committed by drug users have been tested for opiates and cocaine/crack as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. Between April and December 2004 a total of 588 offenders were tested and just over half (55 per cent.) of them tested positive for opiates or cocaine/crack. This gives some indication of the proportion of property crime that may be linked to drug use, although it should be noted that not all crime by drug users is necessarily committed to support their habit.

 Each case is decided on its individual merits.

This includes age, length of residence and strength of connections in the United Kingdom, personal history, domestic circumstances, previous criminal record, compassionate circumstances and any representations received. Should any one or a combination of these factors outweigh the public interest, deportation would not proceed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what views have been advanced in representations which he has received from religious groups <i>(a)</i> supporting and <i>(b)</i> opposing the adoption of a law on incitement of religious hatred.  [210409]</p>

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="50127w10.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 A joint statement issued in April 2004 by representatives of many important faith communities in Britain urged the Government to legislate against incitement to religious hatred as soon as possible. An updated version of this statement with additional signatories was issued in January 2005. The statement reaffirms the belief of the bodies represented that the measure is necessary to remedy an unjust and anomalous gap in the present law whereby racial groups are protected from incited hatred whereas religious groups are not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w10.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">The Home Office has received representations from a number of religious groups who have concerns about aspects of the proposed measure. These concerns have focused around the extent to which the legislation might in certain circumstances inhibit the freedom to worship and to proselytise. There have also been concerns expressed by groups such as humanists and secularists that the law would not catch incited hatred against groups holding non-religious beliefs. The Home Office has met representatives of these groups and will continue to work to allay their concerns.

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="50127w10.html_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Information published by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance indicates that countries with legislation of this kind include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France Germany, Greece and Italy. The state of Victoria in Australia also has legislation on this subject. The details of legislation vary, as one would expect. For example, the offence in Victoria has a lower threshold and wider scope than the Government are proposing for this country.

<p>
<a name="50127w10.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">As regards effectiveness, while it is useful to look for similar provisions in other jurisdictions, we share the view of the House of Lords Select Committee which in its Report on Religious Offences in England and Wales (April 2003) concluded that Whilst it is possible to describe the offences that exist in different jurisdictions with some accuracy assessing their efficacy is much more difficult.&#039;

The table shows actual spend, and spend as a proportion of DFID&#039;s total bilateral programme aid to the relevant countries. This table includes data for the last four years. Data for 1999&#150;2000 could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. Countries not included in the table have not received PRBS. Note, DFID spends some of its funds through multilateral agencies, some of which also distribute direct budget support. While we impute a notional share&quot; of money we give to the EC, World Bank or other agencies as being spent in individual countries, we are not able to split this down further to show how much is spent as direct budget support.

 Following the launch of the Learning Age Green Paper (DfEE 1998) we did pump prime an initiative known as the Graduate Apprenticeship. These combined a higher education qualification (honours degree or higher) with structured work based learning underpinned by key skills and national vocational qualifications units. This early work provided a useful platform for developing foundation degrees which are now the main vehicle we have for expanding vocational higher education opportunities. They are designed with employers and combine work based learning with academic study. Since they were introduced in 2001 they have grown in popularity and there are currently 37,000 students on these programmes studying either full time or part time, including those studying with the backing of their employer. We are also working with HEFCE, the LSC and Sector Skills Councils at ways of strengthening progression for apprenticeships into higher education, including through foundation degrees, and we&#039;re still working with those sectors who feel there is still scope for a level 4 apprenticeship.

<sup>(31)</sup>The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(32)</sup>1997&#150;98 financial data are taken from (pre local government reorganisation) Nottinghamshire LEA&#039;s Revenue Outturn spending return submitted to the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. 2003&#150;04 financial data are taken from City of Nottingham LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement (Table 



A) submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 data remains provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup>Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including these under fives funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under five pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included in the 2003&#150;04 pupil count. Other LEA maintained pupils includes ail pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from the form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(34)</sup>Financial data is collected at local authority level and not constituency level and as such the figures provided are for City of Nottingham LEA. Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Nottinghamshire LEA was split into City of Nottingham LEA and Nottinghamshire LEA As a result, the 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Nottinghamshire LEA and the 2003&#150;04 data is for City of Nottingham LEA.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup>Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup>Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 as at 24 January 2004.<br>

The information shown is for trusts where data is available. All figures are as at 31 December 2004, except Homefirst Community Health and Social Services Trust, which shows the position at 30 November 2004.<br>

Information relating to Foyle Community Health and Social Services Trust and Sperrin Lakeland Health and Social Services Trust are based on numbers of persons waiting for treatment, as opposed to initial assessment, by a podiatrist, although in most cases assessment and treatment take place on the same day.<br>





Southern Health and Social Services Board area Trusts do not hold official waiting list figures, although in some trusts this information is recorded by professional staff. Any data collected are held on manual systems and could be provided only at disproportionate cost because of the time required to extract the information.<br>

<p><a name="st_190"><a name="50127w24.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Article III-122 of the proposed constitutional treaty would provide a legal basis for European laws defining the principles and conditions enabling services of general economic interest to fulfil their missions, without prejudice to the competence of member states, in compliance with the constitution, to provide, to commission and to fund such services. There is presently EC competence to legislate on services of general economic interest within the current European community treaty, for example, in Articles 71 and 80(2) (transport), 95 (internal market approximation measures) and 156 (trans-European networks). A measure under Article III-122 could deal with the principles and conditions referred to above across a range of services of general economic interest; to do this under the current European community treaty would require assembling sectoral legal bases or restricting the measure to approximation provisions. Any new law made under Article III-122 would be adopted on the basis of qualified majority voting and co-decision with the European Parliament. Article III-122 explicitly maintains the competence of member states in the key areas of providing, commissioning and funding services of general economic interest.

<p><a name="st_191"><a name="50127w24.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 There is neither a UK- nor EU- level legal definition of services of general economic interest (SGEIs), although the term services of general economic interest&quot; can be found in Articles 16 and 86 of the EC Treaty. However, the European Commission states in its White Paper on Services of General Interest (COM (2004) 374 final) that there is broad agreement that the term SGEIs refers to services of an economic nature which the member states or the Community subject to specific public service obligations by virtue of a general interest criterion&quot;. In ECJ case C-l79/90, the court said that SGEIs were services which exhibited a general economic interest with special characteristics compared with those offered by other economic activities&quot;.

They apply only to casualties which were witnessed or discovered by UK forces, and give no indication of casualties outside the UK&#039;s areas of operations in South East Iraq, although they also cover the Black Watch deployment to the North Babil area in November 2004. UK forces are not always present at all incidents which result in Iraqi civilian casualties, and following hostile contacts they are not always able to make an accurate count of Iraqi casualties, either because they have withdrawn from the area, or because such casualties have been removed.

<i>[holding answer 24 January 2005]:</i> The yellow card scheme is the United Kingdom system for collecting and monitoring information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and currently relies on voluntary reporting of suspected ADRs by health care professionals. The independent review of the yellow card scheme, published in May 2004 considered whether reporting of suspected ADRs by health care professionals should be made mandatory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w28.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_203">There is no evidence from countries where reporting of suspected adverse reactions is mandatory that rates of reporting are higher. The independent review made no recommendation about mandatory reporting, but recommended that steps should be taken to strengthen the scheme and to raise awareness among health professionals and the public. Proposals are being developed to take this forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50127w28.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_204">Patients may now report suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the committee on safety of medicines and/or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. My noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, the Lord Warner, announced on 17 January 2005 that two pilots (paper based and electronic reporting via www.yellowcard.gov.uk) to enable direct patient reporting have been launched.

<a name="stpa_205">It is good clinical practice that health care professionals discuss with patients the benefits and risks of medicines including the possibility of side effects.

 In the White Paper we estimated that 10 to 30 per cent. of pubs in England might fall into the category of do not prepare food&quot;. A regional breakdown of this figure has not been made. We believe that with food providing an increasing proportion of most pubs&#039; turnovers, it is reasonable for the Government to proceed on the assumption that it makes good business sense for pub owners to continue to serve food. We will consult widely on this area in drawing up the detailed legislation.

 The Department currently monitors waiting times from general practitioner referral to first out-patient appointment and from consultant referral to in-patient or day case treatment.
