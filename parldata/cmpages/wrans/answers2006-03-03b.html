 It is not possible to list individual companies in which the Commissioners have agreed in the light of the ethical investment policy not to invest, as this information is commercially sensitive. There is no blanket policy on investing in, or excluding investment from, any specific country.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="60303w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners what <i>(a)</i> advice, <i>(b)</i> guidance and <i>(c)</i> policies the Church of England&#039;s Ethical Investment Advisory Group has (i) developed and (ii) published (A) excluding and (B) advising against investment in certain countries.  [54673]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60303w01.html_spnew1"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 The Ethical Investment Advisory Group develops ethical investment policy on behalf of the three central Church investment bodies, as set out in the Church&#039;s Statement of Ethical Investment Policy. The policy proscribes investment in certain industrial or business activities from which the Church does not wish to benefit. There is no blanket policy on either investing in or excluding investment from any specific country.

 To ask the honourable Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners what the policy is of the Ethical Investment Advisory Group of the Church of England on investment in <i>(a)</i> China, <i>(b)</i> Cuba, <i>(c)</i> Iran, <i>(d)</i> Libya, <i>(e)</i> North Korea, <i>(f)</i> Sudan and <i>(g)</i> Syria.  [54675]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60303w01.html_spnew2"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 There are no blanket policies relating to specific countries. However, the Church expects companies in which it invests to observe any national or international sanction regimes in place from time to time.


</p>

 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners if he will list the <i>(a)</i> companies, <i>(b)</i> countries, <i>(c)</i> markets and <i>(d)</i> sectors in which the Ethical Investment Advisory Group of the Church of England has a policy not to invest.  [54676]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60303w01.html_spnew3"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 The Commissioners&#039; Statement of Ethical Investment Policy proscribes investment in tobacco, alcohol, pornography, armaments, and gambling. Companies whose activities breach the Church&#039;s policy are avoided but it is not possible to list

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60303w01.html_spnew4"><b> Sir Stuart Bell: </b> 
 The Commissioners held investments in China valued at &#163;1.2 million at the end of 2005. There are to my knowledge no investee companies which are wholly or mainly engaged in trading with any or all of the regimes listed by the hon. Gentleman but, in a globalised economy with large numbers of multinationals, many investee companies will do some business with at least some of these countries provided that there are no sanctions in place.

 The number of people employed within the British Transport Police as at 8 February 2006 is 4,133. This figure includes police officers and civilian staff. This has increased from 3,757 in 2004&#150;05.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what criteria were used in making the decision not to include an underground siding for Crossrail trains; and if he will make a statement.  [55275]</p>








<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60303w01.html_spnew8"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 The engineering of sidings within the central underground section of the proposed Crossrail route would be very difficult and costly, given the need to negotiate the piled foundations of buildings and changing gradients between stations. In operational terms the addition of sidings would not significantly 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Mar 2006 : Column 969W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
improve existing reversing capability or the process for removing a failed train from the tunnel. The inclusion of sidings in the central section is therefore unlikely to deliver good value for money for the taxpayer and farepayer.

<a name="stpa_20">As part of a process of monitoring compliance with the terms of the digital switchover certification mark licence agreements, the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned a programme of mystery shopping in early 2005 during the first year of the scheme. This surveyed approximately 10 per cent. of retail licensees across the country. It did not identify any examples of deliberate attempts by retailers to mislead the public, but did show there was room for improvement in the provision of information. Results were used to inform developments for the second year of the scheme. In addition, several retailers and manufacturers have been contacted directly where the certification mark was being used incorrectly. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has appointed Digital UK, the independent not-for-profit organisation that is coordinating digital switchover, to administer and supervise key aspects of the second year of the scheme.

<a name="stpa_28">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if their turnover falls below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. In the retail sector, 63 per cent. of enterprises (200,000 out of 320,000) were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60303w07.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government introduced statutory controls on spam by means of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, which entered into force on 11 December 2003. The Regulations provide a first line of defence against spam where the recipient has no knowledge of the advertiser or the products being marketed. The regulations require that unsolicited spam must not be sent to an individual subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the European Union (EU). There is regular contact between my Department, the Department of Constitutional Affairs and the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office regarding operation of these regulations.

<a name="60303w07.html_para2">

Development&#039;s Anti Spam Task Force, which is the lead intergovernmental organisation dealing with spam. Additionally on 2 July 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, which aims to reduce further the problem by committing enforcement authorities, which for the UK is the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office and the Office of Fair Trading, to work together to investigate those sending spam.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60303w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">The end user has a role to play in taking action to avoid being a target for those sending spam, as well as taking action to filter spam. Information has been made available to the public and to business by my Department, the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office, the Office of Fair Trading as well as a number of sites provided by service and software providers. These messages have been reinforced by the Get Safe Online initiative that launched on 27 October 2005. This is an initiative between Government and Industry to help individuals and businesses protect themselves against internet threats, including spam. The Government do not measure the amount of spam sent to UK businesses and private citizens.

<a name="stpa_32">Officials engage with Microsoft and the Internet Service Providers on a regular basis, in particular as part of the UK based Anti Spam Working Group, which DTI leads. Ministers have not had contact with Microsoft or Internet Service Providers specific to this matter. Spamhaus which is an active and valued member of the Anti Spam Working Group, is an industry-led initiative and does not receive funding from DTI. DTI advises members of the public who wish to complain about spam to contact the Information Commissioner who is responsible for the enforcement of the Regulations. A breach of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence subject to a fine of up to 5000 in a magistrate&#039;s court.

<a name="stpa_33">Our response to the problem of spam is developing. I have taken careful note of the views of the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office on the powers available to him, and Government is actively considering whether to revise the relevant legislation. I shall shortly meet the Information Commissioner to discuss this, while DTI officials will continue a dialogue with Internet Service Providers regarding steps that can be taken to reduce spam. We will also continue our efforts to achieve greater international co-operation.

<a name="60303w09.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">Manning shortfalls are being addressed through a package of remunerative and non-remunerative measures. In terms of remuneration, we aim to ensure that DMS pay is comparable with the NHS. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for preparing papers of evidence on all DMS pay for the Armed Forces Pay Review Body&#039;s (AFPRB) consideration. Pay recommendations for Medical and Dental Officers are currently being considered by the AFPRB. Nurses and Allied Health Professionals in the DMS are covered separately by the main Armed Forces 2006 pay uplift of 3 per cent. which will be implemented from 1 April 2006. As recommended by the AFPRB, we are also in the process of examining the scope for changing their pay structures to ensure that military pay remains comparable with the new NHS Agenda for Change pay structure. Pay can only go some way towards addressing manning shortfalls. Non-remunerative measures are equally as important. Examples of non-remunerative initiatives include: the introduction of new pension arrangements which are designed to encourage retention; looking at alternative means of meeting operational commitments (for example, by working closely with allies and partners on operations overseas and by using DMS Civilian Medical and Dental Practitioners and Agency Staff); development of the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit (MDHU) concept to build a stronger military ethos; and the regular undertaking of Continuous Attitude Surveys to ensure we remain up to date with the concerns of our personnel.

Against this level of demand it is not surprising that requests have taken longer to process than had been previously been the case.

 Defra has a target to deliver &#163;610 million financial efficiencies by March 2008. Over 60 per cent. of these are planned to be cash-releasing. They arise from two broad areas. First, Defra identified &#163;226 million of cashable savings. These have been recycled to meet (i) requirements under the Department&#039;s 5 Year Strategy for which we were unsuccessful in gaining additional funding in SR04, such as some elements of the climate change and sustainable development programmes, and (ii) other priority pressures such as bovine TB and diffuse water pollution.

 We keep all our travel advice under regular review. Our advice for Cyprus was last updated on 30 January. It advises British citizens considering purchasing property in Cyprus to seek independent qualified legal advice and warns of a number of potential practical, financial and legal complications, particularly in buying property in the north. These complications arise principally from the non-recognition of the &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, the possibility of a future political settlement in Cyprus, and claims to ownership from people displaced in 1974.

Such punishments are in contravention of Iran&#039;s obligations under International Convention of Civil and Political Rights and also the Convention of the Rights of the Child. The EU expressed its hope that Iran would adopt a law abolishing all lashings and executions for crimes committed by those under the age of 18.

 No. The number of paediatric intensive care beds available is a matter for local decision, taking account of demand. This is variable, with more beds provided over the winter months when the incidence of severe respiratory conditions in young children increases. The majority of paediatric intensive care episodes are non-elective. Units, therefore allow for some 20 per cent. spare capacity to be available to respond to anticipated but unpredictable emergency demand. The average number of paediatric intensive care beds available is shown in the table.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">Within the plan period to 2015, it is not proposed to introduce any large scale road schemes on the Saintfield or Ormeau roads as the proposed public transport improvements along this route will help to reduce travel by private car. However, the plan proposes the implementation of a Quality Bus Corridor (QBC) on the Saintfield Road together with a park-and-ride site at Cairnshill for 750 spaces. Initially the Park and Ride site will be served by a dedicated bus service using the QBC bus priority infrastructure, but with the opportunity for linking it in the longer term with a potential rapid transit scheme, known as SuperRoute. The Department plans to submit a planning application for the Park and Ride site in Spring 2006.</p>

 The extent to which UK passports reported lost in the post are used to facilitate identity theft is extremely difficult to establish because there is very little information in this area. However, as a result of concerns about the number of passports being reported lost in the post the UK Passport Service introduced a secure delivery service in February 2004. The secure delivery service provides for all new passports dispatched from UKPS to be taken to their destination by courier. As a result of the introduction of this service the number of UK passports being reported to UKPS as having been lost in the post has fallen dramatically.
