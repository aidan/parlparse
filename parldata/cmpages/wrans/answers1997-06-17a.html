<a name="70617w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will review procedures related to asylum seekers from Sierra Leone and its neighbouring states. [3060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Following the coup in Sierra Leone on 25 May, my Department has suspended the consideration of asylum applications from Sierra Leone nationals. A review of the handling of these cases is being conducted in close cooperation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but no decisions will be made on these asylum applications until the situation in Sierra Leone stabilises. The independent appellate authorities have been asked to suspend all appeal hearings relating to Sierra Leone nationals, and compulsory returns of refused asylum seekers have also been suspended. No one will be returned to Sierra Leone until we are satisfied it is safe to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the total amount of legal and other costs so far spent by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board regarding the claim of Mr. Norman Cobb of Sunderland. [3236]
<P>
<UL>(2) how long has elapsed since Mr. Norman Cobb of Sunderland <i>(a)</i> was the victim of a criminal assault, <i>(b)</i> successfully applied for a judicial review of the initial decision to refuse his claim and <i>(c)</i> had his renewed application upheld; for what reason compensation has not been paid to him; and if he will make a sttaement. [3235]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Although the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Scotland have responsibility for general oversight of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, Ministers have no locus to intervene in, nor do they comment on, the Board's handling of individual applications or their interpretation of the Scheme. Enquiries about individual cases should accordingly be addressed directly to the Board or, in the case of applications lodged on or after 1 April 1996, to its successor body, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.
<P>

<a name="70617w01.html_para0">However, I understand from the Board that:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
<i>a</i> Mr. Cobb was assaulted 6 years and 9 months ago;
<BR>
<i>b</i> Two years and 11 months have elapsed since the judicial review in question;
<BR>
<i>c</i> The Board's consequent re-hearing was two years and 3 months ago, since when interim payments have been made while further examination of the medical aspects has been pursued; and
<BR>
<i>d</i> The Board's estimated costs so far are &#163;4,900, including &#163;3,200 incurred by the judicial review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The prescribing of slimming pills is the clinical responsibility of physicians, whether in the national health service or in private clinics. A recent report by the Royal College of Physicians provides guidance for practitioners on the use of slimming pills in the treatment of obesity.
<P>

<a name="70617w01.html_para5">The report identifies those pills which are of no value in the treatment of obesity and others which are. These are licensed for the treatment of obese patients--body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m <sup>2</sup>  or greater--who have not responded to an appropriate weight reducing regimen. It also recommends that patients are subjected to regular review by the prescribing physician and where treatment is initiated by another physician that the patient's general practitioner should be notified in writing. Anyone who considers that physicians are prescribing inappropriately, should notify the General Medical Council.

The Council also adopted a common position on the Commission's proposal for a decision creating a Community network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases. The Council agreed the text of a resolution on migrant doctors and conclusions noting recent developments of interest to Health Ministers in the drugs-related health field. The Council requested the European Commission to study current practice in the Member States concerning cross-border cooperation in the supply of organs and tissues of human origin for medical purposes. There was a short orientation debate on the Commission's communication on measures to combat tobacco consumption and a brief discussion of a Presidency paper on blood safety and self-sufficiency in the Community. The Council took note of developments since its last discussion of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies and agreed to keep the subject under review. The Council also took note of progress made by the taskforce set up to develop a global early warning system and response network for communicable diseases within the context of the EU-US action plan agreed in December 1994 and of new Commission proposals for programmes of Community action on rare diseases and injury prevention.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the waiting times at the East Surrey hospital for first routine out-patient appointments and admission for elective surgery treatment by each specialty area as at April 1997. [2313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The latest available information on waiting times for first outpatient appointments is contained in "Waiting Times for First Outpatient Appointments in England: Detailed Statistics, Quarter ended 31 December 1996", copies of which are available in the Library. This shows, by individual trust and specialty, the numbers of patients seen during the quarter following written referral to a consultant by a general practitioner and how long they had waited, by timeband.
<P>

<a name="70617w02.html_para4">Inpatient and day case waiting time information collected centrally does not identify separately those patients waiting for surgery. The information that is available covers all patients awaiting admission to hospital, whether it be for surgery or some other form of treatment. The latest gives the provisional position on 31 March 1997 and shows that on that date there were 4,508 patients awaiting admission to East Surrey Hospital of whom 4,282 had been waiting less than 12 months. Provisional information is not available by specialty. Final figures due to be published next month in "Hospital Waiting List Statistics: England at 31 March 1997" will be presented on a trust and specialty basis.

 We want to improve the quality and choice of support that is available to disabled people, and so we will certainly examine very carefully the possibility of extending eligibility for direct payments.

 It is difficult to define comprehensively what is meant by "community" or "cottage" hospital. They differ from place to place in the scale, range and volume of services they offer. What characterise nearly all of them is that they provide a local service and admit patients under the care of a general practitioner. The list has been compiled on that basis and shows hospitals that are currently, or have recently been, the subject of local consultation about full closure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w03.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Funding for food poisoning research comes principally from the Department's Microbiological Food Safety surveillance and research budget (1997-98 allocation &#163;2.3 million), supplemented by further amounts from the Department's general research and development budget and through core funding of the Public Health Laboratory Service and the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research. The total budget allocation, and expenditure before 1993, could only be derived at disproportionate costs.

Additionally, there are other projects funded by the Department which involves research/surveillance into two or more pathogens. Although these include <i>Campylobacter</i> or <i>E.coli</i> O157 or <i>Salmonella</i> because other pathogens are involved the cost of these projects is not included in the above table.

<a name="70617w03.html_para4">Under the current arrangements it is for health authorities and general practitioner fundholders, taking into account local needs, to agree what care should be provided and to set and monitor contracts with NHS trusts. Where changes are proposed, for example to respond to changing local circumstances, these should be discussed and agreed between the parties. Decisions on the admission of individual patients are for the clinicians concerned.

 None. Magistrates' courts are provided by the local paying authority for the use of the magistrates' courts committee (MCC). Closure decisions are for the MCC to determine, although a contributing local authority may appeal to the Lord Chancellor against a proposed closure. The procedure for such appeals is set out in section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In the absence of an appeal the Lord Chancellor has no locus in the matter.

This estimate is of course subject to a margin of error and the precise effect on tax revenues will depend in part on the composition of the increase in GDP.

 Thirty-nine Land Rover patrol vehicles were purchased in 1985. All the vehicles are equipped with the mounting to fit either the general purpose machine gun (GPMG) or 40mm Grenade launchers. The GPMG was purchased from Royal Ordnance--then Royal Ordnance Factory--Enfield in the 1960s and 1970s and the 40mm Grenade launcher was purchased from Sidem (UK) Ltd. in 1990.

 The UK Armed Forces are to be equipped with a new sophisticated electronic question and answer system so that they can distinguish between friendly and potentially hostile forces for the foreseeable future.
<P>

<a name="70617w08.html_para0">The new system, known as Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF), will replace existing IFF equipments on a wide range of ships and aircraft and on certain air defence installations. It will be compatible with those of our NATO allies. As well as protecting our forces from inadvertent attack by their own side, SIFF will improve their prospects of avoiding detection by hostile units and increase their ability to detect and engage such units, thus ensuring interoperability for the foreseeable future. SIFF will also be compliant with new flight safety rules mandated by the Civil Aviation Authority for all aircraft operating in civilian controlled airspace.
<P>

<a name="70617w08.html_para1">Because SIFF equipment will be fitted to over 50 types of platform, the programme will require very careful planning. Following extensive studies, we have decided to invite competitive tenders for an initial integration study and planning phase, phase 1 of the programme, following which a prime contractor will be selected. The prime contractor will be responsible for the supply and installation of SIFF equipments during the implementation phase of the programme, phase 2. In parallel with this competition, contracts will be placed with the companies who are the platform design authorities to enable them to evaluate and cost the SIFF integration task. It is planned that the competitive invitation to tender for phase 1 of the programme will be issued in July. The total value of the programme phase 1 and phase 2 is estimated to be in the order of &#163;500 million, providing substantial work for British industry.

For their sake, having looked carefully at all the options, I issued vouchers on a once-only basis last week, as a basis for grant payments over the 1997-98 school session. No further voucher issues will be made. And I have simplified procedures radically--for example, getting rid of the need for nearly 1,000,000 signatures on vouchers by pre-school staff.

CHECKING OF OVERLAND CONSIGNMENTS OF FISH
TO THE FISHMARKETS AT ABERDEEN AND PETERHEAD
<BR>
Mr. Malcolm Chisholm has asked me to reply to your question about the checking of overland consignments of fish to the fishmarkets at Aberdeen and Peterhead.
<BR>
In the 12 month period to 31 May 1997, the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency's Sea Fisheries Inspectorate staff stopped vehicles and checked overland consignments of white fish which were being transported to the fishmarkets of Aberdeen and Peterhead on 1670 occasions.
<BR>
No reports were made to the Procurator Fiscal as a consequence of these checks.

For pupils at secondary schools, swimming is an optional element of the National Curriculum. Where schools do choose it, pupils must be taught additional strokes and a variety of water-based activities, including rescue and resuscitation skills.

 One of our key aims is to improve the service provided to claimants and other customers. The effectiveness of these arrangements will be reviewed shortly. As the administration of Income Support is a matter for the Benefits Agency, I have asked its Chief Executive, Peter Mathison, to write to the hon Member.
<i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Dr. Lynne Jones, dated 16 June 1997:</i>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking about the delays in despatching notifications in respect of Income Support claimants to local authorities for the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<BR>
The issue of housing benefit notification is an integral part of the existing benefit claim clearance targets. Additionally, Benefits Agency (BA) District Managers and Local Authority (LA) Benefit Managers sign up to an agreed annual level of service which is based on a model national Service Level Agreement. The national model includes agreed quantifiable performance targets. A grievance procedure is included in the document should there be matters that cannot be resolved through normal liaison channels. The SLA provides the framework within which both parties can work together and voice their concerns, should either fail to meet the agreed levels of service.
<BR>
A number of BA internal audits within the last year have highlighted a certain lack of support and co-operation by both parties in adhering to local agreements which will have led to delays in some cases.
<BR>
The BA is committed to improving working relations with LAs and is aware of representations by the LA Associations about the effectiveness of some of the current local arrangements. These will be reviewed in the coming months.
<BR>
You will be interested to know that the BA in Birmingham have a Research and Development Team which examines existing processes with the aim of improving performance. They have recently commenced a Housing Benefit Project to examine the way information is exchanged between the BA and LA with the aim of identifying new processes to reduce any delays.
<BR>
I hope you find this reply helpful.

 There are four asbestos-related diseases that are prescribed for benefit purposes. A record of the occupation of successful claimants at the onset of the diseases is only available since 1995. The data indicate that there was one award to a teaching professional in 1995 (for mesothelioma, in South West England) and one in 1996 (for asbestosis, in the North of England). Awards for asbestos-related diseases for all occupations totalled 1,327 in 1995 and 1,317 in 1996. Separate information on posthumous awards is not collected.

 <i>[holding answer 11 June 1997]:</i> No Northern Ireland Office records were passed to the Public Record Office in 1996. The earliest Northern Ireland Office documents will be due for transfer to the Public Record Offices when they become 30 years old in the year 2002. The suitability of those documents for permanent preservation will be reviewed under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 and/or the Public Records Act (NI) 1923. Neither Act requires statistics to be kept in the form requested. The Chief Executive of the Public Records Office for Northern Ireland has written to you with such information as he has as he has available. To comply with their duties under the Acts the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Departments make arrangements for the safe keeping of their records, with a view to their eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records as set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper Open Government of July 1993 (Cm 2290) apply in Northern Ireland.
<i>Letter from A.P.W. Malcomson to Mr. Norman Baker, dated 10 June 1997</i>:<i></i>
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para2">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question about the percentage and number of documents which in 1996 were (a) passed on to the Public Record Office intact, (b) passed on to the Public Record Office in censored form, (c) retained by her Department in full (d) retained by her Department in part, (e) destroyed, (f) otherwise disposed of and (g) otherwise unaccounted for.

<BR>
The place of deposit for the records of the Northern Ireland Departments is the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, where separate transfer arrangements operate, namely under the Public Records Act (NI) 1923.
<BR>
In 1996, a total of 200 linear metres of records (equating to about 7,000 files) were transferred to the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Court Service. No records were retained in whole or in part by the Departments.
<BR>
There would be prohibitive cost involved in compiling statistics for the percentages and numbers of documents destroyed. There is no mechanism in Northern Ireland for the disposal of records other than by transfer to the Public Record Office in Northern Ireland.

 I believe it should now be possible, in the light of extensive discussion in the multi-party talks, to resolve the question of decommissioning on terms which are broadly acceptable to the talks participants. The Independent Chairmen have been working towards a resolution of the issue, and we have ourselves made intensive efforts, in consultation with the parties and the Irish Government. I hope that proposals can be put forward very soon, and that they will be agreed so as to permit a start to substantive negotiations no later than September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 There are many initiatives under way to prevent ill health.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para3">Primary prevention initiatives including the Welsh Child Health Surveillance programmes play a vital role in monitoring the health and development of children. They help to prevent illnesses, particularly, childhood infectious diseases. Indeed, the childhood vaccination and immunisation programme represents one of the most effective public health interventions currently available. At very little cost, life long protection can be provided against infectious diseases--the health burdens of which can be enormous.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para4">Health education also has a role to play. This is the responsibility of Health Promotion Wales. Health Promotion Wales are responsible for co-ordinating national campaigns dealing with a full range of health promotion issues including smoking, diet, physical activity, substance misuse and healthy sexual behaviour. Their work is complemented by specialist health promotion services commissioned by health authorities; by staff working in the primary and community health services; and by national voluntary agencies.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para5">Additionally, a range of legislation is in place to control the incidence of food-borne diseases and the Government are committed to protecting the public health through additional measures to ensure the safety of food, including the establishment of a Food Standards Agency.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para6">Secondary prevention measures including the early detection of breast and cervical cancers, for example, through screening programmes available in Wales have significantly improved chances of survival from these diseases.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para7">We have set a list of targets to improve the health of the people of Wales. These include reducing deaths from cancer of the lung, breast and cervix. Other target areas include coronary heart disease and stroke. We have also asked health authorities to draw up plans to reduce accident and suicide rates and to work to improve the quality of life of patients with a number of painful conditions.
<P>

<a name="70617w12.html_para8">All these initiatives, both existing and proposed, will continue to be afforded a high priority to ensure that we provide the greatest possible health benefits for the people of Wales and ensure that health strategies are responsive to the needs of the local population.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what the controlling authority will be of the proposed New Forest Heritage Area; [3143]
<P>
<UL>(2) when the New Forest Heritage Area boundaries will be formally approved; [3141]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70617w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The boundary of the New Heritage Forest has been delineated through the statutory local plan process and therefore has the force of section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. I understand that the relevant local plans defining the Heritage Area have been adopted by the local planning authorities, but that the boundary in respect of two areas of land, in the Avon Valley and north of Totton, is being reviewed in the context of the emerging New Forest District Local Plan. For the purposes of the town and country planning legislation, the controlling authorities are the local planning authorities within whose administrative areas the Heritage Area lies. These authorities, together with other public bodies with particular responsibilities for the New Forest, are represented on the non-statutory New Forest Committee which has the purpose of assisting the co-ordination of their activities.
<P>

<a name="70617w13.html_para3">Since July 1994, the New Forest Heritage Area has been subject to the same national planning policies as would have applied had the area been designated a national park. These policies will have been reflected in development control decisions and statutory development plans made by the local planning authorities.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the LINK programme on Horticulture has examined the competitiveness of permaculture-based systems; and if he will make a statement. [3579]<P>

<P>
<a name="70617w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The competitiveness of permaculture-based systems has not been examined by the Horticulture LINK. Such matters are more appropriate for funding by industry organisations.

<a name="70617w16.html_para0">Levy is collected on first-hand sales of fish in the UK according to the method of its presentation on the market. Records of the levy collected by SFIA on such sales are not kept in a format that would enable the income to be broken down by species and compared with recorded landings.
