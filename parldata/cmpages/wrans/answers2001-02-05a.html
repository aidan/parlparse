To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what representations he has received and from whom in the past 12 months on solutions to the drugs problems in Weston-super-Mare.  [148371]<P>

<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 I have received no correspondence in the past 12 months on solutions to the drugs problems in Weston-super-Mare. The UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator, Keith Hellawell, has recently replied to correspondence from the local drug action team Co-ordinator concerning funding for a research project, and will shortly be replying to correspondence from a practitioners group and local MPs about the structure of the local drug action team.

To ask the Solicitor-General, pursuant to the answer of 22 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 489W, on victims, how the Crown Prosecution Service will phase in the implementation of a system to ensure that victims are informed of decisions for which the CPS has responsibility; and if he will make a statement.  [148581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Pilot sites in six CPS areas were established in November 1999 to assess the costs and operational implications for the CPS in implementing a system to ensure that victims are informed of decisions for which the CPS has responsibility.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para0">From October 2000, the same pilot sites began to conduct a scoping/options study to identify the best practice for national rollout. The final evaluation report will be completed in March 2001.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para1">The first phase of national rollout will commence in the six pilot areas in April 2001. A programme of phased national implementation will follow in the other CPS areas to be completed by October 2002. Details of the implementation plans will be finalised in the light of the final evaluation findings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the responsibility of <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency in respect of research undertaken into the effects of depleted uranium use.  [147387]




<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2001 : Column: 358W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) undertakes whatever research is required of it by its customers, of which the Ministry of Defence is a main customer. The MOD draws on all available authoritative scientific knowledge on the effects of depleted uranium use, including information from DERA.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the armed forces first used depleted uranium ammunition; which units were involved; when such ammunition was used in action in the last 10 years; by which units; and if he will make a statement.  [148113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Depleted uranium (DU) based ammunition was first brought into service by the Royal Navy in 1982 for use in its Phalanx close-in weapons system. The Royal Navy (RN) has 36 Phalanx systems, which are in service on all Type 42 destroyers, HMS Ocean, one aircraft carrier, HMS Fearless and the Royal Fleet Auxiliaries Fort Victoria and Fort George. The RN has not fired Phalanx in combat. It is regularly fired for maintenance and system checks, however, including small quantities in the Gulf conflict in 1990-91, and in the Adriatic. All these firings are into the sea.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para2">The first operational use of DU munitions by UK armed forces took place in 1991, during the Gulf conflict. Limited amounts of 120 mm DU munitions were issued to the three Challenger-equipped UK armoured units in the Gulf: the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars and the 14/20 Hussars. Additional rounds were fired by UK forces during earlier work-up training to establish the round's mean point of impact.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para3">The army has not fired DU munitions on operations or in training since the Gulf conflict.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what evidence his Department has collated about the effects of <i>(a)</i> the use, handling and firing and <i>(b)</i> the clearing up of cartridges from depleted uranium ammunition; and if he will make a statement.  [148116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I will write to the hon. Member and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the state of readiness and expected date of return to full serviceability of each of the Royal Navy's S and T class submarines.  [147570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 HMS Triumph, a Trafalgar class submarine, is ready for operations (although currently undergoing short-term maintenance) and the remaining S and T class submarines are at 90 days' or more notice for operations undergoing either defect repair or long-term maintenance. We anticipate that eight submarines (Superb, Sceptre, Splendid, Trafalgar, Tireless, Torbay, Turbulent and Talent) will be available for operations by the end of this year, at which time the current operational boat, HMS Triumph, will be undergoing maintenance. The remaining three submarines (Sovereign, Spartan and Trenchant) will be in longer-term maintenance or refit. The exact state of readiness of individual submarines is withheld under exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the cost of the five Satellite Communications Systems is; what the total number of units to be purchased is; when they all will be in service; and if he will make a statement.  [148102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is assumed that the question relates to the proposed SKYNET 5 military satellite communications system. SKYNET 5 is envisaged as a service provision contract under PFI arrangements. The contractor will provide and own the satellites and associated ground infrastructure. The nature of the assets and the number of satellites that will be used is a matter for the selected contractor.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para4">Bids for the SKYNET 5 service implementation contract were submitted by two competing consortia on 10 January 2001 and are currently being evaluated. It would be inappropriate to comment on the likely cost of the service provision while the competition is taking place. On current plans we expect the service to start in the middle of the decade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what aircraft the Royal Air Force has sold to Poland in the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [148115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Aircraft and helicopters no longer required for service by the Royal Air Force are disposed of on their behalf by the MOD's Disposal Services Agency (DSA). Disposal can be achieved in a number of ways, including sales to legitimate overseas Governments, although no such sales to Poland have been made by the DSA in the last five years.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what quantity of surplus small arms has been destroyed in each of the last two years to conform to the UN resolution covering weapons; if surplus weapons have been sold to other countries to avoid being destroyed; and if he will make a statement.  [148104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In conformity with UN resolution 54/54R the United Kingdom has reported that the total number of surplus small arms it destroyed in 1999 was 31,939. The majority of these were armed forces weapons (some 28,000) with the balance from the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Metropolitan police. Comparable statistics for 2000 are not yet available. Our current policy on the disposal of small arms declared surplus by the Ministry of Defence is to restrict transfers to those which meet the legitimate defence and security needs of overseas Governments. I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence to the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) on 22 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 242W. In the absence of approved transfers in line with this policy, surplus small arms are routinely destroyed. It is not, nor has it ever been, our policy or practice to arrange sales of surplus weapons on the ground that this would avoid their destruction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the cost of the purchase of the Javelin missiles is; how many have been ordered; and if he will make a statement;  [148101]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the estimated cost is of the US test for the Javelin missile; when it will take place; and if he will make a statement.  [148114]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I assume the hon. Member's questions refer to the Javelin anti-tank guided weapon system. The Ministry of Defence is conducting a competitive assessment of the US Javelin and Israeli Gill/Spike systems, to establish whether they are capable of meeting the UK's light forces anti-tank guided weapon requirement. The extra-mural cost of the assessment phase, which is due to complete in 2002, is currently estimated to be around &#163;3 million for each of the competing systems.
<P>

<a name="10205w01.html_para5">A small number of each system will be procured for assessment. Orders for operational quantities would be placed following a successful outcome to the assessment phase. The cost would be dependent upon the final system selected and the total number of systems ordered.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the awarding of an Arctic Campaign Star, in official recognition of the contribution made by servicemen taking part in the Russian convoys.  [148506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Service on the Arctic convoys to Russia during the second world war has already been recognised by the award of the Atlantic Star. There are no plans to institute a new Arctic Campaign Star, or any other medals for second world war service. This is in accordance with the long-standing policy of the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals that it will not consider the retrospective institution of medals for service given many years ago.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2001]:</i> The amount paid out in total by the Defence Bills Agency to contractors in the UK in 1999-2000 was &#163;12,353,730,369.11.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence public service agreement commits the Department to review all services and activities regularly and systematically over a five-year period. This five-year review cycle will include the quinquennial review of agencies, as well as services currently carried out within the MOD headquarters and by top level

Government policy on the review of services has been set out most recently in the Cabinet Office handbook on better quality services, published in 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2001]:</i> There are 112 confirmed and three suspected cases of malaria among service personnel who deployed to Sierra Leone. There was also one person suspected of having lassa fever, which was subsequently found not to be the case. These are cases of notifiable communicable diseases, reported by the Ministry of Defence in accordance with UK legislation. As of 31 January, available central records of illnesses among service personnel who deployed in Sierra Leone showed 36 reported cases of additional types of illnesses, among some 7,500 personnel deployed to Sierra Leone. These illnesses were: nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, fever and chills, dizziness, photophobia, viral meningitis, herpes zoster, severe stress, acute pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis, noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis, enteritis, right sided pleuritic chest pain, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, viral illness, possible parasite infestation, possible appendicitis, chest infection, infection in finger, acute tonsillitis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 30 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 100W, on US National Missile Defense, what concerns his Department voiced to the previous US Administration with regard to US National Missile Defense; and what discussions took place with regard to the use of <i>(a)</i> RAF Fylingdales and <i>(b)</i> other military bases in the United Kingdom.  [148874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We made it clear to the previous US Administration that we understood why the US is concerned about the threat from weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and why they were considering deployment of a national missile defense system as one aspect of their response to the threat. We received no formal request from the previous US Administration for the use of facilities in the UK as part of their proposed system.

 Statutory responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the television licensing system rests with the BBC. TV Licensing carries out the day-to-day administration, including inquiry and enforcement activities, as agent for the BBC. The Government and the BBC are on the whole satisfied that TV Licensing's inquiry and enforcement methods are compatible with the European convention on human rights, but in order to put one matter beyond doubt the Government intend to bring forward an order under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to regulate the use by TV Licensing of apparatus designed or adapted for detecting the installation or use of television receivers.

The criteria for appointment, post criteria and person specification are detailed in the list and have been applied following consultation with the Superintendents' Association for Northern Ireland and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. Both have been involved throughout the selection process. Because of the very tight time scales imposed, advertising for these positions outside the Royal Ulster Constabulary was not practicable on this occasion; however, it will be considered for future appointments.

 The composition of the investigating officers of the Office of the Police Ombudsman is fairly typical of the usual team and ranking structures established to undertake the investigation of complaints and other matters made against the police.

 For the Office of the Police Ombudsman to fulfil its investigative function it is necessary to establish protocols with a number of agencies, some of which have already been established, e.g. with the Forensic Science Agency, and a number of other protocols are currently in negotiation.

 The Government are aware of concerns about the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria affecting humans as a result of antibiotic use in farm-animal production. We supported an EU ban on the use of four antimicrobial growth promoters which were authorised as feed additives, which came into effect on 1 July 1999. We will continue to be guided by the principles established in the report of the Joint Committee on the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary medicines (the Swann report) 1969. This report proposed that antibiotics authorised for growth promotion should be restricted to those which have little or no application as therapeutic agents in man or animals, and which will not impair the efficacy of prescribed therapeutic drugs through the development of resistant strains of organisms.

<P>

<a name="10205w06.html_para0">On DETR measures mentioned in the Queen's Speech there has, as yet, been no environmental appraisal for the Homes Bill. It is proposed that seller's packs, introduced as a result of the Bill, will include information on the energy efficiency of homes and this should lead to improvements by buyers that benefit the environment. An environmental appraisal will be carried out when the contents of seller's packs have been determined, following consultation with interested parties.

<a name="10205w06.html_para1">Our initial assessment of the proposals for the draft Safety Bill suggests there is no need for an environmental appraisal. If, as the proposals develop, it becomes apparent that there is an effect on the environment, we will review the position.

On average, 3,700 vehicles per day used the bus lane during the first year of operation. It is worth noting that, while this represents an average of 7 per cent. of the traffic on the M4 in to London, the vehicles carried 21 per cent. of the people using the road. During peak periods, each bus has saved on average 3.5 minutes and each car has saved on average 1 minute. Journey times for all vehicles have become more reliable following the introduction of the bus lane.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 In the studies we are undertaking in preparation for the new aviation policy, we are not using a single standard assessment of hourly runway movements. The hourly capacity depends on a range of factors, including the separations and staggers between runways, the provision of parallel taxiways and the extent of taxiing movements across runways. We are therefore assessing the capacity of each option individually.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The number of go-arounds recorded at Gatwick airport were <i>(a)</i> 501 in the year 2000, and <i>(b)</i> 383 in 1999. Clearances to land are not categorised as to their timing and, therefore, the information sought on "late clearances" is not available.

<a name="10205w06.html_para4">The go-around figures for 2000 are currently being analysed by National Air Traffic Services Ltd. and the airport authority (BAA plc) but there are no indications that weakness/failure in the safety system is to blame for the increase.

 Local authorities have a duty under section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 both to promote road safety, and to study road traffic accidents in their areas and take appropriate remedial measures.

<a name="10205w07.html_para0">It is for local authorities to decide how to discharge these duties, including decisions on staffing levels and recruitment. However, the Road Safety Strategy, "Tomorrow's Road--Safer for Everyone", recorded the value we place on the contribution that can be made by Road Safety Officers (RSOs), and encouraged National Vocational Qualifications for these officers. We require local authorities to describe, in their Road Safety Strategies, the Education, Training and Publicity programmes being undertaken by their RSOs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what change has occurred in the last three years in the number of aircraft on flight paths above Walthamstow.  [148500]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The number of aircraft that overfly Walthamstow and adjoining areas depends on the direction of operations at Heathrow which itself is dependent on wind direction and strength and so can vary from day to day. Due to the prevailing westerly winds, on average Heathrow operates in a westerly direction about 77 per cent. of the time, but this can vary considerably from year to year. The proportion of westerly operations at Heathrow in each of the last three years for which data are available was 1997--74 per cent., 1998--89 per cent. and 1999--66 per cent. As during any period of westerly operations approximately 50 per cent. of arriving aircraft approach Heathrow by overflying north London, it is possible (after adjusting for the proportion of westerly operations in each of the last three years) to give a rough estimate of the numbers of aircraft (including traffic using London City airport) that overflew Walthamstow or adjoining areas: the estimates are 1997--89,000, 1999--107,000 and 1999--84,000.

operations for the tactical integration of arriving traffic descending from holding positions (stacks) located in the vicinity of Lambourne (Essex) and Bovingdon (Bucks). There are no fixed routes for arriving aircraft during this phase of their approach to Heathrow Airport, but they tend to follow a regular pattern that has not changed in any significant respect for many years. Departures from Heathrow during easterly operations may overfly the area once above an altitude of 4,000 ft. Traffic using London City Airport also overflies the area.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason he has not issued a decision letter in respect of the public inquiries into proposed development at Otterburn Army training estate.  [148431]<P>

<P>
<a name="10205w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The hon. Member may be aware that the Courts have given leave for judicial review in relation to development proposed by the Home Office at Aldington in Kent, which involves a challenge to DOE Circular 18-84 procedures for the development of Crown land. These are the same procedures as have been used by the Ministry of Defence to seek approval for the proposed development at Otterburn in Northumberland. The grounds of challenge are that the procedures are non- compliant with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is unlikely that I shall be in a position to reach a final decision on Otterburn before the Aldington case comes to Court this month. I shall then need to consider how to proceed in the light of the Aldington judgment.
<P>

<a name="10205w09.html_para2">In the meantime, I am arranging for various exchanges of correspondence on this issue to be copied to the parties to the Otterburn inquiry for their information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what protection he plans to offer to women who have not received the rubella vaccination since MMR was introduced in 1988; and how many women of child- bearing age his Department estimates are not innoculated against rubella.  [147485]

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2001]:</i> All women are tested for rubella susceptibiltiy in their first pregnancy. Any found to be sero-negative are recommended to be immunised after the pregnancy. This programme, along with the surveillance of rubella susceptibility of the antenatal population, has been maintained since the introduction of measles, mumps and rubella. Since there has never been a programme to immunise women of child-bearing age, except those sero-negative, it is not possible to know how many women of child-bearing age are not immunised.
<P>

<a name="10205w10.html_para0">It is not possible to estimate the number of women who have not been innoculated against rubella. In 1995, the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation recommended that rubella immunisation for schoolgirls could cease due to the high level of immunisation through either the MMR campaign started in 1988 or the MR campaign in 1994.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Support and treatment depends on the extent of the injury and can, where appropriate, include specialised rehabilitation. The aim of treatment is, wherever possible, to restore the person to the state of health they enjoyed before the injury happened. Our policy is that all patients who need rehabilitation services should have access to them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance he gives to local health, employment and social services in Greater Manchester on funding for vocational rehabilitation for individuals with acquired brain injury.  [147956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We do not give individual guidance to local health, employment and social services on what services to provide for their populations. Health authorities in partnership with primary care groups/trusts and other local stakeholders are responsible for assessing the health needs of their populations and commissioning services to meet those needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Around 1 million people a year receive a head injury in the United Kingdom and some 100,000 of those attend hospital. Each year at least 2,000 adults suffer permanent serious impairments. We do not keep statistics, however, on whether patients are left unable to walk as a result of their injury.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We do not analyse the incidence of brain injury by age. However, a 1999 report from the Royal College of Surgeons, on the management of head injury, found that around half of the people who attend hospital with a head injury are under 16 years of age.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We do not provide funding for individual patients. It is for health authorities, in partnership with primary care groups/trusts and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.

<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how the social services inspectorate follow up the findings and recommendations of the local government ombudsman in respect of maladministration by social services departments.  [147321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> The Department expects local authorities to take all reports, and especially those in which there are adverse findings, of the local government ombudsman very seriously and to take appropriate action locally in the light of the ombudsman's recommendations. The ombudsman does not publish all of his judgments or routinely notify details of individual cases to the social services inspectorate. Thus, the inspectorate does not have a formal role in following up such recommendations. Should the inspectorate be notified of a decision, it may decide to take up the matter with the local authority to establish what action is being taken, but this will depend on the nature of the case and the ombudsman's recommendation.

<P>
<UL>(2) for what reasons the Chief Executive of the Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust has not held discussions with the management of hospitals in Surrey about the impact on them of the location of services away from St. Helier. [148328]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The discussion document published by Epsom and St. Helier national health service trust considers ways in which patient services could best be provided for local people. It takes into account Royal College guidelines on the required critical mass of services for these to be provided and also the need to use the accommodation at Epsom hospital to the best advantage of patients.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it his policy that only accident and emergency departments that are on the same hospital site as in-patient paediatric facilities should accept children.  [148331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w11.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 No. It remains appropriate for accident and emergency departments to offer initial assessment of health status and the options available to achieve best outcome including, if appropriate, transfer to a specialist unit on another site.

 The evaluation team's report is expected to be submitted by the end of this month. It will be published as soon as possible once we have given proper consideration to the findings. The NHS plan made it clear that we will act on the results of the evaluation and without prejudicing the evaluation we would expect the reform of the complaints procedure to result in a more independent and responsive system.

 The proposal from the European Commission for a draft directive was published on 19 July 2000. The directive will be published in final form if and when the Council and European Parliament agree a final text. The Government support co-ordinated European liberalisation--this will ensure a level playing field for postal operators--including the Post Office and the future Post Office company. The Government believe it is important for such liberalisation to be gradual and controlled and to be consistent with our domestic processes to ensure that the full benefits of liberalisation can be achieved. That is why before taking a detailed decisions in Europe it would be preferable to take account

of the work of our postal regulator--to ensure that liberalisation proceeds in a way that is consistent with maintaining the universal service at a uniform tariff.

<a name="10205w12.html_para5">At the Telecommunications Council in December, I said that although I believed that the limits could be reduced from 350 grams to 150 grams in 2003 without adversely impacting on the universal service, I would need the advice of our regulator before going further. In the event, member states were unable to agree on a package and further discussions are expected during the Swedish Presidency.

<a name="10205w12.html_para6">The income of the Royal Mail in these weight categories is a matter for the Post Office and would be commercially confidential within the meaning of Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (third party's commercial confidences).

This has been provisionally closed with Cyprus, Hungary, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia. The indicative timetable for negotiations set out in the Commission's strategy for enlargement of November 2000 envisages conclusion of negotiations on this chapter with other candidates in the second half of this year. All candidates will be expected to apply the common fisheries policy in full upon accession and access to fisheries resources within EU waters will be based on the principle of relative stability, which allocates national quotas according to historic catch levels.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans she has to review her policy on the provision of public funding to overseas aid organisations involved in compulsory abortion and sterilisation in the third world and China; and if she will make a statement.  [147697]<P>

<P>
<a name="10205w14.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department does not fund organisations involved in compulsory abortion and sterilisation. DFID makes annual contributions towards the work of the United Nations Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation in over 150 countries. These organisations have programmes in China aimed at promoting international standards of freedom of choice reproductive health. We strongly support these efforts.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the steps taken by UNESCO to implement the education for all programme following the Dakar Summit.  [148164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w14.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 UNESCO was given a mandate at the World Education Forum to monitor and co-ordinate implementation of the Dakar framework for action. Its Director-General was asked to convene annually an education for all (EFA) high level group to review progress. This has not yet met, but a working group (for informal technical consultation among EFA partners) has been established. UNESCO is implementing major organisational changes to mainstream EFA throughout its programmes.
<P>

<a name="10205w14.html_para2">We will continue to encourage UNESCO to provide leadership and technical guidance on how to achieve the international development targets for education and the goals of the Dakar framework, within a clearly defined poverty framework. I will be discussing progress to date with the Director-General in London on 5 February.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what her policy is with respect to providing development assistance to countries involved in long-term conflict.  [147020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w14.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It is usually impossible to provide long-term development assistance to countries involved in violent conflict. We provide humanitarian relief and support for conflict resolution and development where possible. But 20 of the 38 poorest countries are involved in conflict or recently emerged from conflict. Such conflict leads to growing impoverishment and is a barrier to development. We are therefore working to try to focus greater international effort on the resolution of such conflicts.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what provision her Department is making to assist in the relief operations for the Indian earthquake.  [148091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w14.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID's emergency response centre has been working round the clock since the earthquake struck. With the assistance of the Ministry of Defence, we despatched on 27 January a UK search and rescue team of 69 personnel, available under our contingency arrangements, made up of 25 UK fire service volunteers from Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Greater Manchester, Chester and Leicestershire and specialist rescue organisations. Officials from my Department led the team. They have been working in close co-operation with the Indian authorities and have so far managed to rescue six people alive.
<P>

<a name="10205w14.html_para3">In a joint operation with my Department, 75 search and rescue personnel from the Russian Ministry of Emergencies (EMERCOM), funded by DFID, arrived in Bhachau on 28 January and have rescued nine persons to date. They also have with them an airmobile hospital. A second Russian aircraft, part-funded by my Department, is awaiting clearance from the Indian authorities to bring in 3,000 blankets and 45 family tents.
<P>

<a name="10205w14.html_para4">In the last 48 hours, we have despatched three aircraft carrying 1,200 tents and other shelter items from the DFID's emergency stockpile in Staffordshire. A fourth aircraft has also flown from Brindisi carrying medical supplies, trauma equipment and plastic sheeting. These supplies are already beginning to arrive in Ahmadabad and Bhuj. Further relief efforts will be co-ordinated by the UN.
<P>

<a name="10205w14.html_para5">We have allocated a total of &#163;10 million to support this emergency relief effort without reducing our spending in other parts of India. Nearly &#163;3 million of this has already been spent. We are in close contact with operational agencies, including the Red Cross, UNICEF, WHO, and a number of operational NGOs (Care, Save the Children, Christian Aid) to determine the provision of immediate relief items and medical assistance. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), the UK umbrella organisation for a number of humanitarian NGOs, is launching a public appeal on Thursday 1 February.
<P>

<a name="10205w14.html_para6">The Indian Government did not immediately request assistance but, as the scale of the disaster became apparent, did so. Medical and para-medical personnel continue to assist local civilian and military personnel already engaged in the rescue effort. The Indian authorities are well organised and are providing food, army personnel, heavy lifting equipment, mobile operating theatres and medical supplies, but the scale of the emergency is such that some of the resources cannot be supplies, but the scale of the emergency is such that some of the resources cannot be supplied in the region. We are working closely with the Indian Government and operational agencies to support their efforts and to ensure that all those who survived the earthquake are provided with health care and other basic essentials until they can rebuild their homes and livelihoods. Copies of our regular situation reports are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment she has made of the level of corruption in India.  [147213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w15.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Corruption is widespread in India at every level of public life, as in most developing countries, reflecting weak financial and administration systems. Rent seeking and other forms of corruption hit poor people particularly hard and have a significant impact on their economy.
<P>

<a name="10205w15.html_para0">The Union and State Governments of India are beginning to take anti-corruption measures beyond those that already exist in the form of statutory audit bodies and Vigilance Commissions. State Governments such as those of Andhra Pradesh and Medhya Pradesh, with both of whom DFID is working in partnership, are placing an increasing focus on good governance initiatives, including anti-corruption. Anti-corruption strategies are also being developed in a number of national public institutions.
<P>

<a name="10205w15.html_para1">DFID is supporting a number of strategic initiatives in all four of our partner states which will directly help reduce corruption. These initiatives include the introduction of VAT and revenue enhancement measures; increasing political accountability through decentralisation and local decision-making; the redesign of public expenditure management systems including procurement and audit functions; and improved service delivery including the introduction of electronic governance bringing services directly to the poor. Our support for public enterprise reform will help reduce corrupt practices in public utilities through the introduction of sound, commercial practices and the creation of an effective regulatory framework. At the national level, in supporting health and education programmes, DFID has helped give priority to the introduction and strengthening of transparent transaction processes. We are also discussing support for broader governance initiatives that will help reduce corruption.

The Lord Chancellor and I encourage magistrates courts committees to consider holding these on a regular basis. My officials are also currently developing a national recruitment strategy with the Magistrates Association and others to optimise the effectiveness of future initiatives. Through these initiatives most advisory committees attract sufficient new magistrates to replace those who retire or resign.

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2001]:</i> Since 1997-98, overall early education funding made available by the Government through the Standard Spending Assessment and Nursery Education Grant, has increased by almost &#163;400 million. This has enabled some 120,000 new, free early education places for three and four- year-olds to be created.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) of 22 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 439-40W, on school playing fields, what the basis is for his estimate of the number of school playing fields sold in England in every month between 1979 and 1997.  [147774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w17.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> Public concern about the loss of school playing fields led directly to the introduction in October 1998 of section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Before section 77 was introduced, only grant-maintained schools were required to seek consent from the Secretary of State before selling land, including areas of their playing fields. Local authorities and other schools that owned their own playing fields were free to sell without restriction. It is estimated that an average of 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way before October 1998. This estimate is based on the number of playing field disposals at grant-maintained schools between April 1996, when the previous Government further encouraged the disposal of playing fields by relaxing the Local Authority Capital Finance Regulations which governed the use of sale proceeds, and 1 October 1998, when section 77 took effect. During this 30-month period, some 64 grant- maintained schools were given approval to dispose of areas of playing field, which is an average of over two a month. Using the proportion of grant-maintained schools at that time compared with the number of other schools, we estimate the total number of playing field disposals each month to have been around 40. These estimates are in line with answers given previously by the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), when he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at this Department.

 The Department does not hold this information. It is for local education authorities to ensure that sufficient school places exist for the children in their area. Each authority is required to prepare and publish an annual School Organisation Plan which includes information about the capacity of its schools, the projected pupil numbers, and any conclusions about the need to add or remove places over a five-year period. The Department publishes annually figures showing the overall number of surplus places based on returns from LEAs. In each of the three years referred to the total capacity of the twenty-two local education authority secondary schools in Bristol exceeded the number of pupils on roll by more than 2,000.

We recognise that they do have different needs, and our work on regime provision for young offenders, not only the 18-20s, will concentrate on moving them more effectively from custody to work.

 Since 1987, the conditions of service for all prison officers have been to work a fixed number of hours per week, averaged over a shift cycle. These flexible shift schemes give the best possible match of staff time available for work to be completed. In circumstances when additional hours are required to meet unplanned and unexpected demands, officers can work extra hours for which they receive time off in lieu. Officers can take their time off at a time that does not affect the running of the regimes in the establishment. In exceptional circumstances, when time off in lieu cannot be granted, ex-gratia payments can be authorised. This system has proved to offer the best possible regimes within the resources available in young offender institutes and other types of establishment.

<P>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The views of the Association of Chief Police Officers were sought during the process of drafting the Hunting Bill. The association was concerned primarily about the need for the police to be given an explicit power of arrest to enforce a ban and for the option which introduced a scheme of licensing.
<P>

<a name="10205w19.html_para8">The association has informed the Home Office that it considers that it is too early to provide a final view on the resource implications of any ban on hunting, or of the other options that were in the Bill. However, if hunting were to be banned it does not anticipate a significant additional burden on the service over its current commitment.

 The Government want to see police numbers rising.
<P>

<a name="10205w19.html_para10">Our spending plans therefore make generous provision, intended to meet major pay, pensions and other pressures on forces as well as providing ring-fenced funding to increase recruitment through the crime fighting fund (CFF). We anticipate that these measures will enable forces to increase police service numbers to record levels by March 2003.
<P>

<a name="10205w19.html_para11">The CFF will enable police forces to recruit 9,000 officers over and above the number previously planned in the three years 2000-01 to 2002-03.

 The Criminal Cases Review Commission is operationally independent of the Home Office, and I am unable to intervene in its determination of individual cases or to comment on their merits. I understand that the commission considered an application from Mr. Dickinson, but concluded in March 1998 that the case did not meet the criteria laid down in the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 for the commission to make a reference to the Court of Appeal. His legal representatives made a further application on Mr. Dickinson's behalf in May 2000, and I am confident that the commission will consider these representations carefully and impartially.

 The Private Security Industry Bill provides for the establishment of a security industry authority, which will have responsibility for licensing individuals employed in designated sectors of the security industry, including door supervisors.
<P>

<a name="10205w20.html_para0">The authority will be responsible for establishing, for the first time, a consistent licensing regime for all door supervisors. This will involve setting nationally applicable criteria, in consultation with the police, industry and local authorities. These will be used in deciding whether to issue a personal licence allowing the applicant to undertake door supervision activities. Initially, the criteria will involve a criminal record check, but over time additional criteria relating to training will be imposed. This aim is to ensure that only fit and proper people receive licences. The main benefits of the new regime will be:

<a name="10205w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The recorded crime statistics for England and Wales published on 16 January show a fall in the total number of burglaries of 8 per cent. in the 12 months to September 2000. Domestic burglary fell by 10 per cent. and non-domestic burglary by 5.5 per cent. in the same period.
<P>

<a name="10205w20.html_para4">The British crime survey published in October last year, shows that the total number of domestic burglaries, including those that are not reported to, or recorded by, the police, has fallen from just over 1.6 million in 1997 to under 1.3 million in 1999--a 21 per cent. reduction.

 Most police authorities set targets for responding to 999 calls and their performance against these targets has been published annually by the Audit Commission.
<P>

<a name="10205w20.html_para5">The data for performance in 1999-2000 were published on 10 January in the "Local Authority Performance Indicators, Police and Fire Compendium". This recorded that on average, police authorities in England and Wales, which had set a target, had met it 87.6 per cent. of the time. The targets set ranged from 10 minutes to 20 minutes, depending on whether the police were responding to a call from an urban or rural area.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> Applications for naturalisation as British citizens are normally given initial consideration in date of receipt order. It has long been the case that, in appropriate circumstances, initial consideration may be given out of turn. Some measure of priority may also be afforded to subsequent stages of the process.

<P>
<a name="10205w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 22 December 1997 that henceforth reasons would be given in all cases where applications for British citizenship were being refused. In June 1998, it was decided that the benefit of the doubt should normally be given to applicants where there was a conflict of professional opinion over their ability to meet the full capacity requirement. In the same month, it was decided that where breaches of the immigration laws were due to invalidly completed applications for leave to remain they should normally be disregarded for naturalisation purposes. We have yet to give more detailed consideration to effecting the changes in the residence requirements outlined in paragraph 10.7 of the White Paper.

 In the period 1 April to 31 December the total cost of accommodation paid for by the National Asylum Support Service was &#163;26.7 million. Of this, &#163;19.9 million related to payments for properties that were occupied by asylum seekers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We have substantially increased resources to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), which has enabled an additional 500 asylum decision- makers to be recruited, and as a result the backlog has fallen for each of the last 11 months.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para3">IND estimates that a frictional level of work is likely to be in the range 25,000-35,000 cases awaiting initial decision, depending on the level of intake, the nationality mix of the intake and external factors (for example, conflicts or civil unrest) which may mean certain groups of cases cannot be substantively considered at a particular time.

 I understand from the chief constable of South Wales police that there have been significant reductions in recorded crime in the Vale of Glamorgan. Domestic burglaries fell by 29 per cent., thefts of a motor vehicle fell by 26 per cent., and theft from a motor vehicle fell by 18 per cent. There was also a small fall in violent crime of 0.6 per cent. (six offences).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to reverse the growth in violent crime in the Avon and Somerset area since 1997.  [148685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reducing violent crime and the fear of violent crime and to ensuring that individuals and communities are protected and safe. We are working in partnership with the police, including Avon and Somerset constabulary, and other agencies across the country on a wide range of ways to tackle violent crime. Our strategic approach to combating violent crime is set out in "fighting violent crime together"--an action plan published in January.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para5">The Government are putting in place the investment to make sure that the police have the resources they need. Under the crime fighting fund, Avon and Somerset constabulary have been allocated 195 additional recruits over and above previous plans, over a three-year period 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2001 : Column: 440W</I><P>
from 2000 to 2003. I understand from the force that they will be able to recruit their full allocation in 2000-01. Last year, the Home Office awarded the Avon and Somerset constabulary a grant of &#163;1.1 million to tackle robbery in Bristol. This will be used to target hot spots and run education campaigns.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para6">Under the Government's crime and disorder reduction partnerships, Avon and Somerset constabulary are working with other agencies to put in place a number of initiatives to tackle violent crime, notably domestic violence, alcohol-related violence and bullying.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para7">Avon and Somerset constabulary have confirmed that some of the rise in recorded violent crime in the Avon and Somerset area is due to the increase in reporting of domestic and racial violence. The Government, the police service and other agencies have been working together to raise awareness of these crimes, and to increase reporting, detection rates and support for the victim. In South Gloucestershire, for example, a number of initiatives are currently in place to tackle domestic violence. The police are working in partnership with hospitals to improve reporting, and in the major casualty units a freephone service has been installed to link domestic violence victims with the police and other agencies when they are most vulnerable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I am grateful to all who responded to the recent consultation on this issue. There was general agreement as to the purposes of registration as set out in the consultation document. The responses received made it clear, however, that voluntary registration is a complex matter which requires further careful examination and consideration before informed decisions can be reached on longer-term policy. I have asked officials to develop more detailed proposals in the light of the responses to the consultation and in discussion with interested organisations.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para8">The current regulations which made registration voluntary for charities connected with a number of religious bodies expire on 1 March 2001. I am today laying a new statutory instrument to extend those regulations until 30 September 2002. This will allow time for the necessary work to be done to enable the way forward to be settled.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para9">I will make a further announcement later this year, but I want at this stage to allay concerns expressed by some of those consulted that one of the proposals in the consultation document meant that umbrella bodies would be compelled to take on responsibilities which neither they nor their members want. I can give an absolute assurance that that was not, and is not, the Government's intention.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para10">Many respondents were also concerned that any change could make it more difficult for the public to find out about charities. The further work that I have commissioned will explore ways of making sure that this is not the case.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made on the review of the Prison Service's suicide and self-harm strategy; and if he will make a statement.  [149275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10205w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The review's analysis and recommendations have been accepted by the Director General of the Prison Service and by Ministers, and will be implemented progressively from April 2001 with the aim of year-on-year reductions in prisoner suicide and self-harm. There will be a strong stress on a preventive strategy which invests most resources where the risks are highest. An all-round pro-active approach will be developed which encourages a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. There will be improved identification and case arrangements for high-risk prisoners.
<P>

<a name="10205w23.html_para11">The review's recommendations will be developed and piloted in five establishments: Wandsworth, Feltham, Eastwood Park, Leeds and Winchester. They will be evaluated and rolled out to other prisons. The three-year strategy will involve a major investment of capital and staff in prisons. In the first year, &#163;8 million will be invested in implementation. Improvements will be made to reception and induction areas, for example through installing more first night centres, and by having more safe cells, crisis suites and gated cells. New health care screening procedures will start in 10 pilot prisons. Wing staff will be supported in their work by in-reach mental health teams and by the establishment of dedicated drug detoxification units. There will be full-time suicide prevention co-ordinators in high-risk local prisons. The numbers of trained listeners at high-risk prisons will be increased substantially.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 22 January 2001, c. 490W]:</i> The figures given were incorrect. The correct figure for the number of special constables recruited for the five years from 1995-96 to 1999-2000 was 17,836. There was a net loss of 5,428 special constables during this period. The net loss figure of 2,137 given in my original reply was actually the number leaving the special constabulary from March 1999 to March 2000 only.
