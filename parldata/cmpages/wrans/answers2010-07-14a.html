Its purpose was to harmonise the principles on which the tax was to be applied throughout the then EEC. The directive limited the number of rates to a single standard rate with up to two reduced rates on a specified list of supplies. This prohibits the UK having a higher rate of VAT on specific items. There were derogations, including our zero rates.</p>

 Since 2004 the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has commissioned an annual suite of complementary surveys to measure attitudes towards (and awareness of) health and safety at work.

 There is no standard definition of conflict, state conflict, or counter insurgency. Taking a reasonable interpretation of these terms, since 1980 UK forces have been involved in the following conflicts involving force against another state, some of them undertaken in distinct operational phases over time: Falkland Islands; Bosnia; Kosovo; Iraq (twice). Operations of a counter insurgency nature have been undertaken in Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Sierra Leone, Vanuatu, and the follow on phases of the second Iraq conflict.</p>

 All allowances remain under regular review to ensure that service personnel are adequately recompensed for conditions of service not covered by the x-factor and for the necessary additional costs incurred by virtue of service. Continuity of education allowance allows a stability of education when a service family is required to be mobile for service reasons. Under current arrangements the service person claiming the allowance pays a minimum contribution of 10% of the school fees.

 Since the formation of the Government the Home Office has spent £1,000 on official photographs of Ministers. The fee was for hire of a professional photographer for two days to take photographs of Ministers for official use, including the Home Office website, documenting the Home Secretary's arrival at the Home Office, and the Home Secretary's first address to Home Office staff for the intranet.</p>

 Security in the Home Office Group is embedded in its operations. The central unit responsible for oversight of security. The Departmental Security Unit, and the security units for the agencies provide central points of support and advice but much of the day to day work of security is done by local units under the guidance of their security liaison officers.</p>

 When health and local authority commissioners are planning services to meet the mental health needs of children and young people locally they will want to consider the right way to engage with schools so as to get the best possible services to children and families. Schools are also able to use their own budgets to provide services to meet the needs of their pupils, including services to support pupil's emotional wellbeing and mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="100714w0003.htm_para10"><a name="10071452000198">The national Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme was developed to test the effectiveness of evidence-based mental health support in schools for children, young people, and their families. Schools delivering TaMHS commission a range of service procured from voluntary (as well as statutory) sector providers to meet the particular needs of their pupils (e.g. counselling support for children struggling to cope following family breakdown or bereavement). For specialist mental health support for more severe problems, schools may wish to refer pupils to local specialist CAMHS.</p>

 The former chief medical officer sent a letter to all general practitioners (GPs) in February this year asking GPs to record the status of veterans as part of any referral. GPs have also been given guidance on how to record the status of veterans on their information systems. We are proceeding with plans to improve information systems so that, in future, when military personnel leave the armed forces, they will be provided with information on their entitlement to treatment in the national health service, including priority treatment. Once these are in place, military personnel will be encouraged before they leave the service to fill out a GP registration form which asks whether or not the patient registering is a veteran. The form will then be sent direct to the new GP or given to the veteran to present on registration.</p>

The MAP can be accessed directly by veterans and their families, as well as through general practitioners (GPs). Although we have made no specific assessment of the level of awareness about this programme, it is publicised through many channels. We have confirmed that £2 million additional funding in the current financial year will be made available for a range of initiatives to improve veterans' mental health and this will include production of training resources for GPs.

 Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE) users were given notice in 2005 by Ofcom that they would have to vacate channels 31-37 (600 MHz spectrum) and 63-68 (800 MHz spectrum) by 2012, and in 2007 that channels 61-62 (800 MHz spectrum) would no longer be available for use. Ofcom consider this an acceptable period of notice for users to react and are not obliged to offer compensation or to find alternative spectrum. However, Ofcom have said that most of the 32 channels retained for digital terrestrial television after Digital Switchover in the 600 MHz band will still be available on an interleaved basis for PMSE and it is confident there will be enough spectrum in individual locations to more than satisfy historic peak demand.</p>

 The MPs' expenses scheme only allows the costs of economy/standard class tickets or the equivalent to be reimbursed. MPs travelling on sleeper train services are additionally entitled to claim for sleeper supplements, for either a single occupancy berth or a share of a twin occupancy berth. Both companies which provide sleeper train services within the UK will allow travellers to purchase either berth as a supplement to a standard class ticket.</p>

Therefore, as the guidance to the scheme states at paragraph 7.7, the total cost will be reimbursed in these cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="100714w0004.htm_para49"><a name="1007155000192">IPSA believes that this will allow Members to obtain a single berth on all sleeper services. Where this is not the case, IPSA would welcome evidence from Members.</p>
