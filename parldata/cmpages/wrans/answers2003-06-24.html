<a name="30624w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 To obtain a measure of congestion&#151;and the resultant costs&#151;on individual motorway links consistent with most congestion indicators, it would be necessary to measure journey times and speeds as they vary hour-by-hour and day-by-day. Regular measurement of journey times at this level of detail has 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jun 2003 : Column 658W</I><P>
not been carried out in the past, mainly because of the extremely high costs that would be involved. However, the opening of the Traffic Control Centre next year will greatly improve our knowledge of traffic conditions and will lead to comprehensive information on journey times and speeds being made generally available to the travelling public.

<P>
<a name="30624w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's White Paper on the future of transport recognised motorcycling has a role to play in an integrated transport policy. It stated that motorcycling can provide an alternative means of transport for many trips, bring benefits to the individual including widening employment opportunities, and may offer benefits for the environment and congestion. It advised local authorities to take account of the contribution motorcycling can make and to consider specific measures to assist motorcyclists.
<P>

<a name="30624w02.html_para0">However the White Paper also acknowledged that the role of motorcycling in an integrated transport policy raises some important and complex issues. We have therefore established an Advisory Group on Motorcycling to address these issues. The key workstreams should be completed during 2004, when we intend to determine a strategy for motorcycling.

 The Government's overall Channels Strategy, encourages public sector organisations to use a mix of electronic channels including mobile devices to deliver high quality government services to citizens efficiently and cost effectively.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para1">Figures show that 75 per cent. of the population owns a mobile phone. Its near ubiquity is the principal reason Government are keen to explore the potential of mobile communications.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para2">The office of the e-envoy has recently commissioned a study on how mobile communications might play a part in the e-government agenda. This study will inform the updated channels framework which is due to be published in the spring of 2004.

<P>
<a name="30624w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government have a wide engagement with the private sector to develop e-government services.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para3">The use of private sector ICT products and services to develop and deliver e-government services is well established. The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) runs a programme of work to foster the effective and efficient procurement of products and services to meet Government's needs.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para4">Assessment trials of the common IT vocabulary (known as XML) are underway to find the most effective way to allow buyers' and suppliers' computers, running different procurement software packages, to 'talk to each other'. This is a joint initiative from the OGC and the Business Applications Software Developers Association (BASDA). Importantly, the move will enable easier access to the government marketplace for Small and Medium Enterprises.

<a name="30624w03.html_para5">Also, as part of the e-government delivery programme, the Office of the e-envoy is responsible for the e-government intermediaries policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many of his staff retired on medical grounds due to mental health problems in the last year.  [111967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Between May 2002 and April 2003, the Civil Service Pension Scheme Medical Adviser assessed 241 scheme members as meeting the criteria for medical retirement for reasons attributable to mental ill-health. The vast majority of civil servants belong to the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and there are currently more than 500,000 active members.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para7">Mental ill-health in the context of this answer includes a non-exhaustive range of more specific diagnoses, including for example reactive depression, anxiety, psychosis and schizophrenia.
<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para8">Although data on retirements due to mental ill-health can be broken down by individual civil service employer, doing so where the employer has very few cases of this kind runs the risk of revealing the identity of the individuals concerned. In line with exemption 12 of the "Code of Practice on Access to Government Information", such disclosure would constitute or could facilitate an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office pursuant to his answer of 23 January 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 438W, on paper supplies, whether any of the paper or paper products supplied to his Department by Premier Paper are supplied by Stora Enso's Veitsiluoto Mill in Finland; and what assessment has been made of whether this paper contains <i>(a)</i> timber from old growth forests and <i>(b)</i> timber that may have been logged illegally in Russia.  [117546]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Cabinet Office is party to a framework contract for the provision of paper for printed publications for which the Premier Paper Group is one of four suppliers. The contract is managed by the Department for Transport. I refer the hon. Member to the first paragraph of the answer given to her by the Member for Plymouth, Devonport on 18 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 224W.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will ensure that the delivery and planning of services in <i>(a)</i> Amber Valley and <i>(b)</i> Derbyshire by government departments and public agencies are not distorted by the fact that many areas in Derbyshire do not have DE postcodes.

<P>

<a name="30624w03.html_para9">The postcode is a sorting and routing instruction for Royal Mail staff, and its sole purpose in the postal context is to help to identify the fastest and most efficient route for the transmission of mail to individual customers. The allocation of a postcode to each district and individual address is thus linked to Royal Mail's network of sorting and delivery offices and has never been intended to signify a geographically definitive address in terms of local authority or any other administrative boundaries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 I am a member of the Cabinet ministerial committee on energy policy which considered the Energy White Paper and also of the ministerial group forming part of the sustainable energy policy network.

 The Government have shown leadership in its strong encouragement of the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. The European Commission published a proposed FLEGT action plan on 21 May. The plan includes consideration of new EU legislative regulations to address imports of illegally logged timber in a way that is consistent with EU obligations to the World Trade Organisation. We are now working with the European Commission to develop regulations that will enable illegally logged timber to be refused entry to member states. Successful implementation of these proposals would depend on the co-operation of countries that produce and export timber. The UK raised the issue of the proposed action plan at Environment Council on 13 June with the aim of encouraging the incoming Italian Presidency to facilitate a full discussion at an early time and of focussing the attention of other member states on this important issue.

The number of illegal imports seized in 2002&#150;03 rose to three times the number made in the previous year, reflecting increased enforcement activity and better evidence-based targeting.

 Defra provides funding for coastal defence schemes which meet specified criteria, but responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with local authorities. Defra has paid Lancaster city council some &#163;10.5 million in grant for the first five phases of their coastal defence works at Morecambe. The council has yet to submit applications for funding of further phases of work there. However, I am fully aware that the council are concerned about the time it is taking them to identify habitat compensatory measures for the proposed works as required by the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994. Defra is seeking to assist the council by grant aiding studies to identify possible compensatory sites.

 There have been many exchanges over the years between interested bodies, including Defra and English Nature, on the various phases of Lancaster city council's Morecambe Coastal Protection Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Responsibility for assessing flood risk rests with local operating authorities rather than Defra. However I understand that the Environment Agency recently undertook a strategic flood risk assessment of their north-west region and concluded that Morecambe was one of the highest flood risk locations. No doubt Lancaster city council are taking this into account in progressing their proposed coastal defence works. For our part, Defra will consider any applications for funding such works as speedily as possible as soon as they are received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 All parishes that are in part or totally within the boundaries of the Cotswolds AONB would contribute to appointing the 8 parish members to the proposed Cotswolds AONB Conservation Board. At the moment we understand that 309 parishes will qualify.
<P>

<a name="30624w05.html_para3">There are 103 parishes that will be covered by the Board and are within the Cotswold district council administrative area. This equates to roughly one third of the total number of parishes covered by the Board. Cotswold district council parishes are shared between four of the eight regional groupings that would appoint parish members to a Cotswolds Conservation Board.

[119077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The legislation requires all applications for consent to release or market genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to be supported by a dossier of information about the GMO and its properties and an assessment of the risk to human health and the environment from the proposed release. This information is scrutinised by officials for compliance with relevant legislation. Scientific assessment of the dossiers is carried out by independent experts; the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, the Food Standards Agency, the statutory nature conservation agencies and the Health and Safety Executive. Consent to release would only be issued if these advisors are satisfied as regards the reliability and accuracy of the information provided by the applicant.
<P>

<a name="30624w06.html_para4">As regards liability, approval for a GMO release will only be given if the relevant authorities are satisfied that all appropriate measures are being taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment. There are specific provisions in Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act giving powers to the courts and the Secretary of State to remedy harm that results from the commission of an offence. Otherwise currently there are no specific liability provisions in relation to GM releases. Depending on the circumstances, however, a claim for redress could be made through the courts under existing general legal principles. The independent Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission is preparing a report to Government on GM crop liability. We will consider this issue further in the light of that report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department is aware of a number of Non-native species which can impact on native biodiversity but has not compiled a comprehensive list of Non-native fauna proposed to be controlled or eradicated. Issues in relation to individual species are considered on their merits, and control programmes may also be taken forward by the conservation agencies, other government departments, non-governmental organisations and others to address specific impacts. The devolved administrations can also take action in other parts of the UK. Environmental and economic effects of the presence of the species, the relative cost and likely success of control, are all important considerations.
<P>

<a name="30624w07.html_para0">I recognise that the problems caused by invasive Non-native species can be serious. The recent Review of Non-native Species Policy recommended that Government develop a comprehensive system to assess risks from Non-native species, and also policies with respect to management and control of Non-native species present or newly arrived in the wild, and operational capacity to implement these. The Review's report, available in the House Library, also gives indicative control costs for some invasive Non-native species. This is a complex and wide-ranging issue and we will be considering the review's report carefully in developing, in liaison with the Devolved Administrations, the Government's strategy to take this forward. There will be public consultation later this year.
<P>

<a name="30624w07.html_para1">In respect of species and organisms currently identified to be eradicated, action is being taken by Defra's plant health service to eradicate some introduced plant pests, including the potato brown rot bacterium from watercourses in eastern England, Phytophthora ramorum (the pathogen causing sudden death of oak trees in California) from nursery stock, and the insect pests Bemisia tabaci and Liriomyza huidobrensis from outbreaks in glasshouses. Contingency plans for possible outbreaks of Karnal bunt of wheat, potato ring rot and Colorado beetle are currently being drawn up or revised. Also, on the 3 March 2003 I made a written statement to the House stating that the Government agreed in principle to the eradication of the North American ruddy duck, 3 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 71WS.

Because of this it is not possible to rapidly provide a precise breakdown of support to voluntary organisations working with young people. Other

work&#151;particularly mainstream work with young people in rural communities&#151;is funded by other Government departments.
<P>

<a name="30624w07.html_para4">There are three specific strands of finance which are targeted particularly at young people. They are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) The Environmental Action Fund which helps voluntary groups in England working to promote sustainable development. The majority of projects involve young people to some extent and in 2003&#150;03 the involvement of young people is a major component of projects totalling &#163;1,023,664.
<P>
<BR>
(2) ENCAMS. Defra funds the environmental charity ENCAMS which is the parent organisation of the Tidy Britain Group, for work on litter, waste and local community initiatives in England. ENCAMS funding for youth related programmes and campaigns in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;252,000.
<P>
<BR>
(3) The Sustainable Development Fund which particularly targets the engagement of young people from rural and urban backgrounds on projects in the National Parks and the Broads which has &#163;1 million for 2002&#150;03 (increasing to &#163;1.6 million for 2003&#150;04).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30624w07.html_para5">In addition, Table 1 gives details of the funding made available to voluntary organisation across Defra's areas of responsibility, comparing 2000&#150;01 and 2002&#150;02. The total figure was nearly &#163;39 million in 2002&#150;03 compared with &#163;20 million in 2001&#150;02.

<P>

<a name="30624w09.html_para4">My officials are facilitating work between representatives of the UK wood industry and co-firing power stations to explore the opportunities offered by co-firing under the obligation for UK forestry, and, in particular, the potential for using byproducts from existing wood industries. It is hoped that this initiative, if successful, will have the dual benefit of reducing imports and making more biomass available for a larger market in the UK, thereby helping to stabilise prices. We understand from the forestry industry that it can meet demand from power generators from existing surplus forestry material. My officials are obtaining further information on the availability of forestry material used by power generators and wood panel manufacturers.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many telecommunications masts there are; and how many of these are shared between different operators.  [119600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The total number of telecommunications masts in the UK is not recorded nor is it possible to state how many are shared. Some are owned and operated by the communications operators themselves and others are leased from specialist companies. Operators are required always to consider the possibility of sharing mastsor other structures in order to minimise their number. Many structures such as power transmission pylons are shared with telecommunications equipment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many new masts she estimates will be required to fulfil the telecommunications obligation under the 3G licences by 2007; and how many of them she estimates will be shared.  [119602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the number of new masts that will be needed to fulfil the obligations of the 3G licensees, nor the number that will be shared. The total number of masts will be affected by the level of demand for 3G services, by commercial decisions related to the design of the networks and by the requirements of planning authorities. The four operators with existing GSM networks will also be able to reduce the number of sites required by co-locating the 3G and GSM antennae. Two of the operators, T-Mobile and MMO2 have entered into an agreement to share parts of their networks and this will significantly reduce the numbers of masts required. All operators are required to consider the sharing of masts and this has a significant effect in reducing the total number required.

 At the Ministerial Conference in Tokyo (January 2002), DFID pledged &#163;200 million over five years for development assistance in Afghanistan. In 2002&#150;03, we provided &#163;75 million including &#163;12.7 million to help clear Afghanistan's arrears to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, unlocking highly concessional loans of approximately $500 million over the next two years. For this financial year, DFID is willing to increase our Tokyo commitment of &#163;40 million per year to &#163;50 million, linked to progress on civil service reform. The joint FCO-DFID-MOD Global Conflict Prevention Pool will provide a further &#163;16.8 million this year.

 The programme of evaluations commissioned by DFID's Evaluation Department is independent of DFID's other programme activities and is funded from a separate budget line. The following figures relate only to evaluation activities managed by Evaluation Department. However, other evaluation activities are undertaken within DFID, including those within bilateral and multilateral programmes and within policy and research programmes. Since spending on these decentralised evaluation activities is charged in each case against the budget for the relevant programme, expenditure is spread across DFID's overall budget. Consequently, expenditure figures for these activities are not readily available and could not be accurately identified without disproportionate cost. Similarly, expenditure on research has been spread across a range of programmes and annual totals are difficult to estimate. It is therefore difficult to compare expenditure on research and on evaluation respectively, and the cost of doing so would be disproportionate.

 DFID has provided &#163;1.4 million for mine action in Sudan since April 2002. To date this support has been channelled through the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS), as the UN agency responsible for the co-ordination of mine action in Sudan. UNMAS' current objectives are to support the establishment of a working and appropriate national mine action management structure, as well as to support the systematic reduction of the threat of landmines and unexploded ordinance by a process of identification, isolation and clearance. Specific UNMAS activities, including those supported by DFID, have consisted of mine clearance of major roads in the Nuba Mountains region; cross-line training and capacity building for Sudanese de-miners; technical survey work; support for co-ordination activities; and planning for future mine action activities in the event of peace. Mine action throughout Sudan, particularly southern Sudan, will be a priority following a peace agreement to enable both increased access for humanitarian aid organisations and increased delivery of humanitarian assistance, as well as to allow displaced populations to return.

 DFID is not responsible for any Executive Agencies, advisory or executive non-departmental bodies or tribunals. It is however responsible for CDC Group plc, a self-financing public corporation which it wholly owns.
<P>

<a name="30624w11.html_para1">In 1999, DFID established an Investment Policy to which CDC Group plc must work.

 Two DFID projects, both in support the Republic of Zimbabwe Police, were suspended in April 2000 given concern about political activities and lack of respect for the law by the police. Both projects have since been closed.

The commitment to purchase 1,500 Land Rovers involved a DFID grant of &#163;8.4 million. 1,030 land rovers were provided, and &#163;6 million spent.

 As with every organisation, there is an ongoing need at the Atomic Weapons Establishment to maintain and improve the expertise of its workforce. The recruitment of graduate scientists is vital to the Company if it is to sustain its high technical expertise in the nuclear technology field. The Government attach great importance to ensuring the safety and serviceability of the UK's nuclear weapons. The Strategic Defence Review of 1998 confirmed the need for a robust capability to underwrite the safety and reliability of Trident, in the absence of nuclear testing and to maintain a minimum capability to design and produce a successor to Trident should this prove necessary. To achieve this assurance with great confidence and to meet the SDR remit, AWE must continue to recruit new staff to maintain a viable capability.

These investigations will include debriefing of Iraqi prisoners of war, interviews with senior regime figures and information from other Iraqi military and civilian sources. The breadth of such contacts means that it is not possible to quantify the numbers of interviews on this subject to date. At the appropriate time, we will make the evidence public.

 The potential proliferation of materials and technology related to Iraqi programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons, remains a matter of concern. Coalition forces continue to take action to secure sites, equipment, and material which may relate to WMD programmes, or which may otherwise contain hazardous substances, within the overall aim of restoring security and stability to Iraq. Our long term aim will be to account for, and eliminate, any WMD capability, including any biological weapons. We are confident that further evidence of Iraq's WMD programmes will be uncovered.

 It is Ministry of Defence policy that, in principle, the whole of the United Kingdom is open to essential military low flying training in order to spread the disturbance it can cause as thinly as possible. South East Essex, however, largely falls within an area known as the Thames Valley Avoidance Area (TVAA). The TVAA is excluded from routine military low flying

 The information received from LEAs about the education of permanently excluded pupils in response to a survey in spring 2002 was not sufficiently robust to provide a reliable picture of the type of education provision they received. Eight LEAs did not reply, and those who did used different methodologies to calculate their figures, some of which were incomplete. Some also expressed concern about the reliability of their own returns. For this reason I do not intend to place the results of this survey in the House of Commons Library.

 No specific discussions have been held on this issue between Ministers of the two Departments. However, both Departments are involved with the Mental Health and Social Exclusion project being led by the Government's Social Exclusion Unit. The project is looking at how to improve rates of employment for those aged 16&#150;65 with mental health problems, through support in taking up and retaining work. It is also looking at how to promote greater social participation and better access to services for this group.
<P>

<a name="30624w13.html_para7">The issue is also considered when taking forward other relevant policies. For instance we have developed the Connexions Service in partnership with a range of other Departments including the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Health, which of course leads on mental health policy. The Connexions Service plays an important role in ensuring all 13&#150;19 year olds, including those with mental health issues, get the support they need to overcome barriers to participation in learning and employment. We have recently published an 'emerging practice' guide for Connexions Partnerships setting out learning from a pilot project on providing support to young people with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="30624w13.html_para8">The Learning and Skills Council, which has responsibility for planning and funding of post-16 education and training, including work-based training, also works in partnership with colleagues in the DWP. It is undertaking a programme of action research projects and development work that includes work on promoting access to employment for people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities and also on the development of inclusive provision for learners with mental health problems. They have also published a National Institute of Adult Continuing Education briefing sheet for their staff, "Learning and Skills for People Experiencing Mental Health Difficulties". This sets out considerations for local LSCs to take into account in ensuring there is suitable provision for those with mental health difficulties.

 The UK is a strong supporter of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its work, including on the safety and security of nuclear and radioactive materials. In March 2002, the UK announced a voluntary contribution of &#163;250,000 towards the IAEA's Nuclear Security Fund (NSF) for work in Russia and the Former Soviet Union. We have since announced an additional &#163;250,000 per year for the next two years, bringing our total additional voluntary contribution to &#163;750,000. We are also supporting the IAEA's programmes in other ways, including active participation in the revision of the IAEA Code Of Conduct On The Safety And Security Of Radioactive Sources and the provision of UK expertise where appropriate.

Our current project plans include the dismantling of nuclear submarines, making safe spent nuclear fuel, finding sustainable employment for former weapons scientists, improving nuclear safety and security of nuclear materials, decommissioning a reactor in Kazakhstan, contributing to a shelter at Chernobyl, and chemical weapons destruction. We will negotiate further projects with Russia in due course, as part of this 10-year programme.

It concludes that there have been improvements in content, and that the new textbooks do not incite against Israel or against peace. We continue to encourage such developments, and to support both the Palestinian Authority and Israel as they implement the roadmap, which includes clear obligations on both parties to end incitement against the other. We call on leaders and opinion-formers on both sides to set the standard and exercise judgment in their public statements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many glass-fronted room heaters have been replaced by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in each of the past 10 years; what health and safety procedures are in place to ensure that second-hand room heaters pose no risk to those tenants having them installed; and how often these procedures are updated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Housing Executive is currently in the process of replacing all glass-fronted room heaters with oil or natural gas systems and, over the last four years the number of room heaters in Housing Executive homes has been reduced from around 52,000 to 25,284. It is expected that the majority of the remaining room heaters will be replaced over the next three years. Figures for the 10 individual years are not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30624w16.html_para7">Damaged or unserviceable glass-fronted room heaters are only replaced with second-hand units as an interim measure in situations where a full-scale heating replacement scheme has already been programmed. Each second-hand room heater is examined and assessed by a major heating contractor and if deemed to be in good order it is then fully re-conditioned before it is re-fitted. During the re-conditioning process the appliance is thoroughly checked and tested in the same manner and to the same standards applied to a new appliance. At the time of commissioning, the installation is checked in-situ to the same standards as a new appliance and a commissioning certificate produced. This procedure is now only into its second year of operation and is presently under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will estimate the annual regional rate increase in Northern Ireland for each &#163;100 million of borrowing under the Reform and Reinvestment Initiative assuming a Great Britain council tax increase of 10 per cent. average.  [119042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 A 10 per cent. average increase in council tax in England would represent an increase in the average household bill of &#163;91 per annum over current (2003&#150;04) levels. Access to borrowing under the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative is dependent on the total rates product in Northern Ireland (i.e. the District and Regional rates). On the assumption that district rate and regional non-domestic rate increases are in line with recent trends, a borrowing power of &#163;100 million in 2004&#150;05 would require an increase in the average regional domestic rate of approximately &#163;64 per household per annum over the 2003&#150;04 figure. Each additional &#163;100 million of borrowing in that year would require a further increase of around &#163;10 per household per annum.

 There are no plans currently in place to require disclosure of company drug trial results. The Government welcome the pharmaceutical industry's support for the Department of Health's research governance framework for health and social care, which recognises that it is researchers' responsibility to ensure that research findings are opened to critical review through the accepted scientific and professional channels and disseminated promptly once established. The Government encourage the pharmaceutical industry to disclose drug trial results to the maximum extent consistent with regulatory process and intellectual property rights.

 The tampons industry is self-regulated. Since 1984, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the sanitary protection industry have operated a voluntary prior notification scheme for menstrual tampons. Under the scheme, manufacturers submit to the DTI written details of any significant changes to new or current products. The notification applies to the entire manufactured product including the tampon itself. Approximately 95 per cent., of tampon manufacturers in this country are covered by this scheme. The scheme includes a code of practice, agreed with the DTI, which all the manufacturers who belong to the scheme must comply with. This covers product safety assessment of all materials used. The notification scheme is the industry's response to concerns regarding toxic shock syndrome. Under the scheme, the

<P>
<a name="30624w19.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 There are no controls over the levels of dioxins in tampons and sanitary towels. Trace amounts of dioxins can be formed in cotton used in tampons and sanitary towels during bleaching processes using chlorine. The levels, if detectable, are very low and pose no risk to human health. There is evidence that some manufacturers use unbleached cotton for these products and hence exposure to dioxins in these cases does not occur.
<P>

<a name="30624w19.html_para20">The toxicology of dioxins has been extensively reviewed by many national and international expert groups. The most recent evaluation, by the Committee on Toxicity of Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, was completed in 2001. The potential level of exposure to dioxins associated with use of bleached cotton in sanitary towels and tampons would be considerably lower that the recent tolerable daily intake set by the Committee.

 The intention of the proposals on corporate killing will be to address the failure of the criminal justice system to deal successfully with systemic corporate management failure, particularly in relation to large companies, which results in death. It is not our intention to target the criminal liability of individual directors. Where the failure is on the part of an individual, he should be prosecuted. The present gap is where the failure is collective.

 The National Treatment Agency (NTA) has carried out a review of available evidence on crack cocaine treatment and has issued guidance to service providers and commissioners to support service development, as part of the National Crack Plan, published in January 2003.
<P>

<a name="30624w22.html_para20">The evidence suggests that cocaine misuse is treatable and many approaches already familiar to drug services in Britain work well, though none are specific to the treatment of crack dependence. The NTA guidance makes use of this research by identifying issues that local commissioners need to consider in developing effective treatment services.

<a name="30624w23.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The significant increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disruption to their families, particularly their children, underlines the importance of responding specifically to the particular needs and characteristics of women offenders.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para0">We are taking forward the Women's Offending Reduction Programme over the next three years in order to promote a more distinct response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend, and encourages joint working between departments, agencies and other relevant organisations. A primary focus will be on improving community based interventions that are better tailored to the needs of women, and encouraging greater use of community disposals to ensure that custody is only used for women offenders who really need to be there.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para1">It is, of course, for the courts to decide what sentence is appropriate in individual cases, but we intend to support and encourage greater use of community sentences for women by making sure that there is a comprehensive package of community interventions and services to meet their particular needs, including child care facilities, safe housing, drug treatment or mental health services. We will continue to ensure that the courts are made fully aware of the community options that are available.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para2">We are also introducing new sentencing powers in the Criminal Justice Bill that will allow offenders on short custodial sentences to focus their rehabilitative work in the community, enabling them to maintain family ties and employment. The Criminal Justice Bill will introduce 'Custody minus', under which offenders will have a custodial sentence of under 12 months suspended providing they follow set requirements in the community, breach of which would return them to prison.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para3">There is a new sentence of intermittent custody, under which offenders can spend part of the week in custody and part 'on licence' in the community. One of the pilots for this sentence will be at a women's prison, Her Majesty's Prison Morton Hall. Intermittent Custody will provide an alternative to full-time custody for suitable offenders and will enable them to serve their sentence in a way which dovetails more closely with their personal circumstances.

 I can confirm that authorisations under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 have been made by Gloucestershire Constabulary and confirmed by Ministers. An authorisation may be given only for the purpose of preventing acts of terrorism. It is a longstanding policy of this and previous administrations not to comment on operational counter-terrorist measures and it would be inappropriate for me to elaborate further.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to assist disadvantaged people in providing for home security in poorer areas; and if he will make a statement on measures to be taken when a home has been repeatedly burgled.  [119573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w23.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Under the Crime Reduction Programme, around 200 of the 250 reducing burglary projects involved some form of target hardening for houses that had been burgled or were otherwise considered vulnerable. The projects were all in areas with high burglary rates, which correlate closely with areas of deprivation. We also provided home security improvements to around 55,000 low income pensioners living in areas with burglary rates above the national average.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para6">The Crime Reduction Programme has now been replaced by the Building Safer Communities fund (BSC). BSC funding is mainly distributed directly to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships and it is open to individual Partnerships to introduce target hardening for disadvantaged people, if this accords with local priorities and after consultation with the regional Home Office Director. Reducing burglary is a priority for more than four-fifths of Partnerships and many are undertaking target hardening schemes.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para7">The Police Standards Unit has developed a model of best practice and a menu of tactical options for tackling repeat burglary. It includes such things as target hardening, fast-track processing of DNA, watch 



<P>

schemes (such as Neighbourhood Watch), installation of CCTV and alarms, high visibility patrolling (from police, community safety officers etc.) and better use of intelligence. It also includes a tool to allow household risks and requirements to be assessed. This is being tested in several forces prior to the results being more widely disseminated.
<P>

<a name="30624w23.html_para8">The results of the British Crime Survey indicate that the risk of burglary is inversely related to the level of household security. Householders can, therefore, reduce their chances of being re-victimised by fitting and properly using good quality door and window locks; fencing and gates; alarms etc.

 Targets are set by police authorities in their annual policing and best value performance plans. In the financial year 2002&#150;03, police authorities continued working towards targets for the reduction of vehicle crime and domestic burglary. In addition, the Metropolitan Police Authority and the police authorities for Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands and West Yorkshire set targets for the reduction of robbery. Police authorities may set targets in other areas according to locally determined priorities. In 2002&#150;03, for the purposes of securing best value, police authorities were required to monitor the performance of their forces against 21 indicators. They can choose locally to set targets against these indicators. Police authorities must publish performance against any targets and indicators.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list for each category D prison for which the Prison Service has responsibility for each of the last five years, <i>(a)</i> how many prisoners have absconded <i>(b)</i> how many prisoners who absconded were caught and returned to prisons, <i>(c)</i> how many prisoners at <i>(b)</i> served all or part of the remainder of their sentence in a category C or above prison, <i>(d)</i> how many prisoners have absconded who have yet to be recaptured and <i>(e)</i> how much annual investment has been made in each of the category D prisons designed to deter absconding; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="30624w24.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Categorisation relates to prisoners not prisons. Category D prisoners are those who it is assessed can be reasonably trusted in open conditions. The information sought is not collated in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The available information is set out in the following table. Data are given in respect of prisons that are now open or semi-open. Drake Hall was a female open prison until January 2002 when it became a semi-open prison. Hatfield open young offender institution became Moorland open prison in 2002. Morton Hall was re-roled from male open to female semi-open in 2000. Data on the number recaptured may be understated due to under-reporting.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para2">No investment has been made in open prisons specifically aimed at deterring absconding, but prisoners allocated to open conditions are selected on the basis of stringent risk assessment procedures. The

nature of the regimes in the open estate, with their focus on effective resettlement in the community after release, are designed to encourage the development of personal responsibility on the part of prisoners. Those prisoners who do abscond are usually located in closed, category C, prisons following recapture. In addition to the more

limited regime and greater restrictions which apply in such prisons, prisoners who abscond are likely to receive a punishment involving added days and the loss of various privileges. Where eligible, such prisoners would also be extremely unlikely to secure early release on home detention curfew licence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prison cells there are; and of these how many are regarded as safe cells.  [120724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w24.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The number of available prison cells changes daily as a result of construction and change in use. At present, the number of cells in use is approximately 45,000. Almost 3,000 safer cells have been installed.

<P>
<a name="30624w24.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Funding from the May 2002 budget was provided for 2,320 places to be delivered over the following 12 months.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para3">In addition, we have already announced that &#163;60 million will be made available to provide 740 places by March 2004, together with funding for 450 places at Birmingham prison, which are currently scheduled to open by April 2004. A further &#163;138 million has been agreed from the Budget, which will be used to build around 1,000 places over the period 2004&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para4">Provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will provide sentencers with a range of new disposals to enable them to impose tough and flexible sentences on offenders who do not need to be given custodial sentences. We are also introducing tough new community sentences such as the 'Intensive Control and Change programme' (ICCP) aimed at cutting offending by 18 to 20-year-olds by tackling their offending behaviour and aiding rehabilitation. We have also extended the Home Detention Curfew scheme to increase the maximum period to four and a half months.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many unfilled positions there were in the Prison Service in each month since June 2002; by what percentage the Prison Service is understaffed in each prison in the UK; and what measures his Department is taking to increase the number of prison officers into the Prison Service.  [120170]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w24.html_spnew9"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The number of unfilled prison officer grade positions in the Prison Service for each month since June 2002 is shown in Table A. The percentage shortfall in each prison in England and Wales within the public sector is contained in Table B. It has not been possible to collate this information for contracted out prisons and I shall write to the hon. Member when the information is available.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para5">There are a number of measures under way to increase recruitment and retention. The National Staffing Unit successfully increased prison officer recruitment from an average 1,000 a year to 2,096 during 2002&#150;03. In line with all other recruitment, responsibility for officer recruitment has now been devolved to area and establishment level in order that areas of specific need can be addressed more effectively by local advertising and recruitment campaigns. The majority of applicants wish to work in their home area and are not prepared to move to where establishments have vacancies. Recruitment campaigns have been and continue to be run in areas where shortages are identified and provision has been made to train a further 2,200 new officers during the current financial year.

<i>[holding answer 17 June 2003]:</i> We intend to publish the report of a review of pharmacy services for prisoners very shortly. The national occupational standards for custodial health care set out the competencies required for the administration of medication, including in circumstances where there is a risk of self-harm.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para9">The "Toolkit for Health Care Needs Assessment in Prisons" (University of Birmingham February 2000) provided guidance for prisons and the NHS on the planning requirements for health care services for prisoners. The organisation and staffing of health care centres are matters to be determined by prison governors, in consultation with their local NHS partners.

<a name="30624w24.html_para14">Emerging findings from a group examining recent deaths in custody at Styal have helped to bring about a number of immediate changes. These include the maximisation of prisoners' access to work, education and time out of cell, as well as to various peer support schemes and mental health professionals; improvements to Styal's induction programme; and an improved package of training and support for staff in first-aid and management of suicidal women.

<a name="30624w24.html_para15">In the longer term, 200,000 of funding has been secured to dedicate part of Styal's Waite wing to a proposed high-risk activity team, which will include staff specially trained in risk identification and management. NHS funding has been secured to provide a methadone maintenance programme for women dependent on opiates (subject to staff recruitment), a particular necessity in the female estate where a high percentage of receptions are poly-drug users.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he is taking to <i>(a)</i> reduce overcrowding in prisons, <i>(b)</i> reduce the number of security incidents in prisons reported to the Home Office each week and <i>(c)</i> improve the vetting procedures for employing prison officers into the Prison Service.  [120167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30624w24.html_spnew13"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Funding has been provided for 2,820 extra prison places to be built at existing prisons. In addition, two new prisons will be opened at Ashford and Peterborough. Together with building programmes in progress, these will increase the total useable capacity of the Prison Service estate from 74,138 (as at 19 June 2003) to around 78,700 by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para16">Provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will provide sentencers with a range of new disposals to enable them to impose tough and flexible sentences on offenders who do not need to be given custodial sentences. We are also introducing tough new community sentences such as the 'Intensive Control and Change programme' aimed at cutting offending by 18 to 20-year-olds by tackling their offending behaviour and aiding rehabilitation. We have also extended the Home Detention Curfew scheme to increase the maximum period to four and a half months. Whatever the population pressures, the Government are uncompromising in its response to serious and dangerous offenders: where there is a need to protect the public, they will be held in a secure environment.

<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para17">Prisons are required to report security incidents to Prison Service headquarters. The number of reported incidents in prisons has increased over recent years. In part this is due to improved reporting, although both the number and rate of incidents has increased. Incident data is monitored and analysed so that policy and procedures can be reviewed in order to minimise future incidents and disseminate best practice. Key performance indicators on escapes, assaults and drug testing focus managers and staff on preventing these types of security incidents and self inflicted deaths.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para18">Major initiatives aimed at minimising security incidents include a review of the security manual, a programme of perimeter security improvements in selected prisons and a security awareness programme. Improved analysis and research into the pattern and causes of incidents, including those of concerted indiscipline and hostage taking, is under way.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para19">The Safer Custody Group is working on a violence reduction strategy that will focus on prevention. This mirrors similar approaches taken in the community and in other organisations. Work is already under way to increase the problem-solving capacity of staff and prisoners, improve risk management, reduce violent offending and prevent victimisation.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para20">The Prison Service Drug Strategy includes a co-ordinated package of measures to reduce both the supply of&#151;and demand for&#151;drugs in prison. These include improving CCTV in visits areas, providing additional drug detection dogs, introducing comprehensive measures to deal with visitors who attempt to smuggle drugs, research into the most effective electronic drug-detection equipment, better use of fixed and low-level furniture, and improving drugs awareness training for staff. In February 2003, the Prison Service announced the Supply Reduction Project (SRP)&#151;a co-ordinated programme that aims to support establishments reduce still further the supply of drugs in prisons.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para21">In addition to these centrally led initiatives, establishments have developed local programmes tailored to their particular circumstances. These include violence reduction and anti-bullying programmes. Minimising the number of security incidents is essential to the safe custody of prisoners and to the protection of prisoners and staff. However, the number of incidents will increase as population increases and it should be recognised that the majority of incidents other than escapes, assaults and deaths are quickly and safely resolved by Prison Service staff through the use of good contingency planning and incident resolution procedures.
<P>

<a name="30624w24.html_para22">A formal investigation into the circumstances of the employment of a journalist at Woodhill is scheduled to report by 27 June 2003. The terms of reference include a requirement to ascertain what took place and recommend changes to recruitment and pre-appointment vetting procedures. It would not be appropriate to pre-empt the findings of the report. The Prison Service will consider urgently what action to take in the light of the recommendations.

 <i>[holding answer 20 June 2003]:</i> There are a wide range of passported benefits and it is not possible to say how many people may lose entitlement as a result of new tax credits. However where free school meals and welfare foods were previously only available to families on income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance, eligibility has been extended to low income families who receive child tax credit (but not working tax credit). Entitlement to sure start maternity grants and funeral payments has also been extended to include families who receive more than the family element of child tax credit, or a disability or severe disability element of working tax credit. Families on low incomes will remain entitled to milk tokens and help with health costs.
<P>

<a name="30624w26.html_para9">We estimate that around 70,000 families will move off income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance and then receive a higher income as a result of the increased generosity of new tax credits. These families

<a name="30624w26.html_para10">The introduction of child tax credit has caused no changes to the rules for claiming council tax benefit. As before, it is adjusted to take into account tax credit income, being withdrawn steadily, at a rate of 20p in the pound, to ensure families always benefit from any increase in their income (whether from the new tax credits or any other source). Families who move off income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance need to make a standard claim to council tax benefit and they can be helped to do this by staff at their local Jobcentre Plus office.
