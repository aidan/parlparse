Bribery of any official or &#039;agent&#039; are long standing crimes under UK law and since 2002 our courts have had jurisdiction over acts of bribery by UK nationals and companies even if the acts take place entirely overseas.

 When an asylum claimant is found by the Immigration and Nationality not to be a refugee within the meaning of the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees, caseworkers will go on to consider whether a grant of Humanitarian Protection or Discretionary Leave is appropriate under our published policies. Where a claimant qualifies for Humanitarian Protection or Discretionary Leave, limited leave will be granted for a period of up to three years. Those who are found not to be in need of international protection and have no other basis of stay would be expected to leave the United Kingdom, subject to the outcome of any appeal.

 European Foulbrood (EFB) is a disease of honeybees for which effective means of control are in place or under development.

<p><a name="50606w06.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Government recently carried out a five yearly review of British Waterways and endorsed its vision of being largely self-sufficient by 2012. British Waterways&#039; non-operational estate is an essential part of this strategy and produced around &#163;26.5 million of rental income in 2004&#150;05, out performing the Industry Investment Property Database for total returns from property and investment by almost 3 percentage points .
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w06.html_para1">
British Waterways relies on income from its assets to contribute to the cost of maintaining its waterways and to improve their attractiveness, use, amenity and interest to the wider public.

<p><a name="50606w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 As yet, there have been no formal intergovernmental discussions of the design of a future commitment period under the Kyoto protocol. The UK will chair the EU at the UN climate change conference at the end of this year at which these discussions are due to commence. Our presidency of the EU gives us an excellent opportunity to galvanise work on preparing for future action. Nevertheless, experts have been considering what different approaches might look like and a number of approaches have been suggested for the design of future action on climate change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w06.html_para2">
At this stage, it is important that we remain flexible in looking at the options, that all existing suggestions for future frameworks remain on the table, and that full consideration is given both to the possible frameworks themselves and to the elements within them that could be used to form part of a workable solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w06.html_para3">
In considering any future regime, the Government&#039;s long-term view is that the architecture of a future framework needs to be realistic (relevant to countries with different national circumstances), robust (capable of being adjusted in the light of experience) and durable (will not become irrelevant after a few years) but for any such framework to be affective, it would be necessary for it to achieve a wide global acceptance and to deliver results in terms of significant emissions reductions.

Following public consultation carried out on the Schedule last year, my aim is to revise it during 2005 before the next round of licensing at the end of the year. On the main body of the Act, the Department is developing new options which aim to deliver the public safety benefits of the legislation but also to reduce the level of regulatory burden on local authorities and animal keepers. This will require a slightly longer timescale which may be affected by other initiatives such as the Animal Welfare Bill. I expect to consider the options this year with a view to further developing new proposals for consultation early in 2006.

A key aim of the strategy will be to rationalise and improve the use of assets, and to dispose of those assets that are under-utilised or under-performing.

The strategy will also consider opportunities to exploit the value of Defra&#039;s intangible assets particularly intellectual property.

By the end of the transitional period some sectors will have gained or lost against historical subsidy receipts. Generally speaking, flat rate payments redistribute subsidy from more intensive to less intensive producers and to land not formerly in receipt of subsidy. On average larger dairy farms will receive lower payments under this system than under one based on historic receipts (although, by contrast, smaller farms will on average be better off). However, we believe that the eight-year transition to the flat rate payment should give farmers time to adjust.

All payments to dairy farmers in the UK, as for other recipients of the Single Payment, will be decoupled from production, and therefore are no longer linked to particular farming activity. In a decoupled subsidy environment, farmers should only produce milk if they can do so profitably.

Notes<br>

(a) Figures for 1987 to 1999 cover main holdings only. For other years minor holdings are included. A holding is defined as minor if it meets all of the following conditions:<br>

1. the total area is less than 6 hectares<br>

2. the labour requirement is estimated to be less than 100 standard person-days<br>

3. there is no regular full-time farmer or worker<br>

4. the glasshouse area is less than 100 square meters<br>

5. the occupier does not farm another holding.<br>

(b) Due to the introduction of new questions in 1998 figures prior to this year are not directly comparable with later years&#039; results.<br>

(c) Due to a register improvement exercise in 2001 labour figures prior to this are not directly comparable with later results.<br>

(d) The standard gross margin (SGM) is a financial measure based on the concept of the gross margin for farming enterprises. The total SGM for each farm is calculated by multiplying it&#039;s crop areas and livestock numbers by the appropriate SGM coefficients and then summing the result for all enterprises on the farm.<br>

<p>
<a name="50606w08.html_para2">
The vote on 19 May was on an application made to the German authorities in August 2002 under the novel food regulations (EC) 258/97. This application is for food use of ingredients derived from GM maize MON 863. This dossier also included the results of the rat feeding study. The initial opinion from the German authorities was referred to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which concluded that MON 863 maize will not have an adverse effect on human health. This conclusion has been endorsed by the UK expert committee, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes.

<p>
<a name="50606w08.html_para3">
In September 2004 the German authorities submitted a critique of the rat feeding study by Professor Pusztai. This highlighted a number of features of the study that appeared to indicate adverse effects of the GM maize. EFSA examined this document and issued a statement in September 2004 that confirmed its earlier conclusions. At the same time, the rat feeding study was independently re-examined by the GM sub-group of the UK&#039;s Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, which confirmed that this was a normal and well-conducted study that did not indicate any adverse effects.

Notes:<br>

1. Average prices have been calculated from separate monthly surveys of milk purchasers conducted in England and Wales by Defra, in Scotland by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARD. The surveys were introduced following changes to the milk marketing arrangements in 1994&#150;95. The farmgate price is the average price received by producers, net of delivery charges. No deduction has been made for superlevy.<br>

2. Prices include any retrospective bonuses made by purchasers. Provisional from 2004 onwards.<br>

These regulations are continually reviewed by UKXIRA as outlined in section two of the fifth annual report, published in 2003, which resulted in UKXIRA recommending that the Government review the definition of xenotransplantation.

Athletes must also be able to represent either Great Britain or England in competition. For the first year of the programme (2004&#150;05) no athletes from Northern Ireland received support from TASS as none met the eligibility criteria.

 Pelican crossings were introduced in 1969. We have no recent studies of their effectiveness but studies into the effects of converting a zebra to a pelican crossing, comparisons of pedestrian crossings, and the comparative safety of pedestrian crossings were conducted in the years following their introduction. Reports are available from TRL Limited (formerly the Transport Research Laboratory).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w14.html_para0">
Research carried out by the Transport and Research Laboratory for my Department in 1992 following the introduction of new puffin crossing estimated an average net benefit of approximately &#163;10,000 per site per annum through reduced vehicle delays, giving an overall benefit across the country of about &#163;50 million, if installations were to take place at all sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w14.html_para1">
The Highways Agency commissioned work from the London Accident Analysis Unit in 1996 to carry out a comparative accident study at five pelican crossing conversions to puffins. The investigations found that puffin was no worse than a pelican crossing but in some cases it was better in terms of accidents involving pedestrians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w14.html_para2">
Further research has been commissioned by the Department for Transport to examine the effectiveness of puffin crossings at six sites and the effect of the new crossing on pedestrian and driver behaviour. This work will conclude by the end of this year.

Many bilateral donors have joined the UK in providing 100 per cent. relief. However, multilateral institutions only provide relief at around half this level. The Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development announced in September 2004 that the

The Chancellor discussed this proposal at the G7 Finance Ministers in London in February, and in Washington in April, where the G7 agreed that further debt relief is needed, and to the principle of up to 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief.

Iraq is not eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries&#039; Initiative.

For IMF debt, we believe the IMF&#039;s gold reserves are an under-utilised resource that could be used to finance further debt relief by the IMF. IMF analysis of debt relief and gold sales show that sales of the magnitude which would be required to finance the UK&#039;s proposal for debt relief could if properly phased be accommodated by gold markets without significant difficulty, and fall well within the bounds set by official sellers of gold in recent years.

<p><a name="50606w25.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Between 1 January 2000 and 2 April 2000 asylum seekers could seek permission to work if their application remained outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made on it. During this period any asylum seeker, irrespective of the time taken to reach an initial negative decision on their claim, could seek permission to work if they were appealing against the decision to refuse them asylum. The employment concession for asylum seekers was amended with effect from 3 April 2000 to restrict permission to work to those asylum seekers whose application for asylum remained outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made on it. Those appealing against a decision to refuse them asylum were no longer able to seek permission to work. The concession under which asylum seekers could seek permission to work was withdrawn on 23 July 2002 but it remained possible for asylum seekers to be given permission to take employment in exceptional circumstances. Since 6 February 2005, following the introduction of the EU Directive on Reception Standards for Asylum Seekers, asylum seekers may seek permission to work if their claim remains outstanding for longer than 12 months without a decision being made on it and providing the reason for the delay cannot be attributable to the asylum seeker.

 In a flexible and dynamic labour market such as that of the UK, it is impractical to make forecasts of this nature. As set out in the Home Office Five Year Strategy for Asylum and Immigration, the Government encourages migration for work through a flexible points based system that is employer-led and responsive to market needs, rather than a rigid and arbitrary quota.

<p>
<a name="50606w25.html_para4">
There is already a range of controls to tackle the misuse of these guns which cause real nuisance and can result in the deployment of armed police. To help combat the problem, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 created a new offence of having an imitation firearm in a public place without reasonable excuse. This means that anybody seen in public with an airsoft gun can be challenged and, if unable to give a satisfactory explanation for having it, arrested. It is also a serious offence to threaten other people with imitation firearms.

We have made it clear that we will not tolerate the use of imitation firearms to threaten and intimidate others and we will be proposing tougher laws on the sale and manufacture of all imitation firearms and tougher penalties for misuse in the proposed Violent Crime Reduction Bill.

The Police Standards Unit (PSU) in the Home Office regularly monitors the performance of police forces and, within them, basic command units, and engages with forces who are underperforming on a range of indicators. Forces&#039; performance against their peers is an important aspect of the assessment. PSU have not been engaged with Hertfordshire police.

Hertfordshire constabulary had 2,135 police officers on 30 September 2004, 213 more than in March 2001. The Crime Fighting Fund has funded 113 extra officers in the force since April 2000, over and above the force&#039;s own recruitment plans. At the end of March Hertfordshire constabulary had 99 community support officers, supplementing the work of the force in providing reassurance to communities.

The Home Office has made available to all police forces and CDRPs a statistical database, iQuanta, that enables them to monitor their crime reduction performance.

 Recorded crime figures are used to measure the extent of crime in local areas. Although these include statistics on drugs offences&#151;such as possession&#151;and on property crimes&#151;such as burglary&#151;they do not contain information on the offender&#039;s drug habits. It is therefore not possible to estimate from these statistics the numbers of crimes in Wales that are drug-related.

[687]</p>




<p><a name="50606w28.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 May 2005]:</i> Home Office interest in ticket touting is limited to section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which prohibits ticket touting in respect of regulated football matches. This is a public order provision which explicitly applies to football in view of the importance of segregation in reducing the potential for disorder between rival fans. The provision has not been extended to cover other sports as there is no comparable public order threat.

<p><a name="50606w28.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 This is a local operational matter. Traffic wardens are employed by police authorities and act under the directions of the chief officer of police. Their role in enforcing parking restrictions is being reduced as decriminalised parking enforcement is becoming more widespread. Community Support Officers and accredited persons can also exercise certain traffic related powers and these are being extended by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The recruitment of parking attendants to enforce civil parking infringements is a matter for the local authority.

activity) on reducing crime in isolation from other factors. The 2000 British Crime Survey found that 75 per cent. of respondents thought that Neighbourhood Watch schemes were effective in preventing crimes such as burglary. The information was published in 2001 as part of Home Office Research Findings 150. The Home Office has not made a separate assessment of the effectiveness of Shop Watch, Pub Watch, Farm Watch, Rural Watch or other &quot;Watch&quot; schemes. Following a research and public consultation exercise in 2004, the Home Office is in the process of setting up a new national forum organisation which will act as an umbrella body for the Watch movement as a whole. The new organisation will be a registered charity and independent of Government. It will aim to share good practice within and between different Watch organisations and help to improve co-ordination between them.

 All schools must teach about alcohol as part of the science curriculum. Schools are also expected to use the non-statutory framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) to deliver drug, alcohol and tobacco education. At Key Stages 3 the framework states that pupils should learn basic laws and facts about alcohol and at Key Stage 4, they should learn about the health risks of alcohol.

<p><a name="50606w29.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Anti-litter campaigns are supported by guidance for primary schools relating to the curriculum. For example, geography guidance encourages schools to promote anti-litter activities. Through citizenship lessons pupils learn about what improves and harms their local environments and the ways in which they can play their part in looking after them. Such lessons contribute to pupils&#039; understanding of the consequences of dropping litter.

 Quality music provision depends on having a strong and diverse workforce with a wide variety of skills and experience. Through the Music Manifesto and our ambitious Wider Opportunities programme for primary pupils, we are encouraging classroom teachers to work in partnership with other music leaders and teachers from Local Education Authority Music Services, music institutions such as local orchestras and opera companies and the community music sector.

 The organisation of education and training provision for 16&#150;19 year olds in an area is a matter for local stakeholders, primarily the local Learning and Skills Council and the Local Authority. The LSC informs me that, following consultation on its Strategic Area Review options for Hertfordshire, it has no plans to close school sixth forms in the Broxbourne area. The Department&#039;s five year strategy announced measures to increase choice and diversity in 16&#150;19 provision.

<p><a name="50606w30.html_wqn6"><b> John Hemming: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what changes in expenditure her Department expects to arise from the plans outlined in her Department&#039;s technical note produced for the Gershon review proposing <i>(a)</i> a reduction in the number of teachers and their replacement with interactive whiteboards and classroom supervisors and <i>(b)</i> replacing supply teachers with classroom supervisors.  [983]</p>




<p><a name="50606w30.html_spnew5"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s technical note does not propose <i>(a)</i> a reduction in the number of teachers and their replacement with interactive whiteboards and classroom supervisors or <i>(b)</i> replacing all supply teachers with classroom supervisors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w30.html_para0">
The Gershon review focuses on improving efficiency and recycling such gains into the frontline. The Department&#039;s expenditure therefore remains unaffected and the Department will continue to invest in schools at the record levels already announced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w30.html_para1">
The effective use of information and communications technology (ICT), such as electronic interactive whiteboards, is a significant and powerful tool for increasing teachers&#039; productive time and improving the quality of learning and teaching. ICT supports and enhances quality teaching and is not a substitute for it. The January2005 figures show that the number of teachers increased by 4,000 during the previous year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w30.html_para2">
Schools spent around &#163;800 million in 2003&#150;04 on agency staff and supply teachers. As part of remodelling the school work force the Department is supporting schools in developing and implementing more effective and cost efficient solutions. For example, the Department does not believe that it is a good use of teachers&#039; time to cover for absent colleagues. The use of established cover staff for short-term absences provides better supervision by staff who belong to the school and know the children concerned, and at less cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the expenditure per secondary school pupil was in <i>(a)</i> each inner London local education authority and <i>(b)</i> Southampton local education authority in each year since 1997.  [1697]</p>




<p><a name="50606w34.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The information requested is contained within the following table. There are two main reasons for the difference in spending: first, most inner London authorities have more pupils living in deprived circumstances than Southampton and receive extra funding to reflect that. Inner London authorities also receive extra funding to reflect the high costs of recruiting and retaining staff.

<sup>(34)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending LEA maintained secondary schools and are draw from the DES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources occurred between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000, and 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03.<br>

<sup>(37)</sup> The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(38)</sup> The 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002 -03 and 2003&#150;04 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(39)</sup> Unit costs in Inner London LEAs are higher than in Outer London and other LEAs, because of higher expenditure on teachers&#039; pay.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are reported in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;10 as reported by the LEA.<br>

2. City of London LEA has no LEA maintained secondary schools.<br>

<p><a name="50606w34.html_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Information provided by the Council for the Advancement of Communication for Deaf People shows that in 2003&#150;04 over 20,000 people were learning British sign language (BSL)&#151;approximately 18,500 at level one, 400 at level two, 400 at level three and 200 at level four (including those studying at higher education (HE) institutions).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w34.html_para0">
It is recognised that the demand for BSL courses is currently greater than the supply of provision. The main contributory factor is the recognised shortage of BSL tutors. That is why some of the &#163;1.5 million made available by Government to support the recognition of BSL as a European language is being used to fund six initiatives, which will contribute to establishing a Great Britain wide framework to support the recruitment, training and deployment of BSL tutors. The aim is to enhance numbers, status and levels of qualification. The Learning and Skills Council is currently discussing with the DWP how it might work in partnership to assist in the development of the national framework.

HE institutions are autonomous and so free to plan and deliver programmes as they wish.

Similarly, where the AIT determines an application to reconsider the original Tribunal decision, the rules provide that the reasons for the decision, which may be in summary form, must be served in written form upon the parties to the appeal.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the steps he is taking to tackle race hate crime in Northern Ireland.  [2183]</p>




<p><a name="50606w41.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 The Government along with the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland abhors hate crime in all its manifestations and is taking positive and practical steps to tackle this. In particular the Government are currently considering its response to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee&#039;s report entitled the &quot;Challenge of Diversity&#151;Hate Crime in Northern Ireland&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para0">
The Government have already introduced the Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 which directs the courts to take account during sentencing of any offence where there is evidence of hostility based on religion, race disability or sexual orientation. In addition the legislation increases the maximum sentences available for certain specified, mainly violent offences including where racial, religious or sexual aggravation is proven.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para1">
Work is concluding on the development of the Racial Equality strategy, which will provide a framework for practical and protective measures to tackle hate crime and the causes of hate crime. This will be a joined-up strategy involving every part of Government working together to address this most serious issue. One of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jun 2005 : Column 372W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
practical outcomes of this will be the provision of additional support for the victims of this type of crime and taking forward work to have better information about hate crime incidents so that resources can be targeted to address them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para2">
Finally, the police are investing considerable time and effort in addressing race crime. Recent initiatives include the introduction of an on-line reporting system on the PSNI website as part of the &quot;Hate Crime is Wrong campaign&quot;. The Police Service is determined to fully investigate all hate related incidents and where possible to secure sufficient evidence to prosecute offenders.

<p><a name="50606w41.html_wqn4"><b> Mrs. Dean: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what action is being taken to ensure that those who may qualify for attendance allowance are aware of the availability of the benefit.  [1350]</p>




<p><a name="50606w41.html_spnew4"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The Department goes to considerable lengths to publicise all benefits including attendance allowance. Information is available from all the Department&#039;s offices, from Citizen Advice Bureaux and other advice agencies and leaflets are available in Post Offices, and doctors&#039; surgeries. In addition information and advice about attendance allowance is provided by the Benefit Enquiry Line. For people with internet access information about all benefits and how they may be claimed is on the DWP website (www.dwp.gov.uk).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para5">
The Department also undertakes a considerable amount of local outreach work and is increasingly working with partners such as Local Authority Social Services and Welfare Rights organisations who are well placed to identify people who may be entitled to attendance allowance in a targeted and personal way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para6">
403,000 claims for attendance allowance were received in the year ending November 2004 and the number of people receiving attendance allowance has increased from 1.25 million in November 1999 to 1.4 million in November 2004, a rise of almost 13 per cent. Over this period expenditure has increased from &#163;2.7 billion in 1998&#150;99 to an anticipated &#163;3.6 billion in 2004&#150;05.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will seek to introduce amending legislation which will ensure that children who suffer from autism are entitled to the high rate of care and mobility components of disability living allowance from the date of diagnosis.  [1357]</p>




<p><a name="50606w41.html_spnew5"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 Children with autism spectrum disorders are entitled to disability living allowance on the same basis as anyone else with a severe disability. They will qualify if they meet the entitlement conditions for the benefit, which depend on the effects that severe physical or mental disability have on a person&#039;s need for personal care and/or their ability to walk and not on particular disabilities or diagnoses. There are no plans to amend the legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para7">
The numbers of children receiving disability living allowance as a result of the effects of autism spectrum disorders are not recorded separately, but are included in the more general category of those with &#039;learning difficulties&#039;. As at 30 November 2004, over 71,000 children whose main disabling condition is recorded as learning difficulties were receiving the benefit. Of these over 30,000 were in receipt of either the highest rate care component or the higher rate mobility component, or both.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his most recent estimate is of the amount of unclaimed carers&#039; benefit in a year; and what plans he has to improve the uptake of that benefit.  [1548]</p>




<p><a name="50606w41.html_spnew7"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 Entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance depends on whether the qualifying conditions are satisfied and this can be reliably established only after a claim has been made. There are no data available which would provide an estimate of the number of carers who would meet those conditions if they claimed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para8">
Information and advice about entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance are available from a range of outlets including social security offices, Jobcentre Plus offices, DWP and other helplines, DWP and other internet sites, local authorities, Citizens Advice and welfare benefit offices, public libraries, health clinics, doctors&#039; surgeries and health visitors. Officials from the Department&#039;s disability and carers service also discuss carer&#039;s allowance at outreach events up and down the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para9">
In addition, the extensive pension credit take-up campaign, recently mounted by the Pension Service, has helped many older carers to benefit from the Government&#039;s abolition of the upper age limit on claims to carer&#039;s allowance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50606w41.html_para10">
The carer&#039;s allowance claim pack is kept under review and improvements are introduced on an ongoing basis. Claims can be made in writing, by phone and on-line, and can be accepted by organisations such as Age Concern and Citizens Advice as well as DWP offices.

Enforcement in this area is, in the main, intelligence led. HMRC will assess any information that suggests a trafficking and brokering offence has been committed in the United Kingdom, or has been committed overseas by UK citizens. Depending on their assessment, Customs will either visit the trader using their regulatory powers to inspect records and to require information or will conduct a full investigation using their powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

Where it is necessary to gather evidence overseas, Customs will do so using applicable mutual assistance arrangements where they are in place.

 We understand that reprisal attacks were instigated by Sudanese refugees in several Chadian camps and towns during the week of 9&#150;16 May. Chadian authorities and national police had arrested refugee leaders refusing to co-operate with a UN-led registration exercise to verify refugee numbers and thereby reduce excess food distributions. Refugees retaliated by clashing with Chadian security forces; several refugees were injured though no mortalities were reported. UN officials and Chadian authorities share the view that the events were triggered by a small group of individuals eager to retain private and illegitimate benefits they enjoy through inflated numbers of beneficiaries.

We have received no reports of particular targeting of refugees from Darfur in other third countries. Sudanese migrants have long resided in Iraq and in other Gulf states.

 Asset management guidance for local authorities is non-statutory and sets out in broad terms features of good management of assets. It does not cover issues of probity and transparency as authorities have an obligation to ensure that financial transactions comply with the law.

Changes between years may not be valid due to changing local authority responsibilities. For example, the decrease for fire authorities between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 is due partly to the lower levels of grant per capita received by combined fire authorities compared with other fire authorities. Before 2004&#150;05 grants were not paid directly to combined fire authorities and so these were not included in the figures for earlier years.</p>

However, the Standards Board for England estimates that the current average cost to the board of an investigation into allegations of a breach of the code of conduct by members of relevant authorities is around &#163;5,000 per case.

<p><a name="50606w52.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Medical opinion differs on the most effective treatment for sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). In recognition of this, in 2004 the Department asked the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME. This work is expected to be published in 2007. The national health service is able to provide treatment for the range problematic symptoms often associated with this condition&#151;for example sleep disorders, pain, anxiety, depression and stomach disorders.
</p>


<p>

Local health professionals in primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for determining which health services their local populations require and ensuring the provision of these services. It is, therefore, the responsibility of individual PCTs to decide the level of funding they allocate to services for CFS/ME. However, in May 2003, the Department announced that additional funding of &#163;8.5 million would be made available for services specifically designed for people with CFS/ME. This money will help develop clinical services where none currently exist, including 12 new centres and 28 local support teams solely for CFS/ME sufferers.

In response to a recommendation from the Health Select Committee in its recent report, &quot;New Developments in Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Policy&quot;, the existing guidance was re-issued to trust overseas visitors managers on 16 May 2005.
