<a name="11102w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Grieve: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the average cost to the police of applying for an antisocial behaviour order.  [9480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Based on a survey of 21 cases conducted in April this year, the average cost of an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) was calculated to be &#163;4,800. This is the cost to either the police or the local authority and includes the staff costs associated with evidence gathering, preparing the case and attending court. It does not include dealing with appeals and breaches. Fuller details will be included in the review of ASBOs which we are aiming to publish by the end of the year.

<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) for what reason no statement was made at Home Office questions on 22 October in respect of the under-reporting of antisocial behaviour orders; and when he plans to make a statement;  [11794]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the reasons underlying the under-reporting of antisocial behaviour orders.  [11793]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> In response to a written question on 22 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 71W, I did in fact state that there had been some under-reporting of antisocial behaviour orders, and that we would be undertaking a one-off reconciliation exercise to establish its extent. I intend to announce its results in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on plans to change the status of plain-clothed police officers to uniformed officers; and if he will make a statement.  [5786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We want to enhance the visibility of the police in a common-sense way as part of our programme for police reform. This means that, on some occasions, officers will be in plain clothes and, on others, in uniform. The decision on how this should be applied rests with local management.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para0">Officers in uniform and in plain clothes are equally important and valued in their different roles: uniformed duties should not be regarded as of lesser status.

 The Sussex police are unable to provide information on either recruitment or retirement at divisional level since 1997. East Sussex is an integral part of the Sussex police. Information on recruitment and retirements is therefore for the force area as a whole for the four years to March 2001.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para1">The table sets out recruitment and retirement figures for the Sussex police. Information on retirement and recruitment for the first six months of 2001&#150;02 will be available in December.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the criminal law relating to common purpose with reference to the issues of <i>(a)</i> terrorism and <i>(b)</i> the activities of Islamic fundamentalist extremists; and if he will make a statement.  [10084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I have no such plans at present. I outlined the legislative steps necessary to counter the threat from terrorism in my statement to the House on 15 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 923. However, the Law Commission is conducting a major review of the whole area of inchoate offences and secondary liability, which will include this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will outline the type approval process for speed cameras and publish the operational guidance he has given to the police to avoid motorists being punished for errors caused by camera malfunction.  [11217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Any manufacturer wishing to seek type approval for a new speed camera device may approach either the Home Office or the Association of Chief Police Officers. The device in question will need to meet an operational need and either represent a technical advance or introduce greater competition into the market.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para2">The Association of Chief Police Officers' Road Policing Enforcement Technology Committee considers representations from manufacturers seeking type approval. Where the Committee is satisfied that basic requirements are met, field tests are carried out and the Home Office, working with independent laboratories, conducts rigorous technical tests to ensure that the device is robust and reliable and that it can produce accurate readings or images under a variety of extreme conditions. The Home office has published handbooks for manufacturers about the procedures for type approval, outlining the requirements and specifications.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para3">The Home Office provides a type approval order for any device which fully meets the specifications, and the device is approved for police use from the date of the order.

<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para4">Operational guidance to the police concerning all road enforcement issues, including malfunctioning devices, is provided by the Road Policing Enforcement Technology Committee, and I am placing a copy in the Library. The Committee is reviewing the current guidance and will publish new Codes of Practice for forces towards the end of this year. Advice to police forces is that they should abandon any prosecution where there is doubt about the reliability of the device involved in providing the evidence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tony Clarke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent assessment he has made of the impact of CCTV on the level of crime in Northampton.  [11279]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police operational experience and various research studies show that Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) has considerable crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para5">The Home Office has made no formal evaluation of the effectiveness of CCTV in Northampton. However, the Northampton Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership consider that CCTV has contributed to the 5.9 per cent. overall fall in recorded crime in Northampton last year.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para6">Northampton's existing CCTV system was recently expanded, with &#163;155,000 funding from the Crime Reduction Programme CCTV Initiative, to include Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology. According to figures provided by the Partnership, since the introduction of ANPR, vehicle-related crime in Northampton has decreased by 21.6 per cent. against the same period last year. The scheme has led to 346 arrests as well as the recovery of 31 stolen vehicles and property worth &#163;150,000.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para7">In the first six months of the introduction of CCTV at Sixfields Leisure Park car park, Northampton, last year, there was a 40 per cent. reduction in theft of cars and a 50 per cent. reduction in theft from cars.
<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para8">Further funding of &#163;148,000 to expand the Northampton CCTV system to cover three residential areas has recently been approved under Round 2 of the CCTV Initiative, to target burglary, vehicle crime, antisocial behaviour, drugs offences and youth crime.

<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance has been issued to police who stop people who are using a hand-held mobile phone when driving.  [11787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> There is no specific offence of using a hand-held mobile phone while driving, and accordingly no guidance has been issued. Existing legislation places the responsibility on drivers to have proper control of their vehicles at all times. Any motorist who fails to do so, for whatever reason, is liable to be prosecuted by the police. Drivers may be charged with failing to exercise proper control of a vehicle, careless and inconsiderate driving, or even dangerous driving, if using a mobile phone causes them to drive in such a manner.




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2001 : Column: 864W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11102w01.html_para9">In line with the commitment given in the Road Safety Strategy we are keeping under review the case for specific legislation. At present, however, we share the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers what existing legislation provides sufficient powers to prosecute successfully any driving offences that may arise from the use of mobile phones. Our focus is therefore on raising awareness of road safety risks.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason the goal to increase by 100,000 the number of recorded crimes for which an offender is brought to justice has not been met; if he has plans to revise this target; and if he will make a statement.  [11796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> As the White Paper "Criminal Justice: The Way Ahead" made clear, the criminal justice system-wide target to increase by 100,000 the number of recorded crimes ending in an offender being brought to justice has been set to be met by 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_wqn9"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to make changes to the definition of "brought to justice" for the purposes of departmental targets; and what factors will be taken into account in his decision.  [11795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> I have no plans at present to change the definition of "brought to justice" used in the attrition target.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are a number of offences for which a person serving with a foreign armed force could be prosecuted. Whether an offence has been committed and a prosecution is justified in an individual case, and, if so, what the appropriate charge is, are matters for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide after a full police investigation.
<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para0">There are a number of protections under international instruments for those serving with armed forces, whether foreign or United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I have regular discussions with members of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on a variety of policing issues. It is evident from those meetings that there is broad support within the Association for the police reform programme.




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2001 : Column: 865W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para1">The proposal that responsibility for charging suspects should be transferred from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was made by Sir Robin Auld in his Review of Criminal Courts, the report of which is now out to consultation. The views of the ACPO on this and other recommendations in the report are awaited.

<a name="11102w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Premier Christian Radio has now withdrawn its judicial review proceedings challenging the Radio Authority's decision that it is disqualified from holding a digital multiplex licence and/or a digital sound programme licence.

<a name="11102w02.html_para2">The Radio Authority advertised Premier's local analogue licence on 18 September with a closing date for applications on 8 January. All MPs with constituencies in Greater London (111 of them) have been written to inviting their comments. The date of the award will depend on whether or not the Authority receives any competition for the licence, but will probably be in March or April.
<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para3">Under the current legislation, the Radio Authority is prevented from awarding religious bodies a local digital sound programme licence.

<P>
<a name="11102w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2001]:</i> There are two major schemes for which my Department has made expenditure allocations during the period with reference to the Index of Multiple Deprivation.
<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para4">The Department allocated &#163;75 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund for Space for Sport and Arts. Expenditure will start this year and extend into 2003&#150;04. This scheme, sponsored with the Department for Education and Skills, seeks to provide in the areas of greatest need around 300 new sports and arts facilities in primary schools for use by both pupils and the wider community. This funding is being supplemented by Lottery funding of &#163;25 million from Sport England, &#163;25 million from the New Opportunities Fund and &#163;5 million from the Arts Council of England. The Department invited 65 local education authorities to participate in the scheme. These were selected using a number of indices of educational, socio-economic, sporting and cultural deprivation&#151;including the DTLR's indices of deprivation 2000; meeting the criteria for other programmes such as Education Action Zones, Excellence in Cities, Sports Action Zones and Health Action Zones; nomination by Regional Arts Boards; and being within the Arts Council of England's priority regions.
<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para5">The Department has also allocated &#163;40 million (&#163;15 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;25 million in 2003&#150;04) to the Arts Council of England for the establishment of 16 pilot Creative Partnerships in deprived areas to provide exciting and challenging opportunities for young people to experience, learn from and enjoy artistic and creative activities. The partnerships, which will be run by the Arts Council, will focus on bringing together schools, arts and other creative organisations and commercial creative industries to provide enhanced opportunities for every school child in the chosen areas of deprivation. DTLR's Index of Multiple Deprivation, was used in determining these areas. Other measures of economic and educational deprivation and an assessment of cultural deprivation were also taken into account. The Department also considered the capacity of the areas selected to deliver Creative Partnerships, the need for balanced geographical spread and the inclusion of rural and coastal areas as well as urban ones.
<P>

<a name="11102w02.html_para6">In addition, many programmes and initiatives run by Lottery distributors are targeted at deprived areas, using the Index of Multiple Deprivation and a variety of other indicators.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions she has had with Fakhdar Brahimi, Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for Afghanistan, regarding the involvement of women in the talks involving interested parties to a post-Taliban Government for Afghanistan.  [11301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w03.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I met Ambassador Brahimi on 9 October and reiterated our support for his efforts to develop a broad-based and representative Afghan Government. Ambassador Brahimi has demonstrated a commitment to addressing the human rights dimension of the governance of Afghanistan. The involvement of women in those discussions and the use of expertise on gender issues will help to ensure that the rights of the entire population of Afghanistan are protected and promoted, particularly recognising the complexity of gender issues in Afghanistan. We will continue to provide whatever assistance we can to Ambassador Brahimi and support the crucial role he plays in Afghanistan's future.

 The Government have been at the forefront of global initiatives to tackle the unsustainable debt burden facing some developing countries, and led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which was agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in September 1999. So far, 23 countries have qualified for this exceptional relief. More than $23 billion of debt relief has been agreed for those countries, which together owe $74 billion, so a major part of their debt has been written off.




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2001 : Column: 869W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11102w03.html_para1">In December 2000, the Government announced that the UK would go further than is required under the HIPC initiative and would provide 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief to countries when they qualify for HIPC relief. We will hold all debt payments received from HIPC countries in trust and, at that point, will return these payments to them. In addition, the UK has pledged over $300 million to the HIPC trust fund to meet the costs to the multilateral development banks of delivering HIPC debt relief. This includes our share of $85 million in EC contribution. We have also provided $43 million to assist the IMF with their share of such costs.
<P>

<a name="11102w03.html_para2">Most of our partner states in the European Union have also made bilateral contributions to the trust fund, on top of their share of the EC contribution. In addition, those member states that are major creditors deliver bilateral debt relief through the Paris Club of Official Bilateral Creditors to countries that have qualified for HIPC relief, with the majority providing 100 per cent. debt relief on their remaining bilateral debts.

<P>
<a name="11102w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government are very aware of concerns about the operation of the GB gas market in the light of rising gas prices. While we remain convinced that the primary reason behind the increase is arbitrage across the interconnector with high oil related gas prices in the European market, we are aware of the need to consider the impact of the operation of the other parts of the gas chain on the downstream market. Indeed, this forms an integral part of our strategy to address gas prices.
<P>

<a name="11102w03.html_para11">The Government have therefore today published a consultation document entitled "A Consultation On Concerns About Gas Prices And Possible Improvements To Market Efficiency", which considers the various concerns made about the gas market. The document also considers the wider benefits to the gas market of increased information flows between the onshore and the offshore. This builds on a joint workshop with the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association held on 10 September.
<P>

<a name="11102w03.html_para12">The intention behind the document is to stimulate debate and to see if the concerns stand up to scrutiny. If we find any evidence of actual anti-competitive behaviour we shall bring it to the attention of the appropriate competition authority.
<P>

<a name="11102w03.html_para13">Copies of the consultation document can be found on the Department of Trade and Industry's website at www.dti.gov.uk/energy

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> Both the Competition Commission, in its April 2000 monopoly report, and the European Commission, in its six-monthly surveys of prices, report prices in the UK to be significantly higher than in comparable countries in Europe.
<P>

<a name="11102w04.html_para0">The Competition Commission blamed the high prices of cars in the UK on practices associated with the selective and exclusive distribution system used by manufacturers, and allowed under the EC block exemption on vehicle distribution.

<a name="11102w04.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11102w04.html_para4">HSE licenses all explosives factories and stores holding more than 7,200 kg of fireworks. Stores holding less than 7,200 kg must either be licensed by the local authority or, depending on the quantity held, registered with it.
<P>

<a name="11102w04.html_para5">Where HSE is the licensing authority it considers a range of issues including the nature of the processes, the layout of the site and the construction of the buildings. In particular it will wish to ensure that adequate separation distances are maintained between explosives buildings and other buildings both on and off site. The draft licence is then submitted to the local authority for its assent. HSE will also make an inspection visit before operations start to ensure that the factory or store complies with the licence conditions.
<P>

<a name="11102w04.html_para6">Where the local authority is granting a licence it will normally check on the construction of the store and whether the distance between it and neighbouring inhabited buildings meets the minimum requirements. Registered premises are also subject to legal requirements. However due to the relatively small quantities involved local authorities would not normally undertake checks prior to registration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have no plans to merge the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO). Both organisations are recently formed and have clear and distinct responsibilities, as set out in the Strategic Defence Review. The role of the DPA is to procure new equipment capability for the armed forces and to deliver this in accordance with agreed 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2001 : Column: 875W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11102w04.html_para7">Although I am not considering a merger of the two organisations, the Ministry of Defence continues to explore improvements to the way the DPA and DLO work together on the equipment programme. We are also introducing simpler, common processes and systems to improve interoperability. This is being pursued through a joint steering group set up to manage work under a number of approaches, key among which are finance management, human resources management, through-life management, e-business, key supplier management and common tools for integrated project teams.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions the Government have undertaken with NATO member states about the integration of NATO missile defence research with US plans to deploy a missile defence system.  [10967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No such discussions have taken place. The NATO feasibility studies for theatre missile defence, which started in July 2001 and will take 18 months to complete, are looking at options for protecting NATO forces. They are different from plans for a limited missile defence for the United States.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The President of the United States has made clear that he wants the US's friends and allies to be protected against the potential ballistic missile threat. But no specific proposals have been made. We have a long-standing dialogue with the US on missile defence, and are ready to discuss any specific proposals they might make.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It remains premature to decide on acquiring a ballistic missile defence capability for the UK or our deployed forces. This is based on our current assessment of the threat, the rapidity with which defensive technologies are changing, and the need to address the threat through a range of measures. Our options for the future remain open.

<a name="11102w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Joint US/UK research projects in support of missile defence are undertaken under the auspices of the 1985 UK-US Strategic Defence Initiative Memorandum of Understanding. A list of the projects concerned was given in the answer I gave on 26 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 526W, to the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Mr. Taylor).

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2001]:</i> There are currently a number of BL/RB 755 type cluster munitions on board RFA Fort Victoria, which is in the Afghan theatre of conflict. These weapons are for use by the GR7 Harrier aircraft, which is not deployed with the task force. There are, therefore, currently no plans for their use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Our most recent estimate of the cost of Exercise Saif Sareea II is around &#163;90 million. We are confident that when all bills are finally presented, the actual cost will be within that estimate. With respect to Operations in Afghanistan, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 23 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 114W.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make it his policy not <i>(a)</i> to authorise and <i>(b)</i> to condone the use of cluster bombs in Afghanistan.  [12296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Cluster bombs are legitimate weapons that have not been prohibited by any Treaty or Convention. Those used in Afghanistan contain bomblets designed to detonate on impact and to destroy buildings and vehicles. They are not designed as anti-personnel weapons and do not contain any landmines. They are the most effective weapon against certain targets. The coalition will continue to use them, with discretion and proportionality, against legitimate and appropriate terrorist and military targets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what criteria are used to settle targets for bombing in Afghanistan; what definition of fixed military target is used; how many fixed military targets have been <i>(a)</i> identified and <i>(b)</i> attacked; how many such targets have been attacked more than once; and what assessment he has made of unintended damage to (i) property and (ii) people resulting from such attacks.  [12245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is not UK policy to comment in detail on targeting issues. Attacks are limited strictly to military objectives, including those objects which by their nature, 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2001 : Column: 877W</I><P>
location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation, in the circumstance ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Every effort is made to avoid incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects when selecting targets for attack.
<P>

<a name="11102w05.html_para0">As of 31 October, the total number of targets attacked is somewhat in excess of 100, of which around one half have been attacked more than once.
<P>

<a name="11102w05.html_para1">Following an attack on a target, Battle Damage Assessment is conducted to establish the success of that attack. Although we investigate all claims carefully, it is impossible to make a precise assessment of exactly how many civilians may have been killed or injured as a result of coalition action. Painstaking efforts are taken to minimise any unintended injury or damage but, regrettably, on occasion mistakes will happen and where we know this has happened, the coalition has said so publicly. However, we are clear that Taliban reports of civilian casualties are grossly exaggerated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what safeguards will be put in place to protect <i>(a)</i> UK and other military personnel and <i>(b)</i> civilians from hazardous residues from depleted uranium in the current conflict in Afghanistan.  [12184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Depleted uranium-based ammunition has not been used in current operations in Afghanistan. We are not aware of any plans for it to be used in future.
<P>

<a name="11102w05.html_para2">In the event that depleted uranium ammunition were to be used in Afghanistan and that UK service personnel might come into contact with it, appropriate guidelines would be issued to ensure that the already low risks to health were minimised.
<P>

<a name="11102w05.html_para3">A great deal of information on depleted uranium has already been put into the public domain. Should the need arise, we would discuss with coalition partners and civil agencies what information needs to be made available to the Afghan civilian population. Regrettably, the activities of the Taliban authorities in restricting the flow of information into Afghanistan could make this unnecessarily difficult for UN and other agencies to achieve.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Following the events of 11 September, the Government embarked on a wide ranging review of all their established contingency plans to counter terrorism and manage the circumstances in the UK and the threat to UK security. While elements of the US response to terrorism could be relevant to the UK, our domestic security posture reflects the geography of the UK and the threat of terrorism here which are different from those of the US.

<P>
<a name="11102w06.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence uses a wide range of disinfectants and repellents, many of which are subject to the requirements of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH). These regulations require that an assessment of the risks to health and of the actions that need to be taken when using such a substance are carried out before it is used. Among other things, the assessment must consider the circumstances of use&#151;for example whether it will be used in a hot or cold environment, in windy conditions, or in a confined space&#151;and the information, instruction and training that must be provided for the eventual user, MOD and HM forces have management systems in place to ensure that such COSHH assessments are undertaken, that their conclusions are implemented and that, among other things, clear information, instruction and training is provided for and to the user.

 HMS Ocean was handed over to the Royal Navy in March 1999 and her first refit is not planned to take place until 2008. However, in order to enable her to continue to operate until then, she will require a routine docking period. It had been planned to begin this work in January 2002 at Portsmouth, but due to current operational circumstances it has been decided to postpone the docking period. Instead, some essential maintenance work will be undertaken at her base port, Devonport, when she returns from the Gulf in late November. This will enable Ocean to be made available for operational programming early in 2002 rather than in late spring, which would have been the case had her docking period proceeded as planned.

 The estimated cost of awarding the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal to all those members of the armed forces, volunteer reserve forces and the royal fleet auxiliary who will have completed five years' qualifying service on 6 February 2002, is &#163;3.8 million. The funding that would be required to include all those who are serving on that date would be an additional &#163;1.8 million.
<P>

<a name="11102w06.html_para0">The potential cost of the medal was not a deciding factor in determining the qualifying criteria.

However, in respect of contracts placed in Scotland, I draw the hon. Member's attention to the publication, "UK Defence Statistics 2001", a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. Table 1.9 contains information on defence expenditure on equipment in UK regions, including Scotland.

 Information about Defence Agencies, including the location of their headquarters, the number of staff employed and their annual expenditure, have been given in Annexe K of the Ministry of Defence Departmental Performance Report 1999&#150;2000, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w06.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Currently, four defence agencies operate as Trading Funds. They are: the Meteorological Office, the UK Hydrographic Office, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, and the Defence Aviation Repair Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the vaccinations available to service personnel as protection against chemical and biological warfare have been <i>(a)</i> tested and <i>(b)</i> improved since the Gulf war; and if they are free from hazardous side effects.  [12182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w06.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The only immunisation used to protect UK service personnel against the possible use of biological warfare agents during the Gulf conflict, which is still in use, is an anthrax vaccine. No significant alterations to this vaccine as used by the Ministry of Defence have been made since the Gulf conflict. No serious side effects have been reported. No immunisations were or are used to protect against chemical warfare agents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if UK military personnel involved in the conflict in Afghanistan will be obliged to be vaccinated against exposure to chemical and biological warfare.  [12181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We take all measures necessary to ensure that service personnel are afforded appropriate protection against chemical and biological warfare agents commensurate with the perceived threat. The only licensed vaccine currently used to protect UK service personnel against exposure to biological warfare agents is an anthrax vaccine. The vaccine is offered to specific units of our armed forces on the basis of an assessment of the threat they face, which in turn depends on their deployment role. We continually review whether it is appropriate to offer anthrax vaccine to personnel who may be involved in new deployments, as part of their wider package of protective measures against chemical or biological attack. Vaccination of UK service personnel is not obligatory but voluntary, and is given on the basis of informed consent.
<P>

<a name="11102w06.html_para3">It is not possible to vaccinate against chemical warfare agents.

 The conventions and assumptions used to calculate <i>(a)</i> the direct tax burden are reliable and are set out in the Tax and Benefit Reference Manual. On <i>(b)</i>, as the Tax and Benefit Reference Manual has made clear, estimates on the indirect tax burden on typical households are not made because spending patterns vary considerably between households of the same type and income.

 The Government's policy on the euro remains as set out by the Chancellor in his statement to Parliament in October 1997 and restated by the Prime Minister in February 1999. The Government have said they will complete an assessment of the five tests within two years of the start of this Parliament. Once the assessment has been completed, the Government will make a decision on UK membership of the single currency. If the Government recommend UK entry, it will be put to a vote in Parliament and then to a referendum of the British people.

 The Government launched consultation on further proposals to encourage saving and asset-building, especially among households with low incomes, in "Saving and Assets for All" published by HM Treasury in April 2001. The consultation is focused on proposals for the child trust fund and the saving gateway. The Government intend to report back on the results from the consultation and on their further intentions for these initiatives around the time of the pre-Budget report in autumn 2001. The Government will continue to develop these proposals, including through consultation with interested parties such as financial services providers, to ensure that concerns, including the possibility of fraud, are properly addressed.

 In 1998, the then Economic Secretary to the Treasury commissioned the Registrar General to carry out a fundamental review of the Civil Registration service in England and Wales. This was in recognition of the fact that much of the Civil Registration system is outdated and does not meet the needs of today's society.
<P>

<a name="11102w08.html_para3">In September 1999, the Registrar General published a consultation paper, "Registration: Modernising a Vital Service". The consultation period ended on 6 December 1999. The responses have been used to set out options for the future development of the registration service, so that it can adapt to the changing needs and attitudes of a modern society.
<P>

<a name="11102w08.html_para4">Many of the responses to the consultation document were in support of equality of treatment for men and women in the records of births, deaths and marriages.

 As set out in Budget 2001, the Government are willing to consider what else they can contribute to extending opportunity for all in work, particularly to obtain a qualification up to level 2.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 November 2001]:</i> Monitoring quality of care is primarily a matter for primary care trusts (PCTs), although we recognise that commissioning care overseas raises particular issues. To aid them in this task the Department will publish guidance for PCTs on commissioning treatment for National Health Service patients overseas based on the experience of the three test-bed sites which are currently working up plans to send patients to mainland Europe. The Department will also develop through an open tendering process a list of approved providers/intemediaries whom PCTs may approach when considering sending patients overseas. Finally, officials are considering what role the Commission for Health Improvement might play in monitoring standards of foreign providers.
<P>

<a name="11102w10.html_para1">Primary care trusts will need to satisfy themselves through paper evidence, through clinicians visiting the relevant providers and through the contractual process that their patients will receive good clinical care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The recommendations of the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team (12) report on Young People centred around four themes; improving the way Government develop and implement policy and services for children and young people; a new focus on preventive services; improving individual services for children and young people; and designing policies around their needs, especially through involving children and young people in thinking about policies and services. Substantial progress has been made in all these areas.
<P>

<a name="11102w11.html_para5">To improve the way the Government develop policy the Prime Minister has established a new cabinet committee on children and young people's services, created the interdepartmental ministerial post of Minister for Young People and established the interdepartmental Children and Young People's Unit to be responsible for this work.
<P>

<a name="11102w11.html_para6">A new focus on preventive services and action to address the social exclusion of children and young people has been provided by the new Children's Fund. The Fund is worth &#163;450 million over 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04, of which &#163;380 million is devoted to the development of preventive services by partnerships throughout England and &#163;70 million is devoted to the Children's Fund Local Network making grants to voluntary organisations working on projects to tackle child poverty.
<P>

<a name="11102w11.html_para7">Improving individual services for children and young people was a key theme of the Spending Review 2000, in particular through the introduction of the Connexions service for 13&#150;19 year olds. The first Connexions Partnerships began to deliver services from April this year. &#163;420 million is being invested in Connexions in 2002&#150;03, rising to &#163;455 million in 2003&#150;04. To ensure that national health service provision is designed around children we have announced the establishment of a new NHS National Service Framework. Targeted programmes to support children and young people's individual education needs were set out in the White Paper, "Schools&#151;achieving success" (Cmd 5230). This progress will be further promoted through the cross-cutting review on children at risk announced by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in response to a written question from my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli, Pembrokeshire (Mrs. Lawrence) on 25 June 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 38W.
<P>

<a name="11102w11.html_para8">In "Tomorrow's Future: Building a Strategy for Children and Young People", published on 22 March, the Government set out their commitment to developing an overarching strategy for Children and Young People to ensure that we designed policies around the needs and priorities of young people, including the encouragement of new approaches in Government to ensure effective involvement and participation of children. In the near future, I will be publishing a consultation document on the Government's new strategy for Children and Young People.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the impact her proposal to extend the power of the learning and skills councils to put forward reorganisation proposals for 16 to 19 education provision will have on the role of local school organisation committees.  [11534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11102w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2001]:</i> The proposal will enable learning and skills councils (LSCs) to take the lead in developing and implementing strategic plans for local 16&#150;19 provision across the full range of 16&#150;19 providers. School Organisation Committees (SOCs) will have the right to comment on LSC proposals which affect their area. The range and type of proposals that a School Organisation Committee may itself consider in relation to school organisation will be unaffected. Nor does the proposal affect the range of decisions that a SOC may make, except where a proposal it is considering clashes with one which the LSC has submitted to the Secretary of State, in which case consideration by the SOC would be delayed until a decision is made on the LSC proposal.

<a name="11102w12.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The most recent assessment made by my Department was in the Student Income and Expenditure Survey 1998&#150;99, published in December 2000, which was the fourth survey since the series began in 1988&#150;89. This showed that average spending on essential items such as food and accommodation had not risen in real terms since 1995&#150;96 but average spending on clothes and discretionary items such as entertainment had gone up sharply. Student income from all sources had risen since 1995&#150;96 by 12 per cent. in real terms, with greater commercial borrowings, earnings from employment and withdrawal from savings. Since 1998&#150;99 the value of the student loan has continued to be increased annually in line with inflation.

 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2001]:</i> We have announced our plans up to 2003&#150;04. We will fund 1,087,000 students (full-time equivalent) in 2001&#150;02; 1,101,000 in 2003&#150;04; and subject to any changes flowing from the current Spending Review, 1,115,000 in 2003&#150;04.

 Northampton was invited to take part in the third wave of Sure Start, and local stakeholders were invited to choose the programme's catchment area. They decided to situate the programme in Spencer, Kings Heath and St. James, which are outside of the Northampton, South constituency. Northamptonshire has also been invited to develop a smaller scale Sure Start programme as part of the &#163;22 million wave of programmes announced in July 2001, aimed at rural areas and small pockets of deprivation. Local stakeholders also decided to locate this programme outside of the Northampton, South constituency.
<P>

<a name="11102w12.html_para0">The Government are committed to establishing 500 Sure Start programmes by March 2004. So far, 437 have been announced over five waves and a sixth wave will be announced next year. The next 63 programme areas are not yet decided, but the districts will be identified using similar criteria to those used previously, which is on the basis of level of need and deprivation.

<P>

<a name="11102w12.html_para3">This year, local education authorities in England have been allocated &#163;70,000 in school improvement grant for each secondary school in special measures and &#163;25,000 for each equivalent primary school.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2001]:</i> Department for Education and Skills expenditure is allocated according to a variety of methods.

<P>

<a name="11102w12.html_para5">The vast majority of programmes targeted at schools serving deprived areas make use of recent data regarding numbers of children in receipt of free school meals. This is because these data are up to date and are at school-level. Figures for these programmes, other programmes allocated using different measures, and any relevant programmes that finished before the current financial year, have not been included in the table, because this information could have been obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<sup>(17)</sup> The Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilot areas were selected using a number of indicators, one of which was the Index of Local Deprivation (1998). EMA pilots began in 15 areas in September 1999 and were expanded to a further 41 areas in September 2000.<P>

<P>

<sup>(18)</sup> Funding allocated at the Spending Review 2000. Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative funding has been allocated using the 20 per cent. extent measure from the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2000). It identifies the number of wards within each LEA that fall within the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged in the country. Local education authorities received an allocation of funding according to the number of wards within their area that fall within the 20 per cent., weighted with the population of 0 to four-year-olds.<P>

<P>

<sup>(19)</sup> From 1998&#150;99, Further Education institutions could claim additional funding for students resident in deprived areas. This funding was extended in 1999&#150;2000 to include other types of students.<P>

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment on 30 October 2001 <i>Official Report</i>, column 592W. Within DTLR we continue to take energy efficiency seriously through implementing our greening operations policy and monitoring and reporting progress against cross-government targets. We raise awareness of energy efficiency, and other greening operations issues, through regular advice and information for our staff. A recent example is the foyer displays of environmental performance at our headquarter buildings in London.

 The Government of Zimbabwe are responsible for land seizures in that country. They remain responsible for meeting their legal obligations in implementing land reform. In Abuja, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reaffirmed our willingness to make a significant contribution to a fair, effective and sustainable land reform programme on the basis of the UNDP proposals of December 2000. He made it clear that our support for land reform depended on action by the Government of Zimbabwe to implement the commitments it made in Abuja. We have so far seen little evidence of such implementation. We understand that UNDP have an assessment mission in Zimbabwe at the moment looking at the prospects for a credible land reform programme. We welcome this. But in the circumstances, it is too soon to speculate on a possible UK financial contribution and the possible arrangements for payment.

Again, with the change to a democratic government in the FRY and on-going improvements in the security structures there, we have no reason to continue doing so. This will bring our export control policy on the FRY in line with that on most other countries. All future applications for dual use goods to the FRY will be judged on a case-by-case basis, on their merits, against the consolidated EU and national export licensing criteria.

I understand that managed retreat was the preferred strategic option for the shingle ridge at Porlock. For the lengths between Stolford and Fanning Island, and along the west bank of the River Parrett to Combwich, an observe and monitor strategy was proposed, while consideration is given to managed retreat on undeveloped frontages to promote saltmarsh growth for nature conservation and coastal defence purposes.

It will then be for the local authorities to consider how the levy should be funded taking account of the provision made available to them through revenue support grant.
<P>

<a name="11102w15.html_para10">The Yorkshire Regional Flood Defence Committee will also take account of my recent announcement that we will increase DEFRA grant to support capital works undertaken in their area in 2002&#150;03. The figures stands to rise from some &#163;8 million this year to nearly &#163;13 million for 2002&#150;03 and reflects in large measure the need for new capital works in areas affected by the autumn 2000 floods as well as the Humber Estuary.
<P>

<a name="11102w15.html_para11">It is also the case that Yorkshire has been a major beneficiary of DEFRA's special funding of emergency costs and repairs from last year's severe flooding and of design and feasibility costs for accelerated river defences and associated strategies, receiving some &#163;8.5 million.

<P>
<a name="11102w15.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11102w15.html_para12">My Department contributed to the research carried out for the Construction Industry Research and Information Association that produced design manuals for England and Wales and for Scotland and Northern Ireland (both published in 2000) and a best practice manual on sustainable urban drainage systems (published in 2001). These were based on demonstration projects that clearly showed both the benefits in flood defence, water quality and local amenity.
<P>

<a name="11102w15.html_para13">No formal assessment of the benefits has been made on a national scale since these depend on the local intensity of rainfall for which individual sustainable drainage systems are designed. Such systems can assist in reducing the impact of intense rainfall and they can be as economical as conventional drainage systems. The use of sustainable urban drainage systems is generally encouraged in the new Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 issued in July 2001 but decisions by developers to install them must be based on site-specific assessments of the loads they would need to deal with.

 Local authorities have to apply to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who determines byelaws on the grounds of whether they are reasonable, both to members of the public and to dog owners. A byelaw is a local law, which is made by a statutory body, such as a local authority, under an enabling power established by Act of Parliament. Byelaws create criminal offences and cannot come into effect unless they have been confirmed by a Secretary of State. There are no plans to change this policy.

<P>
<a name="11102w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The recently adopted Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/EC sets minimum standards for a variety of plants that burn waste, including municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs). The UK Government are committed to transposing the EU Waste Incineration Directive, into UK law by 28 December 2002. Its provisions will apply to all new incinerators by this date, and to existing plant by 28 December 2005. This directive tightens dioxin limits to 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  (0.1 billionth of a gram). This standard will be the maximum amount of dioxin permitted to be emitted from MSWIs.
<P>

<a name="11102w17.html_para0">There is no dioxin limit in the Municipal Waste Incineration Directives (89/429/EEC and 89/369/EEC). In 1996 the Environment Agency chose to implement a 1.0 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  emission limit as achievable using the best available technique not entailing excessive cost (BATNEEC). In 2000 the Agency took a similar decision on BATNEEC and MSWIs were required to either (i) reduce dioxin limits to 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  (that is 10 times lower than the earlier limit); or (ii) on plant which could immediately achieve that level, to report on how they would achieve it. As a result, we estimate that dioxin emissions from incinerators in the UK have fallen several hundred-fold.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department has taken to establish a scheme for the valuation of sheep flocks and the payment of compensation for livestock to be destroyed under her proposed special measures for the elimination of scrapie from the national flock.

 The Animal Health Bill was published on 31 October and includes an enabling power allowing Ministers to pay compensation for losses or costs incurred as a result of the provisions relating to scrapie in the Bill. If the scrapie provisions were activated, a decision would need to be taken at the time on whether compensation was appropriate. If a decision to pay compensation were taken, the details would be set out in supplementary regulations.
