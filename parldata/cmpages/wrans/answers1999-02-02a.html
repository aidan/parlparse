To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the location of the University of London and Cambridge University Air Squadrons.  [69144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The basing of Cambridge University Air Squadron and the collocated No. 5 Air Cadet Air Experience Flight, at Cambridge Airport, has been the subject of review to determine whether their operations could be undertaken more effectively at another location. At the same time it has been necessary to identify a new location for the University of London Air Squadron and part of the No. 6 Air Cadet Air Experience Flight task, due to increased helicopter operations at RAF Benson, their current location.
<P>

<a name="90202w01.html_para0">RAF Wyton has been identified as the most cost-effective and operationally suitable location for the two Squadrons and the Air Experience Flights. On current plans the transfer of these units will commence in September 1999.

 Infra-red technology has a wide spectrum of defence applications, and information on the totality of expenditure specifically involving this technology is not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the aggregate total of British service personnel, including members of the Ulster Defence Regiment and RIR, who have served at least one tour of duty or have been employed for six months or more in Northern Ireland since August 1969; and how many service personnel have <i>(a)</i> lost their lives and <i>(b)</i> been injured in connection with their military duties and responsibilities in Northern Ireland.  [67427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Since August 1969, the total number of soldiers who have served or are currently serving in Northern Ireland for six months or more is 152,769. The total number of officers who have served or are currently serving in Northern Ireland is 25,098. The latter figure contains tour lengths of three to four months as well as those of six months or more.

<a name="90202w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the number of civilian casualties in Iraq caused by military action since the conclusion of Operation Desert Fox.  [68352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 We believe that the only military action since the conclusion of Operation Desert Fox which could have caused civilian casualties was an incident on 25 January. Coalition aircraft patrolling the Iraqi Southern No-Fly-Zone in accordance with their humanitarian mission encountered four Iraqi MIGs who were attempting to draw them into a pre-arranged Surface to Air Missile (SAM) trap and were fired at by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery. US aircraft responded by attacking a SAM site and related air defence and communications systems north of Basra. The US has confirmed that a rocket propelled bomb went astray and landed in a residential district several kilometres from its target. It could have caused civilian casualties, but the US is still investigating and cannot confirm. I deeply regret any civilian casualties but must stress that the US acted in self-defence responding to a serious and immediate threat to the safety of coalition aircraft.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library the documentation held by his Department on the crash of the Aer Lingus Viscount in the Irish sea on 24 March 1968, and the subsequent search and rescue operation; and if he will make this material available to the Irish Government.

<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Copies of the UK report on the initial surface search and rescue operation for the Aer Lingus Viscount 712, and on the subsequent sea bed search and salvage operation undertaken at the request of the Irish Government, were placed in the Library of the House and given to the Irish Government in September 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the naval vessels engaged in search operations for the wreckage of the Aer Lingus Viscount in the Irish sea from 24 March 1968 until the search was abandoned and in each case the dates on which searches took place; how many bodies were <i>(a)</i> recovered and <i>(b)</i> identified; where the wreckage was taken to be examined; and where the wreckage is currently stored.  [67437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Details of British naval involvement in the search operation for the Aer Lingus wreckage are contained in the report which my department placed in the Library of the House in September last year. Although the report contains information on the recovery of bodies and wreckage, which were taken to Rosslare for examination by the Irish Authorities, it does not provide the identities of the dead. This, and the current condition and location of the wreckage, is a matter for the Irish Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We have no record of such a briefing having taken place. HMS Penelope played no part in the search operation after 25 March.

To ask the Chairman of the Information Committee how many hon. Members currently have access to <i>(a)</i> the PDVN and <i>(b)</i> the Parliamentary Intranet.  [68434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 There are currently 227 Members registered to access the PDVN in their own name. However, many Members have connected their offices by requesting access for one or more staff members but not for themselves. Analysis of all login IDs issued in the names of Members shows that 517 Members' offices currently have access to the PDVN.

<a name="90202w01.html_para7">Access to the Parliamentary Intranet is through the PDVN and is unrestricted, so the numbers are the same. All PDVN users have access to the Intranet.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 When the production of the existing telephone directory is changed to a print out from the Serjeant at Arms/Telecomms database at the end of this year's summer adjournment, there will be an opportunity to include details of Members' web sites and e-mail addresses in the directory provided Members indicate their wish for it to be done.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the future recognition requirements for recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses under the Financial Services and Markets Bill.  [69148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The new Financial Services and Markets Bill carries forward the main features of the existing recognition and exemption regime for investment exchanges and clearing houses, which has worked well. In order to become recognised, such bodies must fulfil certain regulatory criteria. These are currently contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Companies Act 1989. Under the new Bill the requirements will be set out in secondary legislation. Putting the recognition requirements in secondary legislation will make it easier to respond to any market developments in this area.
<P>

<a name="90202w01.html_para8">The Treasury has today issued a consultation document on the new draft recognition requirements. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The deadline for comments is 30 April. We are consulting on these regulations well in advance so that we have the longest possible time to get them right.

 Under the terms of the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 no one person may hold more than one national analogue licence, national digital multiplex licence or national digital sound programme service licence. A person may hold one FM and one AM licence for areas which share a potential audience overlap of over 50 per cent. and may apply to hold one further licence for the same area on either waveband subject to a public interest test operated by the Radio Authority.

 The Radio Authority is responsible for determining the process of the award of independent radio licences according to the provisions of the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. The Authority decides the questions asked of licence applicants. I understand that the Authority's standard application form requests details of the background of licence applicants, and details of others whose involvement in the preparation of a licence application has been substantial. The Radio Authority published on 29 January details of its licensing award procedures for commercial radio.

<a name="90202w02.html_para2">The Radio Authority is a statutory public corporation independent of Government and is responsible for interpreting its statutory duties under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996.

My Department has no supervisory role in its day-to-day activities and has no locus to direct the Authority to make public details of its proceedings.

"Any incident in which it appears to the reporting or investigating officer that the complaint involves an element of racial motivation; or any incident which includes an allegation of racial motivation made by any person".
Incidents included here are wider than the normal definition of a crime in the crime statistics and include low level harassment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Section 103 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was commenced on 1 January 1999. As a result, all short-term prisoners whose original offences were committed on or after that date and who are subsequently released on licence will be subject to recall by the Parole Board in the same way as those released from long-term sentences.
<P>

<a name="90202w02.html_para5">I have, therefore, prepared new Directions for the Board as to the matter to be taken into account in dealing with such recalls. These Directions are being made under the powers given to me by section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and are based very closely on the existing Directions in respect of long-term prisoners.
<P>

<a name="90202w02.html_para6">The new Directions also make it clear that there should be a clear presumption in favour of recall in cases where a licensee is charged with an offence committed whilst subject to Home Detention Curfew (HDC). This is because the commission of an offence by a prisoner subject to HDC is clearly a breach of the trust placed in that individual.

The Board is currently considering its data collection requirements in carrying out this function. These are likely to include information about the characteristics of young offenders and the effectiveness of intervention work with them in preventing reoffending. This information will be collected from youth offending teams, established under section 39 of the 1998 Act, which the Government expect to implement nationally in April 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the elements of the Government's strategy for preventing youth crime which have been specifically targeted at ethnic minorities.  [68092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government set out their strategy for preventing youth crime in the White Paper "No More Excuses--a New Approach To Tackling Youth Crime in England and Wales". The clear aim of that strategy is to prevent offending and re-offending by juveniles. This is 



<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1999 : Column: 551</I><P>
now the statutory principal aim of the youth justice system, as set out in section 37 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="90202w04.html_para4">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provides a range of new measures designed to be effective in preventing youth crime, irrespective of the ethnic background of those who seek to break the law. The Government are currently piloting new measures in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, including the final warning scheme, new community-based court disposals, and youth offending teams, with national implementation planned for around April 2000. To date, the Government have also introduced a range of measures to speed up the youth justice system, and have established the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales which will provide advice on the operation and performance of the youth justice system.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many assaults have been committed in each of the past five years by <i>(a)</i> white individuals against black individuals and vice versa, <i>(b)</i> white individuals against Asian individuals and vice versa and <i>(c)</i> Asian individuals against black individuals and vice versa;  [68094]
<P>
<UL>(2) what categories of recorded crime were most frequently committed by each of the following ethnic groups <i>(a)</i> white, <i>(b)</i> black, <i>(c)</i> Asian and <i>(d)</i> others, in each of the last five years;  [68065]
<P>
(3) how many street robberies were carried out <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> by each ethnic group in each of the last five years;  [68063]
<P>
(4) for each of the past five years, how many and what proportion of crimes were committed by offenders who were <i>(a)</i> white, <i>(b)</i> black, <i>(c)</i> Asian and <i>(d)</i> other.  [68096]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Data on ethnicity are currently collected by the police, prison and probation services, but not as yet by the courts. The only data on crimes committed by ethnic group would come from court convictions. It follows, therefore, that there are at present no national data on the ethnicity of offenders as a whole.
<P>

<a name="90202w04.html_para5">The Home Office regularly summarises the available information on ethnicity and the criminal justice system in statistical reports published under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The latest of these was published on 8 December 1998 and is available in the Library and on the Internet at: http:www.home office.gov.uk/rds/index.htm
<P>

<a name="90202w04.html_para6">It is likely that a number of the crime and disorder audits carried out by local authorities under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 may in appropriate cases include local data of the kind which the hon. Member seeks. One such is that recently published by the London Borough of Lambeth and the relevant Divisions to the Metropolitan Police Service. I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Library.

"Any incident in which it appears to the reporting or investigating officer that the complaint involves an element of racial motivation; or any incident which includes an allegation of racial motivation made by any person".
Incidents included here are wider than the normal definition of a crime in the crime statistics and include general threatening behaviour. These statistics are regularly published under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.

These findings will first be published under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 in January 2000.
<P>

<a name="90202w04.html_para8">Given the widespread concern about racially motivated crimes, and the recent approval of Parliament for specific racially aggravated offences in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 it is essential that such data should be collected. The benefits are clear.

 Fire and police services provide quarterly reports to Cabinet Office about progress towards Year 2000 compliance. These reports are published in summary in the Library and in detail on the Internet. The NHS Executive also publishes details of ambulance service quarterly progress reports on the Internet.
<P>

<a name="90202w04.html_para9">My Department monitors the progress reports from fire and police services. It is working with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Fire Services, and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Association of Chief Police Officers respectively to encourage fire brigades and police forces to take the necessary action.

<P>
<UL>(2) if the companies that were granted export licences by the Department of Trade and Industry for the export of electro-shock batons from the United Kingdom between 1989 and 1994 had been granted the relevant licence under section 5 of the Firearms Act to <i>(a)</i> handle, <i>(b)</i> store, <i>(c)</i> distribute and <i>(d)</i> manufacture such weapons;  [68191]

(3) what actions his Department has taken against <i>(a)</i> companies and <i>(b)</i> individuals that were not in possession of the relevant firearms licences for the handling, storage, distribution or manufacture of electro-shock batons.  [68240]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Two of the four companies in question had authority to deal in weapons prohibited by section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968, which would include electro-shock weapons as well as other types of weapons capable of discharging a noxious liquid, gas or other things. The other two companies, one of which was the company granted the trans-shipment licence, did not have such authority.
<P>

<a name="90202w05.html_para0">The investigation of possible offences under the Firearms Acts is a matter for the police, who will consider whether there are grounds to bring criminal charges. The decision as to whether or not to prosecute in an individual case rests with the Crown Prosecution Service. The Home Office have no powers to intervene. However, information about the two companies that did not have authority to deal in prohibited weapons was forwarded by the Home Office to the relevant police forces for their consideration. I understand that, in both cases, the police have decided to take no further action.

 There is no express statutory provision enabling police authorities to provide financial assistance to officers involved in criminal proceedings. The circular makes it clear that it is entirely for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances of a case and, on the basis of legal advice, whether to make financial assistance available to officers, either former or serving, in criminal proceedings. It does not seek to offer guidance on the specific circumstances of a case.

In considering the changes in IT needed in preparation for the arrival of the National Assembly for Wales, I have asked my officials to make provisions for making documents and information accessible to people for whom the standard printed form is not appropriate. This will include floppy disk versions which are in a format which facilitates access for the visually impaired. Guidance on how to reach the largest possible target audience when producing documents for use by people outside the Department, including White and Green Papers, has been issued to staff at the Welsh Office. The Guidance will also be incorporated into a revised Equal Opportunities Handbook.

 The bus subsidy grant scheme will make &#163;5 million available to local authorities in 1999-2000, of which &#163;3 million must be spent on rural bus services and the remaining &#163;2 million may be spent on either rural or urban services. In 1998-99 &#163;2.25 million was made available exclusively for rural services. This means that direct support for rural bus services in 1999-2000 will increase by at least 30 per cent. in real terms, and probably significantly more than that.

<a name="90202w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Office for the Supervision of Solicitors is an independent body, and the Government do not have a role in monitoring the work of the Office. However, the Legal Services Ombudsman oversees the handling of complaints against members of the legal profession. She stated in her last annual report that, although the Office 



<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1999 : Column: 560</I><P>
had made some improvements since it started operating in September 1996, there was still a long way to go. When the Ombudsman publishes her next annual report this summer, I will consider whether any further action is necessary.

 Closed case data for 1997-98 are incomplete and will not include five months' data for Nottingham and six weeks for Chester. This is due to the implementation in these two area offices of the Legal Aid Board's new Corporate Information System, which is temporarily unable to access closed case information. A breakdown of the available legal aid expenditure and receipts in respect of personal injury litigation and medical negligence cases for cases closed in 1997-98 was as follows:

2. Retirement Pension estimates have been provided by the Government Actuary's Department.<P>

3. Increased rates are assumed payable to pensioners aged 75 and over at each of the given dates. Category BL rates were increased where the recipient is 75 or over, including cases where the spouse whose contribution record provides entitlement is under 75. Adult Dependency Increases paid in respect of women aged under 75 were not increased.<P>

<a name="90202w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) gathered up to date information about the care and mobility needs of disabled people with the highest awards of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), to check that they were receiving the right amount of DLA. The Benefit Integrity Project will end on 31 March 1999, to be replaced by a new and fairer system. No new cases will be selected for the project after this date. Cases where action has already started will continue to be processed through the remaining stages of adjudication, including review and appeal, in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="90202w08.html_para2">We are determined to ensure that people are receiving the correct amount of benefit. But there is currently no automatic review mechanism within DLA. Therefore, from April a new system of periodic review will be introduced. It will incorporate the lessons already learned and will be continually evaluated and refined as it develops. Staff involved in the new processes will receive full training before commencing this new work.

<a name="90202w08.html_para3">We are already talking to disability groups about ways to ensure the new system is sensitive to people's circumstances, and that it is both fair and effective.

 Stringent controls and severe penalties are in place to discourage the illegal disposal of waste (fly-tipping) and the Environment Agency has made clear its commitment to taking firm enforcement action. The main controls and the maximum penalties were set out in my reply to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), on 8 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>120-21</i>.

 The Department does not offer financial assistance to help bring Housing Act sewage works up to the required standard to enable them to be adopted by the sewerage undertaker. There are provisions in the Water Industry Act 1991 which enable these works to be adopted but the financial implications are a matter for the sewerage undertaker and local authority.

<a name="90202w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My officials are reviewing the way the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970 works. Any changes to its administration have to be considered in the context of the Local Government Bill, now before Parliament, which would allow the Secretary of State to modify existing legislation so as to facilitate local authorities achieving best value. It would be premature to discuss how this power might be exercised in advance of Parliament discussing the relevant provisions of the Bill.

Parliamentary approval for expenditure on these remaining bodies will be sought as soon as practicable following enactment. This is likely to be through a Winter Supplementary Estimate for Class III Vote 4 (local government, England) for 1999-2000. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure in 1998-99 estimated at &#163;320,000 will be met by repayable advances from the Contingencies Fund.

 In 1996, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) evaluated an epidemiological study by the small area health statistics unit. This study, undertaken on behalf of this and five other Government Departments, investigated the incidence of leukaemia near 20 high power Television/FM transmitters in Great Britain. The study found that living close to a transmitter was not associated with an increased risk of leukaemia.

(18) Energy consumed for domestic heating and hot water during a year of average weather (based on weather over last 20 years). It is assumed in the model that all of the house is heated so that the living area reaches a temperature of 21o C, with the following heating pattern: weekdays 2 hours in the morning, 7 hours in the evening. Weekends 16 hours.<P>

<P>

(19) Based on average fuel prices (including VAT) over the 3 years 1996-1998. Connection to mains electricity for other uses, such as appliances, has been assumed and the standing charge associated with this supply has therefore been excluded from the estimated costs. The figures reflect the overall efficiency of typical heating systems for each fuel (eg a standard gas or oil boiler with room thermostat or individual electric heaters with their own thermostats). More efficient systems are available for oil and gas, but not widely installed and they would obviously reduce energy consumption and the corresponding costs further.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 1999]:</i> The current customs tariffs on imports of catering tableware into the UK from the United States of America are 12 per cent. for articles of porcelain or china, and 5 per cent., 5.5 per cent. or 9 per cent. for articles other than porcelain or china. The US tariffs for similar products are 30 per cent. and 31.5 per cent. respectively. The UK is committed to further multilateral liberalisation of trade including significant reductions in US peak tariffs on catering tableware. The issue will be addressed as part of a comprehensive, cross-sectoral multilateral World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiation on industrial tariffs. To date WTO member countries have still to commit themselves to such a negotiation. However, I am hopeful that the WTO Ministerial Conference in the USA next November will be able to agree on the need to make preparations for further multilateral negotiations on liberalising industrial tariffs. I do not, therefore, propose to make a statement.

 In September last year, I announced the fifth and largest Order to date under the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO-5). Under that Order, the electricity supply companies in England and Wales contracted collectively with 261 projects with a combined capacity of 1,177 Mega Watts (MW).
<P>

<a name="90202w13.html_para13">I have also reversed the planned cuts in the renewable programme budget, so that the budget for this year (1998-99) has been maintained at &#163;11 million. The programme supports both Research and Development (R&D) and market enablement projects. Of the latter, among the projects supported this year was the Renewable Generators Consortium (RGC), which brought together the majority of generators with contracts under NFFO-1 and NFFO-2--contracts which subsequently ended on 31 December 1998--in order to negotiate new, post- NFFO contracts collectively with the electricity supply companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w14.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 There is already substantial harmonisation of procedures for acquiring patent rights in Europe. Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), an intergovernmental agreement to which 19 European States belong (including the United Kingdom), applications can be filed with the European Patent Office. This offers a single procedure for obtaining patent rights. Applicants designate those States in which protection is required, and rights become valid in those States upon filing of a translation into their official languages.
<P>

<a name="90202w14.html_para0">Once validated in each designated State the system provides a bundle of national patents which have to be separately maintained and enforced under respective national laws.
<P>

<a name="90202w14.html_para1">Following consultation on its Green Paper on patents in Europe, the European Commission is expected to make a proposal for a Council Regulations for a Community patent providing a unitary right across the Member States. Costs of translation into official languages of all Member States and absence of harmonisation in post grant litigation could reduce the effectiveness of such a system. As stated in the Competitiveness White Paper, the Government will push for a Community patent which is affordable and easy to enforce.

<a name="90202w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We have granted a licence for the export to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of two armoured vehicles based on the Land Rover Defender 110 for use by UNHCR personnel. Given the key humanitarian role played by the UNHCR in the FRY, and the obvious need for the UNHCR to be able to protect staff serving with its office in Belgrade, including against land mines, we were glad to be able to approve this licence. The UN Sanctions Committee appointed under UNSCR 1160 has raised no objection to it.

<a name="90202w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The position of the Cornish language in relation to the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages has yet to be decided. It is a matter of domestic rather than foreign policy.

 According to the Eurobarometer survey, in November 1995 approximately 16-17 per cent. of EU citizens regarded English as their mother tongue. The same survey also shows that one EU citizen in three (of those who do not class English as their mother tongue) regarded themselves as able to hold a conversation in English. EUROSTAT's 1997 figures on foreign language teaching in the EU show that 26 per cent. of pupils in primary education and 90 per cent. of pupils in secondary school were taught English.

 There is no system for formally recognising languages within the EU, beyond the 12 languages used for official business. A report prepared for the European Commission identified over 30 minority languages spoken within the EU. These are:

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1999]:</i> The Ministry does not keep lists of farmers' markets held in the UK and has not received representations on the establishment of a regional farm produce market for the North West. I have no plans to fund the establishment of farmers markets but am keen to encourage them. The Ministry will be holding a seminar in March to promote the concept of farmers' markets.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the risks genetically modified animal feeds pose to humans.  [68774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes rigorously assesses all genetically modified feed material from the point of view of the impact that such feed may have on human health.

<a name="90202w19.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list his Department's responsibilities and policies in relation to genetically modified crops and the departments with which he liaises on this issue; and where the lead departmental responsibility rests for each issue.  [67663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90202w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 My Department's policy is that public health and environmental safety are the fundamental priorities on genetically modified (GM) crops. We believe that the UK agriculture industry should not be denied access to the benefits of GM technology, but that all justified concerns about it must be addressed.
<P>

<a name="90202w19.html_para3">MAFF shares responsibility with the Department of Health for the safety of GM foods. It also shares responsibility with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (who take the lead) on the approval of the release of GM crops into the environment. MAFF takes the lead in a number of areas relevant to GM crops; the agricultural implications of the introduction of GM crops into UK agriculture; plant breeders rights and National Listing and seed certification for all varieties of the main agricultural and vegetable species; and the approval of pesticides, including those to be used on GM herbicide tolerant crops, and GM micro- organisms to be used for plant protection purposes.
<P>

<a name="90202w19.html_para4">Government policy on biotechnology, including GM crops, is co-ordinated by the Ministerial Group on Biotechnology, which is chaired by the Minister for the Cabinet Office, as announced by the Prime Minister on 21 October 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>1134</i>. In addition, officials across Government are in regular contact on biotechnology issues.

<a name="90202w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have not yet discussed with other Member States the ideas of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and the Scottish Fishermen's Federation concerning zonal committees. However, the NFFO and SFF have themselves been discussing their ideas with their counterparts in other Member States and I shall be interested to see the outcome of these contacts.
