 The merits and impacts of individual proposals, including motorway widening, are assessed as part of the appraisal and decision taking process. The appraisal covers the expected impact on road safety, journey time and reliability, regeneration, accessibility, integration and the environment. Among the environmental impacts measured in the appraisal are the effects on the scheme on noise, local air quality, greenhouse gases, biodiversity, heritage, landscape and townscape. Full details are provided in the Department's Guidance on the Methodology for Multi-Modal Studies, available on the Department's website.

 The Environment Agency confirm that there are improved procedures in place at the Pitsea landfill site to monitor and respond to odours produced by the site. Odour checks are carried out by the site operator twice daily, with off site checks carried out weekly. More comprehensive surveys are undertaken bi-monthly. The site's odour action plan has been revised in the light of recent events to provide a better response to any odours identified.

 The Veterinary Laboratories Agency published a risk assessment report on 25 March 2003. This estimated the amount of illegal meat of any type imported annually, on average, to be 7,500 tonnes, with 90 per cent. certainty that the amount of illegal meat imported will range from 2,800 tonnes to 17,500 tonnes per year. Table 6&#150;6 indicates that bushmeat contributes on average 6 per cent. of the estimated total flow of illegal meat. Table 6&#150;1, which shows the contribution by world region to the total estimate of illegal flow of meat into GB, indicates that about 23 per cent. of the total comes from African countries. Most&#151;but not all&#151;bushmeat comes from African countries.

 We agree that, at the outset, dairy compensation payments should be directed to dairy farmers rather than to those who have already left the sector.

This is all subject to the continuing negotiations on the CAP reform package.

 In 2001&#150;02 public expenditure under the CAP and on national grants and subsidies was &#163;4,664 million. The amount is broken down in table 9.1 of the Defra publication "Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2002", which is available in the Library of the House. This indicates the amounts falling either to the EU or the UK budget. Payments for market support and certain payments for rural development will not all have been received directly by the farming industry.

<a name="30625w03.html_para0">In addition, UK farmers benefited from the effect of the market regimes and import tariffs, which kept the price of many commodities in the EU higher than elsewhere. The cost of this will have fallen to consumers. In 2000, the latest year for which UK figures are available, we estimate that the CAP cost UK consumers around &#163;3.5 billion through higher prices.

 There is no current list of antibiotic resistance markers that cannot be used in the genetic modification of plant crops. Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC refers to the phasing out of genes expressing resistance to antibiotics which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment or are of use in medical or veterinary treatment. This phasing out must take place by 31 December 2004 in the case of GM crop plants for marketing and by 31 December 2008 in the case of the release of GM crop plants for research and development purposes. In accordance with this requirement the Commission has established an expert working group to address the use of antibiotic resistance marker (ARMs) genes that GMOs may contain and will aim to produce a list of ARMs which must be phased out.

<a name="30625w03.html_para1">The Advisory Committee on Release to the Environment (ACRE) encourages the avoidance and minimisation of the use and expression of superfluous transgenes or sequences in the development of GM crops, including reduced use of marker genes such as ARMs <sup>1</sup> .

<a name="30625w04.html_para9">Looking back to before the creation of Defra, available data show a reduction from 9.8 days in 1999 to nine days in 2000 and 7.4 days in 2001. The data for 2001 are not broken down to take into account the creation of Defra in June of that year. Figures for sickness absence in 2002 will be available, via the Cabinet Office, in July 2003.

 The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste set targets of 50 per cent. recovery, 25 per cent. recycling and 15 per cent. recycling of each specified material which had to be met by 2001.
<P>

<a name="30625w04.html_para11">Provisional figures for the United Kingdom for 2002, which were made public on 16 May, suggested a 53.6 per cent. recovery and 47.5 per cent. recycling rate had been achieved. However, as noted then, some figures may have to be adjusted in light of a fact-finding mission to look at possible inappropriate issue of Packaging Waste Recovery Notes in 2002. In addition, as the Information Bulletin noted, the figure for the amount of wood flowing into the waste stream might have to be adjusted. Such changes will affect the final level of recovery and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30625w04.html_para12">Targets for 2003 were set in October 2002 and remain as announced then, that is 59 per cent. for recovery and 19 per cent. material-specific recycling. We are preparing a consultation document on possible future targets for 2004 to 2008 and hope to publish this next month.

<P>

<a name="30625w05.html_para1">This is a complex area and recent surveys offer various opinions for such differences. Relevant factors which contribute to an earnings gap between men and women at the early stages of their careers include the different career choices made by men and women and their different academic backgrounds and skills. The largest recent survey of final year under graduates indicates that women have systematically lower expectations than men of the salaries they will earn, both in their first posts and five years later.
<P>

<a name="30625w05.html_para2">Earnings differentials widen with age. This can be explained to some extent by the differences in labour market participation rates, employment continuity records, longer hours worked by male than female full-time employees and women's greater likelihood of having worked part-time for some or all of their careers.

 Breakfast clubs are available in a number of schools as part of study support or childcare provision, and will form an important element in our extended schools programme. They promote healthy eating, can offer learning opportunities, and help working parents by providing a safe environment for their children.
<P>

<a name="30625w06.html_para0">My Department assists breakfast clubs through the Standards Fund grant for study support (out-of-school-hours learning). This amounts to &#163;75 million this year, including a 'top up' element going to Excellence in Cities areas. Our new Sure Start Out of School Programme will also be available from August to fund new childcare places, including breakfast provision. We have announced plans to provide over 63 million in the next three years to create 96,000 new out of school places. Nearly half of these places would be in disadvantaged areas where funding would be available for up to three years.
<P>

<a name="30625w06.html_para1">In addition breakfast clubs can be supported through the National Healthy Schools Standard, the New Opportunities Fund, voluntary organisations and commercial sponsorship, such the scheme run by Education Extra and sponsored by Kellogg. In disadvantaged areas, regeneration and neighbourhood renewal funding may be available. Schools can also fund breakfast clubs from other programmes or from their own budgets.

<P>
<a name="30625w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Drug education should be a part of every school's curriculum. There is a statutory requirement for drug education in the National Curriculum Science Order. Pupils should be taught about the role of drugs as medicines; the effects on the human body of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, and how these relate to their personal health and how the abuse of alcohol, solvents, tobacco and other drugs affects health. This represents the statutory minimum. Schools are expected to use the non-statutory frameworks for PSHE and Citizenship at key stages 1 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2003 : Column 781W</I><P>
and 2, PSHE at key stages 3 and 4 and the Citizenship programme of study at key stages 3 and 4 as the context for developing drug education. We believe drug education in schools has an essential role to play in enabling pupils to develop their knowledge, skills, attitudes and understanding about drugs.
<P>

<a name="30625w06.html_para2">Since 1997, we have taken a range of measures to tackle drug misuse in schools. We have allocated over &#163;68 million to support drug alcohol and tobacco education and prevention in schools, including &#163;17.5 million this year. From April 2001, we have supported the appointment of Schools Drug Advisors to help them deliver drug education and support tailored to the needs of pupils. We have supported the development of training packages to support professionals deliver effective drug education. We are also supporting a national five year research programme called "Blueprint" to test the effectiveness of drug education initiatives in schools. It will make a significant contribution to developing a UK evidence based for drug, alcohol and tobacco education.
<P>

<a name="30625w06.html_para3">It is for schools in full consultation with local partners, including the police, to decide on appropriate strategies, including drug testing, for detecting illegal drug possession or use by pupils. Where schools adopt such strategies they should make sure, in advance, that they have clear evidence of consent. We have offered guidance on this issue in the draft document "Drugs: Guidance for schools (April 2003)". The Department of Health conducts regular surveys on the level of drug taking among young people. Data on the levels of drug taking in schools is not collected separately. The adverse effects of drug taking among young people are well documented and are highlighted in the Government's "Updated Drug Strategy 2002".
<P>

<a name="30625w06.html_para4">Schools should develop a range of options for responding to the identified needs of those involved in a drug incident. These could range from early intervention work with pupils through to fixed period and permanent exclusions. The response should always be appropriate to the seriousness of the incident, the needs of the pupil, other pupils, the school and the community and be consistent with school rules. Responses to drug use and sanctions should be contained in the school's drug policy and be developed through wide consultation with members of the school community.

 <i>[holding answer 23 June 2003]:</i> On 15 May, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced that in response to exceptional pressures this year on some school budgets he has decided to help schools manage their budgets by allowing them, in discussion with their local education authorities (LEAs), to use their devolved capital funding to support their day-to-day running costs. This is to be for this year only and must be a decision taken by the school with the agreement of the LEA.
<P>

<a name="30625w07.html_para1">If schools decide that they wish to take advantage of this flexibility they will not be required to repay any of the funding. However, as the guidance issued by my Department to LEAs on 16 May to enable them immediately to discuss locally where this capital flexibility can be used makes clear, any school which seeks to use this flexibility would irrevocably forego their capital allocation. They would, therefore, lose the benefits over the longer term of the capital investment in their school buildings to pupil standards. This flexibility has an opportunity cost, and should only be used where failure to do so would lead to excessive instability within the school. We did not intend to increase the total funding available to any school.

<a name="30625w07.html_para3">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate selling of school playing fields that had occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. Before then, there were no central records of how many playing fields had been lost. Local authorities and schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can sell any part of a school's playing field. Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that they meet published criteria and, in particular, that any proceeds will be used to improve school sports provision or education facilities.
<P>

<a name="30625w07.html_para4">Since October 1998 we have approved only one application in Shropshire that resulted in the net loss of school playing field that was capable of forming at least a small sports pitch.

Our primary strategy sets out how we will be developing a framework for learning and teaching which will focus on skills development across the whole curriculum. Our forthcoming skills strategy will set out proposals for ensuring that generic skills are developed throughout the education system. It is also important to remember that schools can choose how they teach the National Curriculum, including whether to do it in separate subject lessons or not. They can choose to focus on learning skills without abandoning the breadth and richness of content that is guaranteed by the National Curriculum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) how many schools in England make forms of contraception available to pupils; what counselling is given; and what plans he has to abolish the practice of making contraception available;  [121511]
<P>
<UL>(2) what consultation takes place with parents of school children before deciding whether their schools will be allowed to make forms of contraception available to pupils;  [121512]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the effect of easy access to contraception in schools on sexual promiscuity in underage teenagers; and if he will make a statement.  [121513]<P></UL>

<a name="30625w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Department of Health is currently collecting data on the number of local authorities in which schools are providing, or planning to provide, an on-site service which includes contraceptive advice. The data will be available at the end of June. We welcome the provision of school based health services where the school identifies a need. The decision to provide such services, and the range of the service, is for governing bodies in consultations with pupils, parents and the wider community. Guidance to schools states that trained staff in secondary schools should be able to give young people full information about different types of contraception, their effectiveness and where advice and treatment can be obtained. This should be made clear in the school's sex and relationship education policy which is discussed with parents.
<P>

<a name="30625w08.html_para0">Contraception, including emergency contraception, is provided to young people under aged 16 only under medical supervision. This includes the supply by health professionals such as school nurses and community pharmacists. Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16 if they are satisfied that the young person is competent to understand fully the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved. Health professionals work within an established legal framework which involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents. All professionals are bound by their professional code of confidentiality. A young person's request for confidentiality is respected unless there are serious child protection issues.

<a name="30625w08.html_para1">There is no evidence that access to contraception increases rates of sexual activity among young people under 16. Over the 1990s while the national figure for under 16s attendance at family planning clinics in England increased, the proportion of young people having sex before 16 remained stable.

 Guidance issued by Universities UK (UUK) and the Standing Conference of Principals (SCOP) in July 2002 recommends that where a student withdraws from a course during an academic year, the institution should charge the student a reduced fee contribution fixed in proportion to the number of weeks that the student attended. In particular, the total fee contribution due for the year is divided by 30 and multiplied by the number of weeks the student spent at the institution. Students who complete a full year would be liable for the full fee. Higher education institutions are responsible for pursuing any uncollected tuition fees.

 In spite of a considerable expansion of student numbers, the UK non-completion rate has stayed broadly the same at 17&#150;18 per cent. since 1991&#150;92, representing one of the highest completion rates in the world. We are determined to maintain that performance as we increase participation towards 50 per cent. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &#163;265 million to higher education institutions in 2003&#150;04 for widening access and improving retention. This figure recognises the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds.
<P>

<a name="30625w08.html_para14">Research indicates that there is no single cause of non-completion. However, students making the wrong initial choice of course or institution is a major factor. Under our plans set out in The Future of Higher Education' (Cm 5735), more information will be available about institutions and their performance to assist prospective students. We are also working with HEFCE to develop an electronic portal to give faster access to all available information. In addition, HEFCE is working with institutions to improve retention rates, and to disseminate good practice.

 In 2002&#150;03 the DfES funded ASTs to work in Initial Teacher Training in the context of the Teacher Training Agency-led partnerships project, which was designed to encourage providers of initial teacher training, schools and LEAs to work together to improve provision. As funding at 100 per cent. grant rate would last for only a year we encouraged LEAs to absorb the ASTs recruited in support of the scheme into their cadre of ASTs once the year was up. In order to facilitate this we included sufficient funding in the allocation of the AST match funded Standards Fund grant for 2003&#150;04 to enable each LEA to continue to fund posts previously funded at the 100 per cent. grant rate.

 The definition of a qualified teacher is set out in the Education (Teachers' Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999.

 The table shows the number of new entrants to the Graduate Teacher Programme and the Overseas-Trained Teacher Programme in each academic year since 1997/98. The rising numbers reflect the growth and success of these programmes, which allow graduates to be employed as teachers in schools in England while working towards Qualified Teacher Status. Information on the qualifications held by other categories of unqualified teachers is not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what additional resources he has made available to local education authorities to prevent the loss of <i>(a)</i> teaching and <i>(b)</i> non-teaching staff as a result of this year's budget settlement to schools.  [120968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The funding of schools is a shared responsibility of central and local Government. In 2003&#150;04, there have been a number of very significant pressures on LEA and school spending. Nationally, the additional resources provided for education more than match those pressures. However, changes to the distribution formula for Education Formula Spending, together with the ending of a substantial body of ring-fenced grants from my Department's Standards Fund, have meant that different LEAs and schools have received a wide range of year-on-year increases in overall support for education.
<P>

<a name="30625w09.html_para3">The Department has taken steps through an additional grant of &#163;28 million to ensure that all LEAs have at least a minimum increase of 3.2 per cent. per pupil, in addition to taking account of the effect of the Standards Fund and teachers' pension changes. We have also provided a special grant costing &#163;11 million to 18 London LEAs to help them fund this year's increases in London weighting. In addition, LEAs and schools will be given the additional flexibility to use their devolved formula capital funding from the Department to support revenue expenditure. The decision to use a school's capital funding in this way will need to be made

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the average salary of a teacher in <i>(a)</i> Blackpool and <i>(b)</i> Lancashire was in (i) 1997 and (ii) 2003.  [121348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The table provides the average salary of full-time <sup>1</sup>  regular qualified teachers in the maintained schools sector, as at March of each year shown. The figures shown for former Lancashire for 1999 and 2001 are based on the boundaries prior to local government reorganisation in April 1998. In April 1998, due to local government reorganisation, Lancashire split into three separate local education authorities, Lancashire, Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool. The figures shown for former Lancashire for 1999 and 2001 are based on the boundaries prior to local government reorganisation.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> <sup>1</sup>  Figures cover all grades and include any allowances paid. The average salary figures include some threshold payments that were made before March 2001, following the introduction of the threshold in September 2000. Some threshold assessments were not made in time for the associated payments to be reflected in the March 2001 data, but these were ultimately backdated to September 2000. As a result the figures in the table will be an under estimate of the actual average salary in March 2001.</FONT></UL>

 In addition to the examples of good practice in this area highlighted on our school attendance website www.dfes.gov.uk/schoolattendance 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2003 : Column 794W</I><P>
we have within the last year disseminated guidance on the effective operation of truancy sweeps and issued advice on initiatives to meet specific truancy targets to the 61 areas involved in the Behaviour Improvement Programme. We are also providing expert advice and guidance in reducing truancy to 56 local education authorities with relatively high truancy rates.
<P>

<a name="30625w10.html_para0">This month we are issuing guidance on the legal measures available to secure regular school attendance to local education authorities, schools and magistrates to promote more effective handling of truancy cases.

<a name="30625w11.html_spnew1"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The Government refuse export licence applications where there is a clear risk that the goods will be used in contravention of the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. The surest way of preventing diversion or misuse is by a thorough risk assessment at the licensing stage, where all information available at the time can be considered including the end user's track record, before the goods are exported.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will propose <i>(a)</i> restrictions on the size of the delegations of rich countries to the WTO and GATS meetings, <i>(b)</i> that the money saved be passed directly to countries which cannot afford to send delegations to these meetings and <i>(c)</i> that the voting at these meetings be proportional to the size of the populations they represent.

 The Government believe that it is important that all WTO Members are able to participate effectively in WTO negotiations. We are therefore working to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to participate in the WTO and in the international trading system. In doing so, we are helping developing countries and development agencies to build trade policy capacity in both national capitals and in Geneva, where many of the least-developed country Members of the WTO still have no permanent representation. Since 1997, we have committed &#163;45 million to trade-related technical assistance and capacity building.

<a name="30625w11.html_para2">WTO meetings generally operate on a consensus basis, with agreement reached only when all WTO Members are content with the outcome. As a result, occasions for formal voting are rare but, when they do occur, take place on the basis of one member, one vote, regardless either of the size of countries' populations or of their economic power within the international trading system.

The total is further broken down between Amounts at Risk (payments of principal and interest which have yet to fall due), unrecovered claims (whether rescheduled or not) and moratorium interest accrued on the unrecovered claims.

<a name="30625w12.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment the Government have made of the difference in pay rates between <i>(a)</i> British IT specialists and <i>(b)</i> Asian IT specialists who are working in the United Kingdom.  [120301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government have made no such assessment. The UK's work permit arrangements require that the pay and other conditions of employment that apply to an overseas worker coming to work in the UK should be at least equal to those normally given to a 'resident worker' doing similar work. The host employer must also ensure that the employment terms meet all UK legislation. The employer will be expected to operate PAYE and class 1 national insurance contributions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will introduce a maximum interest rate on personal loans; and if she will make a statement.  [120275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 We have recently consulted on making the extortionate credit provisions within the Consumer Credit Act 1974 more effective. This consultation closed on 6 June 2003, and the responses are currently being analysed. Statutory interest rate controls are just one approach to tackling the burden of extortionate credit agreements on more vulnerable members of society and I remain to be convinced that they would be effective. I will, however, be commissioning research on how interest rate caps operate in other countries.

 None. The OFT is of course free to establish its own enquiry if it has cause for concern.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her estimate is of market share held by supermarkets in the non-food retail sector.  [119351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Department has not carried out an assessment of the share of the non-food retailing market held by the supermarkets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w12.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent representations she has received from retail trade bodies on market behaviour of supermarkets in non-food sectors.  [119352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have received no recent representations from retail trade bodies commenting specifically on the market behaviour of supermarkets in non-food sectors. But submissions received from such bodies regarding the Office of Fair Trading's report on the control of entry regulations and retail pharmacy services in the UK have speculated on the possible market behaviour of supermarkets should the OFT's deregulatory proposals be implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to ensure that world trade rules do not prevent developing countries from using targeted interventions to support <i>(a)</i> their infant industries and <i>(b)</i> vulnerable producers.  [120157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 WTO rules already allow developing countries considerable freedom. In particular, Article XVIII of the GATT allows developing countries to use a wide range of measures to protect infant industries (and has often been used in the past) and Article 27 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) exempts developing countries with a GDP of less than $1,000 per head from certain disciplines of the Agreement. There are no plans to tighten these provisions.
<P>

<a name="30625w13.html_para0">However, although developing countries may choose to support their infant industries and vulnerable producers with subsidies and protect them from competition with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, the evidence suggests that the success of such protection is

mixed. In general, therefore, we do not consider such an approach to be the most useful tool for fostering economic growth and poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="30625w13.html_para1">We recognise that trade reform can have adverse effects on particular sectors and groups particularly in the short term. This is why it is important that trade reform is properly sequenced and accompanied by complementary policies to help manage the process of change. In this context, it is important that Special and Differential Treatment provisions within WTO rules are effective and binding and that any new WTO rules reflect different countries' implementation capacities.

 All of DFID's projects are designed to be sustainable so that they will continue to deliver benefits in the long-term. Our Performance Reporting Information System for Management (PRISM) system measures the success of our projects (above &#163;1 million) against a range of criteria, one of which is sustainability. Headline progress in evaluating the success of our projects is reported in DFID's Departmental Report.

 None of the Departments for which the Attorney General holds ministerial responsibility provide creche facilities. However, the Treasury Solicitor's Department has a contract through the Cabinet Office, with Childcare Enterprises Ltd. This company provides a holiday play scheme to which Treasury Solicitor's staff can apply at a cost, currently, of &#163;30 per day. Half the cost is subsequently met by the Department. In the current financial year, 2002&#150;03, seven staff have used the play scheme service, at a cost to the Department of &#163;1,476.00.

 The Afghan Transitional Authority (ATA) is the legally recognised controlling authority for the entire country.

There continue to be attacks in several parts of the country against ISAF, Coalition and ATA targets, as well as UN demining teams and NGOs. But these attacks remain limited, sporadic and do not constitute attempts by other forces to take control of an area.

<P>

 All unsuccessful applicants receive written notices informing them about their right to appeal, and the procedure they need to follow should they choose to exercise this right, at the time of refusal. Where this is necessary it can be explained in the applicant's own language by an interpreter. Furthermore, by definition, all family visitor applicants will have a UK sponsor who can advise and assist with the appeal.
<P>

<a name="30625w15.html_para0">In response to the discussion paper published to inform the Interdepartmental Review of Family Visitor Appeals the review team has produced a leaflet for family visitors and their sponsors, which is available on the Home Office website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We do not as a matter of course inform refused applicants or their sponsors of the relative chance of success of different types of appeals, but the leaflet for family visitors and their sponsors does point out that "people who ask for their appeals to be decided on the papers are only about half as successful as people who ask for an oral hearing". The leaflet explains that the sponsor and other witnesses can speak to the adjudicator at an oral hearing, and that a legal representative can attend to put the appellant's case. All appeals are determined on their merits by an independent Adjudicator.
<P>

<a name="30625w15.html_para1">As paper appeals are prioritised, and because family visits are often to attend a specific event, it may be in the applicant's interest to opt for a swift decision by choosing an appeal on the papers.
<P>

<a name="30625w15.html_para2">Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) do not usually have the benefit of seeing the applicant's sponsor at interview. If an oral hearing is chosen, the adjudicator will have the advantage of hearing the sponsor's evidence in addition to the evidence provided to the ECO at the time of the application, allowing the appellant and the sponsor the opportunity to make a fuller case.
<P>

<a name="30625w15.html_para3">By definition, all family visitors will have a sponsor in the UK who can seek advice on their behalf about appealing, including which type of appeal to choose.

<P>
<a name="30625w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We receive regular representation from pensioners in the UK who are not being paid their Zimbabwean Government pensions. Our High Commission in Harare speaks regularly to the Zimbabwean pension authorities, reminding them of their obligations to pay these pensions in full and on time. The Zimbabwean authorities say that the current lack of foreign currency in the country means that they can no longer pay pensioners living outside of Zimbabwe. All payments to pensioners living in the UK were suspended from January this year. Regrettably, this situation is unlikely to change until Zimbabwe's economy improves.

 None. Under the transitional arrangements in Schedule 8 to the Licensing Bill, applicants for the conversion of existing licences and club certificates will be required to include their existing licence or club certificate with their application. The past records of licensing justices' will not be required. Once the transfer of responsibility for alcohol licensing to licensing authorities comes fully into effect at the end of the transitional period new licences and certificates will be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and without reference to any previous licence that was granted by the licensing justices.

that the costs to local authorities arising from the administration, inspection and enforcement of licences, as proposed in the Licensing Bill, are met <i>(a)</i> from the fees payable and <i>(b)</i> by direct central Government funding.  [119863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The fees for licences, certificates and notices under the Licensing Bill will be set at a level which provides for full cost recovery in respect of administration, inspection and enforcement. The Government will monitor the levels of fees and it will be open to bodies such as the Audit Commission, after a reasonable period, to report to the Secretary of State on any indications that the level of fees might not be leading to full cost recovery for licensing authorities. Where an exemption from fees has been granted by Government, the associated costs will be met from central Government funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There is nothing in the Licensing Bill which exempts permitted temporary activities taking place under a temporary event notice from the provisions of existing fire and safety legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures will be put in place to ensure that licences issued under the terms of the Licensing Bill by one local authority will be recognised as valid by other local authorities.  [119868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Personal licences must be issued by all licensing authorities in accordance with the provision of the Bill. Further, regulations made by the Secretary of State will prescribe a standard form for a personal licence. No discretion is given to a licensing authority to reject the validity of a personal licence properly issued by any licensing authority. The Government are also committed to setting up a central licensing register, which would allow licensing authorities to check the issue of a personal licence with another licensing authority. Work with local authorities and other key partners to set up such a database is in hand and we will drive the work forward in parallel with the Bill to ensure that a database is available at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="30625w16.html_para2">A premises licence is also granted in accordance with the provisions of the Bill by the licensing authority in whose area the premises is situated. The form of a premises licence will also be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations. The issue of recognition of the validity of a premises licence by another licensing authority may only arise when premises straddle the area of more than one authority. If the other authority made relevant representations on an application for a premises licence, and is aggrieved by the licensing authorities decision, it may appeal that decision to the magistrate's court.

<a name="30625w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The police have existing responsibilities for the prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of current alcohol licensing law. The Licensing Bill will not alter this or impose any additional burdens in relation to enforcement. The Government believe, however, that the removal of permitted hours and the anticipated reduction in crime and disorder problems at the current fixed closing times could help to reduce the burden on the police.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures she is taking to increase the opportunities to hear live music in the UK in <i>(a)</i> pubs, <i>(b)</i> public halls and <i>(c)</i> public open spaces.  [119479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Licensing Bill will provide a unified system for the regulation of licensable activities, removing the need for the current system of separate annually renewable, public entertainment licences. Under the Bill a pub, qualifying club, community hall or indeed any other premises applying for authorisation under a premises licence for the sale and supply of alcohol will be able to apply, at the same time, for authorisation under that licence for the provision of regulated entertainment, such as live music, without incurring an additional fee. Once granted, a premises licence will have effect until the licence is revoked or surrendered, but otherwise will not be time limited unless the applicant so requests. We believe that this unified system will open up more opportunities for live musical events.
<P>

<a name="30625w16.html_para3">Also the Government have made plain their intention to exempt church halls, village halls and other community buildings from the fees associated with the provision of regulated entertainment, including live music. However, a fee will be payable if the applicant also seeks authorisation for the sale or supply of alcohol. We believe that these exemptions from the fees associated with the provision of regulated entertainment will also broaden the opportunities for live musical events.
<P>

<a name="30625w16.html_para4">The Bill provides that a premises can be any place and live music or other regulated entertainment on public open spaces would be licensable, subject to satisfying the conditions in Schedule 1 to the Bill and any exemptions being relevant. We will, however, be encouraging local authorities to obtain premises licences authorising the provision of regulated entertainment for public open spaces, such as village greens, on which many performances take place. No additional licence would then need to be obtained by anyone wishing to provide regulated entertainment on premises covered by such a licence, although the consent of the local authority holding the licence would be required.
<P>

<a name="30625w16.html_para5">All short-term small scale events, whether in a pub, public hall or public open space could also benefit from the more informal system of permitted temporary activities under the Bill, which would require a simple notification to the licensing authority and the police and a small fee of around &#163;20. The Bill has been amended to increase the number of temporary event notices that can be given in respect of the same premises from five to 12, subject to a maximum number of 15 days for that 



<P>

 Of the 338 people and projects supported to date by NESTA, they have taken a financial stake in 106 through their Invention and Innovation programme. Of these 106 projects, in 78 cases this has been a royalty stake, and in 28 cases an equity stake. None of the equity stakes have yet been realised, and it is difficult to predict with any accuracy the market value of these companies at any given point in time. The 78 projects in which NESTA has a royalty stake have produced royalties for NESTA totalling approximately &#163;57,000. However, in the majority of cases NESTA has chosen to defer payment of royalties to maximise the chances of the project's success. In total &#163;2,699 has been received in royalty payments to date. The value and status of NESTA'S portfolio is assessed on a 6-monthly basis.The remainder of NESTA's projects are supported because of their social, artistic or other potential, rather than because they are expected to make a profit.

<P>
<a name="30625w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. The decision by Sport England to prioritise its funding of National Governing Bodies of Sport will not mean that other sports and physical activities will no longer receive funding. Sport England will continue to work with the governing bodies of these sports including those which involve rural sports. When funding decisions for community projects are devolved to the regions it will be open to the Regional Sports Boards to support rural sports where these meet the objectives of their regional sports strategies.

 The Government recognise the desire of many in sport for a rate relief measure for community amateur sports clubs. Under revised Charity Commission guidance announced in April 2002, amateur clubs may benefit from 80 per cent. mandatory relief from business rates if they successfully apply for charitable status.

 Since 1997, our records indicate that the United Kingdom Government have voted against a legislation proposal only once in the Health Council and subsequently, the health element of the Employment, Social Policy Health and Consumer Affairs Council. This was for the Advertising and Sponsorship of Tobacco Products Directive in 2002, the text of which we believed could have been clearer and could have gone further. We were outvoted, by a qualified majority, and the measure was adopted. We have not abstained or indicated dissent on a proposal in that time.

 The information requested is shown in the table. These figures are on a headcount basis rather than a whole time equivalent (wte) basis and therefore take no account of part-time working. NHS dentists cover dentists working in the general dental service (GDS), hospital dental service (HDS), community dental service (CDS), personal dental service (PDS) and salaried service of the GDS. Dentists have been counted in each dental service in which they practice, apart from dentists working in the PDS and GDS, who are counted as GDS dentists.

 Needle exchange schemes are one of a number of harm reduction activities carried out in support of the Drug Strategy. Spend on needle exchange schemes is not separately identifiable but a total of &#163;27 million of Government funding was spent on harm reduction activities in 2001&#150;02. We do not have figures for the previous two years. Other harm reduction activities include work to reduce the spread of blood-borne diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis B and C, and the Government's Action Plan to reduce drug related deaths.

<a name="30625w19.html_para3">Substantial funding is also made available for needle exchange schemes from National Health Service mainstream resources but we have no way of estimating the actual amount, as this is based on local decision-making by drug action teams and primary care trusts.

 It is for the North East Lincolnshire Council to decide, in the light of its priorities, how much to spend on social care for elderly people in the Cleethorpes constituency and how to make available the necessary funds. North East Lincolnshire's personal social services formula spending share increased by 6.1 per cent. in cash terms, to &#163;34.925 million in 2003&#150;04. In addition, the social care grants which North East Lincolnshire has been allocated for 2003&#150;04 have increased substantially. In particular, the council has been allocated &#163;527,000 from the new access and systems capacity grant and &#163;155,000 from the delayed discharges grant.

The CSM had issued advice on the safety of HRT in 1997 and did so again in 2002. Product information, including patient information leaflets, gives clear advice on the indications and risks of HRT. In the light of the WHI study, the Department of Health issued an urgent communication to primary care trust chief executives, medical directors of trusts and directors of public health to cascade to general practitioners, alerting them to the study's findings and to deal with queries from women who were concerned about HRT following publicity about the study.

<P>

<a name="30625w20.html_para1">In response to the Stewart recommendations, the LINK Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) Programme was set up with funding from both industry and Government, including the Department of Health. The MTHR website address is www.mthr.org.uk. The programme includes three population (human health) studies that are designed specifically to look for cancer incidence in relation to mobile phone use. Two of these form part of the multinational INTERPHONE study being conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Results from this are expected in 2004 and more information about this study is available on the IARC website at http://www.iarc.fr/paqeroot/UNIT5/RCA4.html

<a name="30625w20.html_para2">A recommendation in the Stewart Report was that there should be a further comprehensive review of the science related to possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation within three years. The Government asked for this review to be carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and the board of NRPB asked for this to be undertaken by its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation. This review is nearing completion and will be finalised by the end of 2003. It will include a review of the totality of scientific evidence related to concerns about the risk of cancer.

 Medical devices placed onto the United Kingdom market must comply with the provisions of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 and be CE marked by their manufacturers to demonstrate this compliance. The Regulations impose various obligations upon manufacturers designed to protect patients and users by ensuring that devices are safe and fit for their intended purpose. There is no time limit imposed by the Regulations on when devices can be CE-marked.
<P>

<a name="30625w20.html_para4">The Regulations allow non-CE-marked devices to be placed on the market in three specific circumstances. These are: where the device is custom-made for an individual patient on the basis of a prescription from a duly qualified medical practitioner; where the device is made available as part of a controlled clinical trial run by the manufacturer to gain evidence to support its eventual CE-marking; and for use for an individual patient where no suitable CE-marked device is available. In these latter two situations, the agreement of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which is responsible for enforcing the Regulations, must be obtained in advance.

 Since 3 April 2000, asylum seekers cannot claim social security benefits but instead receive accommodation and a cash allowance from the Home Office's National Asylum Support Service (NASS). The cash allowance is the equivalent of up to 70 per cent. of the income support personal allowance.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30625w20.html_spnew10"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 We are making great efforts to reduce overpayments by ensuring that the right benefit is paid to the right person right from the start. Latest figures show that we have reduced the level of error and fraud in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 24 per cent. since 1998.
<P>

<a name="30625w20.html_para20">An overpayment of benefit may be recoverable if it is decided that it has been caused by misrepresentation or failure to disclose a material fact by a benefit recipient. Recovery may also be sought if the overpayment has been caused by the error or omission of an official, but only where it is considered reasonable to assume that the recipient should have realised that they had been overpaid.
<P>

<a name="30625w20.html_para21">The Department can recover the overpayment from on-going benefit in cases of misrepresentation or failure to disclose a material fact by the benefit recipient. Where benefit is no longer in payment or the overpayment is a result of official error, the customer will be invited to repay the amount overpaid. Failure to do so may result in the Department seeking recovery through civil action. If a benefit recipient states that recovery of an overpayment from their benefit would cause hardship, officials will consider on a case-by-case basis whether the customer's weekly outgoings merit recovery at a reduced rate.
<P>

<a name="30625w20.html_para22">There is no time limit for the recovery of overpayments by deductions from benefit. Where recovery is through court action, there are time limits of 20 years from the date of the overpayment decision in Scotland, and six years from the last contact with the customer in England and Wales.

 To date there have been three acts of decommissioning carried out by paramilitary organisations, one by the Loyalist Volunteer Force and two by the Provisional IRA. In 2002 the UVF, UDA and Provisional IRA broke off contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. However, in 2003 the Provisional IRA resumed contact and the Loyalist Commission, along with the UDA representatives, met the IICD. The Prime Minister stated clearly in his speech on 1 May 2003 that an undertaking is needed that all arms will be put beyond use through the IICD.

 It is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that two acts of decommissioning by the Provisional IRA and one by the Loyalist Volunteer Force have taken place since the Agreement. That was the start of a process that must continue until all the apparatus of terrorism, in all its forms, is dismantled. The Prime Minister stated clearly in his speech on 1 May 2003 that an undertaking is needed that all arms will be put beyond use through the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.

It is also moving forward on an animal health strategy to help underpin the future viability of the livestock sector and is engaging in an ambitious modernisation agenda within the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to ensure that its structures and services are best positioned to help the industry move forward.

 I am happy, in principle, to draw on hospital services available in the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in the interests of patients. The health and social services already make very good use of services in Dublin, Glasgow, London, and other centres, as part of the overall services available to patients. In doing so, of course, there is the issue of how that impacts on the overall financial resources available to services here. There needs to be an appropriate balance to ensure that services which people need are accessible and readily available.

 The Department of Education gathered parents' views on the Burns' Report through response forms issued to every household in Northern Ireland and further consulted parents on the way forward through a series of focus groups. The clear message from the focus groups was that parents were satisfied that extensive consultation had taken place and the Department should proceed with developing proposals based on the emerging consensus. The Working Group comprises the main representative organisations and managing authorities that will be responsible for developing and implementing future arrangements and has been charged with taking account of the responses to the consultation on the Burns' Report and providing advice on options for future arrangements for post-primary education.

 The Government's policy on ring-fencing of grant to local authorities was set out in the White Paper, Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services of December 2001 (Ref: CM5237). While recognising that ring-fencing can be an important tool for bringing about change, we are aware that a proliferation of ring-fenced grants erodes local discretion and diverts resources on bureaucracy. So our policy is to reduce the total of ring-fenced grants.

<a name="30625w24.html_para13">In the 'Freedoms and Flexibilities' paper of 26 November 2002 we made it clear that for revenue funding councils awarded 'excellent' and for capital funding councils awarded 'excellent' or 'good' would receive all funding as unfenced grants, except for those grants passported to schools.

<a name="30625w24.html_para14">On current plans, revenue ring-fencing will be less than 10 per cent. by the financial year 2005&#150;06. For capital funding, the target is to increase the level of resources funded through the unfenced Single Capital Pot to two thirds of relevant finance.

It is a matter for the coroner to decide on the scope of the investigation but in most cases coroners will take evidence of what drugs were prescribed and commission tests for the presence of drugs which may have been a factor in a death apparently due to self harm.

<P>
<a name="30625w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 It is not the role of independent judicial officers to provide feedback to entry clearance officers on the quality of decision-making. Decision makers receive a copy of the adjudicator's determination in every case and it is for the entry clearance managers to address any issues of concern over the quality of decision making. If adjudicators identify a matter giving rise to a more general concern then the Chief Adjudicator may write to the head of UK Visas to address that specific issue.

 Legal aid in civil cases is granted from the Community Legal Service (CLS) fund according to criteria set by the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor and approved by Parliament. However, although Noble and Learned Friend and I have Ministerial responsibility for the CLS scheme, individual decisions about funding in civil cases are entirely a matter for the Legal Services Commission, which is an independent body.
<P>

<a name="30625w26.html_para4">The only involvement that Ministers have in individual cases occurs when the Commission, under s.6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999, requests the Lord Chancellor to authorise exceptional funding to a case which is outside the scope of the CLS scheme.

<P>

<a name="30625w27.html_para0">Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by the magistrates courts and the crown court. Debt collected includes not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not at present possible to separate fines from the total. The England and Wales closing arrears total at 31 March 2003 was &#163;276,870,306.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 12 June 2003 from the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd), <i>Official Report,</i> column 1005W, on animal welfare, what research his Department has commissioned into the effectiveness of <i>(a)</i> the inter-departmental Concordat on Data Sharing and <i>(b)</i> measures in finding alternative methods of testing other than using animals; and if he will make a statement.  [120445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w27.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The inter-Departmental Concordat on Data Sharing was announced in August 2000. Its aims included minimising data requirements for animal tests as far as possible, encouraging data sharing between clients, wherever appropriate, and seeking to overcome any procedural and legal barriers to data sharing. As it has now been in place for almost three years, we are reviewing its effectiveness. Accordingly, my hon. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2003 : Column 864W</I><P>
Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), invited ministerial colleagues to review implementation of the Concordat and provide views on how it might be up dated.
<P>

<a name="30625w27.html_para1">As to other measures, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) a budget for the development and promotion of the 3Rs&#151;alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering. Details of completed research are published in the Annual Report of the Animal Procedures Committee, which is available from The Stationery Office and on the Committee's website. The amount being made available to the Committee for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;280,000.
<P>

<a name="30625w27.html_para2">In addition, the Home Office leads the inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs, whose terms of reference are to improve the application of the 3Rs and promote research into alternatives, reducing the need for toxicity testing through better sharing of data, and encouraging the validation and acceptance of alternatives. The Group is currently preparing revised guidance on the conduct of regulatory toxicology and safety evaluation studies and, arising from the Government response to the House of Lords Select Committee on animals in scientific procedures, has also been tasked with exploring the scope for a United Kingdom Centre for research into the 3Rs.
<P>

<a name="30625w27.html_para3">We were also a co-sponsor of the fourth World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences held in New Orleans in August 2002, publish a number of guidance and best practice documents on the Home Office web site and contribute regularly to events and activities intended to develop or promote work relating to the 3Rs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people who entered the UK on a temporary work visa in each of the last three years subsequently claimed asylum.  [120915]<P>

<P>
<a name="30625w27.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is not possible to say precisely how many people who entered the UK on a temporary work permit and then subsequently applied for asylum. However the numbers are likely to be small. The nationalities of most people granted work permits are generally different from the nationalities of asylum seekers. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.

 In cases where the appellant's appeal is dismissed the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) sends a copy of the appeal determination (including family visit visa appeals) directly to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for onward transmission to overseas posts. All allowed Entry Clearance and Visit Visa appeal determinations (including family visit visa appeals) are sent to the Home Office by the IAA so that the Home Office can consider whether to seek Permission to Appeal (PTA) to the Immigration Appellate Tribunal (IAT). The Home Office notify the relevant Entry Clearance post of the final appeal outcome once it has been confirmed whether the Home Office will seek PTA to the IAT. The Home Office also informs posts if an unsuccessful appellant successfully pursues PTA to the IAT. The Home Office is working closely with UK Visas to improve methods of communicating Entry Clearance and Family Visit Visa appeal information to posts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 14 May 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 251W, on lost passports, what assessment he has made of the reasons for the loss of passports by Immigration and Nationality Directive staff; and what proportion of the lost passports were subsequently found.

<P>
<a name="30625w29.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) at any one time hold many thousands of passports (spread across several different locations). They are currently being asked to return between 600 to 900 of these every week to their owners. Sometimes, despite every effort, it is not possible to do this within the timescale stipulated by the applicant. This does not necessarily mean that the passport is lost. Previously, officials have offered to issue a lost passport letter (LPL), that would enable the person to obtain a replacement for their Embassy.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para1">Under the new arrangements, no LPL is issued now without a thorough search having being made for the document, initially by the unit receiving the request and, if necessary, by the Return of Passport Unit. If the search is unsuccessful, a serial-numbered LPL is issued. As a result, the Integrated Casework Directorate (ICD) now keeps a much tighter control on the issuing of letters and robust statistics are now maintained.

 There have been three investigations into losses of a total of 15 passports from passport offices in the last five years.

All three investigations occurred during 2000 and each involved a full and thorough investigation by UK Passport Service's (UKPS) security

<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w29.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service (UKPS) considers an investigation to be a major investigation when it involves multiple instances of fraud or attempted fraud, which are related to each other in some way. Currently UKPS has six such investigations in progress. As investigations may involve instances of suspected as well as actual fraud it would not be appropriate to publish a figure on the number of cases under investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are taken to ascertain whether an individual who applies for a new passport to replace a lost passport has indeed lost the original.  [120913]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w29.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 An individual applying to replace a lost passport is required in completing the passport application to provide details of the lost passport, and explain how, when, and where the passport was lost. The individual in signing the application declares that 'all information given in this application is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief'. There is a caution on the application form reminding passport applicants that it is a criminal offence to make an untrue statement for the purpose of obtaining a passport.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para5">In seeking to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining high standards of customer service and fraud prevention the UK Passport Service's (UKPS) current practice is generally to accept what the applicant has declared to be true at face value. In every case the passport history is checked. Further inquiries would only be made if there was for example an inconsistency between the information on the application form and that contained in UKPS records.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para6">In cases where newly issued passports are declared lost in the post UKPS does not routinely require the submission of a fresh passport application unless a period of time has elapsed. In all cases UKPS requires a signed letter from the passport holder declaring the loss. An untrue statement in the letter would be a criminal offence. The UKPS then carries out validation checks with records held on UKPS systems. Details of losses are passed on to Royal Mail for investigation.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para7">To ascertain with absolute certainty that an applicant was no longer in possession of the passport is probably unachievable. It would require a search which would obviously be impractical and an unwarranted intrusion in almost all cases.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para8">All passports reported lost are cancelled in the UKPS's records to which the Immigration Service has access.
<P>

<a name="30625w29.html_para9">As indicated in the UKPS's 2003&#150;08 Corporate and Business Plan the UKPS is planning to introduce a more comprehensive system for recording and disseminating information on lost, stolen and recovered passports. This will enable the timely and accurate collection and dissemination of information on lost, stolen and recovered passports in the United Kingdom and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts abroad; and will require the applicant to provide more detailed information in notifying the UKPS of the loss of the passport. The new forms associated with the loss and recovery notification will be placed in the Library once they have been finalised.

 In line with a recommendation of the Independent Review Team that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary appointed last September, we have come forward with a provision in the Criminal Justice Bill specifically to empower the Secretary of State to delegate functions under Part V of the Police Act 1997 under which the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has been established. The power is purely discretionary, but will give us the flexibility, should it be needed, to deploy both civil service and private sector staff working in the CRB to best effect. No decision has been taken to delegate any functions currently undertaken by civil servants, including those functions that require access to police records. Were such functions to be delegated they would be subject to appropriate contractual safeguards to prevent any unauthorised disclosure. In addition, under the provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill it will be a criminal offence for any person to whom the Secretary of State's functions are delegated to disclose any personal information save in the course of the person's duties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many British armed forces personnel are stationed in Iraq from <i>(a)</i> regular and <i>(b)</i> reserve forces.  [121304]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 As at 24 June, there were 10,250 personnel deployed in Iraq, of whom approximately 1,400 were members of the Reserve Forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30625w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2003]:</i> British forces deployed on operations in Iraq are provided with guidance for working in extreme temperatures. Acclimatisation and a sensible approach to the working environment mean that personnel can operate effectively. Most of the United Kingdom forces' equipment is capable of operating in high temperatures. However, a number of enhancements have been made to ensure that operational effectiveness is not degraded.
