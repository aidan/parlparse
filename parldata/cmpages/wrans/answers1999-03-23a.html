To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his Department's estimate was of the cost of answering the question from the hon. Member for Chichester of 17 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>689</i>, concerning the waiving of the working time directive (Ref. 76811); and if he will provide a breakdown.  [78048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The cost to my Department's budget of answering individual parliamentary questions is not held centrally, however, the advisory cost of limit answering a parliamentary question is &#163;500.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) of 21 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>529</i>, on outstanding compensation cases, if he will indicate the year of submission of each claim for compensation on the grounds of <i>(a)</i> post- traumatic stress disorder and <i>(b)</i> physical injury; and if he will categorise them according to the geographical region where it is alleged the injuries were sustained.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer on Iraq of 18 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>810</i>, what evidence he has received of Saddam Hussein attempting to use his air force in 1999 for repressing his own people; and to which people he is referring.  [78367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The no-fly-zones were established in April 1991 (north) and August 1992 (south) in support of UN Security Council Resolution 688 which condemned Saddam Hussein's brutal repression of his own people. This repression involved extensive use of helicopter gun ships against the Kurdish minority in the north as well as both fixed wing aircraft and helicopter gun ships against Sh'ia muslims in the south. Since the end of December 1998, over 170 Iraqi aircraft have violated the no-fly zones. Coalition patrols have successfully prevented any of these aircraft from attacking the Kurdish minority in the northern no-fly zone or the Sh'ia muslims in the southern no-fly zone. However, given the extensive history of brutality by Saddam's regime, there is no reason to believe that he would not resume these tactics were we to cease patrols.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service discontinued 12 per cent. of cases completed in magistrates courts in 1998, almost unchanged from the figure recorded for each of the four preceding years.
<P>

<a name="90323w01.htm_para1">More than half of discontinued cases are unable to proceed because witnesses fail to appear in court, refuse to give evidence, or change their evidence; defendants produce documents proving their innocence in motoring cases on the day of the trial; evidence is excluded because of irregularities in its collection; or there are gaps in the prosecution case which cannot be filled by the police. In these circumstances, the Crown Prosecution Service has no choice but to discontinue proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90323w01.htm_para2">The number of cases discontinued against the opinion of the police is very small; a survey conducted in 1994 showed that the police objected to discontinuance on only 4 per cent. of occasions when they were consulted.

 The Attorney-General intervened before the Court of Appeal in this case, on behalf of the Speaker and the Authorities of the House of Commons, as it raised fundamental constitutional issues as to the respective jurisdictions of Parliament and the Courts. It was important that such issues should not be decided by default. The Speaker and Authorities of the House of Commons have a direct interest in protecting the privileges of the House, which were directly in issue in the appeal.
<P>

<a name="90323w01.htm_para3">Before deciding whether to intervene, the Attorney-General took into account the judgment of Mr. Justice Popplewell in the High Court, together with representations made to him following that judgment by the Clerk of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The Welsh Office does not run a large fleet of vehicles and therefore does not have a Fleet Manager. However, the Department's car purchasing and hiring arrangements reflect a concern for the environment. Current practice is to replace petrol driven vehicles with those fitted with catalytic converters and run on unleaded petrol. All vehicles are regularly serviced and fuel consumption, mileage and maintenance costs are closely monitored. These policies will be reflected in the Department's Green Transport Plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what estimate he has made of the cost of implementing the potential road programme identified in Driving Wales Forward; and if he will make a statement.  [78573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I am placing copies of tables in the Library of the House which give the requested information on a constant price base up to the year 2011-12.
<P>

<a name="90323w02.htm_para0">The tables cover maintenance expenditure, schemes for making better use of the network, safety schemes and small scale improvements, as well as the major schemes included in the "short term" programme set out in Driving Wales Forward. That document also announced the Government's intention of undertaking corridor studies in relation to several other major road schemes in the programme inherited from the previous administration. The cost of implementing those schemes has been included in order to show the full potential costs of the trunk road programme.

 A preliminary analysis of the criteria adopted to deal with the worst problems of noise on English trunk roads indicates that no trunk road sites in Wales currently suffer from noise levels sufficiently high to meet those criteria. We will be extending our analysis

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 Last year, the Information Committee conducted an inquiry into options for provision of IT services and equipment for Members. The Committee's report (HC, 1998-99, 76) was published on 18 December 1998. The Committee did not find convincing evidence for savings to public funds from central provision of IT. It did receive evidence that more value could be gained from the same investment if there were more co- ordination of purchases. It therefore recommended that a catalogue of standard equipment should be negotiated with suppliers and made available to Members. This catalogue is now in preparation and is expected to be published before the summer recess.

<P>
<a name="90323w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The importance of voluntary organisations in helping to deliver the range of policies aimed at tackling social exclusion in Scotland is already recognised in the high level of funding which is provided by the Government. Scottish Office funding for the sector totals nearly &#163;283 million a year, with &#163;23 million in direct aid and a further &#163;260 million provided through other funded agencies. These funds support organisations working in the fields of social welfare, health promotion, homelessness, the provision of social housing, rural poverty and urban deprivation.

Decisions concerning the future and number of magistrates courts in their area are for the relevant MCC to determine.

 The Lord Chancellor has no plans to review the retirement age of judges. The retirement age was changed by the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993, which came into force on 31 March 1995. This Act established a normal compulsory retirement age of 70 (except where a lower age is specified in the statutory conditions of tenure for a particular office) for all judicial office holders initially appointed on or after that date, subject to a power given to the Lord Chancellor to extend or re-extend service for a year at a time up to a limit of 75.

[77871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w04.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), which is an independent non-departmental public body and is chaired by Lord Justice Henry.
<P>

<a name="90323w04.htm_para5">The JSB held a series of residential seminars on the new civil justice procedures during January and February 1999 which were attended by nearly all full-time judges exercising civil jurisdiction. Those attending comprised 29 Court of Appeal judges, 83 High Court judges, 352 circuit judges, 387 district judges and 20 High Court masters and registrars. A separate seminar was held on 15 March for judges of the technology and construction court.
<P>

<a name="90323w04.htm_para6">The JSB will hold a series of 22 one day seminars in April, May and June 1999 on the new civil justice procedures which will be attended by all 1,400 part-time judges exercising civil jurisdiction, and by those few full-time judges who were unable to attend the residential seminars.

<a name="90323w04.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor believes that any such arrangements must strike an appropriate balance between the obligations of the judiciary to the public and the overriding constitutional principle of judicial independence which means that judges must be able to determine each case fairly and on its merits, without fear of improper intervention. Almost all judicial decisions are subject to appeal or review enabling higher courts to comment on or redress judicial decisions or conduct. The work of part-time judges provides opportunities for their performance and, therefore, their suitability for appointment to full-time office to be assessed. The Lord Chancellor has decided to review the scope for refining and improving the arrangements for the appraisal of part-time judicial office holders, and in that context has endorsed a pilot scheme involving more structured arrangements for the performance appraisal of deputy District Judges which he hopes to extend in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w04.htm_wqn14"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what arrangements are in place to provide continuing education for judges; what plans he has to review those arrangements; and if he will make a statement.  [77870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w04.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Judicial education is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), which is an independent non-departmental public body and is chaired by Lord Justice Henry.
<P>

<a name="90323w04.htm_para8">The JSB provides continuing education for judges through a programme of seminars on criminal, civil and family law which are attended by Circuit Judges, District Judges, Stipendiary Magistrates, Recorders, Assistant Recorders, Deputy District Judges and acting Stipendiary Magistrates. In general, full- and part-time Judges attend training courses run by the JSB every three years.
<P>

<a name="90323w04.htm_para9">The JSB draws up a strategy, covering three years, which is reviewed annually. In the light of the strategy the JSB draws up an annual plan. Both the strategy and annual plan are sent to the Lord Chancellor, who considers the performance targets and allocates resources to the JSB in the light of the plans and the overall resources available to him.

<a name="90323w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> The Patents Act 1977 lays down the requirements which must be met to obtain patents for inventions in all fields of technology. Patents may be obtained for inventions which are new, not obvious and have industrial applicability. However, the Act excludes certain matter from patent rights. This includes plant and animal varieties and discoveries where there is no accompanying technical step, such as the mere discovery that a gene exists in nature. Any patent can be challenged before the courts, on the grounds that it does not meet the requirements laid down by the Patents Act. In July 1998, an EC Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions was adopted. This Directive clarifies and harmonises the patent legislation as it applies to biotechnological inventions in all Member States. However, the Directive will not change what is and what is not currently patentable in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> The offer of support for Longbridge is based upon being satisfied that the project will meet a number of key criteria, including the improvement of skills levels, improvements in productivity and the securing of substantial investment by BMW. It would be inappropriate, however, to place individual competitive restraints on Rover/BMW as a condition of any aid package.
<P>

<a name="90323w05.htm_para0">A recent report by the European Commission on car prices in the European Union showed that price differences had significantly decreased since the previous report but that the UK continued to be the most expensive market for many models. We shall be encouraging the Commission, as part of the evaluation on the cars block exemption, to identify the reasons for these price differences.

 <i>[holding answer 17 March 1999]:</i> This is an operational matter for the Post Office, which is proposing to introduce changes in transport and packaging requirements for diagnostic specimens and infectious substances in order to ensure compliance with national and international requirements on the safe transport of these substances. Discussions are continuing between officials of the Post Office, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Health and Safety Executive and the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure both that the requirements for the safe transport of infectious and diagnostic substances are met and that costs to industry are minimised.

 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1999]:</i> Neither Ministers, special advisers nor civil servants saw the European Scrutiny Committee questions brief in advance of my appearance.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> The DTI is currently funding around twenty projects to encourage the growth and competitiveness of the UK textiles and clothing industry. These projects cover research into product innovation and development, design, education and training, benchmarking and the development of supply chain partnerships. In addition, 770 textiles, clothing and footwear companies benefited from trade fair support last year.

 The Textiles and Clothing Strategy Group (TCSG) is an industry-led body resulting from a joint management/union initiative. It is looking at long-term competitiveness issues affecting the UK textiles and clothing industry. In response to a request to the Chairman of the TCSG, James McAdam CBE (BATC), I am able to say that the TCSG meets on a monthly basis and, over the coming months, intends to look at a number of issues including: international productivity comparisons, supply chain relations, human resources (training, recruitment and skills), product development, investment, technological development, and design and marketing. As well as James McAdam, the membership of the TCSG includes Peter Aubusson (Courtaulds Textiles), Peter Booth (TGWU), Des Farrell (GMB), Paul Gates (KFAT), Professor Dick Horrocks (Bolton Institute), David Sutcliffe OBE DL (Benson Turner) and John Wilson (BATC).

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The offshore oil industry together with the other key UK utilities and services are providing regular public reports on their state of Y2K compliance through the Action 2000-National Infrastructure Forum arrangements, and also via the Action 2000 and UKOOA Internet sites.
<P>

<a name="90323w05.htm_para1">DTI, acting through UKOOA, the trade body which represents UK offshore oil operators, has asked companies to provide assessments of their state of Y2K preparedness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will <i>(a)</i> list the funding from the EU affected by the UK's abatement and <i>(b)</i> state the amount of required matched funding and the adjustments which had been made as a result of the abatement, for the last year for which figures are available.

<a name="90323w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The UK abatement is one year in arrears and is, broadly, two thirds of the difference between what the UK contributes to the EU budget and what is received. It is deducted from the resources side of the budget, so reduces contributions rather than receipts. There is no requirement for matched funding linked to the abatement.

The Women's Unit has particular interest in teenage girls and this research included 6 focus groups with this age-group in order to inform the Unit's policy area with the views of girls themselves.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the amount paid in National Insurance, excluding contributions to SERPS, as a percentage of national income for each income decile of the working population for <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 <i>(b)</i> 2002-03 and <i>(c)</i> 2007-08 and <i>(d)</i> each 10 years to 2047-48; what impact he estimates the changes will have on the re-distributive nature of national insurance contributions; and if he will make a statement.  [74176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w06.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Information is not available in the form requested because Class 1 National Insurance contributions are not separable into elements for SERPS or for the other benefits paid out of the National Insurance Fund. The information that is available is in the table and relates to gross Class 1 contributions as a percentage of all employed earnings by earnings decile. This takes account of the changes to the structure of Class 1 contributions announced in the Chancellor's 1998 and 1999 Budgets.

 The Welfare Reform Green Paper, "New Ambitions for our Country: A New Contract for Welfare" (CM 3805), set out the framework for welfare reform, based on eight principles, together with a range of success measures. Views were invited on the contents of the Green Paper, specifically on those principles and success measures. The information gathered from the responses was categorised to reflect this. As views were not specifically sought on means testing and it did not feature in the guiding principles or success measures, a list of those who commented on it is not available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish his strategy for combating fraud in social security.  [78576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I am publishing today "A New Contract for Welfare--Safeguarding Social Security", which sets out the Government's strategy for reducing fraud and error in the Social Security system.
<P>

<a name="90323w07.htm_para3">When we came into office far too much money was being lost through fraud and error. Targets were set to find fraud but not to stop it happening, and safeguarding Social Security was too often an afterthought rather than an integral part of processing claims.
<P>

<a name="90323w07.htm_para4">We are determined to focus on a single goal--reducing the amount of fraud and error. We will achieve this by getting payments right in the first place, keeping them right throughout the claim and putting mistakes right when we find them. We will make sure that we have a suitable range of sanctions, including prosecutions, to make those who steal Social Security realise that crime does not pay.
<P>

<a name="90323w07.htm_para5">We have already made a good start and have set clear goals against which our success can be judged. By tightening the gateways to benefit and requiring more supporting evidence before benefit is paid we expect to save &#163;1 billion in Income Support alone over this Parliament. We are providing an extra &#163;100 million to local authorities so that they can make tougher checks on Housing Benefit. We are making greater use of new technology to share information between the agencies and councils paying benefits to improve service and to avoid duplication. We are helping local authorities to prosecute more cases of Housing Benefit fraud and have launched an independent review of how best to tackle the threats to Social Security from organised fraud.
<P>

<a name="90323w07.htm_para6">We shall keep checking that our plans are working and we will review local performance to trace how well we are doing in each area. We have set a challenging target to reduce by 30 per cent., losses from fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance, by 31 March 2007, with at least a 10 per cent. reduction by 31 March 2002. This will take sustained effort by all staff delivering Social Security. We know that they will rise to the challenge.
<P>

<a name="90323w07.htm_para7">Our strategy builds on the work set out in the Green Paper published last July "Beating Fraud Is Everyone's Business: securing the future" (Cm 4012). The responses we had to the Green Paper were largely supportive and I am placing a summary of these in the Library today.

Installers seeking appointment are required to demonstrate that they can meet the required standard of quality of work and customer care, and have the appropriately qualified and trained staff. Those meeting these criteria are then assessed on the basis of price.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have received written representations covering all three issues from eight local residents. We have also received a copy of a report prepared by the A51 Environmental Group, which covers these points.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you know, the Highways Agency is carrying out two studies involving the A51. Firstly, a study of the full length of the road in Cheshire to identify where measures may be required to address safety problems either at specific locations or on the road as a whole. Secondly, a review of all villages on the Cheshire trunk roads to identify and place in order of priority, any locations that would benefit from new or improved traffic calming measures. We expect to have the results of both studies shortly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A51 provides a direct link for traffic travelling between the M6 and Chester, North Wales and Merseyside. A number of residents have suggested that Heavy Goods Vehicles should be signed to use the longer route provided by the M6, M56 and M53 rather than using the A51. We have considered this carefully but have no plans to change the existing signing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A51/A500 Chester to the M6 is one of the trunk routes identified as non-core and one which would be more appropriately managed by the local highway authority. Responsibility for non-core roads is to be transferred to local highway authorities by means of detrunking. I understand that the Government will be announcing a final decision on the split of the network into core and non-core routes as soon as possible.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the A51/A500 is confirmed as a non-core route to be detrunked, then from 1 April 2000 the Agency will only initiate further improvements that we consider necessary to keep the route in a safe and serviceable condition. It will be for the local highway authority, in this case Cheshire County Council, to consider the need for other improvements in the context of their Local Transport Plan. Provisional plans covering the period 2000/01--2004/05 are to be submitted by the end of July.</FONT></UL>

 My Department commissions research at the University of East Anglia to analyse air samples from the archive at Cape Grim in Tasmania. They have made the first measurements of the atmospheric concentration of halon 1202 anywhere in the world. Although the concentration of halon 1202 is currently very low (0.05 parts per trillion), it is growing very rapidly, some 17 per cent. per year in 1998. We also commission routine measurements of the background concentrations of halons at Mace Head in the Republic of Ireland as part of the International Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. Halon 1202 concentrations are currently below the limit of detectability of the instrumentation in place but instrument development is taking place to cover this substance.

 China, together with other developing countries, is committed under the Montreal Protocol to phasing out the production and consumption of halons by 2010. Assistance is available for developing countries under the Protocol's Multilateral Fund to meet their commitments. To this end, US$ 62 million has been provided from the Fund to enable China to phase out halon production, as a result of which China has given a commitment to stop production of halon 1211 by 2006, four years earlier than required under the Protocol. The United Kingdom currently contributes in the region of &#163;6.5 million per year to the Multilateral Fund.

<a name="90323w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Local authorities already have a statutory duty to consult businesses. The proposals in the White Paper, in respect of local authorities' responsibility to listen to their communities, require authorities to make such consultation arrangements effective. The partnership arrangements between business and local authorities needed for the localisation scheme will be based on these effective consultation arrangements. In addition, local authorities will be given the maximum flexibility to agree both suitable partnership arrangements for their areas, and the methods for securing the endorsement of these arrangements by business. The additional costs arising from the localisation scheme are expected to be small, but we will discuss with the Local Government Association any concerns it may have. A consultation paper is to be issued shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The Director General of Water Services is currently preparing guidelines on the application of the Competition Act 1998 to the water industry to be published later this year. I understand that he is considering, but has yet to determine, what increase in staff might be required in respect of his new responsibilities. The Office of Water Services (Ofwat) is a member of the Concurrency Working Party (CWP), comprising representatives from the Office of Fair Trading and those regulators having concurrent functions, which is working to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the application of the 1998 Act. Guidelines on the application and enforcement of the Act have been prepared by the CWP and issued by the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT). In February, the Department of Trade and Industry issued a consultation document "Concurrency: consultation on the possible need and scope for regulations" on the Secretary of State's powers to make regulations for the purpose of co-ordinating the functions exercisable by the DGFT and the regulators.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Government plans to take to assist pensioners with the payment of water charges, with particular reference to those who cannot have water meters installed for technical reasons.  [77695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w10.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under proposals in the Water Industry Bill, currently before Parliament, household water customers would have a new entitlement to be charged on a measured basis without paying any initial costs for the installation of a meter. Customers using water only for basic domestic purposes who opted for a measured basis of charging and found that this did not suit their needs would have the opportunity within the first 12 months to revert to unmeasured charging. These proposals will benefit households using little water including many pensioners.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para1">In a small minority of cases it may not be possible to fit a meter because it would be not reasonably practicable or would involve unreasonable expense to do so. In such cases the Government would expect a water company to make an alternative charging arrangement for customers who asked to pay on a measured basis.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para2">The Government propose to consult later this year on what guidance should be issued and regulations made governing the provisions of companies' charges schemes.

The study programme reflects regional priorities and will feed into the development of regional transport strategies as part of regional planning guidance. I am pleased that the responses we have received are generally in favour of our approach and, in particular, our determination to examine the contribution that all modes can make to the problems of congestion, environment and safety within the study areas.

<a name="90323w10.htm_para4">The studies are divided into two categories--full multi-modal studies which will be taken forward by the Government Offices for the Regions in consultation with regional partners, and roads based studies which, although they will take account of the contributions which can be made by other modes, are primarily directed at specific points on individual roads, and which will be led by the Highways Agency.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para5">Work on most of the studies in Tranche 1 will begin this spring, with all of them commencing by the autumn. The length of time it will take to complete each study will vary depending on the complexity of the issues, but we expect that they will take, on average, 2 years to complete. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1999 : Column: 160</I><P>
As a first step, steering groups will be established, chaired by the Government Offices and to include representatives from the Regional Planning Bodies, and other regional partners, to finalise the terms of reference for each study and the timescale for delivery. Tranche 2 studies need not wait for tranche 1 studies to be completed, and we expect to begin work on these in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para6">The multi-modal studies are not a one off exercise. As we described in the recently published draft planning policy guidance note II (PPGII) "Regional Planning", multi-modal studies of transport problems will be one of the major inputs to the development of Regional Transport Strategies. Therefore in the future we expect Regional Planning Bodies, rather than central Government, to commission and lead their own multi-modal studies. From some of the additional studies proposed by the Regional Planning Bodies, we have identified a provisional third tranche of studies which could be taken forward in this way. The case for a study of the A1 North of Newcastle will depend on the outcome of the current Highways Agency route management study.

<a name="90323w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have today published for public consultation a new version of Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing (PPG3). This is another major step in delivering our commitment to revitalise our towns and cities and to protect our countryside from unnecessary development. Our aim is to achieve nothing less than an urban renaissance. Copies of the new PPG3 have been placed in the Library and are available in the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para7">The guidance emphasises the importance of making the best use of previously developed urban land and existing buildings in order to achieve our 60 per cent. land recycling target. This will minimise the use of green-field sites, encourage urban regeneration and help create more sustainable patterns of development. Local planning authorities are also advised to provide a greater choice of housing to meet the nation's changing housing needs, and to promote mixed development.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para8">We propose to introduce a sequential approach to the choice of sites. Local planning authorities will be required to consider using previously developed land and buildings before releasing green-field sites for development.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para9">Local planning authorities are also required to consider the capacity of the urban area to accommodate additional development. The guidance proposes the use of higher densities, reduced car parking and the release for housing of excess land held for other types of development. The Government are also looking for an improved quality of development and are therefore looking for improved urban design, better layouts and wider choice of sizes and types of housing. They advise developers and local 



<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1999 : Column: 161</I><P>
authorities to place the needs of people before cars in designing the layout of residential developments. Creating a more attractive residential environment must be a central aim for new development.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para10">The Government recognise that not all additional housing development can be accommodated on previously developed sites. The next most sustainable option is to develop urban extensions, making use of existing infrastructure and public transport links.
<P>

<a name="90323w10.htm_para11">The new draft PPG3 represents a major departure in content and style from the previous planning guidance and is an essential toolkit for planning for housing in the new Millennium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I have invited members of Justice to meet me so that they can put directly to me their views on the present legal structures relating to police surveillance and how they believe it is affected by the European Convention on Human Rights. Their views will form part of the consideration which is currently being given to whether further changes are needed to the existing framework of controls.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate by how much the Lancet Inquiry will increase the precept for policing payable by residents of Cleveland in the next year; on what calculation this is based; and if he will make a statement.  [77270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I understand from the Chief Constable that the Cleveland Police Authority has set a budget for 1999-2000 of &#163;83.3 million which is an increase of 3.6 per cent. over 1998-99. This will mean an increase in the police precept on the council tax of 29.2 per cent. or &#163;14 per year in 1999-2000 for Band D properties.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para0">I understand that the increase in the precept for 1999-2000 is not as a result of Operation Lancer but is required to maintain an acceptable number of police officers and to meet other unavoidable expenditure for police pay increases and pensions.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para1">It is a matter for the Chief Constable to determine how to use the resources available. The Cleveland Constabulary achieved significant savings in 1998-99 of &#163;2.7 million. This has made it possible for the force to absorb the costs of Operation Lancet within existing resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the cost of the Lancet Inquiry into alleged corruption in the Cleveland police force; and if he will make a statement.  [77269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I understand from Cleveland Constabulary that the estimated cost of Operation Lancet up to 31 March 1999 is &#163;1.24 million.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para2">The major part of the inquiry is being undertaken by officers from the Cleveland force, for whom provision has already been made in the budget. The costs arising from the involvement of the Northamptonshire Officers and Mr. Timpson, the Chief Constable of Warwickshire Constabulary who is in charge of the investigation, have also been found from within the Cleveland budget.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_wqn3"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he expects that Inspector Ray Mallon of the Cleveland Police will cease being suspended; and if he will make a statement.  [77266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Matters involving the suspension of police officers are governed by The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985. An officer may be suspended from the force by his chief officer where it appears that he may have committed a disciplinary offence. Unless the chief officer decides otherwise, the suspension will continue until either it is decided not to bring disciplinary charges or the case has been resolved.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para3">This is entirely a matter for the Chief Officer concerned--in this instance the Chief Constable of Cleveland Constabulary. It would be wrong of me to comment on this matter whilst the investigation is underway.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_wqn4"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on progress of the Lancet Inquiry into alleged police corruption in Cleveland; when he expects completion of its work; and if he will make a statement.  [77268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 This is a wide-ranging inquiry and is one of the largest supervised by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA). There has been close consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) throughout. A major file on drugs-related issues was delivered to the CPS on 4 December 1998 and is now with Treasury Counsel. I understand that a number of possible criminal and disciplinary matters are still being addressed and eight officers remained suspended from duty.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para4">The length of the investigation is a matter for the investigation officer and the PCA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w12.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Payment offers have been made on all but around 420 claims which cannot yet be fully processed, mainly because the required evidence of value of the surrendered guns and ancillary equipment has not yet been provided. This represents less than 1 per cent. of the claims received. There are around 6,000 outstanding

offers of payment awaiting a response from the claimant before a final payment can be made. The bulk of these should be cleared within the next few days.

 The Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Constabulary has taken steps to establish whether there is any basis for an inquiry into whether the release of the name of a person who declined to assist with inquiries. I am assured that should any member of his staff be shown to have been involved in leaking information to the media about the raid on a Northampton Thai massage parlour they will be severely dealt with.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para5">At the moment there is no evidence to suggest that this leak did come from within his force but, should this position change, the Chief Constable will immediately instigate an inquiry and do everything possible to find out who is responsible.

 The Home Office has a strong working relationship with the Arson Prevention Bureau. Graham Meldrum, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Fire Services and I gave keynote addresses at two if its important events last year and officials are in regular contact with the Bureau to discuss its programme of activities. In addition, a Home Office official has been loaned to the Bureau since December 1996. The first year of that posting (December 1996-November 1997) was funded in full by the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="90323w12.htm_para6">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced earlier this month his intention to publish shortly the outcome of a Home Office study which has reviewed current arrangements for combating arson. We expect to continue to work closely with the Arson Prevention Bureau to take that initiative forward.

 The provisions relating to interception of communications in the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the member states of the European Union are currently under negotiation. The United Kingdom is negotiating on the basis that the Convention should apply to criminal investigations carried out by the Police Service and Her Majesty's Customs, and not to the operations of our security and intelligence agencies. We are also keen to ensure that the Convention does not impose unnecessary burdens on the operations of the United Kingdom's law enforcement agencies.

<a name="90323w13.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> There is no Government-wide policy not to fund charities' core activities. During 1999, the Home Office will lead the preparation of a code of good practice on funding, to underpin the recent Compact with the voluntary sector. The code will be a vehicle for developing a cross- departmental approach to strategic funding. In the case of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS), funding was formally reviewed in 1997. One of the review's conclusions was that, as a national exemplar for the involvement of volunteers, WRVS supported Home Office objectives and should continue to receive strategic funding.

 Information on the number of homes for the elderly in England, for the period 1985 to 1997 and in Devon, for the period 1987 to 1997, is given in the table. It is not possible to provide a consistent series for earlier years or by region because of changes in regional boundaries and changes in the methods of data collection.

 The Department for International Development's (DFID) aim is to help poor people in developing countries gain long-term benefits from their trees, while also helping secure the global environmental benefits that forests offer. Our approach to the problem of deforestation is to support work to improve the sustainable management of forest resources in ways that lead to a range of benefits to poor communities. For the world's poor, trees and forests are a vital part of everyday survival: forests give 2,000 million people fuel to cook with; in the tropics, forests meet a large part of the needs of several hundred million people from wood products and food to medicine and income; trees increase poor farmers' security as they smooth out seasonal flows of produce and provide a reserve of capital for emergencies; forests help agriculture and fisheries by recycling nutrients, stabilising soil and influencing local and global climate; and in 18 African countries, forests represent over 10 per cent. of GDP.
<P>

<a name="90323w16.htm_para7">The Department's approach towards forestry is explained in the recent publication "Forests Matter" and our activities are set out in the pamphlet "Forest Sector Projects", which is being revised and will be placed in the Library of the House in due course. DFID is currently working on over 150 projects with partners in 34 countries.
<P>

<a name="90323w16.htm_para8">We are directly assisting the Government of Indonesia and the people living in the forests to develop better ways of managing the forest resource sustainably. We have helped pilot approaches at provincial level that give poor people more of a say in forest management. We are now exploring with international agencies and representatives of forest users possible changes to forest sector policy. Our aim is to ensure that degradation of the forests is reversed and that poor people who live in and around the forests derive more benefits from the way they are managed. This will give wildlife dependent on the forest, including orang-utans, a better chance of survival.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) officials have frequently discussed the loss of biodiversity among traditional crop varieties of Third World farmers with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Our objective is to ensure that this important issue is taken fully into account in all relevant aspects of the UK's international policies. In particular we, along with these departments, actively contribute to the UK participation in meetings under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention's multi-year work programme on agriculture biodiversity specifically recognises and seeks to support the significant contribution that traditional farming communities have made to the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity and the importance of traditional varieties.
<P>

<a name="90323w17.htm_para1">Our officials are also actively involved in the UK participation at the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources which oversees the implementation of the Global Plan of Action on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The Global Plan of Action includes measures to halt the loss of biodiversity among traditional crop varieties in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="90323w17.htm_para2">We will be actively concerned to ensure that the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in developing countries is taken fully into account in relevant negotiations under the WTO and within the EU.

of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR) to ensure that developing country interests in the effects of biotechnology are properly accounted for in World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations. In addition we are working with international agencies to build the capacity of developing countries to represent their own interests in the WTO.
<P>

<a name="90323w17.htm_para3">All WTO members have an opportunity in the preparatory process for a new round of trade negotiations to set out any concerns they may have regarding existing WTO agreements. We will be working to ensure that specific points are taken forward appropriately.

<a name="90323w17.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) officials have had a number of discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) concerning the effect of genetically modified crops, including the so-called terminator gene technology, on the agriculture of developing countries, in particular through DFID's membership of the Interdepartmental Group on Genetic Modification Technology (IGGMOT).
<P>

<a name="90323w17.htm_para4">Officials also actively supported the UK contribution to debate on the issue of terminator gene technology at the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Biodiversity Convention in May 1998, which urged Parties to consider a precautionary approach and undertook, through its technical subsidiary body, to examine the consequences of this technology and to elaborate scientifically based advice.
<P>

<a name="90323w17.htm_para5">We will shortly be publishing a statement on DFID policy towards Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and developing countries, reflecting the precautionary approach and outlining the action we intend to take, in consultation with other Government Departments, on this issue in the future. DFID will also continue to work with DETR and other Government Departments successfully to conclude the negotiation of a Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which would lay down international rules and procedures covering the transboundary movement of GMOs and help build the capacity of developing countries in related safety issues.

 The reading age of pupils is not collected centrally. The typical eleven year old is expected to achieve level four in the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum assessment tests. In the 1998 Reading test, 71 per cent. of pupils achieved level four, or above. This compares with 68 per cent. of pupils in 1997, the earliest year in which the reading test results were available.

 For 1998-99, local education authorities submitted bids totalling &#163;65.135 million and received &#163;21.32 million in grants. For 1999-2000, there was no bidding process and authorities' revenue needs were established in the context of discussions of their implementation plans. We have recently announced grants to local education authorities of &#163;71.882 million in total for 1999-2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) how much money has been allocated to provide free Bug-buster courses for small and medium-sized enterprises;  [75255]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many small and medium-sized enterprises have completed Bug-buster training courses;  [75256]
<P>
(3) how many accredited training providers are offering Bug-buster courses funded by his Department to small and medium-sized enterprises;  [75257]
<P>
(4) what plans he has for the future funding of the free delivery of Bug-buster courses for small and medium- sized enterprises.  [75258]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w18.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 &#163;26 million was allocated to provide Bug-buster training courses. As at 5 March, 24,774 people had started training, 22,376 of these had completed, and a further 9,474 had booked places. There are 180 accredited providers offering training under the scheme.
<P>

<a name="90323w18.htm_para0">When the free programme ends, training will continue to be available at commercial prices. The average cost per business of a two day Bug-buster course will come to about &#163;750 per trainee, which is a sound investment compared to the potential financial damage posed by the Millennium Bug.
<P>

<a name="90323w18.htm_para1">The Government have made a significant investment in developing the courses, establishing the accreditation process and quality assuring the training, and this will continue. Small and medium-sized enterprises can also get help and advice on Year 2000 issues from their local Business Link.

<a name="90323w18.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 To date, around 3,000 individual learning accounts have been opened, through 15 development projects led by TECs. The DfEE contributed &#163;816,000 to these projects; this funding was used to test out a range of processes, systems and marketing approaches to help inform the final framework. The National Framework will be launched in 2000, from which time Individual Learning Accounts will be widely available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to limit the amounts <i>(a)</i> individuals and their families and <i>(b)</i> employers can invest in individual learning accounts free of tax; and if he will make a statement.  [77884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w18.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 There are no plans to limit the amount an individual and/or their family can contribute to the individual's individual learning account (ILA), although the incentives will be available only on the first &#163;500 spent on eligible courses in any one year.
<P>

<a name="90323w18.htm_para2">There are no plans to limit the tax-free contributions that employers can invest in their employees' ILAs provided that the employers contribute to the ILAs of their lowest paid employees on similar terms and the contribution can only be used to pay for eligible learning.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w18.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment which financial institution will handle individual learning accounts; and what will be the administration fee for each separate account.  [77883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w18.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 The national framework for individual learning accounts is still under development. It will be ready for launch in April 2000. We hope that a range of financial institutions will be involved in the provision of accounts. At this stage it is too early to say which financial institutions will be involved or how administration arrangements will work--currently our discussions are commercial in confidence. We plan to publish detailed arrangements for the national framework later this year.

[77122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w18.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B>

 The dangers of smoking form a vital part of education about drugs.

This is 1.1 per cent. of the &#163;627 million of expenditure being supported in total through the Standards Fund programme this year, which includes a range of grants that reflect the Government's central priority of raising standards in our schools, as set out in the "Excellence in Schools" White Paper.

I should point out that the contact letter sent to lone parents under the New Deal for Lone Parents is not a request for them to attend an interview. Participation is voluntary and lone parents may choose to get in touch with a New Deal Personal Adviser when it suits their circumstances. The letter aims to make lone parents aware of the New Deal and to encourage them to contact an adviser if they want support in returning to work.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list those measures in the Budget which will assist the United Kingdom in conforming to his five economic tests for joining EMU.  [77895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w21.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government have said that the UK economy needs a period of economic stability in order to demonstrate settled and sustainable convergence. The Budget reinforces economic stability by keeping the public finances under control, while allowing fiscal policy to support the economy in the next phase of the cycle. The measures contained in the Budget to raise productivity and increase employment opportunities for all will also improve the flexibility of the UK economy to adapt to economic change. These measures are in the national economic interest. Preparations should be made in this Parliament so that, should the economic tests be met, a decision to join a successful single currency can be made early in the next Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w21.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1999]:</i> The impact on employment would depend on why wages increased, and how employers, employees and others in the labour force responded to the increase in wages. For example, an increase in wages reflecting higher productivity need not have any effect on employment.

<P>
<a name="90323w21.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Tax Law Rewrite project continues to make very good progress. The Inland Revenue will be publishing on 30 March the project's fourth Exposure Draft, which contains draft clauses on the trading income of individuals. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House on that day.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1999 : Column: 207</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90323w21.htm_para0">This latest publication includes rewritten legislation covering the rules for calculating the profits of a trade, the basis period rules and the rules on farming. I would strongly encourage anyone with an interest in these areas to participate fully in the consultation process, which is key to the success of the project.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the estimated additional yield from the increase in fuel oil duty in the Budget for <i>(a)</i> 1999-2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2000-01.  [77457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w21.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise estimate the additional yield, compared to an indexed base, from the increase in fuel oil duty to be &#163;15 million in 1999-2000 and &#163;25 million in 2000-01.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) by what date he has asked Lord Alexander to produce his report on the taxation of shipping; and if that report will be published;  [76845]
<P>
<UL>(2) what terms of reference he has set for Lord Alexander's review of shipping taxation;  [76844]

(3) when Lord Alexander has been asked to complete his review of shipping taxation;  [76912]

(4) if the review of shipping taxation by Lord Alexander will consider matters relating to <i>(a)</i> social security contributions, <i>(b)</i> income tax contributions and <i>(c)</i> linkages to training;  [76913]
<P>
(5) what assistance will be provided to Lord Alexander by the Government during his review of shipping taxation; and if officials from the Inland Revenue will assist Lord Alexander during the review;  [76846]
<P>
(6) if the review of shipping taxation by Lord Alexander has considered taxation regimes other than the proposed tonnage tax;  [77087]

 <i>[holding answers 15 and 16 March 1999]:</i> The scope of the inquiry is set out in the terms of reference, which are:

<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is his assessment of the effects on United Kingdom employment of the change in the value of the <i>(a)</i> Deutschmark and <i>(b)</i> euro relative to the pound sterling since 1 May 1997.  [77590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The effects of exchange rate changes cannot be reliably isolated from the other influences on UK employment. Since the second quarter of 1997 total employment is estimated to have increased by 503,000 to stand at its highest ever recorded level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will change inspection charges for abattoirs from hourly rates to charges based on throughput-headage payments.  [66159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Although harmonised EU rules lay down standard charges for hygiene inspections in slaughterhouses and cutting plants, the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) is required under Treasury rules to recover 



<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1999 : Column: 210</I><P>
the full costs of the services it provides to its customers, be they fresh meat premises or the Government. As the major part of the MHS costs are the time costs arising from the deployment of MHS inspection staff in fresh meat premises, MHS charges are set on a 'per hour' basis since this basis accurately reflects the real costs of providing the inspection service in individual abattoirs and cutting plants. It also encourages operators of such businesses to plan and execute their operations efficiently. In those small premises with only low throughputs of animals or meat, the average inspection charge per animal or tonne of meat will inevitably be higher than in those high throughput premises which are operated efficiently since the latter will inevitably benefit from economies of scale. Any alternative charging system, based solely on throughput of animals or meat, would simply result in large abattoirs or cutting plants having to subsidise the small businesses. The EU Charges Directive precludes Member State Governments from subsidising hygiene inspection costs.
<P>

<a name="90323w22.htm_para0">In relation to charges for the enforcement of specified risk material controls, we have already acknowledged that charges based on throughput rather than an hourly rate could bring benefits to small low-throughput abattoirs and announced that officials have been asked to consider the feasibility of altering the basis of these charges. However any such change would require amendments to the legislation recently laid before Parliament to enable these charges to be levied.

 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> Although translator enhancers are found widely in nature, they have not been added as part of the modification for the only GM food under consideration in the EU which has been recommended for approval by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (genetically modified (GM) tomato products). In the case of GM green-hearted and radicchio rosso chicory, the only other pending applications which have been considered by the ACNFP, the committee did not recommend approval because, among other reasons, the molecular data were incomplete. Copies of the ACNFP's advice on both products is available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> All genetically modified (GM) foods are subject to a full and rigorous safety assessment to ensure that they are as safe as their non-GM counterpart before approval. Whilst it is a criminal offence under the Food Safety Act 1990 to sell any food which is injurious to health or unfit for human consumption, insurance arrangements are a matter for individual companies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to require genetically-modified food manufacturers to demonstrate clinical efficacy through clinical trials before being permitted to make claims regarding the alleged health advantages of such foods; and if he will make a statement.  [76510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> Clinical efficacy forms part of the assessment procedure for all new drugs and therefore applies to any substances, including those which have the appearance of foods, where medicinal claims are made, that is that they will prevent, treat or cure a human disease. Any GM foods, where such claims are not being made (which includes all those currently on the market), are subject to different, but equally strict, safety assessment criteria based on establishing that they do not present a danger to the public; as well as the requirements that the public are not misled in any way about them; and that they do not disadvantage the public in terms of their nutritional content.
<P>

<a name="90323w22.htm_para2">Claims that foods may have beneficial health (but not medicinal) effects may be made so long as they are accurate and do not mislead consumers. A voluntary Code of Practice for validation of all health claims relating to food is being developed by a joint body comprising representatives from consumer groups, food law enforcement authorities and industry.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> None. Recent press reports that the Worcester Trading Standards Department had detected a non-approved genetically (GM) soya ingredient related to a sample of material that entered the country before May 1997, the composition of which could not be verified analytically. There is therefore no evidence that non-approved GM material is entering the food supply. In 1997, the only GM soya grown commercially in the USA was Monsanto's Round-up Ready soya. This is the approved soya currently being used in food in the UK.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Donoughue, had in his possession the questions which he was going to be asked by the European Scrutiny Committee on Wednesday 10 February before the meeting took place.  [75718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w22.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee sitting held on 10 February posed a wide range of questions. The Parliamentary Secretary was aware at a briefing session two days before the meeting what were the main policy areas which would attract questions from the Committee. However, he did not know many of the questions that were to be raised.
<P>

<a name="90323w22.htm_para3">Having some knowledge in advance of the Committee's main questions helped the Parliamentary Secretary to reply promptly and in as informative a way as possible, for the benefit of the Committee. It is helpful to the Committee. It can avoid the need for copious follow up correspondence. It is not expected by, nor necessary to, Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90323w22.htm_para4">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Secretary informs me he did not know at the time of the particular contacts between officials of the Scrutiny Committee and of MAFF: he did not ask for nor initiate them and played no part in the preparation of his brief. This contact was initiated by officials of the Scrutiny Committee. It is a common, though not universal, practice which also obtained under previous Administrations.

<P>
<a name="90323w24.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> The provisional agreement by the EU Agriculture Council on 11 March to the Agenda 2000 CAP reform package will result in a 15% reduction in support prices for butter and skimmed milk powder, over a period of three years beginning in 2003. As a consequence, the aggregate value of UK milk consumption, measured at farmgate prices, is estimated to fall by some &#163;400 million a year by the end of the period. This will mean that consumers will benefit from lower retail prices for milk and dairy products than would otherwise obtain. If all the savings are passed to consumers, the effect will be approximately equivalent to 4% of the retail price of a pint of liquid milk, and 8% of the retail price of butter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w24.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> The farmgate price of milk accounted for 38.1 per cent. of the retail price in January 1997, 32.7 per cent. in January 1998 and 32.1 per cent. in January 1999. The percentages in January 1998 and 1999 are much the same as in the early 1990s. The real price spread--the difference between the retail price and the farmgate price adjusted for inflation--fell by 2 per cent. between January 1997 and January 1999.

However it is estimated that the total value of UK exports of live lambs and sheep was &#163;84m in 1997 and &#163;71m in 1998. these figures include exports from Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic. The value of exports from Great Britain to all other destinations is estimated to have been &#163;23m in 1997 and &#163;26m in 1998, of which approximately 90% went for further fattening and the remainder for slaughter.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> European Commission Decision 98/692/EC, which governs the Data-based Export Scheme (DBES), requires that the only cattle DBES abattoirs may slaughter are those that are eligible for the scheme. However, DBES abattoirs may slaughter sheep and pigs, to which the DBES controls would not apply.

<a name="90323w25.htm_para0">The Rural Development Commission (RDC), which is the Government Agency responsible for promoting economic and social development in rural England, can provide redundant building grants in priority Rural Development Areas, including parts of Lancashire. These grants can help owners to renovate and bring back into productive use, buildings which are lying idle and semi-derelict, or which are becoming redundant for their current use. The buildings must be used for business purposes once renovation works are complete, with the aim of providing new job opportunities, or protecting existing jobs. As from 1 April these grants will be available from the new Regional Development Agencies.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The agreement reached by EU Agriculture Ministers on 11 March delayed cutting milk support prices until 2003 as a means of reducing the overall costs of the Agenda 2000 reform package. Consequently, the introduction of direct payments and general increases in milk quota will also be delayed until 2003. However, some specific increases in milk quota, including an increase for Northern Ireland, will be introduced in 2000-01 and 2001-02.

<P>
<a name="90323w25.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The size of the United Kingdom milk and milk products industry is constrained by milk quotas. In the period up to 2006 the output of the UK milk and milk products industry can be expected to increase in line with the increases in the UK milk quota agreed as part of the Agenda 2000 reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. In the longer term, the size of the UK milk and milk products industry will depend on the decisions of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers as to the shape of the EU dairy regime beyond 2006.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the likely impact on the United Kingdom milk and milk products industry of the proposed enlargement of the European Union.  [78197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90323w25.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Enlargement would afford the United Kingdom milk and milk products industry unrestricted access to the markets of those countries which accede to the European Union. Equally, as part of the single market, the milk processing industries of the acceding countries would have access to the markets of the existing EU member states.

<P>
<a name="90323w26.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 In accordance with the Government's policy on periodic reviews of executive agencies, Agricultural Ministers have agreed that the Intervention Board should commence a thorough evaluation of Agency status in March and produce a report in July 1999. In the light of ongoing issues such as devolution and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the reconsideration of the prior options element of the review has been deferred until March 2001.
<P>

<a name="90323w26.htm_para0">In order to ensure that all matters are considered fully, comments regarding the performance of the Intervention Board since April 1993, which should be provided by 30 April 1999, would be welcomed from interested parties.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 1999]:</i> The package of measures provisionally agreed in Brussels recently represented a good deal for UK farmers, especially those from the hills.

<a name="90323w26.htm_para6">In addition, beef and sheep farmers are likely to benefit from compulsory compensation as a result of the effects of the introduction of the euro on direct payments. We hope to announce details of this shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what access the Review of the Public Analyst Arrangements in England and Wales had to information about the sampling and analysis of food samples held by local authorities; and what restrictions were placed on the publication of that information.

 The Public Analyst Review Team sought information through submissions from interested parties, including local authorities and public analysts, and the Review Team visited a number of authorities and sought information from them directly during those visits. Some of the information relating to their enforcement activities was given in confidence. The Review Report and any non-confidential information gathered has been placed in the Library of the House.
