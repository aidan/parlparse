there is not widespread abuse of export controls is based on their
assessment of the export control breaches either detected at the
frontier or referred or disclosed to them and their evaluation of the
intelligence and other information available to them. HMRC does not
have a precisely defined numerical threshold for widespread abuse. They
regard as abuse those cases where there is evidence of a deliberate
breach involving destinations of concern or particularly sensitive
goods.</p><p><a name="06101762000031">HMRC&#146;s

out their own local exercises that will include elements of risk

(TPIAG) fourth annual report&#151;published in September
2006&#151;included six recommendations, none of which called on
Government to introduce compulsory lessons in schools on
abortion.</p><p><a name="06101775000236">In her
foreword, however, the TPIAG Chair&#151;Gill Frances&#151;did argue
that pregnant young women and their partners should have access to
impartial, evidence-based information on the options open to them,
including abortion, to help inform the decision about whether or not to
continue with the pregnancy. This is a view with which the Government
concurs. TPIAG report that many myths prevail, including the fact that
abortion may lead to infertility, which they are concerned may be a
contributory factor to repeat
abortions.</p><p><a name="06101775000237">The TPIAG
Chair also argues that school-based Sex and Relationship Education
(SRE) programmes should provide opportunities to convey factual
information about abortion. The Government expect all schools to offer
comprehensive SRE programmes, in line with its SRE guidance to schools,
issued in 2000. Schools are also encouraged to evaluate their SRE
programmes against the QCA&#146;s end of key stage statements, issued
in November
2005.</p><p><a name="06101775000238">Ministers in the
Department for Education and Skills have received a small amount of
correspondence from members of the public concerned about press
reports, which wrongly said that TPIAG had called for schools to
&#145;promote the benefits&#146; of abortion. This was not the
case.</p><p><a name="06101775000239">The TPIAG

includes a challenging PSA target to halve the under-18 conception rate
by 2010 (compared to the 1998 baseline rate). We envisage that we will
continue to need a small team of policy officials within DfES (the
Teenage Pregnancy Unit currently has seven members of staff) to drive
forward the Strategy. Broad estimates calculate that every pound spent

Some of these calls would have been answered, and others would have

the last 3 years as management information systems have
improved. 4. &#145;Calls for which outcome recorded&#146;
are those which were received and for which there is management
information to track the eventual outcome. 5. Other
ineffective calls are those that result in a ring tone but no reply,
fail due to network technical problems, or are answered by a BT message
but do not connect to the CSA system. 6. IVR denotes the
automated touch tone part of the process where clients enter their
details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have cleared this part
of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by a CSA
person. 7. The percentage of calls abandoned in the queue
refers to the percentage of total calls received, for which the outcome
is recorded, that were abandoned once in a queue to be answered by a
CSA person. 8. The percentage of calls answered that were
available to CSA people to answer refers to calls answered as a
proportion of those that were connected to the queue for an agent (post
IVR where appropriate). 9. Numbers are rounded to the nearest

the financial support provided to households through cash benefits are
based on the ONS analyses &#147;The effects of taxes and benefits on
household income&#148; which is published annually. The latest
analysis for 2004-05 was published on the National Statistics website
on 12 May 2006 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The
analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which
is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.
The income decile groups used in this analysis are based on a ranking
of households by equivalised disposable income&#151;a widely used
proxy for standard of
living.</p></ul><a name="61017w0014.htmbrev_295"><a name="06101810000486"><ul><p class="tabletext">The table
below shows the average receipts of cash benefits by households in the
bottom income decile. Figures have been provided back to 1987, the
earliest year for which comparable figures are available. They are
based on the figures which have appeared annually in the taxes and
benefits analysis, but have been adjusted to 2004-05 prices using the
all items retail prices index. Receipts of cash benefits have also been
shown as a percentage of average gross household income for households
in the bottom income
decile.</p></ul><a name="61017w0014.htmbrev_296"><a name="06101810000487"><ul><p class="tabletext">There has been
some cyclical variation in receipts of cash benefits by this group of
households, although there is no clear long term trend. However cash
benefits constitute a declining proportion of gross income for these
households. This is because of trend increases in real incomes from
other sources such as wages and salaries and occupational
pensions.</p></ul><a name="61017w0014.htmbrev_297"><a name="06101810000488"><ul><p class="tabletext">Cash
benefits include contributory benefits such as the state retirement
pension, and incapacity benefit, as well as non-contributory benefits
such as income support, child benefit, housing benefit, and disability
living allowance. Tax credits are only partially included since for
households paying some income tax, the tax credits are initially
treated as negative tax, rather than a benefit. Only after the tax
credit has eliminated any income tax liability, is any further tax
credit receipt treated as a
benefit.</p></ul><a name="61017w0014.htmbrev_298"><a name="06101810000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">It should be
remembered that these results are based on a sample survey and so there
is some uncertainty surrounding the estimates for any one year. The
bottom income decile is likely to contain some households who have low
income but high wealth, and so can sustain a standard of living higher
than that which would be suggested by their income
alone.</p></ul><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i> Average

permits to move from one area to another are increasingly difficult to

restrictions can be by age (usually 15 to 32-year-old males), by gender

to be responsible for the majority of recent rebel attacks. We are
