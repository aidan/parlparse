<a name="40401w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many civil servants have been employed in the Wales Office in each year since 1999 in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;London and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Cardiff.  [160935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 The actual number of civil servants in the Wales Office and the split between London and Cardiff could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The table as follows shows the staffing complement in each year, since the Wales Office came into being on 1&nbsp;July 1999. This differs from the outturn figures given in the Wales Office annual Departmental Reports as it takes no account of vacancies during the year.

 Because the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has overall policy lead for fire safety and arson reduction among government departments, it is ODPM rather than this Department that compiles statistics on fires in schools.
<P>

<a name="40401w01.html_para1">The latest figures we have from ODPM cover the years 1997&#150;2001. They show that, on average, the annual economic costs of arson damage to schools amounted to &#163;42&nbsp;million. The numbers of school fires started deliberately did not increase steadily over that period, but fluctuated around the average of 972 per year.

<a name="40401w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Data on bullying is not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools to tackle the problem. Our guidance pack 'Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence' and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We have also recently launched our anti-bullying Charter which I hope schools will sign and use. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. We are also currently running a series of England-wide regional anti-bullying conferences for schools and other partners to share good practice.

Pupils learn about the work of the courts, parliament and the government in making and shaping the law. It is up to schools to arrange the allocation of time for subjects and specific elements within them. The QCA has sent detailed guidance on citizenship to all schools, which includes specific units on how to plan and cover the justice system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w04.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 No. The Common Agricultural Policy is an integral part of the European Union's internal market. It would be bizarre to consider withdrawal at the point when we are achieving the reforms for which the UK has long argued. The changes will deliver a more rational CAP and we played a leading role in securing radical reforms last June. The reforms reflect our own goals for sustainable farming and will deliver better value for money to taxpayers and consumers, provide opportunities to boost farm incomes, bring benefits to the wider rural community, reduce damage to the environment and improve animal welfare.
<P>

<a name="40401w04.html_para4">As a result the reforms will bring benefits across the EU and to agricultural trade and development worldwide. The UK played a leading role in securing these reforms and we will continue to work within the EU for a more sustainable CAP.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w04.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Hare coursing as such is not illegal at present. 'Illegal hare coursing' takes place when other offences are associated with the activity, the most common offence being that of trespass. Since it is not a defined activity, separate studies of the economic effect of 'illegal hare coursing' would not be appropriate. Nor is further legislation focused on 'illegal hare coursing' likely to reduce its scale. Enforcement requires effective police intelligence and the active support of people living in affected areas to obtain evidence of offences being committed. However, the Government considers all forms of hare coursing to be undesirable because it involves unnecessary suffering. Last session's Hunting Bill would therefore have made all hare coursing events illegal. Evidence of this offence would be easier to obtain and this would help enforcement.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the commitment of EU development assistance to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Baltic, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cross-border and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;regional co-operation in 2002.  [163859]<P>

 EU assistance to the Baltic States is largely provided through the PHARE programme (PHARE stands for Poland and Hungary Assistance with Reconstruction, although the programme expanded to cover other countries). The objective of PHARE is to help candidate countries <sup>1</sup>  preparations to accede to the European Union. This consists of technical assistance with the implementation of European legislation, and the building of institutional capacity. The Baltic States are also eligible for assistance under the ISPA programme (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession: to help candidate countries to 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1560W</I><P>
meet environmental standards) and the SAPARD programme (Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development: to help candidate countries deal with the problems of the structural adjustment in their agricultural sectors and rural areas, as well as in the implementation of legislation concerning the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) and related issues). The total planned allocation to the Baltic States under these three programmes was approximately Euros323&nbsp;million in 2002.
<P>

<a name="40401w05.html_para10">In addition the Tacis programme (development assistance to the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia) contains an element for co-operation in the Baltic region. In 2002 this focused on the promotion of environmental protection and management of natural resources and support for the private sector and assistance for economic development. The total planned allocation for this in 2002 was approximately Euros8&nbsp;million. Cross-border assistance also forms a part of the Tacis programme. It aims to assist border regions in overcoming specific developmental problems, encourage links between economic, social and transport networks, accelerate social and economic reform in the partner states and to reduce transboundary environmental risks and pollution. The total planned allocation for cross-border activities in Tacis in 2002 was approximately Euros27.5. The PHARE programme also contains provision for cross-border activities, the objective of which is to promote cooperation of border regions in countries in central and eastern Europe with adjacent regions in a neighbouring country. The total planned allocation for cross-border activities in PHARE in 2002 was approximately Euros151&nbsp;million.
<P>

<a name="40401w05.html_para11">The PHARE and Tacis programmes, as well as the CARDS programme for assistance to the countries of the Western Balkans, contain the facility for spending to promote regional co-operation where that supports delivery of the overall objectives of the programme. It is not possible to produce an estimate for the total spending on regional co-operation in 2002 because this aspect is not individually accounted for in comparable ways across all of the programmes.

 DFID follows Cabinet Office guidance on the disclosure of interests that is set out in Section 4.3 of the Civil Service Management Code. The letters of appointment for staff draw their attention to the rules on use of official information and related activities that are set out in full in our Staff Handbook. The Handbook states that employees must obtain permission from the Head of Human Resources (a Senior Civil Servant) before entering into any business or financial dealings with individuals or businesses with whom they come into official contact, either directly or indirectly. They must also declare immediately if, in the course of their work, they come into contact with an outside organisation in which they have an interest.

 The UK is working with the EU Water Initiative finance working group to improve the tracking of aid flows in the water sector. This is because different donors currently use different criteria to calculate support to the water sector or track support within multi sector projects. Figures may also include or exclude related issues such as water resources management or concessional loans. Data on water expenditure are not, therefore, directly comparable. The most recent available data for support to the water sector in sub-Sahara Africa 2001&#150;02 show expenditure as:

<a name="40401w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have made it repeatedly clear that the licensing regime to be established under the Licensing Act 2003 should permit the full recovery of the licensing authorities' costs of administration, inspection and enforcement under that regime. We do not consider that taxpayers should subsidise applicants for authorisations under the 2003 Act, save in two instances. During the passage of the Licensing Bill, we gave undertakings in both Houses that schools, sixth form colleges and village, parish or other community halls would be exempted from fees associated with the provision of regulated entertainment. The licensing authorities' costs in these cases will be met by central Government. When compared with the continued operation of the existing licence regimes, we estimate that industry will save &#163;1.97 billion over the first 10 years of the operation of the new regime.

 The Guidance laid in Parliament on 23&nbsp;March under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003 is guidance to licensing authorities on the discharge of their functions under the 2003 Act, but we hope that it will also be beneficial and helpful to future applicants for authorisations under that Act.

 My Department provides block funding to Transport for London through the GLA Transport Grant, and it is for the Mayor to determine how much of this grant should be allocated for capital investment in buses or London Underground. The GLA Transport Grant was &#163;l,681.932&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04, and will be &#163;2,224.556&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05.

<P>
<a name="40401w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We recognise that urban light rail is one of the possible measures that can help relieve congestion and pollution. A number of light rail schemes are under development. These are appraised according to the Departments' New Approach To Appraisal framework which assesses how significant these impacts are alongside other criteria and whether a scheme represents value for money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w11.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Between 1&nbsp;October 2003 and 30&nbsp;March 2004, DVLA and local authorities with devolved clamping powers clamped 30,500 unlicensed vehicles. Of these 14,600 were disposed of by crushing as they were in too poor a condition to put back on the road.
<P>

<a name="40401w11.html_para0">No figures are available for the number of vehicle keepers who initially objected. However crushing is treated as the final option when disposing of vehicles. Every effort is made to contact the current keeper when unlicensed vehicles are clamped and vehicles are kept in pounds for a minimum of seven days for this purpose. It is only after it becomes clear that the keeper cannot be identified or they provide a disclaimer that vehicles are disposed of by crushing.

<a name="40401w11.html_para3">An illegal site containing in the region of 10,000 tonnes of waste may cost approximately 1,000,000 to remediate by waste removal. The total number of such sites in Northern Ireland is not known.

<a name="40401w11.html_para4">In addition to the cost of remediation of illegal sites, illegal dumping also impacts adversely, in competitive terms, on those operating legitimate waste management businesses.

 The issue of solvency of the pension fund of a company seeking assistance from Invest NI only arises in relation to larger operations that provide defined benefit schemes to their employees.
<P>

<a name="40401w11.html_para5">From an industrial development perspective, the important issue is the ability of an applicant company to demonstrate that it can fund its proposal for assistance in the context of all of its liabilities, including those relating to the pension scheme. Under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17, the statutory accounts of a company must disclose full details of any liability to the pension fund. Invest NI would therefore become aware of any pension scheme insolvency issues through a company's most recent statutory accounts.

 The Common Funding Formula (CFF) has not been implemented. The plan is to consult schools on the final proposals for the CFF shortly, with the aim of implementing Common Funding in April 2005. The implementation of Common Funding will be undertaken within finite budgetary constraints, and central to this will be the issue of manageability, especially for schools facing reductions in their relative budget share. All existing Funding Formulae contain a Small School Factor to facilitate the delivery of the curriculum. Small schools with above average teaching costs may also receive additional support through the Teachers' Salary Protection Factor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a number of new measures to empower and inform consumers.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1586W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40401w12.html_para6">The Enterprise Act 2002 introduced a new concept of supercomplaints. It provided the legislative framework for the Office of Fair Trading to conduct an investigation of the doorstep selling market in response to supercomplaint from NACAB (now Citizen's Advice). The OFT's report is expected shortly.
<P>

<a name="40401w12.html_para7">The Enterprise Act also included provisions to strengthen the powers available to enforcement authorities to tackle the activities of rogue traders. The Stop Now Orders, first introduced in 2001 by implementation of the Injunctions Directive in the UK, created a new enforcement regime across a wide range of consumer protection legislation. They enabled designated enforcement authorities to apply to the courts for "Stop Now Orders" to stop the practices of rogue traders if they are acting against the collective interests of consumers. The Enterprise Act has extended that protection across an even wider range of consumer protection&#151;particularly in the service sector.
<P>

<a name="40401w12.html_para8">Another way in which we are informing and empowering consumers is the development of Consumer Support Networks (CSNs). These bring together organisations to plan and deliver better, more accessible and more joined-up support for local consumers. Across Britain, the Networks are helping to raise awareness of consumer issues. This includes considerable emphasis on issues relating to sales in the home, particularly for vulnerable or older consumers.
<P>

<a name="40401w12.html_para9">The Government has made up to &#163;30&nbsp;million of new money available over a 3 year period to roll out a new national consumer helpline&#151;Consumer Direct. With a single, widely publicised number, it will be a powerful tool for consumer advice across Britain. Consumers, no matter where they live, will be able to access reliable, independent help on consumer matters via their own phone, for the price of a local rate call. For those who prefer it, the service will be available on-line.

<P>
<a name="40401w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps have been taken by her Department to ensure energy supplies to the United Kingdom once North Sea reserves have expired.  [165078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Maintaining reliable energy supplies, now and in the future, is one of the key goals for UK energy policy set out in the Energy White Paper published in February 2003. It set out how the Government is working with industry to maximise the economic potential of our North Sea reserves, particularly through the PILOT initiative.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para1">However, the White Paper also noted that it is likely that the UK will become a net importer of gas on an annual basis by around 2006 and of oil by around 2010. By 2020 we are likely to be importing around three-quarters of our primary energy needs.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para2">The UK will then be in the same position as most other advanced industrial economies which already import significant proportions of their energy need without noticeable disruption. Import dependency has long been a fact of life for all the G7 countries apart from the UK and Canada.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1592W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para3">Oil and currently to a lesser extent gas are internationally traded commodities. And all countries, whether import-dependent or not, have a common interest in promoting open markets and predictable prices.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para4">Current gas import infrastructure projects would facilitate imports from Norway, Netherlands, Russia, Qatar, Algeria, other LNG exporters, or other sources of piped gas or LNG into continental Europe. For example, we have agreed the key principles of a new agreement with Norway which will facilitate a range of cross boundary oil and gas developments including the construction of a pipeline between Norwegian offshore infrastructure and the Easington terminal in the UK. This pipeline will deliver dry gas from Norway's Ormen Lange field and when operational will be capable of delivering up to 20&nbsp;per cent. of the UK's gas demand.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para5">The expansion of renewable energy is also important for the contribution it will make to ensuring secure energy supplies (as well as to achieving our environmental goals). Our recent Renewables Innovation Review was very clear on the future costs of all renewables technologies and we can see that renewables offer the best opportunity for the new capacity we need. We have set as our first goal obtaining 10&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010, with the aspiration of doubling this by 2020.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para6">Wind energy, as the form of renewable energy with far the best immediate prospects for expansion, will play a very big part in this expansion. Through capital and research grants, we are also encouraging the development of other forms of renewable energy such as biomass and energy crops, photovoltaic and wave and tidal energy, so as to create a much more diversified renewable energy sector over the longer term.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para7">As stated in the Energy White Paper: while The Government does not have specific proposals for new nuclear build now, we do not rule out the possibility that at some point in the future new build might be necessary to meet our carbon targets.

 The Small Business Service and the Department for Education and Skills have collaborated to help establish the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship (NCGE), as a private company limited by guarantee. The NCGE will promote the idea of starting a business as a viable career option for students and graduates. Six Directors have so far been appointed to the Board of the NCGE, with David Frost (Director General, British Chambers of Commerce) acting as interim Chairman and Karan Bilimoria (Founder and Chief Executive, Cobra Beer) recruited as the Council's Graduate Entrepreneur Champion.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para8">The establishment of the Council builds upon support already provided by Government to help promote Entrepreneurship as a viable career option to students and graduates. The Small Business Service provides support of around &#163;1&nbsp;million per annum to support organisations

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that young people reach the age of 19 with the skills they need to compete in a modern, global economy. Our ambition is that UK staying-on rates after 16 should be among the highest in the OECD.
<P>

<a name="40401w14.html_para12">The new minimum wage rate that will be introduced for 16 and 17-year-old workers at &#163;3.00 per hour with effect from 1&nbsp;October 2004 has been set with this concern very much in mind. First, the great majority of young workers are already being paid in excess of this rate, and research commissioned by the Low Pay Commission for their latest report concluded that a new minimum wage rate introduced at this level would have negligible effects on education participation. Second, Education Maintenance Allowances will be implemented nationally this autumn and these will provide payments of up to &#163;30 per week for young people who choose to continue in full-time education after reaching compulsory school leaving age. The report of the 16&#150;19 Financial Support Review, "Supporting young people to achieve: towards a new deal for skills", was published alongside the budget. That report sets out the Government's proposals to ensure that young people aged 16&#150;19 have the support and incentives they need to participate in education and training.

<P>
<a name="40401w15.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The South Hampshire Priority Area for Economic Regeneration is broadly defined in Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9 2001). The area was originally proposed by SERPLAN (the South East Regional Planning Body in 2001) in their draft RPG, and was confirmed by the Panel following a Public Examination in 1999. The report of the panel provides further justification for the designation, but criteria included: above average unemployment levels, high levels of social deprivation, low skill levels, dependence on declining industries, derelict urban fabric, peripherally and insularity.
<P>

<a name="40401w15.html_para8">Within the South East Regional Planning Guidance the recommendation was that all the areas identified as Priority Areas for Economic Regeneration (PAERs) need tailored regeneration strategies backed up by appropriate resources to address their problems and maximise their contribution to the sustainable development of the region. Designation as a PAER signalled to regional partners, including the Regional Development Agency, that the needs of the area should be given high priority. As such, the South Hampshire Priority Area for Economic Regeneration is not a scheme. The objectives for the area are set out in RPG 9 (2001), in particular Policy RE7 and Chapter 12. The policy calls for local and regional partners to give particular attention to actively supporting economic regeneration and renewal, including inward investment.

<a name="40401w15.html_para9">In line with the signals given through designation of the area as a PAER, regional partners, including the South East England Regional Development Agency (SEEDA), have given the area a high priority.

The Department is currently discussing the future development of MAS with the English RDAs and Welsh Development Agency, including the determination of future funding arrangements for MAS post March 2005. We are also discussing with RDAs and other stakeholders how best to ensure that MAS co-ordinates effectively within the new DTI Business Support framework, in particular the Support to implement Best Business Practice product (Product 10) that will be delivered through Business Links from April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) of 9&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1401W, on defence contractors, what contracts for the supply of equipment have been awarded to RUAG and are currently in operation; what action has been taken to enforce the contract under which supplies were suspended by the Swiss Government during the Iraq war; and for what reason he maintains no records centrally of similar contract breaches by other suppliers to his Department.  [161778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are currently three contracts in place with RUAG Ammotech GMBH, a wholly owned business subsidiary of RUAG, for the supply of ammunition and components. No action was taken against the company in respect of deliveries of 40 mm grenades suspended during the hostilities in Iraq, as this recognised the Swiss Government's long standing policy of neutrality. There was no impact of the operational effectiveness of British forces as available stocks were more than adequate to cover the Operation Telic requirements.

<P>
<a name="40401w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Between 17&nbsp;October 2003 and 28&nbsp;March 2004 there have been some 67 recorded attacks where firearms or explosives have been used against the United Kingdom Forces in MND(SE). These include some 18 improvised explosive devices, some 41 contact shooting incidents, and some eight other attacks involving mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades or grenades.

<P>
<a name="40401w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 UK forces who witness an incident in which they are not directly involved provide medical assistance if necessary and endeavour to report it to the appropriate authority. However, it is not always possible to confirm whether or how many casualties have occurred during a particular incident. Consequently there is limited utility in central recording since we have no viable means of assessing the completeness of the information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I am not able to quantify precisely the savings, as they depend on force levels and the volumes of mail that families choose to despatch. However, I can say that the cost to the taxpayer of the service since its inception on 17&nbsp;April 2003 has been between &#163;1.5&nbsp;million and &#163;2&nbsp;million. This is in addition to the cost to the Royal Mail Group, who generously provided their services free of charge during the initial three months. I estimate that the cost of providing this service to all personnel on operational deployments would be between &#163;3&nbsp;million and &#163;9&nbsp;million per annum. Forces Air Letters ("blueys") and their electronic equivalent, the "e-bluey" will continue to be free of charge. Other airmail items up to 2Kg in weight will be charged at a subsidised rate equivalent to the Royal Mail inland first class tariff.

<P>
<a name="40401w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are currently proposals for a re-organisation of Army brigade headquarters in Northern Ireland with a change from three to two operational brigade headquarters. Such a move is a natural progression after the Police Service for Northern Ireland changed from three to two regions last year and would provide a more effective and efficient command structure. This proposal is currently the subject of consultation with the Trade Unions and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="40401w18.html_para0">If we proceed with this proposal it will mean the disbandment of Headquarters 3 Infantry Brigade which is currently situated in Mahon Road Barracks. Such a re-organisation will not reduce the current level of support which the armed forces provide to the PSNI, indeed the aim is to provide this support more efficiently. Neither will it result in any significant reduction in the number of soldiers or units deployed to Northern Ireland.

 Carbon monoxide alarms conforming to the relevant British Standards are a useful back-up precaution for householders, but should not be regarded as a substitute for proper installation and maintenance of gas equipment by a competent installer registered with Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI).
<P>

<a name="40401w19.html_para2">In the meantime recommendation of CO alarms as a secondary line of defence has been included in the latest HSE guidance on gas safety and HSE is co-operating with industry on research to resolve questions around long-term reliability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what discussions he has had with gas suppliers on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the need for regular gas checks and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the efficient operations of gas appliances in the domestic setting;  [163389]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will convene a meeting at the earliest opportunity with the gas supply industry, the Health and Safety Executive and other relevant agencies to plan a national campaign to address the dangers of carbon monoxide poison from domestic gas appliances. [163392]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Officials from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have already met with representatives from the gas supply industry, who are currently developing a strategy for future national gas safety awareness campaigns. The industry players have committed to produce an agreed strategy for implementation in time for autumn 2004.
<P>

<a name="40401w19.html_para3">This is in addition to existing measures to promote awareness of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. These measures include the annual winter gas safety awareness campaign overseen by HSE, which this year targeted particularly vulnerable groups, such as students and other first-time renters, elderly people and parents of young children.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1613W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40401w19.html_para4">HSE's domestic gas safety website contains information on the causes and symptoms of CO, and what to do if poisoning is suspected. HSE produces free leaflets on gas safety both for general consumers and landlords, including information on CO, in 12 community languages as well as English.
<P>

<a name="40401w19.html_para5">It also operates a Gas Safety Advice line providing free advice to callers. Additionally, where possible, HSE officials participate from time to time in awareness-raising events run by other organisations, such as local community groups.

<a name="40401w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will introduce a statutory requirement for all homes to have their gas appliances checked on a regular basis.  [163390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Residential landlords are already required by law at all times to maintain, in a safe condition, the gas appliances in their rental properties, and to carry out a gas safety check on an annual basis. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also strongly recommends that owner-occupiers put in place a regular servicing and maintenance routine for their gas appliances. However, when the question of introducing mandatory safety checks was examined by the Health and Safety Commission in 2000, the Commission concluded that such an approach would be difficult to justify on both cost and practicality grounds. The recommendation of their Review was that efforts should instead be focused on further publicity and guidance in order to raise awareness of the need for all gas appliances to be regularly checked for safety and services in accordance with manufacturers' instructions. I fully support this position.

<BR>
<i>Throughput and Case and Cash Compliance</i>
<BR>
Issues with the new computer's management information systems, mean that we are unable to provide reliable performance figures at present. We are working to resolve the problems and expect to have a solution shortly.
<BR>
<i>Customer Perception</i>
<BR>
The aim of this target is to focus on how the service provided by the Agency is perceived by those who use it. A qualitative study has been commissioned to look at the experiences and views of new customers whose only involvement will have been with the new scheme. The results of this will be used to establish a baseline from which a customer perception target will be developed. The Agency is now committed to publishing a milestone target in the Business Plan for 2004/05 leading to a published target in 2005/06.
<BR>
<i>Unit Cost/Productivity</i>
<BR>
The Agency published an internal unit cost target in the 2003&#150;04 business plan. This target was based on Agency staff cost and the number of cases on the live load. The target for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;184 per case. Our performance in the year to date is within &#163;10 of the target figure.
<BR>
<i>Debt</i>
<BR>
Our target is to introduce an internal target for this year and a Secretary of State target for 2004/05. Work continues on the development of the format of the Secretary of State target for 2004/05.

<P>
<a name="40401w21.html_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The latest figures for February 2004 show that the Department now employs 7.5&nbsp;per cent. staff from an ethnic minority against the figure of 6.8&nbsp;per cent. for the UK's economically active population.
<P>

<a name="40401w21.html_para11">Several initiatives are in place to help us to increase further the proportion of our staff from ethnic backgrounds, these include a new recruitment system introduced in December 2002 which is designed to be inclusive, increasing external recruitment into the Senior Civil Service to give us benefits from a wider range of candidates, development of a checklist of recruitment best practice which will enable recruitment at all grades from the widest possible pool, and a pilot of new methods of recruitment to our non-departmental public bodies. This will be based on outreach, marketing and support for applicants.

and 25&nbsp;January 2003.<P>

2. The people eligible for Direct Payment are those who have an account suitable for receiving direct payment and who have an agreement with the Secretary of State that they want their benefit or pension made by this method. The figures above are of those people who have taken up the option of receiving their benefit or pension this way.<P>

3. The figures relate to payments administered by Department of Work and Pensions only. They do not include Child Benefit accounts which are the responsibility of Inland Revenue or War Pension accounts are now the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence<P>

<P>
<a name="40401w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Making services available online is an intrinsic part of DWP's business strategy, not a free-standing activity. It is therefore no longer appropriate to publish a separate e- business strategy. Details of DWP's approach to customer service delivery can be found in the business plans of each of the main delivery businesses, copies of which are on the Department's websites and in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w22.html_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Department's use of agencies to supply temporary staff is limited, temporary vacancies are normally notified to, and filled by, Jobcentre Plus Offices. The information requested is not held centrally and where available would only go back to 2001/02, due to the length of time the Department is required to keep recruitment information. Obtaining any information would be at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="40401w23.html_wqn0"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his plans are for Jobcentre Plus for over 50s; and how much his Department has committed to the programme.  [163016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Our Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement' reinforced our commitment to extend employment opportunities for older people, with a range of proposals including providing extra back to work help for the over 50s and a number of changes to tax and pension rules which will give individuals more choice and the opportunity to stay in work longer. We have also pledged to tackle age discrimination in the workplace and will be introducing age legislation and guidance covering employment and vocational training by October 2006.
<P>

<a name="40401w23.html_para0">Through Jobcentre Plus we have enhanced the New Deal 50plus programme to offer customers a package of help tailored to individual needs. This includes personal job-search advice, pre-work training, work trials, volunteering opportunities and an in-work training grant. This help is available to all people aged 50 and over (and their dependent partners aged 50 and over) who have been on specified benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance, Incapacity Benefit and Pension Credit for six months or more.
<P>

<a name="40401w23.html_para1">The projected expenditure for New Deal 50plus in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;56&nbsp;million. Back to work help is also available to people aged 50 or over through other programmes, for example New Deal 25plus and Work Based Learning for Adults. The cost of this help is not available separately of wider programme budgets. Additionally, we have allocated &#163;7.9&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;7.2&nbsp;million in 2005&#150;06 to fund new measures to assist people aged 50 and over back to work (as announced in the pre-Budget report) and a campaign to encourage employers to recruit and retain older workers (as announced in the 2004 Budget).
<P>

<a name="40401w23.html_para2">From April 2004 we will be piloting two of the back to work help proposals outlined in the Green Paper. The Over 50s Outreach pilot involves external organisations acting as an intermediary between Jobcentre Plus and the customer. Research has indicated that contact from Jobcentre Plus can concern people aged over 50, particularly those on inactive benefits such as Incapacity Benefit, Income Support and Severe Disablement Allowance. This project is aimed at identifying best practice to help Jobcentre Plus better engage with these customers.
<P>

<a name="40401w23.html_para3">We are also running a pilot study giving customers aged 50 to 59, who have been claiming JSA for 18 months, mandatory Intensive Activity Periods as part of their ND25plus programme. Customers aged 25 to 49 are already required to participate in this element of the ND25plus programme because it offers them extensive help back into work. Eligible customers aged 50 to 59 currently have voluntary access to this provision but only 12&nbsp;per cent. take up the opportunity. Research suggests that this lack of take up may be due to 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1629W</I><P>
individuals losing confidence and becoming demoralised about their chances of returning to work. We believe that participation in the Intensive Activity Periods is a key element in re-motivating people aged 50 to 59 years old and giving them the relevant support and employment opportunities they need.
<P>

<a name="40401w23.html_para4">In addition to this, the IB Reform pilots are looking at how we can best provide the support needed to help new incapacity benefit customers return to work. Given the positive start to the pilots, and the fact that many of those existing customers volunteering to take part have been successfully helped back into jobs, a tailored regime will be introduced early in 2005 for all existing IB customers who started their claim in the two years prior to the beginning of the IB Reform Pilots.

<a name="40401w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Jobcentre Plus advisers, in common with other DWP staff, receive a basic salary and have the opportunity to earn a performance-related bonus on top. In the 2003 pay award those bonuses were up to &#163;220 for Band C staff in Jobcentre Plus, which included personal advisers. The amount of bonus was determined by the "box marking" an individual received in their annual appraisal, which depended on achievement of their objectives. These objectives would have covered the full range of their duties.

<a name="40401w24.html_para6">Over one million people have been helped in to work through the New Deal since its creation, but it has also been a success in financial terms. NIESR estimated that the economy as a whole is richer by &#163;500&nbsp;million a year as a result of the New Deal for Young People. Independent evaluation has also found that the New Deal for Lone Parents saves money; with every lone parent moving into work equating to an exchequer saving of nearly &#163;1,600.

<a name="40401w25.html_para3">We have always recognised that there will be a small number of people who we cannot pay directly into an account. We are finalising the design of a method of payment to properly meet the needs of these customers and it will be cheque based.

2. Excludes State Pension recipients who receive State Pension combined with another benefit and are paid through another benefit system.<P>

3. Day of payment is calculated by looking at the last payment authorised by the Pension Service, which may be in the future.<P>

4. The day of payment used in this analysis may not be the pensioners usual day of payment if their last payment day in this instrument of payment is altered for any reason (e.g. Christmas).<P>

5. This table shows the day State Pension is paid, not the day the claimant picks up their pension from the Post Office.<P>

6. This answer differs to PQ/04/145975 (Mr Alan Reid) because of change in methodology for calculating these figures.<P>

 Already 87&nbsp;per cent. of all customers, rising to 90&nbsp;per cent. of pensioners, have access to a bank account that can receive Direct Payment. It is the role of staff to provide customers with factual information on all of their account options. It is for customers themselves to decide which type of account they wish to have their pensions and benefits paid into. The conversion process normally consists of one or more mailings sent directly to the customer, followed by a telephone call if there is no response to the letter(s). The mailing advises customers that this may happen.

 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> We do recognise that some customers have been slow to send their Post Office card account details to the DWP. The DWP typically send out a conversion letter to customers shortly after they have been sent a new order book. As order books normally last for 20 weeks, this gives the customer plenty of time to open an account if necessary and supply account details.
<P>

<a name="40401w26.html_para2">However, it is clear that many customers do not realise that they then need to provide DWP with their card account details. We are working with the Post Office, sub-postmasters and others to solve this problem. We have improved customer information and sub-postmaster training. These actions have already had some impact and the number of customers returning account details is starting to increase. Further action will also be taken to simplify the process for customers returning account details to DWP.

 The Department does not market specifically the Post Office Card Account. Instead customers are given information on all the accounts available for Direct Payment.

 Prime Minister Khin Nyunt of Burma's State Peace and Development Council announced a "roadmap to national reconciliation" on 30&nbsp;August 2003. The first step of the roadmap is to reconvene the National Convention to agree a new constitution, as outlined by Foreign Minister Win Aung at the Bangkok Process meeting in December. In light of that, we believe that it would send a wrong signal to strengthen sanctions under the EU's Common Position on Burma at a time when the regime may be moving forward with the political process. We are therefore prepared to support a rollover of existing measures in the EU Common Position on Burma which already contains tough measures against the regime. However, we remain ready to respond proportionately to positive or negative progress in Burma.

 The UK Government are concerned that Palestinian terrorist groups may draw support from inside Iran and Syria. We continue to press both the Iranian and Syrian authorities on this and. in Syria's case, on the activities of those groups with a presence in Syria. Separately, we have urged the Iranian Government to take effective action against any members of Al-Qaeda seeking refuge in Iran and the Syrian Government to act to stem the flow of terrorists into Iraq. We and EU partners have made clear that relations with both countries can only develop on the basis of action to address political concerns, including terrorism.

<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;representations his Department has received from and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;what meetings his Department has had with the housing industry regarding the proposed introduction of home information packs;  [165114]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate he has made of the percentage change in the number of failed housing market transactions that would result from the proposed introduction of home information packs;  [165115]
<P>

<P>
(4) what research has been <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;commissioned and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;undertaken by his Department to assess the economic costs and benefits to the housing market, in particular in areas of low-demand, of the introduction of home information packs;  [165117]
<P>
(5) what assessment his Department has made of the pilots carried out on home information packs for house sales.  [165118]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 All the main professional and trade bodies involved in the home buying and selling process have been actively involved in helping steer research and develop proposals for home information packs. These organisations frequently express views to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. They are closely involved in finalising arrangements for the smooth implementation of home information packs.
<P>

<a name="40401w29.html_para0">Research carried out in 1998 showed that 28&nbsp;per cent. of home sale transactions failed after terms have been agreed, costing buyers and sellers about &#163;350&nbsp;million each year in wasted expenditure. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expect home information packs to reduce significantly this failure and waste.
<P>

<a name="40401w29.html_para1">Between 7,500 and 8,500 home inspectors will be needed to prepare home condition reports and 90&nbsp;per cent. of these have already been identified within the property professions. Candidates will be trained within the educational sector and property industry in accordance with approved National Occupational Standards. They will be covered by indemnity insurance and the required number will be available before the implementation of the home information pack.
<P>

<a name="40401w29.html_para2">A regulatory impact assessment published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister following consultation with the industry provides details of anticipated costs and benefits arising from home information packs. Following extensive research on this subject, we published a consultation paper "the home information pack in low demand low value areas" in March 2003. A summary of responses to the consultation was published on 3&nbsp;February 2004. Copies are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40401w29.html_para3">In December 1999 we launched a pilot scheme in Bristol to test the practical operation of packs. This showed that home information packs can be assembled quickly, inject transparency into the home buying and selling process and help with the early identification and resolution of problems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Alan Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the effect of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the Starter Home Initiative and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the Abandoned Home Initiative in North Tyneside.  [165360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Since September 2001, the Starter Home Initiative (SHI) has been helping key workers into home ownership in areas where the high cost of housing serves to undermine recruitment and retention of skilled staff in our key public services. It has not been available to key workers in the North East. The SHI was superseded from 1&nbsp;April by a new key worker housing programme&#151;Key Worker Living. This is also not available in the North East.




<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1650W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40401w29.html_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of an Abandoned Homes Initiative. However, our Market Renewal Pathfinders are a comprehensive programme to tackle low demand and abandonment in nine areas of England, including Tyneside. The boundaries of the Tyneside scheme, which include parts of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, but not the North Tyneside council district, were drawn up following an analysis of local housing markets, using a "worst first" approach. The integrated approach to spatial and economic issues being adopted by the pathfinders should bring substantial benefits to the wider sub-region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to permit local authorities to charge landlords council tax for houses in multiple occupation occupied solely by students; and if he will make a statement.  [162017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No. Dwellings occupied entirely by students are exempt from council tax because unlike other groups of people on low incomes, students are not normally entitled to income related benefits such as housing and council tax benefit. If the Government were to make owners of student accommodation liable for council tax, it would not necessarily follow that they would ultimately bear the costs of the tax. This is because landlords could simply pass on the extra costs to the students through their rent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn3"><B> Sandra Gidley: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what definition he uses of the category key worker. [164650]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 For the purposes of the recently announced Key Worker Living programme, a key worker is defined as someone employed by the public sector; in a frontline role delivering an essential public service where there are serious recruitment and retention problems; and in a group recommended for inclusion by Regional Housing Boards.

<a name="40401w29.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Local Authority Standards (Training)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will provide central funding to ensure that there is consistency in the level of training offered to local authority standards committee members.  [165626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister already funds the Standards Board for England, which has issued guidance to assist members of standards committees to carry out their role. The Board will continue to issue guidance as it considers appropriate on matters relating to the conduct of members of authorities, including guidance to standards committee members. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister relies on the Board's guidance, which has been well received by authorities, to promote consistency of standards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will list those parts of the Chelmsford local authority area in the West Chelmsford parliamentary constituency which are included in the M11/Stansted corridor as a designated area for development; and if he will make a statement.  [165066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Chelmsford local authority area is not included in the London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough corridor. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), made a statement on 2&nbsp;February 2004 listing the local authorities in the corridor. A copy of this statement is available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of the set-up costs of elected regional assemblies he estimates will be <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;premises, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;wages and salaries, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;equipment and stationery and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;other costs.  [164831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The costs of setting up an elected regional assembly will vary between regions, largely because the cost of referendums and elections depends upon the size of the region's electorate. For these reasons the proportions of the various elements of the estimated set-up costs will also vary between regions.

 Local authorities, along with all public bodies have a duty under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) to take reasonable steps, consistent with the proper exercise of their functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs for what reason the Public Record Office retained original documents written by those court-martialled following the Dublin uprising in 1916.  [162318]<P>

 The Judge Advocate General's office, which organised these courts martial, formed part of the British administration in Ireland. It took the original decision to preserve documents written by the defendants in these cases on the grounds that they formed an integral part of the court proceedings. It was subsequently decided that the court records as a whole merited permanent preservation because of their historical importance.

 Postal voting has been available for many years and since 2000 has been available on demand. There are several safeguards in place for this, a Declaration of Identity as well as a variety of offences including personation and undue influence. For the all-postal pilots in June this year, the European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill builds on existing sanctions, by extending the offence of personation to be an arrestable offence outside polling stations and also by allowing the time limit for investigating electoral offences to be extended, along with a range of practical measures, in partnership with electoral administrators and other key stakeholders, to address potential fraud. Returning Officers can perform checks, including random inspection of Declaration of Identities and the checking of signatures against those already on file or investigating where more than a

<a name="40401w31.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. McGrady: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what plans he has to bring into effect in Northern Ireland the recommendations of the Leggatt Report on the Review of Tribunals.  [164628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Sir Andrew Leggatt's report made a number of recommendations in relation to tribunal reform. The Government will issue its response to these recommendations set in the wider context of reforming the Administrative Justice System in a White Paper later this year. Consideration is currently being given to the implications of Sir Andrew Leggatt's Report for Northern Ireland.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the principal categories of claim which are heard in the small claims track are.  [164436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The categories of claims made in the small claims track for which the department collects certain information are debt, personal injury, other negligence and non-possession housing disputes.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many claims for return of tenancy deposits were heard in the small claims track in 2002&#150;03.  [164437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost to the department.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_wqn9"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps his Department has taken to assess whether charging fees for the recovery of small claims in the small claims track has a deterrent effect on claimants.  [164438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The first step when setting fees is to ensure that the size of the fee is proportionate to cost. This means that even the smallest claim attracts a fee of &#163;30. The second step is to ensure (by means of claim bands) that fees are proportionate to the amount at stake. The third step is to provide protection for those unable to pay. Exemption is available for those on means tested benefits and discretionary remission (based on hardship) for those not qualifying. Finally, the successful litigant may recover his fee from the losing party.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para5">If a litigant is deterred from issuing proceedings this is most likely to be because he is unsure of winning or because he is unsure that the losing party has the means to pay.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para6">When court fees are increased there is always a consultation process. Consultation has shown that the probability of successful recovery is just as important to potential litigants as the size of fees. Relatively low fees are payable on defended small claims because the cost is 



<P>
<P><I>1 Apr 2004 : Column 1659W</I><P>
shared by those with claims that are not defended. The cost of undefended small claims is the concern of most claimants.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_wqn10"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will encourage the the small claims track to sit in neighbourhood premises to determine groups of local cases.  [164440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Cases in the small claims track are heard throughout a network of 218 county courts across the country. The present arrangements for hearing cases in the small claims track are considered adequate to meet the needs of local and public interest and in providing access to justice.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_wqn11"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what plans he has for improving access for the socially excluded to the small claims track.  [164441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 One of our Departmental Public Service Agreement targets (PSA6) is to increase year-on-year the number of people who receive suitable assistance in the priority areas of law involving fundamental rights or social exclusion. We are increasing the capacity of the Community Legal Service and all advice and guidance services through closer co-operation and collaboration within the advice sector.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para7">Access to justice is protected by automatic exemption of fees for litigants on specified means tested benefits and discretionary remission (in part or full) for those who do not benefit from exemption but would face exceptional hardship if required to pay fees, or required to pay them in full. There are no current plans to review this policy.
<P>

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many defendants in the small claims track defaulted on orders for money judgments in 2002&#150;03; and how many such judgments were enforced by the court after defaults in that year.  [164442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The department does not hold information centrally concerning defendants who default on money judgments in the small claims track, and it can be provided only at disproportionate cost. For information, figures for enforcement of judgments in 2002&#150;03, irrespective of track, are contained in the table. These figures do not take into account whether or not they were issued because the defendant defaulted on a money judgment.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs pursuant to his Written Ministerial Statement of 22&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 41WS, what the mechanism will be by which magistrates courts will conduct blitzes against fine defaulters; and by what mechanism the efficacy of such blitzes will be evaluated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The national fines initiative referred to in my Written Ministerial Statement of 22&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 41WS, is Operation Payback National guidance was issued to assist courts in planning, but the scope and process of the local operations was determined by individual Justices' Chief Executives, according to local circumstances. Courts identified particular dates and areas for their action, and then, assisted by the police, concentrated all their enforcement resources in the targeted areas for the duration of their local operations.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para9">The magistrates courts who have taken part in Operation Payback have been asked to provide a core set of data, including the number of warrants progressed, amount of money collected and the number of Civilian Enforcement Officers and police involved. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of the Operation at both a national and regional level.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_wqn14"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the purpose is of charging fees for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;applicants and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;defendants in the Small Claims Court.  [164454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Four fees may become payable during the course of a defended small claim. The fee on issue of the claim, the fee on a counterclaim, the fee on allocation to track, and the fee on making a specific application. In all cases the purpose of the fee is the same, namely to recover cost.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para10">It would be administratively convenient to recover the extra cost of applications simply by increasing claim fees. However there is a danger that if applications did not attract fees the time of the court and the parties would be wasted by unnecessary applications.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para11">A claimant who forces a defendant to make an application to the court by unreasonably refusing to hand over information risks having to pay the fee. A defendant who makes an unnecessary application is unlikely to recover the fee.
<P>

<a name="40401w31.html_para12">The charging of fees on applications therefore promotes co-operation between the parties and helps to ensure that the time of the court and the parties is not wasted by unnecessary applications.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_wqn15"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make the forms for application to the small claims track available in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;citizens' advice bureaux and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other neighbourhood premises.  [164455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Claim forms are available to the citizens' advice bureaux and all other advice agencies through any county court and via the Court Service website.
<P>

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the minimum number of trips to the small claims track is which an applicant must take to make a claim and recover judgment.  [164456]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w31.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 It is possible for a claimant to make a small claim and recover judgment without having to attend court.

 Access to health records of living patients is governed by the Data Protection Act 1998. Where a patient is a competent adult, access should normally only be given with the patient's consent. Special provisions apply for adults who are incapacitated and for children. Where a patient has died, access to their record is governed by the Access to Health Records Act 1990. The Act provides the right for a deceased person's personal representative and any person with a claim arising out of the patient's death to apply for access.

<P>
<a name="40401w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Public Benefit Corporation (Register of Members) Regulations 2004 were laid in Parliament on 5&nbsp;March 2004. Subject to Parliamentary approval, they come into force on 1&nbsp;April 2004 and set out how trusts should maintain registers of members once they have been authorised by the regulator. Registers are to be made public other than in the circumstances set out in the Regulations. The obligation to keep a public register of members only arises once a National health service trust receives an authorisation from the independent regulator to be a NHS foundation

 The timetable for elections to the board of governors is a matter for each applicant national health service trust. The Department has issued model rules and guidance and these are available in the Library. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides for the commencement of elections once a trust has made an application to the regulator. The independent regulator is responsible for ensuring that a NHS foundation trust's constitution, including its provisions for carrying out elections, is in accordance with the requirements of the Act.

<P>

<a name="40401w36.html_para0">Approximately 1,300 Silzone* mechanical heart valves were distributed in the United Kingdom between its introduction in 1997 and its withdrawal from use in January 2000. The main problems associated with Silzone* heart valves were increased risk of blood clotting complications, such as stroke, and leakage around the valve. The MHRA was originally alerted to this problem by a report of seven incidents of such complications among a series of 51 patients implanted with Silzone heart valves at one UK centre. The MHRA has since received only a small number of reports associated with the Silzone* valve. A clinical study sponsored by the manufacturer, St. Jude Medical, confirmed the MHRA's finding that the risk of complications was higher with this valve than in valves without the Silzone* coating, but showed that the increased risk occurred only in the first few months after implantation. Consequently, patients who remain implanted with this valve are now at no greater risk from complications than recipients of uncoated valves.

 <sup>1</sup>  Under the European System of Accounts 95 (ESA95) the economic estimates that are defined as Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices are broadly equivalent to what has been historically known as GDP at factor cost. ONS has effected the change frtim GDP at factor cost to GVA at basic prices as part of implementation of ESA95, along with all other EU countries. GVA at basic prices includes the effects of taxes less subsidies on production, but excludes taxes and subsidies on products, which are included in GDP at market prices under ESA95.<P>

 <sup>2</sup>  Estimates of GVA in Table A are on a residence basis, where the income of commuters is allocated to where they live, rather than their place of work.

The Office for National Statistic has effected the change from GDP at factor cost to GVA at basic prices as part of implementation of ESA95, along with all other EU countries. GVA at basic prices includes the effects of taxes less subsidies on production, but excludes taxes and subsidies on products, which are included in GDP at market prices under ESA95.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Tables C4 and C5 of Budget 2004 set out the Government's aggregate plans for public sector capital investment. Under these plans, Public Sector Net Investment will reach 2.2&nbsp;per cent. of GDP by 2007&#150;08 to rectify the historical under-investment in public infrastructure and deliver improved public services. More information on specific capital allocations through to 2005&#150;06 is set out in the SR2002 White Paper (Cm 5570) and the Government will set out new capital plans for 2006/-07 and 2007&#150;08 in the forthcoming Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 As stated in Budget 2004 (HC 301), and in line with previous years, 90.6&nbsp;per cent. of self assessment returns were filled on time. Over one million returns were received electronically. Inland Revenue issued 952,766 Late Filing Penalty Notices on 17&nbsp;February 2004 for returns not submitted by the due date.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;lower and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;upper limits are of his estimate of the annual amount of spirits duty fraud; and how he arrived at these estimates.  [165232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Customs' estimate of spirits revenue evaded in 2001&#150;02 is &#163;600&nbsp;million,as reported in "Measuring and Tackling indirect Fraud Losses 2003" (December 2003). The National Audit Office report "Estimating the Level of Spirits Fraud" (March 2004) calculates a corresponding 95&nbsp;per cent. confidence interval of between &#163;330&nbsp;million and &#163;1,080&nbsp;million. This calculation takes account both of sampling variation in the initial level of consumption and of the under-reporting variation. Both reports are available in the Library of the House.

<a name="40401w40.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Alan Reid: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the change in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;sales of spirits in the UK and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the consequent amount of duty collected that would be caused by increases in the sale price of a 70cl bottle in steps of one penny, up to 40 pence.  [164498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The sale price of a bottle of spirits is a commercial decision for individual retailers. HM Customs and Excise estimates that a 10p increase in the sale price of a bottle of spirits would lead to a reduction in sales of UK-dutied spirits of around 0.8&nbsp;per cent. The effects of smaller or larger increases would be broadly pro rata. The impact on spirits duty revenues would depend on the extent to which such an increase was related to spirits duty increases or other factors.

<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Alan Reid: </B>

<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Government announced in the Budget that, owing to continued high levels of spirits duty fraud, it will legislate to implement the Roques Report recommendation to introduce tax stamps for spirits. In doing so, the Government will help the trade financially with compliance costs by deferring payment for tax stamps, assisting firms with capital investment and freezing spirits duty for the remainder of this Parliament. The Government are also investigating the potential for offsetting security costs. Further announcements will be made once all the detailed offsetting options have been considered in discussion with the trade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40401w40.html_spnew11"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Organisations can only recover VAT they incur on purchases that relate to their taxable business activities. The provision of education for a fee is exempt from VAT, so universities and other educational institutions cannot recover the VAT which relates to their exempt supplies of education.
<P>

<a name="40401w40.html_para4">Bodies which engage in both taxable and exempt activities must use a partial exemption method to work out the amount of VAT they can recover. The partial exemption method a university uses is designed to take account of its individual circumstances, but HM Customs and Excise cannot accept a partial exemption special method that does not produce a fair and reasonable recovery of VAT.
<P>

<a name="40401w40.html_para5">Universities and other higher education institutions often use methods that calculate their recoverable VAT in proportion to the value of their supplies of education. In these cases, Customs will take account of the value of the Higher education Funding Council teaching grant (the "T element") when agreeing the method.
<P>

<a name="40401w40.html_para6">The Government cannot comment on the VAT affairs of individual taxpayers. Exemption 15<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;of the Open Government Code applies.

<a name="40401w41.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government take steps to close down tax avoidance schemes as they become aware of them, particularly where they create economic distortions, provide commercial advantages over compliant taxpayers, redistribute tax revenues in an unfair and arbitrary manner, or represent an abuse that conflicts with or defeats the will of Parliament.
