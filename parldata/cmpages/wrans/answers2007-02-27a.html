Allocations in future years will depend on the outcome of this year's comprehensive spending review and DFID internal resource allocation decisions. We expect to maintain our support to Afghanistan in line with the UK's 10 year Development Partnership Agreement signed in January 2006. We committed to spending more than 50 per cent. of DFID's assistance to Afghanistan through the Government of Afghanistan's systems, which we believe to be the most effective way of delivering aid.

In December 2006 the Quartet (US, Russia, UN and EU) requested a further expansion to remove the income ceiling entirely, so the TIM has been extended to all civil employees of the PA (excluding security forces and the civil police). The last payment in February 2007 paid all 77,000 civil PA employees.

 DFID uses a range of approaches and aid instruments to fight specific diseases in developing countries according to the country situation. The preference is to provide budget support or pooled funds to support the implementation of countries' own health plans. Such approaches provide flexible and long term support to fund trained staff, essential medicines and the costs of delivering broad based health services. In more difficult settings where DFID supports large disease specific programmes it encourages the delivery of integrated packages of care, for example adding distribution of bednets, micronutrients, and other vital treatments to immunisation programmes. DFID also encourages others to buy into national plans and use national delivery systems to minimise the negative effect of projects that may divert funds, staff and effort to specific health issues at the expense of broad based services.</p>

 The Casino Advisory Panel established by the Secretary of State, to recommend the local authority areas for the 17 new casinos permitted under the Gambling Act 2005, is independent from Government. The panel made its recommendations to the Secretary of State in their final report on 30 January 2007. In paragraph 88, &#147;Ambient and Impulse Gambling&#148;, of their final report the Casino Advisory Panel stated:</p>
<a name="70227w0002.htm_brev0"><a name="07022780000143"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Throughout our consideration of the submitted evidence we noted concern that the location of a casino in or near an area of social deprivation could locally worsen problem gambling and debt. For example, people in financial trouble might see the prospect of an unlimited jackpot as a &#147;quick fix&#148; to their problems. Such concern is supported, for example, in Sir Alan Budd's report by a reference in the British Prevalence Survey associating the highest percentages of problem gambling with table games in a casino, betting and fruit machines, and we note also evidence as to correlation between proximity and problem gambling related to casinos. Our remit, however, is to look at areas rather than sites and we have very much focussed on that. Moreover, town planning policy throughout Britain regards casinos as a town centre use. So our view is that problem gambling is more a town planning consideration rather than one for us, though we have noted in our appraisals where it is proposed to locate a casino near to an area of deprivation. In the event, this consideration has in no case been determinative.&#148;</p>

 British Army Gurkhas serve under their own unique terms and conditions of service, which include a pension scheme. The Gurkha Pension Scheme is based on the Indian Army model. It provides an immediate pension at Indian Army rates, according to rank, to every Gurkha who completes at least 15 years service, together with associated lump-sum payments. 15 years is the maximum length of service permitted to soldiers on the Gurkha engagement up to and including the rank of corporal. The pension increases for higher ranks, including Queen&#146;s Gurkha officers and longer service, but only WO1 and above can normally serve up to 22 years. Pensions are calculated in Indian Rupees  <br>

 As with other strands of discrimination legislation individuals of any age can enforce their employment rights through employment tribunals. Once the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) is established in October it will provide institutional support on age discrimination for the first time. The new Commission will be an independent influential champion whose purpose is to reduce inequality, eliminate discrimination, strengthen good relations between people and protect human rights. The CEHR will take an active role in helping to achieve change to benefit some of the most vulnerable and least well represented people in our society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="70227w0006.htm_para0"><a name="07022789000034">However, the Government are fully aware of the concerns expressed by farmers and growers that the abolition of SAWS will adversely impact upon their businesses by depriving the industry of a source of much needed seasonal workers.

<notus-date day="27" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><b>27 Feb 2007 : Column 1173W</b><br>
the Government decided that SAWS should not be phased out until 2010. This is to allow time for the industry to adapt to new sources of supply of workers from the new member states. It is evident from data collected by the Worker Registration Scheme that many farmers and growers are making this transition. According to the Accession Monitoring Report (produced by the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Communities and Local Government) between May 2004 to September 2006 some 56,000 workers from the A8 member states (excluding Cyprus and Malta) registered to work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="70227w0006.htm_para1"><a name="07022789000035">The Government appreciate that there may be occasions when, despite the availability of workers from the new member states, employers are still unable to recruit sufficient workers to meet their labour needs. The Government have therefore made provision under Tier 3 of the Points-Based System (PBS) for managed migration to set up short-term, quota-based schemes for workers from outside the EU to address temporary shortages. This will ensure that we can respond flexibly and quickly to meet shortages in the supply of workers when these cannot be met from the resident and EU labour force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="70227w0006.htm_para2"><a name="07022789000036">Together, these measures should ensure that the phasing out of SAWS will have a minimal impact on British agriculture.</p>

 As the Secretary of State said in his statement to the House on 19 February 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 29, our avian influenza policy is guided by scientific evidence. Scientific evidence is important because it provides the evidence base of our decision making process. The DEFRA Chief Scientific Advisor and, through him, Ministers are guided by expert and, as appropriate, additional independent advice.</p>

 Targeted surveillance for all types of avian influenza viruses in wild birds is in place throughout the UK and is ongoing. The targeted surveillance focuses on species of wild birds that experts believe to have a greater potential role in the spread of avian influenza viruses. There is a comprehensive list which generally includes ducks, geese, swans, gulls and waders. Sampling is targeted to high priority surveillance areas, which have been chosen on the basis of abundance of migratory waterbird species and domestic poultry. Membersof the public can report dead swans, ducks, geese, waders and gulls by calling the Defra Helpline on 08459 33 55 77.</p>

Biofuel sales made up some 0.5 per cent. of total transport fuel sales in 2006. Monthly and annual UK fuel sales data are available via the HM Revenue and Customs website at http://www.uktrade info.com/index.cfm?task=bullhydro Sales of biofuels in 2007-08 will depend on a variety of factors, including the relative prices of crude oil and biofuel feedstocks. As a result of the introduction of the RTFO, sales of biofuels in 2008-09 should reach some 2.5 per cent. of total transport fuel sales, rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>

 It is rare for a waste private finance initiative (PFI) project to have just one technological solution or one waste processing facility. Essentially, PFI credits are awarded to authorities to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Once they have analysed sufficiently the technical, environmental and economic options, an authority can choose to deliver this diversion by adopting a range of waste management technological solutions.</p>

 The average contract length of a private finance initiative (PFI) project, which has an energy from waste facility as one of several waste management technology solutions, is approximately25 years. PFI credits are awarded to authorities primarily to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Most PFI projects use a combination of waste processing technologies rather than a single technology. Typically, energy from waste, as a waste processing option, is used in combination with other waste processing technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="70227w0010.htm_para0"><a name="07022789000444">A minimum tonnage of waste throughput is usually guaranteed throughout the contract period as funders, typically banks, would otherwise expose themselves to unconstrained waste volume risk over the term of the contract. Very recently, we have become aware that certain waste management companies with access to waste arising have been prepared to underwrite a block of plant capacity, thereby opening up the possibility of shorter contracts for smaller volumes.</p>

On 1 November 2006, the UK ambassador to Reykjavik led a diplomatic d&#233;marche of 25 countries (including Australia, Germany and the US) together with the European Commission, which called upon the Government of Iceland to reconsider its decision to resume commercial whaling, arguing that the action was unjustified and unnecessary.</p>

Icelandic companies engaged in significant trade with the UK and other EU countries have suggested that the potential gains from commercial whaling are minimal, compared to the damage that might be done to Icelandic trade in other goods and services.</p>

1. Fraud and error in incapacity benefit is not measured every year. The last full review was in 2000-01. As there has been no measurement in other years, it is assumed that the percentage level of fraud and customer error have remained constant. All of the fraud and customer error estimates are calculated by applying the percentage overpaid in 2000-01 to the annual expenditure on incapacity benefit.<br>
2. Official error in incapacity benefit has been measured in every year since 2000-01.<br>
3. The official error estimates for 2004-05 and 2005-06 differ from those published in the relevant departmental resource accounts, as up to date estimates were not available at the time.<br>
4. As the measurement system is based on the examination of a sample of the incapacity benefit case load, the estimates are subject to a degree of statistical uncertainty. For example, the central estimate of official error in 2005-06 is &#163;90 million, but the range in which we can be 95 per cent. sure that the true value lies runs from &#163;70 million to &#163;120 million.<br>

<i> [holding answer 19 February 2007]:</i> Under our reforms, more people will be receiving state pensions based on their national insurance records, and there will be a more generous basic state pension due to the restoration of the earnings link. This provides a solid foundation for private saving. The guarantee credit will continue to provide a safety net and reforms to the savings credit will reduce the spread of means-testing and support the savings incentives that are an integral part of the reform package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="70227w0014.htm_para6"><a name="070227102000407">Raising the level of the basic state pension as specified would lead to a series of cliff-edges in the weekly amounts being received by different retirement cohorts in the same year. An individual who retires in 2009 with full entitlement would receive around &#163;84 (in 2007-08 earnings terms) of weekly basic pension income. In 2012, when earnings-uprating commences, this amount of basic pension would be worth around &#163;82 per week. This individual would then receive this amount each year of their retirement. However, another individual retiring in 2015 would receive &#163;100 in weekly basic pension income&#151;almost &#163;20 more per week than an individual retiring six years earlier. This disparity would continue to grow until 2030, when new retirees would receive &#163;115 per week.</p>

1. Estimates of additional expenditure are consistent with the policy detail set out in the regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Pensions Bill. Net costs include savings seen from reduced expenditure on other income-related benefits (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit). They do not include any change in income tax revenue or national insurance.<br>
2. The costs of raising the basic state pension as described are additional to the costs of pension reform set out in the regulatory impact assessment. They assume the basic state pension is uprated by earnings from 2012, and is set at the levels specified in the question for new retirees only. That is, an individual would retire with a given level of basic state pension, and maintain that level (in earnings terms) throughout their retirement. They would not benefit from the higher rates in later years as specified in the question.<br>
3. Net costs assume the pension credit standard minimum guarantee is uprated by earnings from 2008, and the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015.<br>

 It is for the Court of Appeal or the Sentencing Guidelines Council to issue guidance to courts about sentencing practice. Criminal Justice Ministers made a statement to the National Criminal Justice Board on 23 January 2007, which included a reference to the sentencing principles set out in legislation. The Senior Presiding Judge, who sits on the Board, agreed with the Lord Chief Justice that the statement should be drawn to the attention of all judges and magistrates as they took the view that it was helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="70227w0021.htm_para0"><a name="070227105001199">The Sentencing Guidelines Council was set up in March 2004 and we are not aware of previous communication to the judiciary about sentencing guidelines. But the statement to the National Criminal Justice Board is not unprecedented. For instance, a similar statement was issued in November 2002 by the then Home Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Attorney-General.</p>

 Monitoring of sentencing guidelines is primarily a matter for the Sentencing Guidelines Council. It is not possible to make an estimate of the proportion of cases where sentencing guidelines were not followed in individual sentencing decisions, particularly when there have so far been few offence specific sentencing guidelines published. The Sentencing Guidelines Council publishes information about sentencing trends and monitors decisions of the Court of Appeal for those cases where an appeal involves consideration of the application of a guideline.</p>

The monitors are put in place to gauge whether aircraft comply with the departure noise limits specified in the noise abatement notice for Heathrow under Section 78(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. The noise limits apply at a distance of 6.5 kilometres from aircraft &#145;start of roll&#146;, so the location of the fixed monitors is relatively close to the airport; it does not extend to Wandsworth. Compliance is reviewed regularly through the Noise and Track Keeping Working Group, and data is published annually in BAA&#146;s Flight Evaluation Reports.

(ERCD Report 0406, available on the CAA website, shows the location of both fixed and mobile monitoring sites over recent years.)

 The only change which has been brought forward recently to the legislation on private hire vehicles (PHVs) in London which will affect PHV work for local authorities, is in section 54 of the Road Safety Act 2006. This will bring into the licensing regime in London currently unlicensed PHV operators, drivers and proprietors who carry specific groups&#151;including under local authority contracts&#151;rather than the general public. A three-month consultation exercise in was carried out in 2004 before including this change in the Road Safety Bill.

 The new measures in the Children Act 2004 and the Children (Private Arrangements for Fostering) Regulations 2005, strengthened the private fostering notification scheme which was introduced under the Children Act 1989. These measures came into effect in July 2005. The Government have agreed that, at a suitable point during the lifetime of the new provisions, they will publish a report on the impact of the new measures in the Act, including an indication of whether the Government are minded to move towards a registration scheme. Sections 45 and 47 of the Children Act 2004 make provisions which allow the Government to introduce a registration scheme in England at any point within four years of the Act receiving Royal Assent. The report will therefore be prepared and published in time for Parliament to consider the matter by November 2008.</p>

There have been numerous discussions about the proposals too.

Prior to 2004-05, the count of occasions was based on each record of suspension identified by the education and library boards, and in some instances longer periods of suspension may have had more than one record. This change is due to an improvement in the data collection systems for suspensions in the education and library boards, which has enabled better analysis of the data. As a result, e number of occasions pupils were suspended in 2004-05 has decreased from previous years.

The new measures include: the use of personal identifiers by postal voters; the new offence of falsely applying for a postal vote; the requirement in all cases for a reason to be given if postal ballot papers are to be sent to a different address to that at which the postal voter is registered; a marked register of returned postal votes; and new secrecy warnings on postal voting documents.</p>

 We are unable to provide a figure for an average hourly rate. The legal aid schemes provide for a variety of ways in which lawyers can be remunerated, including fixed, standard, and graduated fees, individual contract rates and prescribed hourly rates. In successful civil cases, where an order may be made for payment of costs by the opponent, providers may be remunerated at market rates. Barristers' fees are generally not set by reference to hourly rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="70227w0028.htm_para4"><a name="07022811000136">Where hourly rates are used, different hourly rates are set out in regulations and contracts depending on whether the case is civil or criminal, the tribunal or court where representation is provided and on other factors. Providers can also claim enhancements and uplifts, depending on, for example, matter type, complexity, or seniority of fee earner. As part of our legal aid reform programme we are extending the categories of work that are covered by fixed, standard and graduated fees.</p>

 The Department does not collect data centrally on the use and disposal of radioactive materials by hospitals. The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 requires that hospitals register their use and storage of radioactive materials and hold authorisation for disposal and accumulation of radioactive waste. Under these structures, the registered users maintain detailed local records of use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials. The Environment Agency maintains information on the individual registrations and authorisations, which include the maximum limits on radioactivity permitted. In addition, the Agency hold records related to waste radioactive materials through the pollution inventory.</p>

The waste is mostly disposed of by decay, with extreme dilution to watercourses (where strict measures are used to estimate the rate of discharge and ensure that drinking water is never put at risk), as waste for incineration or by dilution in other waste for local authority disposal. As a consequence of these methods of disposal there is no significant burden to the low-level waste repository.</p>

 The provision of in-year financial support or brokerage is no longer permitted. Deficits in national health service organisations must rest where they fall. In 2006-07, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have the power to agree a resource top-slice from their primary care trusts in order to create a reserve which the SHA may then use to balance the overall financial position across its economy.

 Plans originally developed in autumn 2004 assumed that all deployments of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) delivered through the national programme for information technology would be completed by the end of March 2007.

Despite this delay the majority of installations, including 100 per cent. of those planned in London and the south of England, will have been completed by this date, in line with plans for 100 per cent. completion across the national health service in England by the end of 2007.</p>

 The answer to the hon. Member&#146;s recent Parliamentary Question on estimating the fiscal impact of people taking ASP was answered on the 20 February as follows:</p>
<a name="70227w0037.htm_brev7"><a name="07022818001313"><ul><p class="tabletext">Alternatively secured pensions were introduced to meet the specific needs of certain religious groups that have a principled religious objection to the pooling of mortality risk through annuities. As explained in the partial regulatory impact assessment published at pre-Budget report (Tax Relief for Pensions&#151;2006 pre-Budget report Reforms) the fiscal impact of introducing ASPs are part of the overall costs of pension simplification. Estimates of the overall Exchequer costs of pension simplification remain at &#163;25 million for 2006-07, rising to &#163;250 million in 2010-11.</p>

 The 2006 pre-Budget report announced that the Government will move forward with the implementation of the Planning-gain Supplement (PGS) if, after further consultation, it continues to be deemed workable and effective. To maintain critical links to local delivery, the Government will ensure that in England at least 70 per cent. of PGS revenues are recycled to the local authority area in which they are raised, to fund additional infrastructure.
