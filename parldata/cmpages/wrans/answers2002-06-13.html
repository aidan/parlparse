<a name="20613w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Palmer:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on restructuring NATO's forces in the Balkans; and if he will make a statement. [62522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20613w01.html_spnew0"><B> Geoffrey Hoon:  </B> 
At our meeting in Brussels on 6 June, NATO Defence Ministers approved a series of changes to SFOR and KFOR following the Joint Operational Area (JOA) Review.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para0">The Review advocates a regional approach to NATO's peacekeeping operations in the Balkans, whereby both Bosnia and Kosovo will be treated, for military planning purposes, as a single theatre. The security situation in the Balkans has changed since the initial deployment of SFOR and KFOR. NATO's operations will be restructured accordingly, to provide a smaller, lighter and more flexible force that will be better able to meet current challenges.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para1">Implementation of the JOA Review will take place over the next 12 months. It is planned that, by the end of 2002, SFOR will reduce from some 18,000 to some 12,000 personnel and KFOR from some 38,000 to some 32,000. By June 2003, it is envisaged that KFOR will reduce further to some 29,000 troops. Responsibilities for support of civil implementation will be transferred to local authorities and other international organisations, as appropriate. The United Kingdom welcomes the outcome of this review.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para2">This reduction in troop numbers does not signal any reduction in NATO's commitment to the Balkans. Rather, these changes are a sign of the Alliance's achievements to date in bringing security and stability to the Balkans. The United Kingdom, with the rest of NATO, remains committed to the security and stability of the Balkans and will continue to play its full role in achieving the international community's objectives for the region.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para3">Individual nations are now considering and discussing with one another how to adjust their troop contributions in the light of the JOA Review.

<P>
<a name="20613w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Levitt:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to offer immunisation against anthrax to the armed forces. [62523]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20613w01.html_spnew1"><B> Geoffrey Hoon:  </B> 
Following the delay to the voluntary immunisation programme against anthrax that was caused by difficulties at the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research, which was supplying the vaccine, the programme was re-launched for personnel deployed to the Gulf in May 2001. But continuing 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jun 2002 : Column 1346W</I><P>
uncertainty over the licensing of future supplies meant that it was not extended further to other members of the Armed Forces.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para4">The problems over the licensing of future supplies have now been resolved and the Ministry of Defence took delivery of the rest of the supplies that are required at the end of March this year. We are confident that there will be no difficulties with the future, large-scale production of the vaccine.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para5">It takes six months for immunisation against anthrax to become fully effective. But we may not have nearly so much warning of a change in the threat, nor of the requirement for British Armed Forces to deploy to a high threat area. Given that we cannot expect to predict exactly where or when a threat might arise, or which units of the Armed Forces might be called upon to respond. We have decided to expand the immunisation programme so that all Service personnel, including reserves, and those essential civilians who are likely to deploy on operations, are routinely offered immunisation against anthrax. We plan to expand the programme gradually over the next few years, beginning with those units that are held at the highest readiness.
<P>

<a name="20613w01.html_para6">Immunisation against anthrax is safe and effective. As before, and in keeping with long-standing medical practice, it will be offered to personnel on the basis of voluntary informed consent. By accepting it alongside their other defensive measures, this will ensure that they have the very best protection against anthrax used as a biological weapon.

<a name="20613w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie:  </B> 
US Station Commanders are responsible for security at their Stations and exercise day to day operational control over the Ministry of Defence Police in respect of site security duties. The Senior Police officer is responsible to the Chief Constable MDP in respect of the exercise of constabulary powers. MDP officers are currently deployed at RAF Alconbury, RAF Fairford, RAF Hythe, RAF Lakenheath, RAF Menwith Hill, US Navy London (Eastcote) and RAF Welford. These sites also had a MDP detachment on 1 May 1997.

<a name="20613w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie:  </B> 
Eight MDP officers stationed at bases made available to US Forces currently occupy housing made available by the Department. Although the officers are not paying rent, the accommodation has been made available in lieu of the payment of housing allowance.

All costs connected with MOD Police at RAF Fylingdales are met from the Defence Budget. The cost of the authorised complement of MDP at RAF Menwith Hill and related costs are recovered from the US Authorities. The complement was increased with effect from 1 February 2002. Until officers are posted in on a permanent basis to fill the newly completed posts, cover is maintained using officers on temporary detachment. Costs are recovered as though all posts were filled on a permanent basis, enhanced to cover the additional costs associated with the detached duty while it continues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) of 11 March 2002 <i>Official Report, </i> column 654W, on accommodation costs, what the cost was from April 2001 to March 2002 of hotel accommodation for departmental staff working away from home; how many members of staff were so accommodated in the year in question; and what the average cost was per paid-for night of these stays.

<a name="20613w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie:  </B> 
An accurate breakdown of rental and maintenance costs between occupied and empty Service Families Accommodation (SFA) is not available. Because of Service mobility, turnover of occupancy tends to be high and some properties may have several occupants over a relatively short period and various empty spells between occupants. However, on a proportionate basis, the current vacancy rate would indicate expenditure in the broad order of #20 million per annum in rent and #9 million in maintenance. Corresponding figures for a year ago would be #23 million rent and #11 million maintenance, and two years ago when #27 million rent and #14 million maintenance.
<P>

<a name="20613w02.html_para0">Of the current 8,600 empty properties in mainland UK, some 2,400 are in the course of disposal, 2,500 are held for future unit deployments and some 1,000 are empty awaiting modernisation. Others are available to incoming occupants or already under offer to them. Since January 2000, over 10,000 surplus properties have been disposed of.

The powers that permit tolling at the Dartford Crossing, contained in the Dartford Thurrock Crossing Act 1988, expire on 31 March 2003. However, it was announced on 4 April 2002 that we have decided to introduce a road user charging scheme at the Crossing using powers contained in the Transport Act 2000. The Act requires that the net revenues from the charging scheme be spent on transport projects. It is expected that the charging scheme will commence on 1 April 2003.

The Fourth Preparatory Committee meeting for the World Summit on Sustainable Development gives us a basis for the final run up to Johannesburg. Progress was made on a Programme of Action, which includes the importance of sanitation in eradicating poverty and meeting the Millennium Development Goal on safe drinking water. Broad agreement was also reached on key issues such as the urgent need to restore fish stocks and address illegal fishing, and on the important role non-governmental actors can play in achieving sustainable development. The meeting also recognised the need for a strong focus on Africa.

The Commission made a wide range of recommendations relating to the England Rural Development Programme. These referred to the agri-environment schemes, to the Vocational Training Scheme, to the Processing and Marketing Grant, to Hill Farm Allowance, and to the Rural Enterprise Scheme. The commission also advocates a shift in the overall balance of Common Agricultural Policy support between production subsidies and rural development measures. The recommendations would involve a range of different timescales for implementation, and the administrative costs involved in each would depend on a number of further decisions on the manner of implementation. For that reason it is not possible at this stage to give an assessment of the costs of the Policy Commission recommendations as a whole. We will publish our response to the recommendations in the Autumn.

We are determined that keepers of vehicles should take full responsibility for them. The Finance Bill includes enabling powers to reform the vehicle registration and licensing system to improve the accuracy of the vehicle record and thus to ensure that those who abandon cars can more easily be brought to book. The Government intend to consult motoring groups and other stakeholders on detailed reforms. The maximum penalty for abandoning a vehicle is a fine of #2,500 or three months' imprisonment or both.

The mandate of the Management Committee for oils and fats is to assist the Commission in the management of the common organisation of the market for oils and fats as established by Article 37 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 136/66. The Committee has met 17 times over the last 12 months and one official attends; the cost of this attendance to public funds over the last year was #8,500. The Committee considers matters relating to the management of the market for fats and oils.

<a name="20613w04.html_para1">Together with Member States, the Commission is currently conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of comitology committees into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to Xsimplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission". As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February (Com (2001) 783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government has encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agenda and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.

There are stringent controls in place to deal with fly tipping, which is a criminal offence. In the event of a conviction, severe penalties are available to the courts, including an unlimited fine and/or imprisonment of up to 5 years. The Environment Agency or the local authority have powers to remove fly-tipped waste and to recover their costs from those responsible.<P>

The Agency is currently working to establish a central unit to co-ordinate its approach to environmental crime. This unit will work with other key enforcement bodies, such as local authorities, the Police and HM Customs and Excise, and will target particular environmental and economic threats such as fly tipping.<P>

The Darwin Initiative is a #3 million annual programme of grants which was launched at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. It uses UK expertise to help countries that are rich in biodiversity but poor in resources to help safeguard the world's biodiversity. Information on the total funding for each project is contained in the reports on the Darwin Initiative covering the periods from 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01. The first three are already available in the House of Commons Library. I am arranging for copies of the fourth report to be placed in the House Library. The fifth Annual report, covering the period 2001 to 2002 will be published on 17 June 2002. I will also arrange for a copy to be placed in the House Library.

<i>[holding answer Monday 10 June 2002]: </i>Statutory requirements for the provision of subtitling on Channel 3 and Channel 5, and for the provision of subtitling and sign language translation on digital terrestrial television (DTT) services are included in the 1990 and 1996 Broadcasting Acts respectively. The targets for DTT services are that 80 per cent. of programming should be subtitled and 5 per cent. signed by the tenth anniversary of the start of the service. The

recently published draft Communications Bill (Cm 5508&#150;1) extends these targets on DTT to digital cable and digital satellite channels.
<P>

<a name="20613w07.html_para5">In setting these targets, we have aimed to strike the right balance between practicability and benefit. It would be extremely difficult and expensive to meet 100 per cent. targets. In addition, there are a number of unresolved technical issues in the development of a reliable closed signing system, and resultant problems caused by open signing. We believe that the current targets are challenging but achievable, but will keep them under regular review.

In 2001 the Department delivered Regional Selective Assistance and Training grant offers totalling #35 million. The Department also spent about #2 million last year on various other projects to promote competitiveness and productivity improvements in the sector. The Department is continuing to support process improvements through the SMMT Industry Forum and research and development through the Foresight Vehicle Programme with commitments to date exceeding #13 million.

The Government is committed to a strong UK aerospace and defence industry and my Department is very supportive of this important prestigious event which plays an important role in maintaining the UK's pre-eminent role in the world's aerospace industry. This year, my Department is not providing any financial support to the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), organisers of the Farnborough International Air Show to fund inward missions. One application was made to Trade Partners UK under the national inward mission scheme, but this did not meet the required criteria. The Defence Export Services Organisation, part of the Ministry of Defence, makes arrangements for the attendance of official overseas defence delegations to Farnborough International and is supporting the event this year.

The proceedings of the Joint Committee on the draft Communications Bill are webcast as part of a one-year pilot project covering proceedings in the chambers of both Houses, sittings of the House in Westminster Hall, and public proceedings of certain select and joint committees. The pilot project is due to run until the end of December 2002 and is specifically intended as a means by which the general public can follow proceedings in Parliament. It is not accessible via the PDVN since the volume of electronic traffic that might be generated could affect the quality of day to day services on PDVN.
<P>

<a name="20613w13.html_para2">Once the pilot project has come to an end, an assessment will be made of its value. If a webcasting service is to be provided in the long term, a decision will be taken on whether access will be made available within Parliament, bearing in mind any further investment which would be needed. The hon. Gentleman may want to raise the matter with the Broadcasting and Information Committees later in the year, as the pilot project comes to a close.

As an example, campaign spend on Working Families Tax credit since its introduction in October 1999 has increased awareness of WFTC, with advertising awareness peaking at 68 per cent of the target audience in December 2000.

Dissent amongst RCD-Goma ranks has been reported at several locations, in particular in Kisangani on 14 May and in the Hauts Plateaux since February. Information remains incomplete. It is clear however, that the rebellions have resulted in an unacceptable loss of life and that the local civilian populations have suffered. We have supported EU and UN statements condemning the violent response of the RCD-Goma leadership in Kisangani and calling on Rwanda to use its influence to calm the situation. My right hon.

British officials paid a third visit to Guantanamo Bay between 27 and 31 May. The purpose of the visit was to ask questions relevant to national security, to confirm the identity and nationality of two British detainees transferred there in May and to check on the welfare of all seven British detainees. The officials were from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Security Service.
<P>

<a name="20613w14.html_para4">The officials met the detainees individually. US officials were able to observe the interviews. One detainee has sustained injuries in Afghanistan. He and the US authorities confirmed that he was receiving medical treatment for them. The other detainees appeared to be in satisfactory physical health, though some of them complained of ailments, which are being addressed. Some detainees raised concerns about their status and other aspects of their detention and conditions at Guantanamo, which British officials discussed with the camp authorities. The officials saw no visible sign of mistreatment.
<P>

<a name="20613w14.html_para5">British officials delivered to the camp authorities letters from some of the detainees' families to be passed to the detainees. Some of the detainees asked the officials to relay oral messages to their families. We have passed them and the details of the detainees' circumstances to their families. Personal details are not disclosed in the answer for reasons of privacy. The detainees confirmed that they were able to send and receive letters to and from their families through the camp authorities and through the International Committee of the Red Cross.

<P>

<a name="20613w14.html_para6">All detainees were now housed in recently-built indoor accommodation including individual sleeping, toilet and washing facilities and air-conditioning.

The foremost principle is that funding must follow the learner. Other principles of the funding system are that it should: be easy to understand, determine funding rates fairly, and be simple in design and administration. It must have the flexibility to cope with provision ranging from full-time classroom learning to on-line learning at home. These principles are based on the extensive consultation carried out by this Department in 1999&#150;2000 and confirmed by the Department and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in November 2000. We have built on the best elements of the former Further Education Funding Council's national system of formula based funding and the LSC are committed to introduce a single non-bureaucratic system. In 2003&#150;04 further education, work based learning for young people, school sixth forms and adult and community learning will be funded through systems which follow the same principles. The LSC will develop the common funding approach further and plan a single funding system for all the main post-16 learning routes in 2004&#150;05.

<P>
<a name="20613w16.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge:  </B> 
The National Childcare Strategy offers substantial resources to develop childcare facilities in all areas, including rural communities. The Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative, which is part of the Strategy, encompasses rural communities and was launched in 2001 to create 45,000 childcare places in the most disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, an additional #22 million has been allocated for a round of smaller Sure Start programmes, delivered through Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships (EYDCPs). These new Mini-Sure Starts will provide additional resources to new Neighbourhood Nurseries and existing childcare facilities in rural areas, small towns, and pockets of disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="20613w16.html_para1">DfES Officials are working closely with the Countryside Agency to maximise support for rural areas and policies which take the needs of rural areas into account in accordance with the Rural White Paper.

The revised National Curriculum requires all pupils aged 5 to 14 to be taught Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and we have a target of 85 per cent. of 14 year olds reaching National Curriculum level 5 or above by 2007. To support schools in reaching this target we have, in particular, a strategy at Key Stage 3 which is currently in pilot and will be rolled out to all schools in the next academic year.

<a name="20613w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis:  </B> 
The New Opportunities Fund ICT teacher training programme is to ensure that serving teachers feel confident and are competent to teach using ICT within the curriculum, with the aim of raising the standards of pupils' achievements. This is probably the largest scale teacher training programme in the world and over 96 per cent. of eligible teachers and over 99 per cent. of schools have already signed up for the training in England.
<P>

<a name="20613w16.html_para3">However, the programme still has 18 months left to run and it is therefore too early to assess the full effectiveness and to say whether the training is having the desired impact on classroom practice.
<P>

<a name="20613w16.html_para4">However, the recent Ofsted report highlighted a number of positive things about the training, namely that the scheme has raised the profile of ICT training in many schools; has helped teachers to improve their ICT skills significantly and that there has been an unprecedented willingness in the teaching profession to embrace ICT.
<P>

<a name="20613w16.html_para5">The Ofsted report also raised concerns that the training has not had as widespread an effect on classroom practice as might be reasonably expected at this stage of the programme. My Department will be working with NOF and the TTA to ensure that these concerns are addressed and that we establish the most effective support for teachers who are crucial to the successful implementation of the overall ICT Schools programme.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> The means test for students in higher education takes account of the income of resident step-parents only where the step-parent has legally adopted the student. Where parents are separated or divorced it is for the LEA to decide which parent's income should be assessed. Where the resident parent's income is assessed, payments made by the non-resident parent to support the student or the household are included as part of the income assessment.

The proportion of young people from the three lowest socio-economic groups participating in higher education rose from 10 per cent. when loans were introduced in 1990 to 17 per cent. in 1998 when the new student support arrangements were introduced. The proportion had risen to 18 per cent. in 2000, the latest year for which data are available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20613w17.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Hodge:  </B> 
My Department has not commissioned a survey which includes estimates of student debt since the Student Income and Expenditure Survey of 1998&#150;99. The next Survey is planned for 2002&#150;03. Recent data on anticipated debt are available from the UNITE/MORI poll conducted in late 2001, which suggest today's students expect average debt on graduation of #8,133. Indicative figures in the 2002 Nat West Money Matters Survey suggest graduates in 2002 will leave with average debts of #10,000.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jun 2002 : Column 1415W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20613w17.html_para7">A significant part of the debt arises from borrowing through the Student Loan Company. Repayment relates directly to earnings and the interest charged only reflects inflation. However, some debt is incurred in commercial borrowing to support a higher level of expenditure. These figures have to be considered in the context of graduates currently earning around 35 per cent. more than the national average and potentially #400,000 more over their working lives.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]: </i>The most comprehensive information on the social composition of entrants to undergraduate courses in higher education is taken from data collected by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). Although it is accepted that not all entrants or undergraduate courses use the UCAS route. UCAS assigns social class to applicants based upon the occupation of the parent with the highest income in the applicants household, as reported by the potential student. For applicants aged 21 or over, the occupation of the person contributing the highest income to the household is used.

Other information on the social composition of higher education entrants is also available from the Youth Cohort Study (YCS), a series of longitudinal surveys of young people that track their activities in the years immediately after they have completed compulsory education. The YCS is a sample survey of young people that employs a socio-economic group (SEG) classification that differs from the social class breakdown used by UCAS. Therefore, the two sources of information are not directly comparable.<P>

<P>

<a name="20613w18.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn:  </B> 
We have considered with the Law Society strategies to promote a high quality service for youth justice cases. We are keen to see extension of the existing specialisation of solicitors in some areas, but this is more difficult to achieve outside large metropolitan areas.

On personal application being made at one of its seven passport offices, in an emergency the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) can replace a lost or stolen passport on the same day, or early the following day. The circumstances considered by the UKPS to be an emergency are:
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para0">&#151;Compassionate grounds&#151;where the applicant is travelling abroad because of the death or serious illness of a family member or friend; or for hospital treatment; and where travel has been arranged for the seriously ill, and their carers by charitable organisations.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para1">&#151;Urgent business travel which can be confirmed by a supporting company letter.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para2">&#151;Where the passport has been stolen within the last week and travel has already been booked and paid for. In such cases evidence such as a crime reference report or reference number is sought.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para3">In all these circumstances the United Kingdom Passport Service will require time to complete the necessary identity and eligibility checks to confirm the issue of a replacement passport. If it is not possible in such circumstances to complete all these checks, a passport restricted to 12 months validity may be granted.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para4">The same day (premium) service now available from UKPS public counters is not normally available for applications to replace lost, stolen, damaged or unavailable passports, as access to the original issue file and possible further identity checks may be required.

Inter-agency guidance on the strategic management of complex child abuse investigations is published today in response to Recommendation 22 of XLost in Care", the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the abuse of children in care in the former county council areas of Gwynedd and Clwyd since 1974.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para7">This new guidance builds on the key principles for investigating organised or multiple abuse set out in the Government's child protection guidance XWorking Together to Safeguard Children", published in 1999. It has been developed by an inter-agency working group, chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which drew together the experience of a number of police forces, local authorities and voluntary organisations which have been closely involved in undertaking complex child abuse investigations.
<P>

<a name="20613w19.html_para8">The guidance is aimed primarily at the police and social services. It focuses on the specific issues highlighted in Recommendation 22 of access to records and information-sharing, and it also provides practical advice on key inter-agency issues such as setting up and closing an investigation, victim and witness support and media handling. The guidance also addresses concerns raised by those who have questioned the investigative methods used in inquiries, including the methods used to contact potential witnesses and the treatment of alleged offenders.

<a name="20613w20.html_spnew6"><B> Advocate General:  </B> 
No cases have been brought against either me or my right hon. Friend the Secretary of state for Scotland under the Human Rights Act 1998. Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge.
<P>

<a name="20613w20.html_para4">In Scotland human rights points may arise as Xdevolution issues" as defined in paragraph 1, Part I of schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998 and since May 1999 over 1,400 devolution issues have been intimated to me.
<P>

<a name="20613w20.html_para5">We do not collect information centrally about the costs to public funds, legal fees or compensation payments in cases which include a human rights issue. In most cases it would be difficult to single out associated costs relating to the human rights element.

<P>
<P>

The prescribing duties of general practitioners are set out in the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992.

1. Staff in post figures are rounded to the nearest ten. Population rates are rounded to the nearest whole number and five decimal place. Due to rounding totals may not equal the sum of component parts.<P>

2.

The responsibility for ensuring that emergency services, including the provision of emergency theatres, are staffed according to the demand for emergency care, lies with individual trusts. Normally, trusts who provide a 24 hour emergency service will have a core theatre team to cover emergency surgery and an additional complement of staff Xon-call" to supplement the core team if required. This aspect is not Xregulated" as such, but will form part of trusts' clinical governance and risk management programmes. The Commission for Health Improvement audit and inspection includes the organisation and standards of emergency care provided by trusts.

<i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]: </i>Over the last 18 months we have spent #100 million on modernising National Health Service dentistry. #10 million of this was for the dental care development fund and the dentistry action plan fund to support local plans to improve access. This money enables health authorities to assist dentists seeking to set up new practices and to expand and modernise existing ones. Furthermore, the #35 million Modernisation Fund provided grants for dentists to improve facilities.

We have no plans to issue any guidance to strategic health authorities or primary care trusts on minimum levels of chiropody and podiatry services. However, chiropody/podiatry services are essential parts of the national service frameworks for older people and diabetes.

Information in medical or other clinical records may be released without the knowledge and consent of the patient concerned where the information concerned does not identify him or her. Where the information might identify the patient any release must satisfy the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and if the information is also held under obligations of confidentiality any release must comply with common law requirements. Additionally, the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 must be satisfied, there must not be a statutory prohibition against the release of information and, in the case of a public sector body, the body must have the <i>vires</i> to release information for the purpose in question.
