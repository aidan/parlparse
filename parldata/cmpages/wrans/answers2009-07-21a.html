<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para1"><a name="09072245001469">When the Treasury Solicitor, or counsel instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, acts for a Secretary of State, a Minister or a Government Department or agency, the client is the Crown itself (which is to say, the Crown in right of the Executive). There can be no conflict of interest in the legal professional sense in acting for a single client in more than one manifestation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para2"><a name="09072245001470">Occasionally, while acting for the Crown, the Treasury Solicitor is requested to act on behalf of bodies or persons who are not the Crown. These may be non-departmental public departments or, very occasionally, individual Crown servants having a personal legal interest in a matter or claim. In such cases, where there is a possibility of conflict of interest, the Treasury Solicitor&#146;s Department operates under procedures that have been designed to be compliant with Lexcel, which is the Law Society&#146;s practice management standard. That standard embraces policy and practice in relation to conflict of interests. In pursuit of accreditation, the Department has prepared guidance for all its staff which explains the requirements of the Code and details procedures for identifying and handling potential conflicts of interest. Both the policy and the procedures are kept under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para3"><a name="09072245001471">The procedures have been designed to ensure that conflicts of interest are swiftly identified, the clients are informed and appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests of the parties concerned. Such steps may, where the interests of all parties cannot be properly safeguarded, involve the Department&#146;s declining to act for the non-Crown party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para4"><a name="09072245001472">In any case where the question of conflict of interest has arisen, the case work file will contain a record of the consideration and the outcome.</p>

 On 18 June, the Government published the latest UK Climate Projections. These projections show the potential changes in climate for the UK for a range of probabilities, climate variables and emissions scenarios. The data is provided by region to a scale of 25km grid squares in 30 year overlapping time slices, starting from the 30 year average between 2010-39. This data is freely available to all to make their own assessments of the likely effects of climate change. The Government have set the framework to allow local authorities to undertake their own assessments of the risks and effects from climate change into the future by including a new performance indicator (National Indicator 188 Planning to Adapt to Climate Change) in the local government performance framework. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 the Government are required to undertake a risk assessment of the impacts of climate change on the UK. The results of this risk assessment will include an assessment by region and is expected to be published in 2012.</p>

1. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the environmental effects of the proposed new surface water drainage charge system. [288125]</p>

<p><a name="st_228"><a name="09072245001993"><a name="90721w0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="09072245005158"><b>Huw Irranca-Davies:</b>
 In 2003, following a review of the various options, Ofwat recommended that charging in relation to site area is the fairest approach to charging for surface water drainage. The larger the site area, the more surface water is likely to drain from it. Charging by site area therefore better reflects the actual costs imposed on the system by customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para2"><a name="09072245001994">Charging by site area is also considered to be the most environmentally responsible approach in that it provides a financial incentive for site owners to reduce the amount of water that is directed into the public sewerage system. Options for achieving reductions include such things as: replacing an asphalt or concrete car parking area with a gravel one, and the installation of soakaways. This will reduce the likelihood of flooding from overloaded sewers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para3"><a name="09072245001995">Surface water drainage needs to be managed more sustainably, by allowing for the increased capture and reuse of water, slow absorption through the ground, and more above-ground storage and routing of surface water separate from the foul sewer, where it is appropriate to do so. Water should increasingly be managed on the surface, rather than relying on the wholesale upgrade of the sewer system which would be a costly and lengthy process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para4"><a name="09072245001996">The Environment Agency has estimated that around two-thirds of the flooding in summer 2007 was due to surface water. Surface water flooding is extremely difficult to predict as it is often a result of sudden localised rainfall events, and very small variations in the built environment can have significant effects on the way the water flows.</p>

 The Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process exists to address unforeseen capability gaps for imminent or current operations. Over 70 UORs for Afghanistan were approved in the period 13 July 2008 to 13 July 2009. We would generally expect these programmes to begin delivering capability to Theatre between six to 18 months after approval. We would not, therefore, expect the majority of requirements associated with these programmes to be fully met within the period stated in the question.</p>

Most of the fatalities listed above for Iraq occurred before 15 December and so were not covered in that statement.

In a relatively small number of cases, their injury or condition may mean that they become permanently unable to deploy. Reasons for this are various, but might include a serious permanent injury (physical or mental) or because during service they develop a medical condition that is incompatible with front line duties.</p>

In clear-cut cases where the individual's fitness falls below the service employment and retention standards, the board will recommend a medical discharge without further delay. In many cases however, the patient will first be downgraded, to allow for treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. For personnel who do not make a total recovery, the board may recommend the patient is retained as permanently downgraded with limited duties, or they may recommend a medical discharge.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what provision has been made for the psychological rehabilitation of members of the armed forces returning from military operations; how much funding has been made available for such provision in 2009-10; and if he will make a statement; [288590]</p>

 Diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in the armed forces is performed by fully trained and accredited mental health personnel, and measures are in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate the development of operational stresses. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide the necessary in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out or in-patient basis in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para0"><a name="09072245002467">In the UK, our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care, primarily through our 15 military departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental health care. The DCMH mental health teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available (including psychological therapies, environmental adjustment and medication) where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para1"><a name="09072245002468">For the relatively small number of patients who need it, in-patient care is currently provided by a group of seven NHS trusts located throughout England and Scotland, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust (SSSFT) through a central MOD contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para2"><a name="09072245002469">The organisational structure of the Defence Medical Services means that comprehensive figures for mental health care expenditure cannot be provided without disproportionate cost as the sums involved are disaggregated and embedded in the budgets of individual military units and overall operational budgets. Under the contract with SSSFT, payment for in-patient care is made on a case-by-case basis; as a point of comparison, payments totalling &#163;3.3 million were made for in-patient care in 2008-09; most of this was paid to the previous in-patient provider.</p>

 The Healthcare Commission reported its review of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) in March 2009. As part of that review it looked at the provision of mental health care and visited military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) in Plymouth, Lisburn and Cranwell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para4"><a name="09072245002473">All three Defence Medical Services have processes for inspecting DCMHs, utilising a Common Healthcare Assurance Framework which is based on the Department of Health&#146;s &#147;Standards for Better Health&#148;.

 Service personnel who are identified as suffering from a mental health condition will be followed up or referred on by the medical staff who first had contact with them. Some personnel will have their conditions managed wholly by primary care staff, who also have the capability to downgrade medically personnel if required; to treat and refer on personnel to military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs); or to liaise with DCMH staff if advice is required, including cases where direct referral to an in-patient facility might be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para5"><a name="09072245002476">Patients are provided with appropriate treatment and care.

 Personnel who are referred to one of the military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) will undergo a routine biopsychosocial assessment which will comprise an interview with a mental health professional. This usually takes the form of a one-to-one interview, although further reports (for example, from medical providers or from the chain of command) may be requested and psychometric questionnaires might be used where appropriate. The initial DCMH assessment will focus not just on the problem that led to referral but will take a holistic approach to the difficulties that an individual might be experiencing at the time of referral.</p>

There is no requirement to hold data on average flying hours. The figures are agreed in Joint Business Agreements (JBAs) between Front Line Commands (FLCs) and the Defence Equipment and Support organisation, and are forecast up to a year ahead. The month by month Profile is to enable forward resource planning within the overall total for the year, not a definitive prediction of requirements, which will vary during the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para1"><a name="09072245003514">&#147;Actual&#148; hours are the total of all hours flown for training and on operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para2"><a name="09072245003515">The reasons why actual hours may be less than planned include aircraft unavailability through routine maintenance, running repairs, essential upgrades and modification programmes; air crew unavailability through recuperation, absence on training courses, and leave; changes in training schedules; adverse weather; or cancellation of tasking. Taskings on operations clearly depend on mission requirements at any given time, which are difficult to predict several months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para3"><a name="09072245003516">Flying hours required for training are managed within this framework by the FLCs but priority is given to operations.</p>

 The United Kingdom is fully supportive of this Estonian-hosted Cyber Defence initiative and their endeavours in this important area. However, given the need to co-ordinate Cyber Defence with a number of other Government Departments and Allies, the MOD&#146;s preferred means of support is by participation in specific mutually beneficial workstreams rather than attach personnel permanently to Estonia. The United Kingdom is not formally a sponsoring nation of this Centre of Excellence but this position will be kept under review.</p>

your request for a list of the drug seizures made by Royal Naval vessels since 1997; where the seizures took place; and what the value of each seizure was. In the course of this research, US officials have been consulted, who have kindly shared information from their own very detailed records.</p>

The Royal Navy conducts Flag State Verification procedures on Gulf Region Shipping and has also provided significant support to US counter narcotics operations in the Caribbean. Further disruption operations are conducted whenever opportunities arise during the Royal Navy's standing patrol tasks, including within UK territorial waters, in support of operations led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. These operations have contributed to the seizure of large quantities of illegal narcotics which otherwise might have ended up on UK, US and European streets. A comprehensive list of seizures since 1997 is set out below. This information updates previous estimates and draws on additional information provided by US law enforcement officials.</p>

Our previous answers were drawn from figures often estimated by the UK vessel at the time of the interdiction; subsequent investigations by law enforcement officials would usually have been completed after the UK vessel had left the vicinity and thus not reflected in the initial UK estimate. For interdictions when cargoes were jettisoned by the traffickers we have continued to provide the sizes assessed by the UK crew before the contraband was lost.</p>

In some cases these omissions are due to different approaches by individual UK ships in recording an incident as a &#145;seizure&#146; or as an &#145;interdiction&#146; (which may have resulted in a jettison). In others cases the reliance upon disparate ships' records may have resulted in a small number of accidental omissions as our historic responses were consolidated. The positive outcome is that the Royal Navy has had an even greater impact on narcotics trafficking than previously reported.</p>

seized drugs would have been intended for the UK, however for simplicity the estimated values in the table are based on the assumption that the product would have reached the UK with street values of &#163;40,000 per kilogram of cocaine, of &#163;45,000 per kilogram of heroin and of &#163;2,880 per kilogram of cannabis.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]: </i>The Department for Transport uses valuations to assess changes: either to the costs of congestion over time, or for particular interventions.

This looked at the costs of additional road congestion as it is predicted to increase over time, rather than the absolute costs of congestion. It estimated that the increase in time lost in England due to road congestion between 2003 and 2025 for all travellers including business and freight would be worth &#163;23 to &#163;24 billion by 2025 in 2002 prices.</p>

 Journey time is only one of the factors that people consider when they are making a choice about how to travel. Other factors include reliability, frequency and price. The Department for Transport has not carried out a detailed assessment of comparative journey times by rail and air, however the evidence does point to passengers making rail their first choice when it can provide a fast and convenient service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="90721w0027.htm_para6"><a name="09072245004835">For example passengers on short-haul trips to European destinations are already increasingly turning to rail where that is an attractive option. Flights to Paris have fallen by over 20 per cent. since 2000, and flights to Brussels by over one third. Increasing the speed of trains within the UK can also have benefits. The journey time between Manchester and London has decreased from nearly three hours in 2007 to around two hours now. The number of rail passengers between Manchester and London increased by 64 per cent. between 2003 and 2008 from 2.1 million to 3.3 million per annum and over the same time period the number of air passengers has decreased from 1.9 million to 1.4 million, a 30 per cent. decrease.</p>

A survey by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 2008 reported that 10 businesses based in the UK and UK overseas territories had brought legal action on debts owed by heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), although creditors may litigate for a variety of reasons.</p>

It is impossible to calculate the exact spend on advertising Locate because the campaign combines a number of different travel safety messages, and local promotion initiatives have been funded from Posts&#146; devolved budgets.

1. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission took responsibility for the Child Support Agency (CSA) from the Department for Work and Pensions on 1 November 2009. As a result, information available on the number of managers and support staff working within the CSA for the 2008-09 year is limited as the existing organisational structure underwent significant change.<br>
2. There will be some managers shown as working for the CSA in the 2008-09 year who may have been working entirely within the new services offered by the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.<br>
3. Information on the numbers of Executive Support and Administration Staff can not be extracted from CSA data. An estimate of the number of staff deployed in those roles has therefore been provided. This estimate is extrapolated from the number of senior managers in the CSA for 2005 to 2007, and on the organisational design from 2007-08 and 2008-09.<br>
4. The Child Support Agency operates from six main sites with a supporting network of around 100 smaller sites.<br>

The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has several means which it can use to trace those non-resident parents who are evading their financial responsibilities, including contacting the DVLA, the Prison Location Service and credit reference agencies.

 1. Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website at:<br>
https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/Default.asp<br>
2. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
 3. Data are unrounded.<br>
 4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS vacancy survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
 5. Median duration is measured in days and is the median time between notification and closure of vacancies.<br>

<a name="90721w0041.htm_brev3"><a name="09072269002513"><ul><p class="tabletext">Early in the New Year, I wrote to you outlining a pilot we were running to allow vulnerable customers to make applications for Social Fund Crisis Loans (SFCLs) using Customer Access Points (CAPs or &#145;warm phones&#146;) in Jobcentres. This follows the Committee&#146;s recommendation in its 2006-07 report. We worked with the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union to agree these arrangements. The small pilot ran from 7 January to 28 March this year and we have now completed the evaluation, which I have attached.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev4"><a name="09072269002514"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our current procedures mean that, customers cannot use warm phones to make SFCL applications. This is because a customer could receive an adverse decision in an unscreened area and so, if aggrieved, could pose a risk to themselves, staff or other customers. This control measure is a key part of our agreement with the PCS on working in unscreened offices. The result is that, at present, some vulnerable customers&#151;who use a face-to-face procedure instead of our normal channel of making a telephone claim from home&#151;are referred to a screened office to receive their decision (be that favourable or adverse).</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev5"><a name="09072269002515"><ul><p class="tabletext">The main replacement control measures for the pilot, agreed with the PCS, meant that Floor Managers and Customer Care Officers were always aware of calls of this type, and&#151;crucially&#151;that the Decision Maker in the Benefit Delivery Centre would contact the Jobcentre on a dedicated telephone line if the application was about to be refused. This allows the Floor Manager and Customer Care Officers to be in place to offer any further assistance to the customer on receipt of an adverse decision. Given the potential risks, and PCS concerns to such an approach, we agreed to a small pilot which ran in five offices in Northumbria.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev6"><a name="09072269002516"><ul><p class="tabletext">During the three month pilot seven customers used the service, compared to two using the existing face-to-face service in the preceding 14 months in the whole Northumbria District. Four were awarded a Crisis Loan and there were no incidents of unacceptable customer behaviour linked to any of these customers.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev7"><a name="09072269002517"><ul><p class="tabletext">The qualitative evaluation revealed that Jobcentre staff locally were confident that this service was restricted to appropriately vulnerable customers; that they enjoyed the discretion and flexibility this service provided; and, that it was an improvement in access for those customers who are currently turned away or sent to a screened office for a face-to-face decision.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment she has made of the implications for nuclear safety regulation of the civil nuclear industry of the comparative inspection effort expended for the performance of inspection per nuclear power reactor set out in the extract from Committee on Nuclear Regulatory Activities of the Nuclear Energy Agency working group on inspection practices published in annex F of the paper presented to the Health and Safety Executive Board in January 2009, No. HSE/09/13.

 It is correct that the number of HSE nuclear inspectors per nuclear installation is less than most other countries with active nuclear programmes. This is not a recent development and is a consequence of the goal setting nature of the UK regulatory system with its emphasis on ensuring that nuclear operators understand the hazards of their activities and how to control them, and take full responsibility for nuclear safety on their sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_796"><a name="90721w0042.htm_para8"><a name="09072269001540">Unlike many foreign regulatory authorities referred to in the Nuclear Energy Agency reference, HSE&#146;s nuclear inspector resources are not used to develop detailed regulations that prescribe how the nuclear operators should carry out their business. The nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) sets safety goals that are embodied in the licence conditions for each nuclear licensed site and require the operators to make and implement arrangements to meet these goals. UK law holds the nuclear operators responsible for safety. The NII&#146;s role is to ensure that they meet this obligation. The law, however, gives the NII the powers to intervene when and where appropriate, and seek further improvements in nuclear safety where reasonably practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_797"><a name="90721w0042.htm_para9"><a name="09072269001541">The system requires highly experienced and technically qualified nuclear inspectors to operate efficiently and effectively. Government have agreed with HSE interim measures to ensure that the NII has the resources needed to continue to effectively meet current and future regulatory challenges. Furthermore, the Government are proposing, in their recent consultation document on the Restructuring of the Heath and Safety Executive&#146;s Nuclear Directorate, further measures to sustain this capability into the future.</p>

 The self-employment element of the six month offer was introduced on 6 April 2009 and provides substantial advice and support to enable people to move into self-employment or to start their own business. There is an active programme of intensive support delivered by Business Link in England by Flexible Support for Business in Wales and by Business Gateway and Training for Work in Scotland. Those moving into self-employment will be entitled to a self-employment credit made up of 16 weekly payments of &#163;50 to help with the transition into work and to underpin finances for the first few months of the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_814"><a name="90721w0045.htm_para3"><a name="09072269002004">There is no new deal for the self-employed although both the new deal for young people and the new deal 25-plus include options offering self-employment support. Under flexible new deal providers will also be able to provide self employment support. The new deal and six month offer routes into self employment are broadly similar. Both offer intensive support and advice to those who need it. To ease the transition into sustainable self-employment the new deals give customers an opportunity to undertake a period of test-trading for up to 26 weeks. Test trading enables the customer to begin work while remaining on benefits, whereas under the six month offer the self-employment credit is payable.</p>

In addition, two further methods will be used to inform a review of the policy at the end of 2009. First, the last half-yearly Omnibus Survey of local authorities contained questions which specifically asked them about the impact of these changes. Second, a survey has been running on the DWP website since 2 March, inviting stakeholders such as welfare rights agencies, local authority associations and housing organisations to submit their assessment of the effect of the new rules. This survey, which was devised with the assistance of key stakeholders and ends on 31 July, also includes a case study section so that respondents can contribute detailed information about the impact on individual cases.</p>

The factors considered when deciding whether or not to accept a recommendation from the Board are set out in directions given by the Secretary of State to the Board.

 Any death in prison custody is a tragic event. The Government, Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody.

This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures.

5 Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Staffordshire Police Force were only able to submit sample data for persons proceeded against and convicted at magistrates' courts for the year 2000. Although sufficient to estimate higher orders of data, these data are not robust enough at a detailed level and have been excluded from the table.<br>

 Once we phase in registration with the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA), there will be duties to check registration, and penalties for non-compliance. If, for example, a person permits staff to look after children under the age of eight in a crèche, it will be an offence if that person does not check that the staff are ISA-registered, or uses staff who are not ISA-registered, or knowingly uses staff who are barred from working with children.

 There is already a process for investigating such deaths or serious injury. Where a death in custody engages the investigative requirement in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the requirement would normally be met by means of an inquest or a combination of the inquest, criminal proceedings and serious case review. In addition, any death in custody will be the subject of an investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the case of a death or serious injury of a child who is looked after by a local authority, and where abuse or neglect is known or suspected to be a factor, the Local Safeguarding Children Board will consider whether a Serious Case Review (SCR) should be undertaken, as they would following the death of any child in those circumstances.

 Apart from the statutory elements of Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) that are included in National Curriculum Science, schools currently have flexibility to decide the content of SRE provided within Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). DCSF has provided a non-statutory programme of study indicating what it believes it is appropriate to include within PSHE which&#151;in Key Stage 4 (age 14 to 16)&#151;includes &#145;informing pupils about where they can go to obtain health information&#146;. This would include information, advice and treatment on contraception and sexual health issues. Subject to public consultation, the Government intend to make PSHE (and the programme of study that underpins it) statutory. First and foremost, however, the principal aim of SRE is to encourage young people to delay early sexual activity. Within secondary schools pupils are taught the skills to enable them to avoid being pressurised into unwanted or unprotected sex, and given factual information to enable them to negotiate safer sex when they do become sexually active. However, we make it clear in our &#147;Sex and Relationship Education Guidance&#148; (July 2000) to schools that any programme of study must be tailored to the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the children.</p>

Importantly, we involved young people fully in the review, many of whom told us that they did not have the knowledge they needed to make safe and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health.</p>

This will pay for six individual products to be featured, each of which contains a number of 'real-life' examples of the people who have used STEM and related skills in their manufacture.</p>

 Governing bodies of maintained schools in England are constituted under a stakeholder model which prescribes the percentage representation of each group on the governing body. They can vary in total size from nine to 20 members. It is not our intention to prescribe a smaller size. Each governing body will continue to be free to choose a membership of between nine and 20 which best suits their individual circumstances. We will, however, relax the percentages in the stakeholder model, while retaining safeguards to ensure that each stakeholder group is represented and that there is no reduction in the percentage of parent governors, to give further freedom to governing bodies to choose the optimal membership to meet their needs.</p>

It is not possible to produce such a projected analysis of similarly specific costs because of the scale of change in place in Ofsted; several major changes to Ofsted's organisational structure and operations will be implemented at the same time as the introduction of the new school inspection regime.

Currently, the annual saving as a result of the introduction of the new inspection regime is projected to be &#163;3.9m. This represents a 7.8% savings on the direct cost of the inspection of schools in 2008-09.

 The Geography, Science, Citizenship and History programmes of study within the new secondary curriculum provide opportunities for teachers to educate their pupils in issues related to international poverty, sustainable development, and cultural diversity.

 For more than a decade we have worked with the Teacher Training Agency, now the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), and training providers to secure the continuous quality improvement of Initial Teacher Training (ITT).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1146"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para0"><a name="0907235003885">The standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) were revised in 1998, 2002 and 2007 setting out progressively more demanding expectations of beginner teachers. Statutory requirements apply to all accredited providers of ITT to ensure training is designed to make sure new teachers have met all of the standards. The TDA uses quality categories derived from Ofsted inspections when allocating ITT places and funding to higher education institutions and school-based providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1147"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para1"><a name="0907235003886">In the 10 years that this allocation approach has been used in full, the percentage of undergraduate and Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) ITT places allocated to high quality ITT providers has increased from 68 to 96 per cent. This approach has helped secure positive results from the TDA&#146;s annual survey of newly qualified teachers. Currently 85 per cent. of primary newly qualified teachers and 86 per cent. of secondary newly qualified teachers rate their training as good or very good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1148"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para2"><a name="0907235003887">The outcomes of the first full inspections by Ofsted of the Graduate Teacher Programme will be available in the autumn of 2009 which will assess quality of training through that route. Since 2003 Teach First has brought into teaching many high quality graduates who would otherwise not have considered the profession. Ofsted said that some of their trainees were the best it had ever seen. Currently around half of teachers trained on this route remain in the profession at the end of their induction year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1149"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para3"><a name="0907235003888">The agency&#146;s special educational needs (SEN) and disability programme of work has been developed within the context of the Government&#146;s long-term strategy: &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148; (2004), the &#147;Children&#146;s Plan&#148; (December 2007) and other evidence. Resources have been put in place to ensure that all trainees are well-prepared to teach children and young people with SEN and disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1150"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para4"><a name="0907235003889">Since 2000 the agency has invested nearly &#163;20 million of its funding from the Department to support Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in initial teacher training alongside the Government&#146;s investment in ICT in schools. The aim is to ensure that all NQTs have strong skills in using ICT to support teaching and learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1151"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para5"><a name="0907235003890">TDA have worked with schools and ITT providers to ensure that ITT is up-to-date, responds rapidly to changes in the schools&#146; curriculum, that ITT partnerships are secure and that every trainee has effective school based training.</p>

Similar modules for secondary training were launched on 25 June 2009. PGCE materials are due to be launched later in 2009.</p>

Since the introduction of the current school inspection framework in September 2005 (commonly known as section 5), the recording of how lessons are organised has been based on discussions with the headteacher or teacher during the inspection, or by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may not, therefore, represent the way pupils are grouped in the school as a whole.</p>

Ofsted does not currently differentiate between setting, streaming and banding in the data collected during lesson observations.</p>
