<sup>(12)</sup>In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years. <br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">(i) Our work under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which sets out targeted plans for 391 endangered species and 45 habitats across the UK. These plans are delivered by partnerships with the public, voluntary and private sectors.

A consultation on the review was completed in March this year and a number of wildlife measures from the consultation have been included in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Bill;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">(iii) Delivery of our PSA targets to bring into favourable condition by 2010 95 per cent. of all nationally important wildlife sites; and to reverse the long term decline in the number of farmland birds by 2020.

<a name="stpa_11">Defra operates a priority scoring system to ensure that taxpayers&#039; money is spent to best effect and to maximise the benefits achieved from a finite budget available for flood and coastal erosion risk management. The system is designed to be as logical, transparent and equitable as possible, with criteria published on our website. Prioritisation has to be based on risk and while I understand the desire for defences when areas flood, it is not, however, a defensible reason for allowing them to jump the queue ahead of areas where risks of future floods might be greater. Making an

 The Department does not have any provision for the free collection of animals lost in the recent flooding.

 As indicated in the Consultation Document on the draft Gangmasters (Exclusions) Regulations 2005 published on 28 February 2005, Defra has commissioned research to assess the extent of worker exploitation or illegal activity involving labour providers who supply workers to undertake second stage processing. A draft report has been received and we intend to publish this once it has been finalised.

[9572]</p>








<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50706w06.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 makes the Secretary of State responsible for appointing officers to enforce the criminal offences that the Act establishes. It is currently our intention to appoint officers of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority to undertake enforcement activities on behalf of Defra. The Regulatory Impact assessment that accompanied the Act indicated that the cost of enforcing the new legislation would be &#163;2 million in a full year. This would enable the creation of an enforcement team of some 20staff plus associated legal support. It is envisaged that the enforcement team will be additional to existingGovernment funded enforcement resources. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2005 : Column 427W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Gangmaster Licensing Authority staff involved in enforcement work may have other duties. However in aggregate the resource available to undertake enforcement work should equate to some 20 full-time equivalents in a full year.

<a name="stpa_18">It is anticipated that the offences of operating as a gangmaster without a licence and using an unlicensed gangmaster will be triggered in summer 2006. Enforcement capabilities will be built up gradually over the intervening period with the intention that the enforcement team will be at full strength when the offences come into effect. A programme for recruiting and training enforcement officers is being developed and funding will be made available in the current and next financial year to support this programme. We anticipate that the enforcement team&#039;s first full year of operation will be 2007&#150;08 and that from that year onwards, expenditure on enforcement activities will be some &#163;2 million per annum. It is not intended to seek to recover the cost of enforcement activities through licence fee income.

CoRWM will deliver its recommendation by July 2006, in light of which future policy will be decided.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 29 June 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1623&#150;24W, on foster care, what assessment she has made of the reasons for the change in the amount spent on external foster care.  [10008]</p>









<p><a name="st_91"><a name="50706w11.html_spnew3"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Changes in the amount spent on external foster care reflect decisions made by individual local authorities about how best to provide care for the children for whom they are responsible. Over 40,000 looked after children (out of approximately 61,000 children who are looked after by local authorities at any one time) are placed with foster carers. Decisions about spending on specific categories of foster care are made at local level, in the light of children&#039;s individual circumstances and needs. However, the emergence in recent years of a market in foster care, comprising statutory sector, voluntary sector and independent sector providers, has contributed to the development of greater choice in placements for looked after children and helps ensure that specialised needs can be met. The Government have taken forward a number of strands of work to encourage more strategic approaches, at local level, to the commissioning of placements and services, and to encourage greater awareness and understanding among commissioners of the cost implications of placement decisions.

 Primary care provided by independent general dental practitioners (GDPs) forms the major element of national health service dental services. Most GDPs operate within the national terms of the general dental service (GDS), although some have opted to provide similar patient services under local contracts agreed with their primary care trust (PCT) as part of the recently introduced personal dental service (PDS). Under the GDS, the main costs are the individual treatment fees, including patient registration payments, payable to dentists; under the PDS, dentists are usually paid a regular contract value for a defined level of NHS commitment. The gross cost of GDS fees and PDS contract payments in the area of the Milton Keynes PCT are shown in the table.

 National health service organisations are expected to plan for and achieve financial balance each and every year.

In circumstances where a surplus cannot be generated in the following year, SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. This would require other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period.

<a name="stpa_80">Five per cent. of garages were rated very good, indicating they had carried out a thorough service, according to the manufacturer&#039;s service schedule; about half were rated either poor or very poor. There was evidence that women were subject to greater exposure to detrimental practices: overall 40 per cent.. of garages missed one or more items on the service schedule, this rose to 51 per cent.. if the customer was female (33 per cent.. if male). Performance was generally poor on providing accurate information, for example proper quotes for servicing. 61 per cent.. missed at least one of the faults found by the project&#039;s inspectors, which should have been picked up in service. 71 per cent. did not show customers replaced parts. Exposure to detriment seemed endemic and there was no significant difference in ratings between types of garage: 53 per cent.. of independent garages and 50 per cent. of franchise dealers were rated either poor or very poor. Only 6 per cent. of independents and 4 per cent. of dealers achieved a very good rating and there was no significant difference between members of trade associations and non-members. Fast-fit&quot; centres faired a little better with 28 per cent. rated poor or very poor for overall quality of work; however, only 3 per cent.. carried out a thorough check and rectified both simple introduced faults.

Among other things, they explore the scope for co-operation across a number of key sectors, including energy and ICT. The Chancellor recently announced that the Asia Task Force will build on this work by identifying generic problems that British companies face in these markets. Ensuring that barriers are tackled where possible, and helping business overcome those that remain. Sector programmes have been developed in collaboration with industry, the

In China these are the China British Business Council, and in India the Indo-British Partnership. In addition, UKTI directly supports numerous trade missions, seminars and trade show events to assist companies in penetrating these markets for the first time.

 While there are no specifically defined strategic gas reserves&quot; in the UK, there are levels of storage stocks known as Safety Monitors. These are determined as the minimum storage requirements to protect loads that can not be isolated from the network and also to support the process of isolating large loads from the network. The resultant storage stocks or monitors are designed to ensure that sufficient gas is held in storage to underpin the safe operation of the gas transportation system under severe conditions. There are separate safety monitors for each storage facility type (long, medium and short duration storage) each determined by National Grid Transco (NGT) to meet its Network Code requirements and under the terms of its Safety Case. Total shipper gas stocks should not fall below the relevant monitor level (which declines as the winter progresses). NGT is required to take action (which may include use of emergency procedures) in order to prevent a breach of these monitors. These monitors are calculated from:

 Sierra Leone qualifies for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. In March 2002 Sierra Leone reached HIPC Decision Point, following production of an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy, which made it eligible for debt relief equivalent to US$600 million in net present value terms, or 80 per cent. of the country&#039;s outstanding (foreign) external debt as at the end of 2000.

<a name="stpa_117">The recent agreement by G8 Finance Ministers proposes a further significant reduction in debt payments for HIPC countries.

Decisions on Completion Point are made following a period of implementation of a full Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). Sierra Leone&#039;s PRS was agreed earlier this year.

In addition, Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport, published in 2001 requires that, where developments will have significant transport implications, transport assessments should be prepared and submitted alongside the relevant planning application so that planning authorities can better assess the application.

 There is no commonly agreed, objective means of measuring whether a country is a full or partial democracy.

 The TOGETHER campaign was set up to ensure that anti-social behaviour is dealt with swiftly and effectively by local services. The first phase was about equipping practitioners with the tools and the know-how. We have seen some good results: Over 4,500 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), over 150 crack house closure orders and over 400 dispersal orders have been issued.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50706w26.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_165">As part of the next phase on the campaign, we will ensure we give the right help and support to communities so they know what they can do to tackle problems of anti-social behaviour and what they can expect from local services. As announced on the 29th June 2005, from 1st July 2005 provisions from the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, will give vulnerable witnesses in ASBO cases the protection and support they need in court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50706w26.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_166">There will also be the lifting of automatic reporting restrictions to allow the local media to give details of those who breach their ASBOs.

<a name="stpa_167">Funding for Individual Support Orders (ISOs) for young people between the ages of 10 and 17 years of age will be increased by &#163;500,000. ISOs can be attached to an ASBO and direct the young person to activities and support to address the underlying causes of their anti-social behaviour. This can include anger management courses and alcohol and drug misuse programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent discussions he has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2005 : Column 512W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
had with <i>(a)</i> his EU counterparts and <i>(b)</i> senior police officers on tackling (i) child prostitution and (ii) child trafficking; what proposals were examined; and if he will make a statement.  [2900]</p>








<p><a name="st_246"><a name="50706w28.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Child prostitution and trafficking are abhorrent crimes, and the Government have acted swiftly to set tough penalties for these offences. There have been no recent discussions with EU officials or senior police officers on tackling child prostitution. However, guidance on Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution was circulated to the police and other agencies in May 2000 as supplementary to the wider Working Together to Safeguard Children. The guidance stresses the need to treat children involved in prostitution primarily as victims of abuse, provides advice to agencies on ways to work together to safeguard and promote the child&#039;s welfare and encourages proactive policing so that, wherever possible, action is taken against the exploiters through the criminal justice system. New offences with severe penalties were introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to enable the police to take firm action against anyone paying for the sexual services of a child, causing or inciting child prostitution, arranging or facilitating child prostitution, controlling a child prostitute, or trafficking a child into or within the UK for sexual exploitation. The Government are currently conducting a review of prostitution which includes consideration of action on child abuse through prostitution and people trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The Association of Chief Police Officers has contributed to the review and will continue to be involved in discussions on how to tackle these issues. In the case of child trafficking, despite a few high profile instances of children being trafficked into and through the UK, there is insufficient information to say if this is a growing problem. However, the nature of the crime demands that is treated very seriously. Government have introduced criminal sanctions covering child traffickers. In addition to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, measures in the new Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 make it an offence to traffic for other purposes, for example, domestic servitude or benefit fraud. The Government have also tasked Reflex, the government&#039;s multi-agency response to organised immigration crime, with co-ordinating intelligence on the problem of trafficking. The Metropolitan Police led an Operation (Paladin) to profile unaccompanied children arriving at Heathrow. This threw up a number of child protection issues that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2005 : Column 513W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
might not otherwise have come to light. Officials from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate met the Metropolitan Police on 15 June 2005 and have agreed to take forward the creation of a permanent multi-agency partnership team based at Heathrow. The team will address the specific safeguarding needs of unaccompanied minors. We have made people trafficking a priority for our presidency of the EU. During our presidency we aim to improve co-operation among member states so that we achieve operational results and prosecutions, making it impossible for organised immigration crime businesses to operate within the EU. We want to encourage greater police co-operation through EUROPOL and the sharing of best practice on investigations and prosecutions by raising awareness of the role of Eurojust. We will also be working closely with our EU partners to ensure that the Hague Programme commitment for the EU Commission and EU Council to draw up an action plan on trafficking is met. In addition to discussions within the EU, trafficking is an important issue for the G8. Tackling trafficking and smuggling was discussed at the recent G8 ministerial meeting in Sheffield on 15&#150;17 June. Ministers considered progress with existing G8 initiatives which impact on trafficking, including tackling document fraud, information sharing and co-operation through Interpol.

 The difference in performance of police forces in the recovery of the proceeds of crime is largely attributable to the use made by each force of the powers in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to seize and confiscate criminal assets. The Joint Criminal Justice Inspectorates&#039; Thematic report on the implementation of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 published last November made a number of recommendations for improving police force performance in this area of work. The report acknowledged the effectiveness of the new powers when they are actually used but concluded that asset recovery is not yet a mainstream enforcement tool for police forces. I am pleased to say that a number of the report&#039;s recommendations have been implemented, and we are encouraging forces to make financial investigation and asset recovery an integral part of criminal investigation.

 The Inquiry Team had hoped to complete the report by June of this year. However, that deadline is likely to be extended by a few months. It will be discussing with Surrey Police and the IPCC recent disclosures from the Army and once those discussions have been concluded it will be better placed to give a final date for completion.

<p><a name="st_296"><a name="50706w33.html_spnew6"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 It is widely recognised that the very nature of identity fraud makes it difficult to be precise when estimating the scale of the problem in terms of the number of fraudulent passport applications. Based on the results of an exercise involving the detailed scrutiny of some 10,000 passport applications, extrapolated 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Jul 2005 : Column 536W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
across a whole year, the UK Passport Service (UKPS) estimate that the level of fraud may run at around 0.18 per cent. of applications received. Approximately half of the cases identified in this exercise involved false declarations but the individual was otherwise entitled to a passport. The remaining cases featured identity fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50706w33.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_192">With around 6.5 million passports applications per year this suggests the possibility of around 11,700 fraudulent applications per year. Of these, half, around 5,850, might involve identity fraud with a similar number of cases in which deception has been practised but the individual would otherwise be entitled to a passport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50706w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_193">This exercise was run during a peak period of passport demand and represented a snap shot of the possible level of fraud at one particular time of year. UKPS is currently developing a more flexible and robust system for estimating the level of fraud which will take account of the seasonally of passport demand and other variables.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50706w33.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_194">As regards the number of fraudulent applications detected, UKPS has recently introduced a new and comprehensive fraud casework and management information system. This system was rolled out and operational in all Passport Offices by the beginning of March 2005. It is now used for the progression of cases of suspected fraud and the collection, collation and analysis of information relating to passport fraud. Prior to the introduction of this system information relating to frauds detected was collated through manual processes. The figures which are available for the last five years are derived from those manual processes and are given as follows:

 An efficiency target for the police service was introduced in 1999&#150;2000. From that year until 2004&#150;05 each Police authority was required to make efficiency gains each year of 2 per cent. of net revenue expenditure. A new target was set in Spending Review 2004. For the period from 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08 authorities are required to make cumulative efficiency gains of 3 per cent. per year, half of the total to consist of cashable gains.

The plans recognise that providing work opportunities for prisoners in prison is important in a number of ways. Such opportunities can introduce and maintain the work ethic; help occupy prisoners&#039; time in custody constructively and can make a significant contribution to the resettlement agenda.

<i>[holding answer 16 June 2005]:</i> Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) are regularly reviewed at a local level by Strategic Management Boards (SMB), formed of senior staff from the Police, Probation and Prison Service. Since 2001&#150;02, each SMB has produced an annual report on the MAPPA arrangements. These reports show that the arrangements have made a significant difference to the way the public is protected from the risks posed by sexual and violent offenders. I have also commissioned an independent study of MAPPA by De Montfort University, due to be published later this year, and a joint inspection by Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Probation, Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Prisons and Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, starting in September. All of these reports will be made available in the Library once they are published.

 I understand that Defra has no plans to review the current policy on shooting of foxes and ground game at night. Consequently there has been no need to consult stakeholders. Under the provisions of the Firearms Act 1968 a person under 14 may not be granted a firearm certificate in any circumstances. A person between 14 and 17 may be granted a certificate in order to possess a firearm provided that the police are satisfied that the individual concerned is fit to possess the gun without being a danger to the public safety and

<i>[holding answer 16 June 2005]:</i> The key measure of the effectiveness of the youth justice system is a reduction in the rate of re-offending. To measure the extent to which offenders re-offend we measure whether or not they are reconvicted within one year. Our target is to reduce juvenile re-offending rates by 5 per cent. by 2004.The latest results, published in February 2005, show that the rate of juvenile
