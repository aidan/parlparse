 The cost of installing a recharging point for electric vehicles will depend on what type of technology is used, its location and what, if any, ancillary work&#151;for example ground works, utility connection, signage&#151;is needed. Procuring points in volume or where supporting infrastructure already exists is likely to be significantly cheaper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="90617w0003.htm_para8"><a name="090617107000297">As a broad indication of the range of possible costs, free standing on street charging points may cost between &#163;500 and &#163;3,500, with accompanying street works where required costing up to &#163;5,000. The total cost of installing a plug point on a wall where a power supply exists may be in the region of &#163;250 to &#163;1,000. More innovative fast charging or battery swap infrastructure would be more expensive to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="90617w0003.htm_para9"><a name="090617107000298">It should also be noted that many motorists are likely to choose to recharge their electric and plug in hybrid vehicles at home overnight, provided they have secure access to a standard 13 amp socket.

A range of charging technologies and infrastructure solutions exist, which vary in scale and cost.

 The South Central franchise specification required the operator to set targets based on National Passenger Survey results for trains, stations and customer service, split by groups of services&#151;South London, Sussex and Coast and Gatwick Express.

 The franchising process does not allow for the identification of individual sources of investment. Instead, it provides an overall price to Government of the package that is proposed by the bidder (either subsidy or in the case of South Central a &#163;534 million premium). It is thus not possible to identify the individual investment costs being borne by the South Central operator or the Government.</p>

 The Department for Transport issued DFT Circular 01/2007, &#145;Guidance on the Deployment of Speed and Red Light Cameras&#146; on 31 January 2007. The guidance was placed in the Libraries of the House and is also available on the Department's website. This recommends that partnerships proactively provide information about safety cameras, including their deployment and benefits, but do so as part of a wider approach to road safety related communications that aim to raise public awareness of behaviours that can cause casualties on the roads. Communications expenditure is entirely a matter for individual local partnerships using funds from their allocation of the Department's specific road safety grant.</p>

It makes animal testing the option of last resort where there are no suitable non-animal alternative tests available, requires the mandatory sharing of all existing data on the intrinsic properties of chemicals derived from animal tests when completing registrations, and bans repetition of animal tests. In addition, industry has to provide a full justification if further animal tests are proposed to fill identified data gaps, and gain the approval of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) before such tests may be conducted. Test proposals are required to be published on ECHA's website for 45 days, to allow interested third parties to submit scientifically-valid comments.</p>

 The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) stopped subsidising compost bins in England in April 2009 and will cease selling compost bins completely there at the end of September 2009. Notice has been given to all stakeholders of this change.</p>

The programme has therefore met its original objectives and demonstrated the value of home composting as part of a local waste strategy. It was appropriate at this stage for the issue of future subsidies to become one for local authorities rather than central Government to decide.</p>

 The Government have done no specific work to assess the role of ornamental plants in mitigating the effects of climate change. However, the growth of plants captures carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration), so giving some mitigation for other emissions. Assessments of carbon capture have been made for forestry and non-ornamental crops in the UK, since they represent the majority of the land use. The data available would allow a crude assessment of the potential for carbon sequestration by ornamentals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="90617w0007.htm_para2"><a name="090617107000951">More generally, ornamentals are a significant component of green infrastructure, which can reduce air temperatures in built up areas by up to 2° C. Some studies suggest that surface temperatures can be reduced to a much greater extent. Incorporating deciduous trees, including ornamental trees, into building design can also help to reduce solar gain in summer reducing energy usage associated with air conditioning, while maintaining solar gain in winter. Apart from the role of green infrastructure in reducing the urban heat island effect, the shade provided by ornamental trees will also play a role in reducing the incidence of skin cancers that is otherwise likely to increase as a result of projected reductions in cloud cover. Green infrastructure also has a role to play in sustainable urban drainage systems, helping to alleviate the projected increase in flood risk.</p>

 In 2003, the Home Office undertook a one day count of antisocial behaviour incidents to quantify their impact on key service providers. This estimated that the cost to Government agencies of responding to reports of antisocial behaviour in England and Wales was approximately &#163;3.4 billion per year. This figure did not include indirect costs to local communities and businesses, nor the emotional costs to victims and witnesses. The cost of not taking action against antisocial behaviour would be much higher.</p>

Home Office funding for local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour now forms part of the general Area Based Grant (ABG) paid by the Department of Communities and Local Government. This grant is designed to increase the funding flexibility and allow local areas much greater freedom to spend money in a way they see fit to support the delivery of local, regional and national priorities in their areas.</p>

 A total of 1,004 DNA profiles taken from crime scenes and loaded to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2009 matched against more than one subject profile. This equates to an average of 83.7 multiple matches per month over this 12 month period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"><a name="90617w0008.htm_para6"><a name="090617111000119">The SGM Plus profiling system looks at 10 areas within the DNA molecule and derives from these a profile normally consisting of 20 numbers plus a sex marker indicating whether the person is male or female. With such a profile the likelihood of a random match to a person unconnected to the crime is a minimum of one in a billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"><a name="90617w0008.htm_para7"><a name="090617111000120">Biological material found at a crime scene will degrade due to the effects of the environment, ultraviolet light, or bacteria, among other factors. There may be very little DNA in very small stains of biological material. In either case it may not be possible to produce a full DNA profile. In some cases, a partial profile may be produced by the analysis of the DNA and in some cases no DNA profile at all would be obtained. A partial profile consists of fewer than the 20 numbers of a full SGM+ DNA profile. A crime scene profile of eight numbers plus the sex marker would be sufficient to load to the DNA database.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="90617w0008.htm_para8"><a name="090617111000121">Evidence from such a partial profile may still be crucial, not least because of its ability to conclusively eliminate people from an investigation. A match of a person to such a partial profile carries significantly less weight than a match to a full profile and it is quite possible that two or more people might have the same partial DNA profile. The evidence presented to a court will reflect this. The Crown Prosecution Service have made clear that in any case involving a DNA profile there must be appropriate supporting evidence before a prosecution is initiated.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI), sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>
Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
The reference period for HBAI figures is single financial years.<br>
The income measure used here is unequivalised, i.e. it has not been adjusted for household size and composition. This is because the groups requested are based on household size and composition, and in this specific instance, equivalisation would cloud the comparison between household types. This means that the statistics presented are on a different basis to those in the HBAI publication.<br>
Median household incomes are less affected by outliers, and are therefore generally more commonly used in analysis of incomes.<br>
In particular, the sample size for households containing two working age adults and four children is relatively small, so estimates for this group are subject to a higher degree of sampling error than the other groups presented. This particularly affects the mean, where no robust estimate can be produced.<br>
Gross incomes have been presented. The HBAI publication looks at net disposable incomes Before and After Housing Costs. While the statistics cover individuals who are of working age, not all individuals will be working.<br>

This figure includes the processing of change of circumstances notifications and changes made following some IT upgrades.</p>

 All non-British personnel now serving in the British armed forces have exactly the same pay arrangements as UK personnel and there are currently no plans to undertake a retrospective review. It has long been the policy of successive Governments not to implement changes to pay policy retrospectively, a policy that has been applied across the public sector in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, no estimate has been made of the cost of retrospective treatment in either case, and to do so would involve disproportionate cost. Additionally, pay records are kept for seven years before destruction, so individual cases could not be assessed beyond the last seven years. Given the number of personnel involved the costs would be significant.</p>

 The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) is required to deliver a capability measured through operational analysis against war fighting scenarios. The capacity of the individual aircraft is therefore of secondary importance to its capability, and the fleet has been sized to meet the operational requirement. No direct comparison can be made with another aircraft. Additionally, there are no commercial air-to-air service providers with approval to operate on the UK civil or military aircraft registers.</p>

The fuel offload capacity is related to the radius of action, aircraft fuel consumption and the time on station at the refuelling location. For FSTA this fuel capacity relates to a standard sortie scenario of 500 miles radius of action, 140 minutes on station and a fuel offload of 60 tonnes to 20 different receiver aircraft.</p>

To take this forward the MOD is supporting the development of a Joint Maritime Security Training Centre at a military site close to Lagos. A range of courses are being offered to individuals, units and HQs, leading to a common doctrine with a strong theme throughout of respect for the rule of law and human rights.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what financial incentives his Department provides to encourage the <i> (a)</i> construction and <i> (b)</i> adaptation of homes to incorporate (i) renewable energy technologies and (ii) sustainable building materials. [278873]</p>

 The Government play an important role in providing incentives to increase take-up of small scale renewable on-site energy technologies. These technologies have a key role to play in meeting our 2020 renewable targets, and will be essential in achieving our legally binding 2050 target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent. Presently, the main sources of financial support for these technologies come from the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP) and the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="90617w0016.htm_para2"><a name="090617113000140">The LCBP is an &#163;86 million capital grant programme supporting households, communities and the public sector to install small scale onsite energy technologies. A further &#163;45 million was allocated to the programme in Budget 2009, bringing total funding to &#163;131 million. The programme aims to demonstrate how energy efficiency and onsite energy technologies can be combined in a range of buildings to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="90617w0016.htm_para3"><a name="090617113000141">To incentivise the installation of microgeneration under CERT, the scheme provides suppliers with a ring-fenced market transformation option which allows them to achieve up to 12 per cent. of their overall CERT target by promoting measures for which there is not yet a developed market. To further incentivise microgeneration, suppliers may increase this market transformation ring-fence by a further 2 per cent. by promoting microgeneration measures; suppliers receive a 50 per cent. uplift in their carbon score within the ring-fence for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="90617w0016.htm_para4"><a name="090617113000142">The LCBP and CERT have made an important contribution to developing a market for low-carbon small-scale generation in the UK. However, we fully acknowledge that we need to go much further if we are to meet our long-term goals. That is why we included powers in the Energy Act 2008 to introduce feed-in tariffs (FITs) for small-scale low-carbon electricity generation (up to a maximum limit of 5 megawatt capacity) through changes to electricity distribution and supply licences. We are currently working to develop recommendations on the design of the mechanism, including the tariff levels and the period during which they will apply, the detail of which we will consult on this summer. We have committed to have feed-in tariffs in place in April 2010.</p>

The powers allow the RHI to provide financial assistance to generators of renewable heat, and producers of renewable biogas and biomethane. The incentive payments will be funded by a levy on suppliers of fossil fuels for heat. Our aim is to make the RHI as accessible, flexible and user-friendly as possible to potential investors in renewable heat at all scales, from domestic to industrial. We are currently working to develop the main features of the RHI scheme, which we will consult on towards the end of this year, and aim to have the RHI in place by April 2011.</p>

 The main findings of the review were that there were robust rules already in place on EEA nationals&#146; access to the benefit system but that a stronger test of employment prospects should be applied to EEA nationals claiming income based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and that the Department&#146;s ability to monitor claims to benefit from EEA nationals should be improved. There are complex issues related to EU law to be considered before decisions can be reached on the way forward.</p>

 It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs.

160 Subarachnoid haemorrhage<br>
161 Intracerebral haemorrhage<br>
162 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage<br>
163 Cerebral infarction<br>
164 Stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> PCT/strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97,1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of General practitioners practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in national health service practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Small numbers</i><br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_669"><a name="90617w0027.htm_para2"><a name="0906186000186">Up to 2005-06 there was a requirement for Children's Fund Partnerships to allocate 25 per cent. of their expenditure to youth crime projects. The total funding for the Children's Fund for the period 2005-06 was &#163;146 million. Therefore, &#163;36.5 million of these funds were allocated to youth crime prevention. In 2006-07 the requirement of the 25 per cent. quota was discontinued. Since April 2008 funding has been distributed to local authorities and pooled with other funding via the Area Based Grant. Directing funding through local authorities gives local areas the freedom and flexibility to base spending decisions on local circumstances and the needs of local communities.</p>

These actions help provide the conditions for a UK economic recovery. The world economy is experiencing its first recession since the second world war, driven by the global financial crisis, and governments around the world have adopted similar policies to those in the UK to help encourage a return to growth.</p>

 Yes Loans' licence did not expire in June 2008. Yes Loans submitted a valid application to renew its consumer credit licence before the licence was due to expire. In accordance with section 29 of the Consumer Credit Act, the licence continues in force until the OFT reaches a decision on its application and, if there is an appeal against the OFT decision, until the appeals process is completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_734"><a name="90617w0032.htm_para1"><a name="0906188000429">The OFT is aware of concerns and has been working with Yes Loans in considering certain matters relating to its business practices. However I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter while a review is still under way.</p>
