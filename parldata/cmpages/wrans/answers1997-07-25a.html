To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many and what percentage of civil servants in each of grades 1 to 5 in her Department are of <i>(a)</i> Asian origin and <i>(b)</i> Afro-Caribbean origin. [9568] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Staff of Asian and Afro-Caribbean origin are not currently represented in posts formerly classified as grades 1 to 4. In posts formerly classified as grade 5, the Department employs one member of staff of Asian origin, representing 2.3 per cent. of such posts, and one member of staff of Afro-Caribbean origin, 2.3 per cent. We aim to do better.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the Government Departments with which she is co-operating directly with respect to the provision of overseas aid and the eradication of world poverty; and if she will make a statement. [10135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Consistency in Government policy on issues affecting poorer countries is a key element in the remit of the new Department for International Development in the elimination of global poverty and promotion of sustainable development. My Department therefore co-operates as appropriate with other Departments, in particular with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; HM Treasury; the Department of Trade and Industry; the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions; the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; the Department of Health; the Department for Education and Employment; and the Ministry of Defence.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what criteria her Department uses to determine whether a satisfactory degree of economic reform has been implemented for the purposes of receiving overseas aid; and if she will make a statement. [10137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We look to work in countries that wish to implement sound macro-economic policies aimed at laying or preserving the foundations for sustainable economic growth based on prudent budgeting, effective and transparent fiscal disciplines and efficient markets. At the same time, we look for a demonstrable commitment to eliminate poverty by expanding opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and human development through increased access to basic education, basic health and clean water for all.

 The know-how fund provides flexible technical assistance to central and eastern Europe and central Asia adjusting to the transition to democracy on an efficient economy. I am reviewing its activities as part of the process leading up to the publication in the autumn of a White Paper on international development to adjust to progress achieved and the need to address growing inequality and poverty in transition countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development for what reasons it is not her policy to set a target date for reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product for official development assistance; and if she will make a statement.[9195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As I have repeatedly made clear, we are committed to reversing the decline in the proportion of our GNP spent on development assistance, which was 0.52 per cent. and rising in 1979, is now 0.27 per cent. and almost halved under the previous Administration. My policy is to reverse the decline in our spend rather than make false promises and continuing cuts, as did the previous Government.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the prison population rose by 17,000 or nearly 40 per cent. in the four years up to this June to reach 60,580. It is expected to rise to at least 68,900 by March 2000. In the three months since the election, it has risen by 2,440, far exceeding any projection published before 1 May. This three-month rise is equivalent to the total capacity of four average-sized prisons:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>resources have not kept pace with this rise in numbers. The building programme approved by the previous Government is already being outstripped by the rise in population, which on latest assumptions will exceed maximum capacity later this year, and will do so again by a larger margin by early 1999:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the number of prisoners "doubled"--held two to a cell designed for one--has already increased from 7,251 in 1992 to 10,926 at the end of June and, on current plans, would have to increase to around 16,000 by early 1999;

<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will instigate an inquiry into damage that occurred to the personal property of prisoners in the aftermath of the disturbances on 20 January at Full Sutton prison with particular reference to damage to <i>(a)</i> personal stereos, <i>(b)</i> clothing and <i>(c)</i> books. [9981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 No. Claims for compensation for prisoners' property damaged during the January disturbance at Full Sutton prison are being dealt with through the normal Prison Service request and complaint procedures. Although the Prison Service does not accept liability for loss of personal property held by prisoners in their cells, it has been agreed in this instance to make ex-gratia payments to prisoners who were innocent victims of the disturbance. Those prisoners who are judged to have been involved in the disturbance will not be liable for compensation.
<P>

<a name="70725w01.html_para5">Prisoners who are not satisfied with the outcome of these procedures may appeal to Prison Service headquarters and, if still not satisfied, to the independent prison ombudsman. In addition, all prisoners retain the normal right of any citizen to seek to recover legitimate losses through the courts.

 Information on the average population for 1992-96 is contained in table A. Long-term projections of the prison population in England and Wales are produced annually and were last published in the Home Office statistical bulletin 7/97 on 3 April 1997. The projected average population figures for 1997 to 2000, including a higher and lower variant, are as set out in the attached table B. On 18 July 1997, the prison population stood at 62,300 which is 1,700 higher than the central projection for mid-July.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his oral answer of 9 June, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 775-76, what assumptions he made in respect of <i>(a)</i> the deterrent effects of the mandatory sentences and <i>(b)</i> the likely effect on the length of other sentences when forming his estimates as to the likely increase in the prison population as a result of the implementation of each of the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.[10258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The estimates assume that the deterrent effect on those who are liable to mandatory minimum sentences--that is, offenders who have one qualifying conviction for serious violent or sex offences, or two qualifying convictions for trafficking in class A drugs or domestic burglary--will reduce the requirement for prison places by 20 per cent. The estimates also include an allowance of 1,000 prison places for indirect effects of the provisions on sentence levels, if all are implemented.

Member for Portsmouth South (Mr. Hancock) of 18 July, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>344,</i> if he will list the matters which are considered in the assessment as to whether a particular procedure should be approved under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; [10695]
<P>
<UL>(2) in the case of procedures carried out for commercial gain, what criteria need to be satisfied before approval is given under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; and if he will make a statement. [10683]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Applications for all project licences must satisfy the criteria set out in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Section 5(3) sets out the permissible purposes of the work; section 5(4) requires that the likely adverse effects to the animals concerned be weighed against the benefits likely to accrue; section 5(5) requires applicants to give adequate consideration to alternatives; and section 5(6) prohibits the use of cats, dogs, primates and equidae unless no other species is suitable or it is not practicable to obtain animals of another suitable species.
<P>

<a name="70725w02.html_para1">When the cost-benefit assessment required by section 5(4) is carried out, the importance of the objectives; the probability that these objectives will be achieved; the potential adverse effects to the animals involved; and the measures for reducing these adverse effects must all be taken into account. This assessment of benefit and severity is described in more detail in appendix II of the 1993 report of the Animal Procedures Committee.
<P>

<a name="70725w02.html_para2">I understand that, as part of its review of the operation of the Act, the Animal Procedures Committee is preparing an extended statement on the principles and operation of cost-benefit assessment.
<P>

<a name="70725w02.html_para3">When the benefits are assessed, the potential financial gain which may accrue from the sale of any product is not considered. Broader economic and social benefits, such as 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jul 1997 : Column: 763</I><P>
cheaper or more accessible medicines or other products, or reduction in costs to the taxpayer may be taken into consideration. Animal use is often required not by the commercial organisation, but by national and international regulations which protect human safety.

This project may also consider establishing a standard database. More immediately, the CCCJS has piloted and evaluated an initiative to link criminal justice agencies in Suffolk and Southampton by e-mail. The scheme has been recommended for replication and the Court Service, in conjunction with the CCCJS and local agencies, has identified other potential sites for this facility.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the quangos within his Department's responsibility which he has to date announced his intention <i>(a)</i> to abolish and <i>(b)</i> to make subject to a significant element of democratic accountability. [9679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w04.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department has not so far announced plans to abolish any of its quangos, or non-departmental public bodies. However, it is currently examining the role and responsibilities of each of our NDPBs as part of the Department's current spending review. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced last month a review of NDPBs with the aim of reducing overall numbers across Whitehall.
<P>

<a name="70725w04.html_para0">The issue of democratic accountability will also be addressed on an across-Whitehall basis with the launch in the autumn of a discussion paper considering how democratic oversight of NDPBs might best be enhanced. In the light of consultation, it is proposed to bring forward proposals in a forthcoming White Paper on better government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has made to extend workskill pilots for the unemployed; and if he will make a statement. [11172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Regulations have been approved by Parliament to allow four more workskill pilots to be introduced on 1 September 1997 to run for one year. These pilots will allow people who have been receiving jobseeker's allowance for six months or more to undertake employment-related education and training for up to one year:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>full-time, in Scotland in the Glasgow and Dumbarton districts and in the north-west region in Lancashire and Cumbria districts; and 
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>part-time, in London and south-east region in south and south-east London districts and in the south-west region in Wiltshire, Avon and Somerset districts.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="70725w04.html_para1">About 12,000 unemployed people will be able to benefit from the flexible arrangements to take up education or training: provision for 8,000 in these new pilots in addition to 4,000 in the pilots introduced in four areas last April.
<P>

<a name="70725w04.html_para2">The extension of workskill pilots supports our plans in the new deal where we are acting urgently to improve the employability and labour market prospects of the unemployed. The workskill pilots will help us to assess whether and how flexible arrangements in jobseeker's allowance help unemployed people to get and retain work, both in the short and long term.
<P>

<a name="70725w04.html_para3">We will further review the jobseeker's allowance rules on education and training in the light of the workskill pilots and early experience in the new deal.

 The lower and upper earnings limits for class 1 national insurance contributions and the lower and upper profits limits for class 4 national insurance contributions are linked to the level of the basic retirement pension. If the basic retirement pension had been uprated since 1980 in line with the higher of earnings or prices the weekly lower and upper earnings limits for 1997-98 would be &#163;86 and &#163;645 respectively and the annual lower

 The Nuclear Weapons Safety Committee was established in 1959. Its current terms of reference are to advise my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, the services and other interested MoD authorities on all safety matters pertaining to nuclear weapons systems, including issues of design, manufacture, transport, storage, handling and operational training.
<P>

<a name="70725w08.html_para0">The present chairman of the committee is Professor Sir John Cadogan CBE FRSE HON FEng FRS; he was appointed in 1992. The previous chairmen, both of whom are deceased, were appointed on the understanding that their names would remain confidential. The production of reports is dependent upon the business of the committee at any given time. The classifications of reports range from restricted to top secret.

This enables appropriate safety cover to be provided by MoD personnel.

<a name="70725w08.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has not possessed an offensive biological weapons capability since shortly after the second world war. The UK gave up its offensive chemical weapons capability in the 1950s and had disposed of its stocks of such weapons by 1960. Indeed, we are party to the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention and the 1993 chemical weapons convention, which explicitly ban the stockpiling of biological and chemical weapons.

 As required by the statute, we shall decide each application on its merits having regard both to our policy on sanction applications and to the circumstances of the individual case concerned. Our policy is to continue the approach previously followed, namely, that the power to sanction should not be exercised too widely. Sanction may be appropriate in those cases where the expenditure is incurred in good faith, but in ignorance of the strict letter of the law, or inadvertently without observance of requisite formalities, or under such circumstances as make it fair and equitable that the expenditure should not be disallowed by the auditor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many cars have been modified for use of unleaded petrol in each of the last five years. [10251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w09.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The information required is not held centrally. Most modifications to vehicles to enable them to run on unleaded petrol are likely to have taken place in the years immediately following the introduction of unleaded petrol in April 1987, encouraged by the duty differential in favour of that product. This is reflected in the rapid increase in unleaded petrol sales to 40 per cent. of total petrol sales by April 1991. From that date, subsequent increases in the sales of unleaded petrol are likely to be attributable primarily to the statutory requirement for new petrol-engined vehicles, with some time-limited exemptions, to be designed and constructed so as to be able to run on unleaded petrol, and from 1993, to the need for catalyst-equipped vehicles to use only unleaded petrol.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w09.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Chidgey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of <i>(a)</i> cars, <i>(b)</i> motor cycles and <i>(c)</i> light goods vehicles, which are able to use (i) four-star petrol only, (ii) unleaded petrol only and (iii) either four-star petrol or unleaded petrol. [10249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70725w09.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Vehicles which are able to use only unleaded petrol are generally those fitted with catalytic convertors. An estimated 7 million petrol-engined cars and light good vehicles are so fitted. An estimated 1.3 million cars and light goods vehicles not fitted with catalytic convertors must be able to use unleaded petrol. In addition some 604,000 motor cycles are estimated to be able to use unleaded petrol. The remaining 12.4 million cars and light goods vehicles and 130,000 motor cycles were originally designed to use leaded petrol. However, the experience of countries such as the United States and Sweden indicates that most of these can safely use premium or super-unleaded petrol as an alternative, with the addition of a lead-replacement additive if it is felt necessary to afford a greater degree of protection against the possibility of increased seat wear.

 The Department has produced advice notes, setting out what we consider to be best technical practice, for those involved in the installation of seat belts. The issue of trading standards is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry which has confirmed that legislation already exists to prevent traders from making false claims about their goods and services. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for local trading standards officers.

<a name="70725w10.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I have no plans to review these provisions. As the law stands, it is open to a highway authority to adopt an unadopted street, but the frontagers are legally liable for the cost of any works necessary to bring it up to the required standard first; the charge is normally based on the respective lengths of the frontages of the properties which adjoin the street, though the highway authority may modify such an apportionment by taking into account the degree of likely benefit to individual householders when calculating their apportionments. It also has discretion to contribute towards the costs of the works as a whole or those borne by flank or rear frontages. Properties on private streets may be expected to cost less than they otherwise would, because of the liability for private street works expenses.

There is clear evidence that some local authorities were subsidising their costs in some way. This has inevitably meant that some individual operators are paying more than they did previously. On the other hand-meat inspection charges to other operators have fallen.

 In December 1996, the European Commission presented a proposal to the Standing Committee banning the use of avoparcin as an additive in animal feed. The proposal was agreed by qualified majority and the UK implemented the ban on the use of avoparcin as a feed additive by the 1 April 1997 deadline. Product licences containing avoparcin were revoked with effect from 31 March. Avoparcin is therefore no longer authorised as a feed additive for use in poultry flocks.

<P>
<a name="70725w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government take very seriously the possibility of the development of antibiotic resistance in humans and animals as a result of the use of antibiotics in animal feed. This is carefully examined as part of the safety assessment of applications for authorisations for antimicrobial products, and is kept under review by the independent scientific Veterinary Products Committee which advises the Government on the safety, quality and efficacy of veterinary medicines. In considering the use of antibiotics, the committee has consistently followed the principles established in the report of the Joint Committee on the Use of Antibiotics in Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine--the Swann report--of 1969. The VPC evaluated the report on Avoparcin produced by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition and endorsed its conclusion that, on the basis of science the evidence presented did not establish a risk to human health, animal health or the environment.
<P>

<a name="70725w11.html_para3">Apart from regular reviews by the VPC, a number of other recent initiatives into the issue of antibiotic resistance have been undertaken. The Advisory Committee on Microbiological Safety of Food has set up a working group to assess the risks to humans from antibiotic resistant micro-organisms entering the food chain. The working group is expected to report by the end of the year. Secondly, following the ban on avoparcin, a Commission working group has prepared a programme for the monitoring of resistance to a number of antibiotics in pigs and poultry. Samples are to be taken in slaughterhouses in a number of member states including the UK. The EU Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products has also set up an ad hoc working party to investigate the prevalence and effects of anitmicrobial resistance in animals and potential for transfer to man. Finally, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology has established a sub-committee on resistance to anti-microbial agents. It aims to report in early 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> We are discussing with the European Commission a proposal to allow the export of meat from cattle born after a specified date. The first of August 1996 is a key date as, from that date, it became an offence to use or possess mammalian meat and bone meal on a farm and remaining stocks on farms had to be surrendered by that date. This, together with the introduction of cattle passports in July 1996, means that we are able to offer additional safeguards in respect of animals born after that date to our trading partners.

 The list of ministerial responsibilities referred to is not a template for the priorities of the Department of Health.

The aim is to ensure that all women have speedy access to high quality diagnosis and treatment, based on Calman/Hine networks of cancer care. Guidance has been published on improving outcomes in breast cancer and on the provision of palliative care services.
<P>

<a name="70725w12.html_para1">A great deal of work has already been undertaken within the national health service to implement the recommendations with much being achieved locally. A key element has been the identification of cancer units and centres and the local agreement of where and what cancers should be treated at each individual hospital. In many regions, this has involved site visits by multi-disciplinary teams to assess cancer provision against agreed cancer standards, to identify strengths and weaknesses and to agree a time scale for change.
<P>

<a name="70725w12.html_para2">Although full implementation is planned to take some five to 10 years, we will continue to ensure that the programme is given a high priority. We are currently considering what further action should be taken both nationally and locally to ensure these improvements to cancer services are taken forward as quickly as possible.

 A statement on the toxicity of vitamin B6 by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--was made available to the general public on 4 July 1997. Availability was announced in a Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food news release on Government action following COT and Food Advisory Committee advice on vitamin B6.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has not commissioned any research into the effectiveness of vitamin B6. Data from pharmaceutical companies, on the efficacy of medicinal products containing vitamin B6 have been evaluated by the licensing authority and its expert advisory bodies in relation to applications for marketing authorisation submitted to the Medicines Control Agency. Following grant of a marketing authorisation, the MCA continues to monitor efficacy in relation to safety for all authorised medicinal products, including those containing vitamin B6.

<a name="70725w15.html_para0">The national minimum wage is one of the Government's top priorities and for that reason we have moved quickly to put the commission in place. We advertised nationally for applications to the commission and were gratified by the large response and the high quality of the candidates. I am confident that, with such a high-quality membership, the commission will be able to go about its work effectively and successfully.

 Apart from his holding in BP, which the Minister has undertaken not to trade before 1 January 1998, he can no longer give a report of his shareholdings, or changes in them, since they have been placed in a blind trust. It would breach the protection against conflicts of interest the trust provides to ask the manager of the trust to publish the composition of the portfolio.
