 In 2004, the Department introduced a National Service Framework (NSF) for Children, Young People and Maternity Services to set standards. Copies of the NSF are available in the Library. Asthma has a specific care pathway within the NSF, which serves as a benchmark in guiding national health service commissioners in procuring efficient, effective and child/family orientated services, and also serves as a reference for appraisal by families, service commissioners and the Healthcare Commission.</p>

 On the recommendation of the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UK NSC), a newborn cystic fibrosis screening programme was introduced in England in 2001 to identify babies with cystic fibrosis. The screening programme is not designed to test for cystic fibrosis carrier status. A small proportion of babies (about one in 100) are unavoidably identified during the testing as cystic fibrosis carriers. This can happen if a mutation analysis of a blood sample is required after the biochemical test. In such cases, in line with other newborn screening programmes, parents will be advised that their child is a carrier. The UK NSC keeps all its policy advice under review.</p>

 The Valuation Office Agency is satisfied that the bandings undertaken when council tax revaluation in Wales was introduced in 2005 were made competently. During the period 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007 (the first two years of the 2005 council tax lists coming into force) one third fewer challenges were received than in the same period of the 1993 lists, and just 1.55 per cent. of bandings were changed as a result of these challenges.</p>

Final efficiency savings figures will be reported in the 2008 DCMS autumn performance report latest headcount figures show a reduction of 76 posts at 31 March 2008. The Department was carrying 35 vacancies at 31 March 2008 and even excluding these posts we have still exceeded our target Latest relocation figures show the relocation of 586 posts at 31 March 2008.

2. Care should be taken when interpreting the table. The Department does not routinely collect information on backdating periods and these have been estimated by comparing information on the date entitlement starts and the data pension credit is put into payment. Estimated backdating periods therefore include unknown periods of time that are due to processing, evidence gathering and verification work which routinely accompany every claim for pension credit.<br>
3. Due to rounding the numbers of successful claims by period of backdating may not sum to the total number of successful claims.<br>
4. There will be people flowing onto pension credit that will have zero backdating. These cases will be captured in the 0-3 month group.<br>

 The following tables provide information on current pinch point trades. As can be seen, not all of the information on current pinch point trades is available. This is largely evident in the Army figures as there is insufficient data held on the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system. During the transition to JPA, which was introduced to the Army in April 2007, some data was lost. This data is currently being rebuilt although it may be some time before reliable information is available. Target figures are not available as they do not exist. Not all pinch point trades can be rectified by inflow as the pinch point may appear at more senior levels; this loss of experience cannot necessarily be grown through inflow. Some gaps can be filled by promotion pull but the challenge is to stem voluntary outflow.</p>

All three Services employ retention measures targeted at specific trade groups. For example, in the RN financial retention incentives (FRIs) are used to retain GR7 Instructors (&#163;100,000 for pilot), MERLIN Aircrew and Lieutenant X Sub-Mariner Advanced Warfare Qualified (&#163;25,000 with a Return of Service of four years). Other incentives include more flexible use of Full Term Commissions and the introduction of a Professional Aviator Pay Spine for air crewmen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80515w0011.htm_para6"><a name="08051597000157">Similarly, in the Army, FRIs are used as incentives for Infantry at identified key decision points and there is considerable focus on improving wastage during training. To retain Royal Engineer Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel the Army has introduced specialist pay and extended the course to increase first-time pass rate. REME Recovery Mechanic is another trade where the removal of Class 1 time bars, development of an apprenticeship scheme and the instigation of early eligibility for promotion to LCpl has helped to aid retention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80515w0011.htm_para7"><a name="08051597000158">The RAF have FRIs for a number of trades (fire fighter, nurse and gunner); introduced more flexible manning policies (such as re-engagement to 22 years for selected Base Rank personnel) and opened up Continuance as a way of retaining experience.</p>

This announcement followed completion of the MOD's assessment of the evidence gathered during the utility vehicle trials and the further work to fully understand the commercial implications of the three competing designs.

 Defence Ministers have met their counterparts on a number of occasions where the subject of NHS reservists was discussed. Officials within the MOD and the UK Health Departments have further advanced this issue under the auspices of the MOD/UK Health Departments Partnership Board. The Partnership Board is currently exploring a number of ways in which NHS staff can be encouraged to become reservists. These include targeted MOD recruitment campaigns and the education of NHS employers on the benefits to the NHS, in terms of clinical and leadership skills, of their staff being members of the volunteer reserve.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced our intentions in a speech in April at a dinner hosted by the Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers (SaBRE) organisation. The invited guests at the dinner consisted of NHS executives from NHS Trusts in the North-West. As part of his speech he also spoke of his support for NHS staff being members of the volunteer reserves and his hope that NHS employers would actively support staff who became reservists.</p>

This protocol will provide for Designated Court Centres (DCC) for SOCA cases which are prosecuted by OCD. This will be an effective way to manage the prosecution of these cases which are typically multi handed, voluminous and raise complex and specialist issues of law. The process of designating court centres will take into account geographical factors and the size, security and facilities at court centres.

 The Drug Strategy is focused on illegal drugs and the most dangerous drugs, including class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine. The reason for this is that illegal drugs cause significant and wide ranging problems to individuals, families and communities, including drug-related crime and health harms. class A drug use generates an estimated &#163;15.4 billion in crime and health costs each year and between a third and a half of acquisitive crime is estimated to be drug related. Due to this, the new strategy focuses on achieving a long-term and sustainable reduction in the harms associated with illegal drugs.</p>

For example, interventions to limit the supply of illegal drugs would be inappropriate to deal with prescription drugs. Similarly, the harms caused by prescription drugs differ from those generated by illegal drug use. The latter give rise to predominantly crime and social harms, whereas prescription drugs give rise to health harms and, indeed, health harms requiring interventions other than those employed in the treatment of dependency on illegal drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin. For these reasons, it would be inappropriate for prescribed tranquillisers to be subject to the measures set out  in the strategy to tackle the harms caused by illegal drug use.</p>

With respect to the last two years, there was a bid for a three-year project to develop management strategies for small hive beetle which was not funded although a shorter project to develop a monitoring system for small hive beetle is ongoing. There was also an outline proposal but no formal bid for a project to build upon previous DEFRA funded work to develop a biological control product for the varroa mite. This project is still being discussed; a decision has yet to be made about whether this work will be funded.</p>

contracting <i> Mycobacterium</i> bovis (<i> M</i>. bovis) infection from cattle in Great Britain is considered low due to robust human health controls (cattle surveillance and slaughter of infected animals; controls on milk and meat; occupational health controls; and Government Departments and agencies working together to monitor the situation). The majority of cases of tuberculosis in humans are caused by a different organism, <i> Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="80515w0020.htm_para1"><a name="08051597001783">At present, less than 1 per cent. of all confirmed cases of TB in humans are due to infection with <i> M</i>. bovis. In these cases, the Health Protection Agency carries out epidemiological investigations into the source and route of transmission of the infection. Most <i> M</i>. bovis infections identified in Britain in the present day have been picked up abroad or prior to the introduction of widespread pasteurisation of milk.</p>

 We have considered a range of evidence relating to risk factors which may increase the likelihood of TB in cattle herds. An association between increased herd size and an increased risk of TB herd breakdown, and persistence of infection, has been reported by several recent studies in the scientific literature. However, the relationship is not straightforward. Testing more animals is likely to result in an increased probability of obtaining a positive test result in the herd, and herd size may be a proxy for other management-related risk factors such as herd turnover rates and stocking density, farm enterprise factors, and risks from foodstuffs.</p>

 Ofgem is currently conducting a probe into the energy markets, which includes looking at tariff differentials to make sure that the different payment methods are fair and justified. It released initial findings at the Fuel Poverty summit in April, and is already taking action to ensure that energy suppliers provide clear information on their websites to ensure that customers can make informed choices about the different payment methods.

These arrangements will be monitored by a new trade body, the Christmas Prepayments Association, under the terms of a new code of practice. We understand that the Association will be seeking approval of the code by the OFT under the terms of its consumer codes approval scheme.

This will enable new and emerging industries to develop the skilled workforce they will need. We have instituted a process of vocational reform inviting sector skills councils, on behalf of employers, to undertake sector skills reviews to identify key vocational qualifications for the future of their sectors. World-class apprenticeships commit us to boost the range of apprenticeships and we would expect the new National Apprenticeship Service to identify the skills needs of business involved with emerging technologies and to work with sector skills bodies to develop appropriate frameworks.

<i> [holding answer 13 May 2008]:</i> The childcare sufficiency assessments which all local authorities were required to complete by 31 March 2008 took account of the affordability of childcare, which is one of the factors which can be regarded as the 'benchmark' of sufficiency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_507"><a name="80515w0027.htm_para10"><a name="0805161000512">This Government recognise that childcare costs are a serious matter for some families in some areas, which is why we are doing more than ever before to make good quality childcare and early education accessible and affordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="80515w0027.htm_para11"><a name="0805161000513">We are investing &#163;3 billion per year to support free early education, so all 3 and four year olds, irrespective of the employment status of their parents, can benefit from 12.5 hours of free early years provision for 38 weeks per year. This increases to 15 hours by 2010 and will be delivered more flexibly to meet families' needs. In addition, we announced in the Children's Plan an additional 100m to pilot a free entitlement for 20,000 of our most disadvantaged two year olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="80515w0027.htm_para12"><a name="0805161000514">We provide substantial help (totalling over &#163;3 million a day) through the tax credit system, in providing up to 80 per cent. of childcare costs. This helps nearly 450,000 families, with nearly 280,000 of these families being those with children under the age of five.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="80515w0027.htm_para13"><a name="0805161000515">The budget increased the commitment to childcare by announcing additional pilots to support new approaches to childcare, building on good practice from the additional childcare support provided by the &#163;33 million London Childcare Affordability Programme. In addition, the Government will also pilot new child development grants of 200 in 10 local authority areas, payable where parents take up their childcare places and have contact with their local Children's Centre.</p>

 It is our intention to allow settings to grant exemptions from the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) learning and development requirements to individual children, where parents can show that the requirements are in conflict with their religious or philosophical beliefs. We anticipate that such exemptions will be needed in only exceptional circumstances, given the breadth and flexibility within the EYFS requirements. It is already the case that good providers of early learning and child care will tailor their provision to suit each individual child that they work with, including taking into account the views of parents, and we expect that they will continue to do so when the EYFS comes into force.</p>

 Whether a Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) check is required of an employee of a business offering a work experience placement, either as part of current statutory work related learning at key stage 4 or as part of a diploma course from September 2008, depends on the nature of the placement, and an assessment of the risks involved. Risk assessments, and CRB checks where required, are frequently carried out by Education Business Partnerships on behalf of schools which have the duty to ensure this is done. There are no plans to carry out Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks on everyone a young person comes into contact with during a work experience placement including those which are part of diploma requirements. This is because looking after, training and supervising a young person during the course of their placement is not part of those employees' day to day role. CRB checks, where selectively required, have been carried out on employees of businesses offering work experience placement at KS4 for a number of years. The track record in respect of safeguarding young people during their work experience is first class, with no reported instances or difficulties.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has proposed to accept the recommendations of the School Teachers&#146; Review Body for a pay award of 2.45 per cent. for school teachers in England and Wales from 1 September 2008. This would mean that all teachers currently in service and who remain in service on 1 September 2008 would receive a minimum uplift of 2.45 per cent. About 40 per cent. of teachers progress to a higher point in any one year and these teachers would therefore receive additional increases.</p>
