To ask the hon.

<a name="30109w01.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the comparative level of investment by the United Kingdom in national air traffic control equipment with that of the EU average.  [89007]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is little financial information available from national air navigation services providers across the EU on the magnitude of investment in air traffic control equipment. Even if comparative information were available, it would be difficult to make a meaningful assessment because the level of investment by any service provider depends where that provider is in its investment cycle, for example whether or not it is currently introducing major new facilities as NATS has recently done at Swanwick.

<a name="30109w01.html_wqn2"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B>

 The Civil Aviation Authority has proposed new arrangements for the upper airspace over the North Sea and, as part of these changes, a small area of UK airspace amounting to less than 0.1 per cent. of North Sea airspace will, from 20 March 2003, be serviced by the Dutch national authorities. Co-operation between national air traffic control authorities is widespread and routine across Europe and is effected under the auspices of Eurocontrol and&#151;in the case of the UK&#151;the Civil Aviation Authority. The co-operation takes the form of one national authority handling traffic which is in the national airspace of another state where this will facilitate the most expeditious movement of air traffic.

<a name="30109w01.html_wqn3"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many air traffic controllers were employed by NATS on <i>(a)</i> 1 May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 1 May 2002; and how many hours of training was provided to air traffic controllers annually in the year ending <i>(a)</i> 1 May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 1 May 2002  [89005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 NATS employed 1,735 air traffic controllers on 1 May 1997 and 1942 on 1 May 2002. These figures include trainee controllers. I am informed by NATS that trainee controllers received 145,054 hours of training in the year ending 1 May 1997 and 235,346 hours of training in the year ending 1 May 2002. Information about continuing in-service training of qualified controllers is not readily available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Staffing issues are matters for NATS, as the employer. NATS inform me that on 1 May 1997, 112 staff were absent out of a total of 5,142 (2.18 per cent.). On 1 May 2002, 102 staff were absent out of a total of 5,294 (1.93 per cent).

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will publish the results of the two-year trial, beginning August 2000, to extend night period runway alternation at Heathrow to the hour between 6 am and 7 am; and if he will make a statement.  [89536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The trial was expected to run for about two years. During 2002 it was affected on approximately 35 per cent. of mornings by engineering works, including replacement of the instrument landing systems (ILS), runway resurfacing and replacement of runway lighting. Completion of the resurfacing work on the southern runway has also been delayed, and will resume in April. Consequently it is not possible at this stage to draw any firm conclusions from the trial, which will need to continue for a sustained period following the completion of the engineering works later this year.

<a name="30109w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom already has a comprehensive security regime in place covering ports and harbours which service international ferries and cruise ship calls. In addition, the three border agencies, police Special Branch, HM Customs and Excise and the Immigration Service, control the movement of passengers and goods through small ports. Their presence at the ports is determined by a risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="30109w01.html_para5">This national regime will be augmented by July 2004 with the implementation of the recently agreed International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global maritime security regime. This agreement requires signatory nations to develop and implement maritime security procedures. All ships over 500 tonnes engaged in international voyages and all ports which service such ships will be party to the security requirements.

<P>
<a name="30109w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Capital funding for local transport is provided by Government in two main ways: for maintenance and schemes costing below #5 million, as a block of funds over which local authorities have discretion; and for major schemes costing over #5million, as scheme-specific funding. In recent years, up to and including 2001&#150;02, authorities had permission to carry over their 'block' funds from one financial year to the next.

Outturn spending figures for 2002&#150;03 will be available in July 2003.

The site was emptied of United Kingdom owned munitions by December 2000. The UK portion of the Welford site was transferred for use by the United States authorities in October 2002.

 We do not have information on numbers of national minimum wage (NMW) beneficiaries specific to Newcastle upon Tyne or Gateshead. For the north-east region as a whole, it is thought that around 80,000 people should have benefited from the introduction of the NMW in April 1999. The number who should have benefited from the NMW uprating in October 2001 is estimated to be 110,000.

In spring 2002 the average wage in Newcastle was #409.9, an increase of nearly 22 per cent., and in Gateshead it had risen to #389.4, an increase of 10.5 per cent. over the period. Over the same period the average wage for the north east as a whole increased by nearly 18 per cent., to #399.3, and for Great Britain by 21 per cent., to #464.7.

 Different air quality objectives apply in respect of different pollutants, different dates and different parts of the country. For many pollutants, our latest modelling indicates that by 2010 100 per cent. of the population will be living in areas that meet the current air quality strategy objectives. But in respect of other pollutants, there remain some areas where the current objectives may not be met. In respect of particulate matter (PM10), for example, our latest air quality projections estimate that in 2010, 88 per cent of the population of England (excluding London) will live in areas that meet the air quality strategy objective. Furthermore, it is estimated that 98 per cent. of the population of London will live in areas that meet the air quality strategy objective for PM10 for London in 2010. Additional measures will need to be developed over the coming years to increase the proportion of the population living in areas that meet the strategy targets for PM10.

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> Under the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative, a potential of #170 million will be spent funding 684 public area CCTV schemes. Many of these schemes cover shopping areas. Under the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas Initiative, #15 million is being provided to improve security of small retailers, including the provision of CCTV where appropriate. In year one of the Initiative (2001&#150;02) approximately 50 per cent. of projects involved the installation or upgrading of CCTV. This figure rose to almost 70 per cent. in year two (2002&#150;03).
<P>

<a name="30109w06.html_para4">Police operational experience and various other research studies show that CCTV has considerable crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> Under the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative around #170 million will be spent between 1998 and 2003 funding 684 CCTV schemes. More than 520 of these schemes are already fully operational, with further schemes coming on line weekly.
<P>

<a name="30109w06.html_para6">Although this initiative is now closed, other opportunities for funding of crime reduction measures, including CCTV schemes, currently exist under the Safer Communities, Communities Against Drugs and the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas initiatives.

<P>

<a name="30109w06.html_para8">The Updated Drug Strategy was published in November 2002, and makes further progress towards breaking the link between drugs and crime by introducing or extending a range of interventions aimed at getting offenders with drug problems into drug treatment, in particular taking forward the work we have already done on Arrest Referral and Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, building on the pilot Drug Testing projects by extending this approach more widely, and developing better systems for throughcare and aftercare.

 There are already arrangements nationally to record missing persons. Details of all missing persons should be recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) as soon as possible and in any case within 48 hours of their disappearance.
<P>

<a name="30109w07.html_para0">Notification of all outstanding missing persons should be sent to the Police National Missing Persons Bureau (PNMPB) within 14 days. Most missing persons are found locally within this period.

The aim of the project is the establishment of joint working arrangements between the United Kingdom police service and NMPH, together with improved recording and information sharing, to improve the service to missing persons and their families and to inform our understanding of the problem and develop strategies to address it. One of the key objectives of this project is to establish a unified national database of missing and unidentified people reported either to the police or to the NMPH.

<a name="30109w07.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have no plans to end the status of British Overseas Citizen. We received representations during the passage of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill about the plight of British nationals who had no right of abode in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.

<a name="30109w07.html_para4">The remaining provisions in the British Nationality Act 1981 relating to the statuses of British Overseas Citizen, British subject and British protected person will continue in force to cater for those who are unable or unwilling to acquire British citizenship, and to facilitate the voluntary renunciation of those statuses.

 We estimate that there are now some 35,000 British overseas citizens and 10,000 British subjects and British protected persons who have no other citizenship. However, a margin of error must be allowed. These figures are based largely on personal contact with our overseas missions in the course of applications for passport and other consular services. There will be people who have not availed themselves of these services. Conversely, there will be people eligible for British citizenship who will not apply.

 The Secretary of State for the Home Department does not have the power to intervene in the recording or investigation of individual complaints.
<P>

<a name="30109w07.html_para5">Under section 69 of the Police Act 1996, the chief officer of the force is the appropriate authority for recording and investigating complaints, other than complaints against senior officers. All complaints about the conduct of police officers must be recorded. It is for the chief officer to determine whether a complaint relates to the conduct of officers. A complaint may be resolved informally if the complainant consents and the chief officer is satisfied that the conduct complained of would not justify criminal or disciplinary proceedings. Otherwise the complaint must be formally investigated.

It will also have the power to call in any complaint and to determine how any subsequent investigation should be handled.

<P>
<a name="30109w08.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There is no published data on decision times specifically to determine applications for settlement. We aim to screen all postal applications within three weeks and decide those that are straightforward at that point. However, because of the high number of applications in the latter part of 2002, this is, regrettably, taking around 10 weeks on average. Some that need further inquiries or more detailed consideration can take around 12 months to decide. We are taking measures to improve this situation and expect to make significant progress towards our three-week target for initial screening over the next two to three months, and to reduce the turnaround time for deciding more complex cases.

Immigration Services Commissioner, which was established under Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Any subsequent disciplinary action is a matter for the relevan designated professional body. Complaints may also be submitted direct to the particular solicitor's professional body. The Commissioner must report annually to the Secretary of State as to the effectiveness of each designated professional body in regulating its members regarding the provision of immigration advice or immigration services. The Commissioner's first such report was incorporated in his Annual Report for 2001&#150;02 which the Secretary of State presented to Parliament on 23 July 2002.

However, if the inquiry is about an application which is still awaiting a decision by IND for over six months or where compelling evidence is provided of compassionate reasons for resolving the application quickly, the hotline and casework teams will endeavour to complete it or explain why that is not possible.

 The Crown Prosecution Service deals with fraud cases of all types, from simple Xhigh street" frauds to major corporate frauds. The most complex cases do require highly specialised knowledge, for instance knowledge of Stock Exchange practices. The Casework Directorate of CPS Headquarters has a number of specialist lawyers, working with dedicated accountancy support, to deal with those cases.
<P>

<a name="30109w08.html_para6">Elsewhere in the CPS special casework lawyers deal with large fraud cases, particularly in the larger urban areas where these tend to arise. The capacity of the CPS to devote more senior lawyer resources to complex cases, including fraud, has increased following its restructuring in 1999 and a significant increase in resources in recent years. In response to the recent inspection of the Casework Directorate by HMCPS Inspectorate, the CPS will shortly be considering how best it can deploy its resources to deal with fraud cases in the future.

<P>
<a name="30109w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 National health service medical primary care services are available free to all persons who are ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. Refugees and asylum seekers given leave to remain in the UK, or awaiting the results of an application to remain, are regarded as ordinarily resident and entitled to full NHS general practitioner treatment.
<P>

<a name="30109w09.html_para1">This will be re-emphasised in a resource pack for those who work with asylum seekers, which has been developed with the Refugee Council and will be issued early this year.

 The NHS Cancer Plan set out new goals to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. Data is currently published by geographical area on the Department of Health website for the two week outpatient waiting time standard and the treatment targets for 2001. Reporting of performance against the December 2002 target of a two month maximum wait, from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for breast cancer, will begin in 2003. National reporting of performance against the 2005 targets, which relate to all cancers, will similarly begin when those targets come into force. Arrangements are being put in place to enable those providing and commissioning services for cancer patients to monitor progress in the interim.

<a name="30109w09.html_para8">The assumptions underlying the #100 million figure are as follows: assuming that local authorities reach the targets they have set themselves to reduced delayed transfers of care by March 2003, and which are conditions of their receiving Building Care Capacity Grant for that year, there will be a total of 4,200 delays on average per day. Of the 4,200 delays, it is assumed that 1,900 would be at the #100 rate per day and 2,300 at the #120 rate per day. Of these, it is assumed that social services might be responsible for some 60 per cent. On that basis and on the assumption that social services make no further progress in reducing delays beyond the March 2003 targets, the total sum that social services departments would have to pay in reimbursements to the National Health Service per year would be around #100 million.

 The grant was used in a variety of ways, consistent with its purpose. High proportions of the grant were used to fund residential and nursing care placements, and increase fees. The funding allocated to councils will provide for a continued reduction in the number of delayed discharges from hospitals, so that 20 per cent. fewer beds are blocked in March 2003, compared to March 2002.

Delayed discharges are a joint health and social services indicator, but data are submitted to the Department on the basis of NHS organisations, the data having been agreed with their social services partners. No social services departments chose not to allocate their building care capacity grant funding to reduce delayed discharge, as this was a condition of their receipt of the grant.

There is as such no set criteria for deciding eligibility to a home visit although we expect the vast majority of queries will be dealt with swiftly and effectively without the need for a home visit. Indeed a simple call to a pension centre is likely to be the most effective and satisfactory way of dealing with customers' inquiries without the delay of appointments.

 It remains the Government's aim, as set out in the Department's public service agreement, to increase higher education participation towards 50 per cent. of 18 to 30-year-olds by the end of the decade. I will be publishing a strategy for higher education later this month which will include our plans for achieving the target.

<a name="30109w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The first sure start programme, announced in 1998, has worked by bringing together early education, child care, health and family support for the benefit of young children living in disadvantaged areas and their parents.
<P>

<a name="30109w12.html_para1">On 11 December the Government launched the new sure start programme (in England) which will support families from pregnancy until children are 14. The new sure start will bring together universal, free, early education and more and better child care, with greater support where there is greater need, through child care tax credit, children's centres, and on-going support for sure start local programmes.

 All local education authorities were committed to offering a full timetable to permanently excluded pupils from September 2002. In targeted schools in 34 local authorities provision is also being made for those excluded on a temporary basis.

<P>
<a name="30109w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Some sections of the Act dealing with admissions have already been commenced. Most depend for implementation on Regulations, to be read in conjunction with revised Codes of Practice on School Admissions and School Admission Appeals. Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Regulations and Codes of Practice are expected to come into force on 20 January. Most aspects of the Regulations and Codes are intended to apply to admission arrangements affecting intakes from September 2004, which means, for example, that each LEA must have an admission forum in place by 20 March 2003. The obligation to co-ordinate admission arrangements applies to intakes from 2005 but LEAs are encouraged to co-ordinate secondary intakes earlier.

 All local education authorities (LEAs) were invited to bid for Basic Need funding when the guidance for 2003&#150;04 was issued on 30 July 2002, and the deadline for LEAs to submit their bids was 30 September 2002. It was for LEAs to decide whether or not to bid for funding based on the criteria in the guidance. Wokingham LEA did not submit any bids for Basic Need funding in 2003&#150;04. Officials within the Department confirmed with Helen Rowlay at the LEA that no bids were being made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Guidance on identifying and assessing children's special educational needs is given in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, to which schools and local education authorities must have regard. The guidance is organised under four broad areas of need&#151;communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development; and sensory and/or physical needs&#151;to recognise that children often have needs in one or more areas. Dyslexia is referred to specifically in relation to communication and interaction and cognition and learning. The Department has also produced specific guidance to support pupils with dyslexia as part of the National Literacy Strategy.
<P>

The new system of funding for LEAs consists of a basic entitlement which is the same for all pupils, plus a top up for all deprived pupils, which is the same for all deprived pupils, and a further top up for those LEAs in areas with additional costs for recruitment and retention of staff. The average formula spending share per pupil for upper tier authorities is higher than for Leicestershire, because most upper tier authorities have a higher percentage of deprived pupils, and some have higher area costs.<P>

We have commissioned the QCA to produce new units for the music schemes of work to help teachers work more effectively with peripatetic music specialists and to develop their confidence and skills; and we are exploring best practice in music education through the inspection of LEA Music Services; through a network of advanced skills teachers for music; and through six pilot projects focusing primarily on instrumental tuition at Key Stage 2.

Since it was set up in 1999, this Department has provided around #125 million through the MSF for the protection and expansion of LEA Music Services; while the MDS has allocated just under #65 million to gifted and talented young musicians since 1997 through its Aided Pupil Scheme.

 Local education authorities (LEAs) and admission authorities for schools may set their own admission arrangements, as long as they comply with legislation and have regard to the statutory Code of Practice on School Admissions. The Code gives advice to LEAs and schools on setting admission arrangements, and refers to the 'Greenwich Judgement' of 1989 which ruled that LEA maintained schools could not refuse applications simply because a child did not live in the Authority's administrative area. However, admission policies may give priority for entry to oversubscribed schools to children who live within a specified catchment area, to those who live closest to the school, or (for secondary schools) to those who attend named Xfeeder" schools. These, and the many other criteria which are used to determine priority for admission to schools, may include children who live both inside and outside a LEA's area.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has <i>(a)</i> to increase the supply of affordable housing in areas of shortage and <i>(b)</i> to make changes to reduce the loss of housing stock through the Right to Buy.  [88546]<P>

<a name="30109w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In his statement to the House about sustainable communities on 18 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 438, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister promised to return to the House with a comprehensive long-term programme of action to tackle a number of housing and planning issues in order to deliver a step change in the Government's policies for building successful, thriving and inclusive communities in all regions. The statement, which will be made shortly, will set out how the additional funding announced in the 2002 spending review will be used and what it will buy over the three years up to 2005&#150;06. It will cover the provision of affordable housing in areas of shortage.
<P>

<a name="30109w15.html_para0">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is concerned about some aspects of the way in which the Right to Buy is operating, and about exploitation of the rules, and is looking at ways of addressing this.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many homeless people, broken down by local authority, have been placed in hotel annexes of self-contained accommodation where meals were not provided in each of the last five years for which figures are available.  [89125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Information distinguishing the number of households accommodated in self-contained hotel annexes has only been collected since March 2002 (previously, local authorities recorded such accommodation either as bed and breakfast or as private sector accommodation). These annexes are not necessarily directly attached to a hotel, and meals may or may not be provided, but the household has exclusive use of all facilities.
<P>

<a name="30109w15.html_para1">Information on households in such accommodation confirmed, or not reported, by local authorities in England at the end of each quarter since March 2002 is presented in the table; authorities not listed reported nil returns.

 The Government have made a clear commitment that by March 2004 no local authority should place a homeless family with children in Bed and Breakfast accommodation other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks. In April 44 of the highest using B&B authorities were required to produce bed and breakfast action plans detailing how they would meet the commitment by March 2004. Some authorities set out ambitious plans to meet the commitment a year early in March 2003, 10 currently appear on target to do so:

 The Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 (si 2002/2051), made under the Housing Act 1996, and the main homelessness provisions of the Homelessness Act 2002 came into force on 31 July 2002. The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is monitoring implementation of the new provisions, including local housing authorities' progress in carrying out a homelessness review in their district and preparing a homelessness strategy for adoption and publication by 30 July 2003. In addition, local housing authorities have been asked to submit a statement to the directorate indicating how they propose to spend their share of #10 million, allocated by the directorate in 2002&#150;03, to assist with the cost of implementing the Homelessness Priority Need Order. The provisions of the 2002 Act which amend part 6 of the Housing Act 1996 (allocation of housing) will not come into force until 31 January 2003.

<a name="30109w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government supports the National Land Information Service (NLIS) initiative as a way of delivering property searches electronically within the context of the 2005 target for e-enabling public services and as a part of the seller's pack initiative. Over the last year the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has supported NLIS by contributing to a reception for exemplar authorities and co-ordinating the distribution of a letter to all authorities briefing them on the benefits of NLIS and the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG). In particular, the briefing [paragraph 13] makes the case for lower fees as an incentive for electronic searches. Copies of the letter have been placed in the Library of the House. Officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and other government departments have formed a central government stakeholders group to co-ordinate work with NLIS across Government. NLIS is an integral part of our proposals to reform the home buying and selling process. It provides the information needed for conveyancing searches more quickly and with more certainty than paper-based systems. NLIS will help ensure that sellers' packs can be produced quickly and thus reduce the scope for gazumping and other problems to occur.
<P>

<a name="30109w16.html_para0">Fees for searches of the local land charges are prescribed by my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor. Fees for other land and property searches are set by individual local authorities. These powers are already wide enough to allow different fees to be set for electronic and manual searches, so the question of an order under the Electronic Communications Act does not arise. As with other services they provide, it is the responsibility of local authorities to set income targets and fees for dealing with conveyancers' enquiries, taking account of the cost of the service and the level of charges 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2003 : Column 350W</I><P>
the market will bear. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister supports reasonable levels of differential pricing where local authorities consider this appropriate in light of these criteria. Completely electronic based services are likely to be cheaper and the briefing quotes the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) and NLIS calculation that fees for searches received could be set at least 18 per cent. lower than for other searches (even without counting savings from electronic payment).
<P>

<a name="30109w16.html_para1">There has been no assessment of administrative and staffing costs of the search methods as it is for councils to set the level of charges. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is encouraging Information House's efforts to market NLIS and the cost savings from e-enabling is clearly an attractive part of the business case for adoption. NLIS reports that over 70 authorities have introduced differential pricing for land and property searches.
<P>

<a name="30109w16.html_para2">It is not the intention of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to offer financial support to either Information House or individual councils to accelerate take up of NLIS. It has always been framed as a self-funding proposition for both Information House and participation councils. However, councils may, if they wish, use part of the 200,000 capital grant made available by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Implementing Electronic Government monies) for e-Government to support local implementation of NLIS.
<P>

<a name="30109w16.html_para3">Over the next month and beyond, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will work with other government departments and NLIS in the context of the Central Government Stakeholders group to consider ways of encouraging the take up and success of NLIS. Officials are currently working with the IDeA and Information House to discuss the provision of funding to support the NLPG project and the development of Local Land and Property Gazetteers (LLPGs) in local authorities. The implementation of LLPGs in local authorities and NPLG will assist take up of NLIS. Officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellors Department are working together to examine a proposal from the Local Government Association for differential prescribed fees for searches of the local land charges register.

 Psychiatrists are educated about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) during their general professional training as part of child and adolescent mental health subjects. Child and adolescent psychiatrists, who undergo higher professional training prior to becoming consultants focus on relevant areas such as ADHD in more depth. Postgraduate training, as part of continual professional development, also ensures increased awareness and keeps professionals abreast of developments in this area.

 The resources available to the DHSSPS are distributed to each of the four HSS Boards on the basis of a regional capitation formula, which takes various factors into account, such as the population profile and additional need. It is the responsibility of each board to allocate resources equitably to its population. Boards are encouraged to use the capitation formula to inform spending decisions for their sub-board populations.
<P>

<a name="30109w18.html_para0">The Eastern Health and Social Services Board is currently reviewing the equitable distribution of resources to its sub-board population. The board has been working on a strategy to address the equitable allocation of resources to all trusts in its area and, following public consultation, implementation of the resultant strategy should commence from April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30109w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 A wide range of measures is being taken to tackle hospital waiting lists. These include the expansion of existing bed capacity, the development of protected elective facilities, the provision of additional in-patient procedures, the development of community provision as an alternative to hospital treatment, the validation of waiting lists and improved management of waiting lists.
<P>

<a name="30109w18.html_para1">I believe that these measures will have an impact. For example, half of HSS Trusts were able to report a fall in numbers waiting at 30 September 2002. It is also important to note that, despite the large numbers of people waiting for hospital treatment, almost three-quarters of inpatients treated between July and September 2002 waited for less than three months and 95 per cent. waited less than a year for their treatment.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of anticipated receipts from the landfill levy will be allocated to <i>(a)</i> continuing funding for environmental schemes and <i>(b)</i> funding to encourage sustainable waste management in (i) 2003&#150;04, (ii) 2004&#150;05 and (iii) 2005&#150;06.

 No decision has yet been made on the precise figures that will apply. However, in 2003&#150;04, landfill operators will be able to divert approximately 6 per cent. of their total tax liability to the funding of local environmental schemes. About a further 14 per cent. will be used to fund the uptake of more sustainable waste management practices. Estimates for future years will depend on the figures applied in 2003&#150;04. The figures for 2005&#150;06 will also depend on decisions the Government take on how the revenue from the proposed tax increase of #3 per tonne is recycled.

 It has been the practice of successive administrations not to release the minutes of meetings concerned with the development of policy. Exemption 2 (internal discussion and advice) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information applies.
