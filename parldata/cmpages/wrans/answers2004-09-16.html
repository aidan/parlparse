<p><a name="40916w01.html_wqn1"><b> Derek Conway: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will investigate the process by which Bexley council proposes to dispose of the North Cray school site in Sidcup to London and Quadrant.  [188590]</p>








<p><a name="40916w01.html_spnew1"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Disposal of land by local authorities is governed by section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972. Authorities have discretion to dispose of land in any manner they wish. The First Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s only power is to grant or withhold consent where authorities wish to dispose of land at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable and the proposed disposal falls outside the scope of the General Disposal Consent in ODPM Circular 06/2003. There are no statutory powers available to launch an investigation into the disposal process used in any specific case. If an individual feels the correct procedures have not been followed the best course of action would be to approach the Local Government Ombudsman.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many additional houses he anticipates will be built on Canvey Island over the next 10 years; and how many school-age children he estimates will live in those houses.  [189304]</p>








<p><a name="40916w01.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 It will be for Castle Point borough council, as the local planning authority, to decide how many homes should be built on Canvey Island once the Regional Spatial Strategy for the East of England has been issued. It will also fall to the local authorities to consider how many school-age children are likely to live in any additional Canvey Island housing, having regard to local demography, types of housing to be provided and local educational standards.

 The Index of Multiple Deprivation (2004) is based on Super Output Areas (SOAs) rather than wards. SOAs are geographical units which are based on consistent areas of between 1,000 to 3,000 people. They are designed to measure small areas more effectively and to be consistent over time. Tables which show each of the wards in Weston-super-Mare and each of the Super Output Areas which make up these wards have been made available in the Library of the House. The scores and ranks of these SOAs are given as requested. In the ranks, 1 is most deprived. One of the Super Output Areas, in Wrington, is partially in this ward and partially in the adjacent ward. This SOA is included.

<p>
<a name="40916w02.html_para7">
During 2003, ETMP has tested a range of improvements to the pre-trial process in six criminal justice areas. These have included measures designed to ensure that pre-trial hearings in the magistrates&#039; courts are held only where necessary to progress a case to an effective trial.

Since the introduction VAT, in the UK, allergy relief products supplied in all other circumstances are liable to VAT at the standard rate which, since 1 April 1991, has been 17.5 per cent. Prior to that, the standard rate of VAT was as follows: from 1 April 1973&#151;10 per cent.; from 29 July 1974&#151;8 per cent.; from 18 June 1979&#151;15 per cent.

<p><a name="40916w04.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessments she has made of the effect on the number of experiments on animals of the new REACH regulations; and if she will make a statement.  [187479]</p>








<p><a name="40916w04.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The EU proposal on REACH requires information to be gathered on chemicals in order to provide the basis for protecting human health and the environment. This information may come from a number of sources, one of which is animal testing. The Commission has estimated that this draft Regulation will require data to be gathered on approximately 30,000 chemicals. Of these, 20,000 are thought to be produced or imported in quantities of less than 10 tonnes. At this tonnage the current Commission proposal requires 25 animals per chemical, although it should be remembered that in most cases the tests are expected to demonstrate that the chemical concerned is safe and therefore involves no threat to humans or animals. It is a key objective of the UK Government&#039;s work on REACH to keep animal testing to a minimum. Discussions are continuing on that basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w04.html_para1">
The Commission proposal would require further data as tonnage increases to reflect the greater potential human and environmental exposure. The tests performed need to comply with the relevant requirements for the protection of laboratory animals set out in Directive 86/609/EEC where, among other things, methods used must be refined in such a way as to minimise the amount of suffering caused to the animals concerned. Further, the chemical industry already has some of this data and there are other sources of information such as modelling of data and grouping of chemicals to read-across data from one chemical to another, all of which will reduce the amount of new testing that will be required. If recent experience from a major testing programme in the USA were to be duplicated in Europe, the number of new animal tests that will need to be undertaken will be significantly lower than the estimates talked about to date.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w04.html_para2">
It is an overall objective, for the UK Government, in negotiating this Regulation, to ensure that animal testing is kept to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment. One of the ways we aim to do this is by applying an intelligent approach to testing.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1662W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="40916w04.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK has always sought to maintain a balanced approach to CITES issues&#151;basing its decisions on sound science. This means promoting worthwhile and practicable conservation measures while upholding the principle of sustainable development. The views of the UK Government on these issues are widely respected both within the EU and CITES as a whole, and as such have been, and continue to be, very influential in shaping the EU position on CITES issues.

<p><a name="40916w04.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK Government and the other EU member states take the view that no decision on commercial trade in ivory should be taken outside the framework agreed at the last Conference of CITES Parties in Santiago. This allowed for a one-off sale of ivory stocks held by Botswana, Namibia and South Africa subject to certain strict conditions, which have yet to be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w04.html_para4">
It is our view that it would be inappropriate to consider any wider resumption in the commercial trade in ivory until there has been a proper assessment of the wider impact of this proposed one-off sale. This is therefore the line that the UK and other member states will take at the forthcoming CITES conference in Bangkok.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 20 May 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1084, on cormorant predation, what additional measures will be introduced to help angling clubs and fishing owners protect fish stock in freshwater fisheries from cormorant predation.  [189283]</p>








<p><a name="40916w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 After careful consideration of cormorant population dynamics and modelling I am announcing a new strategy to help fishery owners and angling interests deal with the problems caused by cormorants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para0">
A revised licensing system will make it simpler to apply for licences to cull cormorants where serious damage to fisheries can be shown. The new system will presume that where significant numbers of cormorants are present at a site, and it is clear that these are feeding on fish stocks, serious damage is occurring, or there is a risk of serious damage. However this will continue to be confirmed on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that Defra is satisfied that there is no other solution in accordance with the law, and to ensure that there are significant numbers of cormorants feeding which are causing, or are likely to cause, serious damage, Defra will continue its research into non-lethal methods of managing cormorant populations. Further work will be undertaken, in the near future, to test the applicability of fish refuges, optimise their design and to determine their most cost-effective spatial arrangement for them in still waters, as well as looking at ways to resolve problems in rivers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para1">
The licensing system will be made simpler in the following ways Licences will be:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Issued for a period of up to two years;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Revoked or amended by Defra as necessary;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Issued between 31 August and 15 April;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Issued in advance to prevent problems occurring;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Issued without an assessor&#039;s visit unless it is a new licence application or where circumstances have significantly changed. Every site will be visited at least once every two years, with site visits being undertaken more often if this is considered necessary;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Licences can be amended by telephone, fax or by email</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para2">
We will also ensure that the Environment Agency and other Defra agencies are aware of the changes and encouraged to follow permitted procedures where appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para3">
In addition to the measures above, where it is necessary to protect salmon and sea trout smolts, we will be prepared to issue licences to kill birds during the smolt run up to 1 May This extension will also apply to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1664W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
protect designated spawning sites, such as gravel shallows on rivers, for appropriate species of fish and fisheries. In addition those sites planning fresh stockings of fish in still waters will be able to obtain licences where such fish would be particularly vulnerable to attack.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para4">
The new licensing system is expected to lead to an increase in the number of cormorants culled. Mathematical modelling by the Central Science Laboratory suggests that the overall cormorant population would be reduced but would stabilise at a number significantly higher than its historic level. We will ensure that the cormorant population will be monitored through a refined Wetland Bird Survey count and, if necessary, the number of licences reduced in future years to ensure the stabilisation of the population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w05.html_para5">
The consequences of the new policy will be assessed on an annual basis and the number of cormorants allowed to be killed under licence adjusted as necessary to ensure stabilisation of the population. Defra will cease to issue licences for a period, and may consider revocation or suspension of licences currently issued, should the cormorant population not respond in the manner predicted. This will provide an added safety mechanism and will protect the conservation status of the bird, (as required under the Birds Directive), while providing enough flexibility to resolve fishery problems.

In the interests of providing a healthy working environment, Defra pursues a non-smoking policy in the workplace but provides smoking rooms wherever possible. The Department is committed to policies of equal opportunity and tolerance and responds to the needs of religious worship where this is required (for the Christian Fellowship, for Ramadan or for private contemplation for example). Also any conference room or meeting room can be booked for the purpose of religious observance. Similarly Defra seeks to serve the needs of nursing and expectant mothers. At smaller sites, provision for worship and nursing mothers is often combined with other facilities such as quiet rooms or first aid rooms for reasons of practicality and cost effectiveness.

 The conclusion, in the report of the Origin UK Foot and Mouth Disease Epidemic in 2001, that the UK and South African epidemics are likely to arise from a common origin, rather than the South African outbreak being the source for the UK outbreak, is based on knowledge of the history of the disease pattern and control measures in place in both countries rather than any direct evidence from phylogenetic analyses.

No viruses have been submitted to the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for foot and mouth disease which have a closer relationship to either the South Africa 2000 or the UK 2001 than these two viruses have to each other.

However, as indicated above, this should not be taken to indicate a causal relationship between the Japanese and other isolates. Due to the widespread distribution of the pan-Asia strain and its limited genetic diversity, phylogenetic analysis is unlikely to provide further information on any possible common origin for the UK and South African outbreaks.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1668W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
We do not expect commercial cultivation of GM crops in the UK before 2008. The recent decision to add 17 varieties of GM maize to the EU Common Catalogue of seed varieties does not alter this as the varieties in question are not appropriate for cultivation in UK conditions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on recent decisions of the European Commission relating to plans for commercial growing of 17 different varieties of GM maize, as submitted by Monsanto.  [188308]</p>








<p><a name="40916w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The European Commission has approved the addition of 17 varieties of GM maize to the EU Common Catalogue of seed varieties. The Common Catalogue is an amalgam of individual member states national seed lists and it is a routine procedure for varieties on individual national seed lists to be added to the Catalogue. These 17 varieties are already on either the national seed lists of France or Spain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w06.html_para4">
The 17 maize varieties all contain the same GM transformation event which confers resistance to the European corn borer. This GM event was given EU wide approval for commercial cultivation in 1998, and maize varieties containing this GM event have been grown in Spain since then.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w06.html_para5">
While adding these varieties to the EU common catalogue means they could theoretically be grown in the UK it is not expected that any farmer in the UK will attempt to grow them. This is because these varieties are very late maturing and in UK conditions they would not produce a crop with anything like the feed value that livestock farmers require from maize. Nor would they ripen to produce a grain crop. In addition the pest to which the maize varieties are designed to be resistant is not a problem in the UK. We understand that Monsanto do not intend to offer these seed varieties for sale in the UK.

 The illegal disposal of waste, or fly-tipping, is a serious criminal offence. The current penalties for those found guilty of this offence is a maximum fine of up to &#163;20,000 and two years imprisonment for incidents involving non-hazardous waste and unlimited fines and five years imprisonment for incidents involving hazardous waste. The Government is currently consulting on proposals as part of the Clean Neighbourhoods consultation to increase these penalties.

<p><a name="40916w07.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 In a report commissioned by Defra it is estimated that in 2000, approximately 660,000 tonnes of methane was emitted from UK landfills, accounting for 27 per cent. of the total methane released from the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w07.html_para3">
The amount of methane that is used has significantly increased over the last five years and information held by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) indicates that there is currently 612,674 KW installed capacity at a total of 269 UK landfill gas power stations. This is out of a potential capacity that could be readily exploited for utilisation of approximately 800,000 KW.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w07.html_para4">
The proportion of methane in landfill gas that is used has increased in response to two main drivers and is expected to continue to increase. These drivers are:

<i>(i) The Landfill Regulations (England and Wales) 2002</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w07.html_para6">
These regulations require landfill operators to collect, treat and use landfill gas (e.g. electricity generation) to the extent possible. The requirements for improved landfill gas management form an important part of new landfill permits being permitted by the Environment Agency in accordance with the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) regulatory regime.

<p><a name="40916w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are no precise figures for the amount of waste cooking fats disposed of or recycled. However, it is estimated that between 70,000 to 90,000 tonnes of used cooking oil is collected each year for use in animal feed. The remainder goes to incineration at energy plants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w08.html_para0">
Between 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of used cooking oil going to animal feed comes from catering premises. However, from 1 November 2004, this use will be prohibited under the terms of the Animal By-Products Regulation (Regulation EC No. 1774/2002). It is thought that other markets, including the growing bio-diesel industry, will absorb this stream of used cooking oil. In the short-term, these alternative markets are likely to be elsewhere in the EU. A Cabinet Office sponsored working group, including industry representatives from the various potential markets for used cooking oil, is considering current and potential UK capacity for domestic use of used cooking oil.

 A significant but highly variable proportion of the original ozone depleting substance (ODS) within a refrigerant unit will have been lost during the working life of the appliance.

The licence conditions for storage and treatment facilities of refrigeration units include measures that will minimise the loss of ODS, but further losses may occur during the extraction of the coolant (known as phase 1 degassing), as even the best equipment and procedures will not remove 100 per cent. of the coolant. Other sources of loss may include inappropriate transportation/handling or accidents/vandalism at storage facilities.

staff and visitors. A strategy document was issued to all Prison Service staff in June 2003. This explained the implications for prisons of the changes in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) due to come into effect on 1 October 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w09.html_para1">
The prison estate consists of a wide variety of buildings of differing ages and security levels and therefore access for prisoners to all prisons and prison facilities poses some difficulties. However the Prison Service&#039;s policy for all prisoners is to address their needs, including disability related needs, through the sentence planning process. This will allow prisons to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that prisoners are not discriminated against.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w09.html_para2">
The Prison Service has significant experience of operating within the employment provisions of the DDA as non-operational staff have had protection since its first introduction. On 1 October, all operational staff will be covered by the DDA. Policies have been revised to ensure that the treatment for individual staff with disabilities is compliant with the employment aspects of the DDA.

<p>
<a name="40916w09.html_para3">
A national disability compliance audit of all Prison Service establishments from a visitors&#039; perspective has not been undertaken. Given the potential scope of the exercise this would not be practicable. It remains the responsibility of each establishment to address the individual requirements of those with particular needs, bearing in mind resource implications and reasonableness. Establishments and Visitors&#039; Centres remain vigilant to the fact that the interpretation of disability within the Disability Discrimination Act is wide.

 We are delighted that women are excelling and are now attaining more degrees than ever before. In 1993, 8 per cent. of women held degrees. By 2002, this had increased to 14 per cent. Around 50 per cent. of all students on law, accountancy and medicine undergraduate courses are female. However, we must not get complacent. Occupational segregation still exists. Women are still under-represented in certain sectors and senior positions. Women represent less than 25 per cent. of all managers and senior executives, and only 15 per cent. of those working in science, engineering and technology jobs. That is why earlier today my right hon. Friend was delighted to launch a new resource centre in Bradford, dedicated to promoting women in science, engineering and technology.

<p>
<a name="40916w14.html_para0">
The further education funding system is different to schools. Funding is paid for learning aims as well as an entitlement per 16 to 18 payment. Under the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC&#039;s) funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels in a sixth form college and a further education college to a student in the 2004&#150;05 academic year will be &#163;3,045. This figure comprises &#163;766 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, and &#163;747 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme.

Under the LSC&#039;s funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels to a student at an English maintained secondary school will be &#163;3,212. This figure comprises &#163;785 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, &#163;750 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme, and &#163;107 for each student to meet additional employers&#039; contributions to teachers&#039; pensions.

These figures do not represent all funding that colleges and school sixth forms receive and are not directly comparable. For example the further education funding rates include consolidated funds for pay and staff training that are not reflected in the school sixth form rates.

As outlined in the Science and Innovation Investment Framework, the Government intends to increase the scale of its activities in advancing the Science and Society agenda. This includes activities to promote public confidence and engagement in science. Expenditure in this area will be supported through the Office of Science and Technology&#039;s Science and Society budget which will, overall, increase from &#163;4.25 million per year in 2005&#150;06 to over &#163;9 million per year by 2006&#150;07.

The Department has recently taken forward a programme of stock rationalisation in which overstocked and obsolete products were identified and recycled. We have also introduced a &#039;print on demand&#039; facility, whereby low turnover items are stored electronically and only printed when requested.

Furthermore, we are in the process of rolling out an online ordering system for schools which allows head teachers to access print materials electronically and order them in the multiples they need when they need them.

<p><a name="40916w15.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions she has had with the lenders on securing the return of two bark etchings and an Aboriginal ceremonial headdress on loan to the Museum Victoria in Melbourne, Australia; why such items have not been returned; and if she will make a statement.  [189148]</p>








<p><a name="40916w15.html_spnew3"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 DCMS has been following this matter with interest and is liaising closely with the British Museum (which has been leading on this issue for the lenders), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Australian High Commission. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has represented the UK Government position directly to the Victorian State Government and to the Federal Government of Australia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w15.html_para0">
The items in question are currently on loan from the British Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew to Museum Victoria. Their return from Australia has been delayed by two Emergency Declarations imposed by an Aboriginal inspector under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protection Act 1984. The current Declarations expire on 18 September. While a Declaration is in force, the removal of an item contrary to its terms is a criminal offence. Museum Victoria is therefore currently unable to return the items to the British Museum and Kew Gardens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w15.html_para1">
Like the lenders, we are concerned about the potentially negative impact of this issue upon future loans to Australian museums, and are keen for the loan agreements entered into by Museum Victoria to be honoured.


</p>







<p><a name="40916w15.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will prevent further loans of cultural artefacts to Australia in the light of the seizing of Aboriginal etchings recently on loan to that country from the UK.  [189149]</p>








<p><a name="40916w15.html_spnew4"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Decisions on whether or not to loan objects in museum collections are matters for the institution concerned, and the Government has no power to influence this decision. In making any decisions concerning loans of objects overseas, Trustees would obviously want to consider the particular circumstances of the countries to which the items would be sent. The government will take into account the risk that any item will not be returned to this country before granting any application for an export licence in relation to an item which a museum proposes to lend overseas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w17.html_para3">
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) will publish its annual report on the level of poppy cultivation in the autumn. We anticipate an increase in cultivation levels. Although unwelcome, experience of counter narcotic policies in Pakistan and Thailand, which both had much lower initial levels of production and were more stable countries, shows that cultivation tends to increase before declining.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w17.html_para4">
In the first year of implementation of the strategy, the basic counter narcotics structures have been put in place: drug control legislation, a Counter Narcotics Directorate, the Ministry of Interior&#039;s Afghan Special Narcotics Force, the Counter Narcotics Police and a central eradication capability. Work is also in hand to develop alternative livelihoods for farmers dependent on opium poppy cultivation. These measures provide a sound basis for the future development of robust institutions and programmes to combat opium production and trafficking. Progress remains linked to the wider security situation in Afghanistan and to the implementation of other areas of institution building such as policing and judicial systems.

Notes:<br>

1. The Transport Policies and Programme/Local Transport Plan Capital Funding covers all aspects of transport (e.g. maintenance, road safety and public transport). There is no specific allocation within these figures for public transport; it is for the local authority to set priorities and allocate funds accordingly from its Single Capital Pot budget.<br>

2. The Rural Bus Subsidy Grant, Rural Bus Challenge, Countryside Agency and Strategic Rail Authority monies are all allocated solely to public transport.<br>

3. In addition, the local authority receives Revenue Support Grant (RSG) from the Government each year. This is a block allocation for all council services, which includes support for public transport. However, it is not possible to identify any specific allocations for public transport from within the RSG allocation.<br>

<p><a name="40916w19.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The precise percentage contribution of transport-related emissions to overall UK greenhouse gas emissions depends on how broadly transport-related emissions are defined. In particular, it varies according to how emissions from domestic and international aviation are treated, and whether, on the rail side, a share of the total emissions from power stations is included. The Government regularly publish estimates of the breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions between sectors. The most definitive source of this information is the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (available at www.naei.org.uk), which estimates that in 2002 (the most recent year for which data are available) some 20 per cent. of total UK greenhouse gas emissions came from the transport sector.

The RIA is available on: www.dti.gov.uk/er/equality/age.htm As far as the impact of an increase in the labour supply is concerned, &quot;Winning the Generation Game&quot; (Performance and Innovation Unit, April 2000, www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/innovation/2000/wirining/generation.pdf) on the impact of ageing on the economy put the cost of early and involuntary exit from the labour market at about &#163;16 billion each year.

<p>
<a name="40916w25.html_para1">
The research aims to collect information on the immediate destinations of around 20,000 income support, incapacity benefit or jobseeker allowance (JSA) unknown destination benefit leavers. Specifically, we are looking to obtain information on why the claimant has left benefit (for example, they have moved into work, training or education); details of hours worked and earnings (if the destinations is into work); current activity (at the time of interview); and demographic information not already held administratively by the Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w25.html_para2">
This is a repeat of the 2003 survey. A copy of the report (2003 Destination of Benefit Leavers in-house research report No. 132) is available in the Library.

<p>
<a name="40916w25.html_para3">
At present, comprehensive information on immediate destinations is collected for JSA recipients only. The information gathered via the destination survey is, therefore, an important and significant development to the Department&#039;s analytical evidence base and will

<p><a name="40916w25.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 It is normal for social security schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives, and we have no plans to change the rules which preclude people aged 65 or over from entitlement to disability living allowance unless they claimed and qualified for it before reaching that age. This is because the benefit is focussed on providing help with the disability-related extra costs of people who are severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life.

<p><a name="40916w27.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The TUC has published new research showing which groups of employees have been the most likely to lose membership of a pensions scheme. We welcome the research that the TUC has undertaken on membership of occupational pensions. This draws substantively on data produced by the Government and underscores the importance of the measures we are taking forward through our pension reforms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w27.html_para1">
The Pensions Bill will rebuild confidence in occupational pensions, it will strengthen the partnership between employers, individuals and the state in pension provision. The introduction of the Pension Protection Fund (supported by a Pensions regulator) will enhance protection for pension scheme members. The Bill also protects employees transferring from one employer to another with a minimum level of pension provision. In 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Sept 2004 : Column 1746W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
addition it will encourage individuals to build up pension savings by offering a cash transfer sum when leaving a pension scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w27.html_para2">
Through our informed choice agenda we will work with our pension partners to explore and test different approaches aimed at maximising membership of employer-provided schemes. One of these is automatic enrolment where new employees automatically become members of their employer&#039;s pension scheme unless an individual opts out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40916w27.html_para3">
The TUC research does not contain specific information relating to Wales. However, based on the data that is available, Wales does not appear to be significantly different to the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of trends in occupational pensions.

 Independent research commissioned by DWP which is soon to be published shows that there are very high levels of satisfaction among benefit and pensions customers who have transferred to direct payment and those who have started claiming and chose to receive direct payments.

The comparison shows that North Somerset&#039;s funding is always less than the England average. Each authority&#039;s SSA/FSS allocation depends on a number of factors including whether it has a large or small population, and whether it suffers from relatively high levels of need and deprivation. As a result an authority with a large population and much deprivation receives a far higher funding share than a smaller authority that has relatively low levels of need and deprivation.
