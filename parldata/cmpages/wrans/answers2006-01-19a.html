 On 4 March 2004 the Treasury Solicitor, acting for the Secretary of State for the Home Department in an appeal to the House of Lords in A and others <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for the Home Department, wrote to the Senior Law Lord drawing attention to a view expressed by a Law Lord in a published lecture in November 2001.

The Senior Law Lord replied on 25 March 2004 stating that he had been informed by the Law Lord

 This information is not held centrally. The Returning officer at a local election, has a duty to publish the results of that election, including the names of the candidate(s) elected, the number of votes each candidate received and the number of rejected ballot papers under each head shown in the statement of rejected ballot papers (Rule 44(1 )<i>(c)</i> of the Local Elections (Principle Areas) Rules 1983). There is no duty, however, to inform the Government of the result of a local election. The local authority in question should hold this information.
