<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para2"><a name="081125100000016">With regard to the implications of sea ice melt for the Greenland ice sheet, a MOHC study has examined the impacts of long-term deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet using a greenhouse gas concentration scenario where the Arctic becomes free of sea ice during the summer. This experiment incorporated a model of sea ice so that interactions between sea ice and Greenland land ice melt were included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_694"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para3"><a name="081125100000017">The results showed a maximum contribution from the melting Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise of 5 mm per year, which is within the uncertainty range already considered in projections of sea level rise around the UK coastline. However processes involving rapid movement of ice within the ice sheets are not included in this, or other current ice sheet models, as the dynamics are still poorly understood. Further work is needed to improve these models and thus estimates of sea level rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_695"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para4"><a name="081125100000018">The UK also monitors changes in the Greenland ice sheet directly. Observational measurements of the rate of change of its volume have been carried out by UK research groups over the last 15 years, using satellite radar remote sensing. Recently scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), part of the Natural Environment Research Council, have developed a new, more accurate technique for determining ice cap changes, using satellite laser technology. Significant research on the fundamental physics of glaciers and ice sheets is being carried out by BAS and other UK research groups, often in Antarctica.</p>

 There is currently significant spare capacity on High Speed 1. Much of this will be utilised when domestic high-speed services commence in December 2009.

 UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) forces on the ground are best placed to deal with the current situation: I fully support their efforts to do so, and commend them for the work they have done.

The Council issued conclusions which reiterated its support for MONUC in these difficult circumstances and asked that everything be done to allow it to fulfil its role completely.

The employee should feel able to involve the local staff association, and no staff association representative will be penalised in any way for becoming involved. If the employee is unsatisfied with the outcome of this process or of any appeal, then they may have recourse to the local courts (subject to the possible application of local Iraqi laws, including Coalition Provisional Authority Orders in this regard).</p>

Only national health service trusts reporting relevant income have been included in the table.  2. Some of these trusts provide services other than mental health care and the Department is unable to separate income for mental health care from other income, therefore some of the figures in the table may include income from private patients that are not mental health patients.  3. The data are from national health service trust audited summarisation schedules. Data on foundation trusts are not included as the Department does not collect information from foundation trusts. Where an NHS Trust gains foundation trust status during any financial year, the audited summarisation schedules report information only for the part of the year the organisation operated as an NHS trust.<br>

<i> [holding answer 24 November 2008]:</i> Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_851"><a name="81125w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08112618000087">The licensing system under the 1986 Act is demand-led and we have no control over the number of project licence applications we receive. The Act limits such animal use to where there is a clear benefit to people, animals or the environment when there is no means of obtaining these benefits without animal use, or at a lesser animal welfare cost. All scientists and researchers undertaking animal research in the UK are required to take into account the &#145;3Rs&#146; (measures to replace, reduce, and refine animal use) when devising their programmes of research proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_852"><a name="81125w0015.htm_para6"><a name="08112618000088">In 2004, the Government established the National Centre for the 3Rs to provide a focal point and resources for such activities. The NC3Rs drives advances in the 3Rs by taking a robust scientific approach, and bringing together expertise from a diverse range of areas, including academia, industry, Government and regulatory bodies.</p>

 I have been asked to reply. The following table shows the number of recommendations for deportation orders issued by judges in the Crown Court in England and Wales in each of the last three financial years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_888"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para13"><a name="08112618000551">Figures are broken down according to the county in which the relevant Crown Court centre is located. This may differ from the county of residence of the defendant and other key parties involved in the court case. Some counties do not have a Crown Court centre located within their boundaries; these are not shown in the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_889"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para14"><a name="08112618000552">During this period there were 28 occasions where a defendant was the subject of a recommendation for a deportation order having already been the subject of a previous such recommendation at some point since April 2000 (the earliest point at which data are available). There were six such occurrences in 2005-06, seven in 2006-07 and 15 in 2007-08. However, these data are not broken down to county level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_890"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para15"><a name="08112618000553">These figures only show judicial recommendations for deportation made during criminal proceedings in the Crown Court. More general immigration statistics can be found on the Home Office website;</p>

 The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available is shown in table 1. Data on the number of crimes detected with a DNA match are not collected on a monthly basis; and the figures are therefore presented by year. The figures provided are for the years 2002-03 to 2007-08, as the recorded crime figures before and after 2002-03 are not directly comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_893"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para2"><a name="08112618000748">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory; this data is not collected centrally. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_894"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para3"><a name="08112618000749">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate. It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2007-08, just over 854,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 per cent. of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2007-08, potential DNA material was collected at 102,400 crimes; and of these, 41,800 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 41,800 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 37,375 crimes (this represents 89 per cent. of crimes where DNA material was loaded to the NDNAD).</p>

 Information held on the national DNA database (NDNAD) is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. Thus figures for any particular police force include residents from outside the force area arrested and sampled by the police force, and exclude residents in the force area who were arrested and sampled by police forces elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_898"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para7"><a name="08112618000844">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_899"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para8"><a name="08112618000845">Ethnicity is recorded on the basis of the judgment of the police officer taking the sample as to which of six broad ethnic appearance categories the person belongs to. &#145;Unknown&#146; means that no ethnic appearance information was recorded by the officer taking the sample.</p>

We have also launched a &#163;3 million three-year publicity campaign designed by young people focusing on the risks and consequences of knife carrying.

There was no survey in 1997 and therefore figures are interpolated from within the overall time series, but this can be provided only for the social rented sector as a whole.

 I believe the hon. Member may be referring to section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which was repealed and replaced by section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This requires determinations under the planning Acts to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The effect of proposed development on a listed building, conservation area or other heritage asset could constitute a material consideration. The provision ensures that heritage assets are given due consideration when planning applications are being determined.</p>

 Formula Grant is made up from Revenue Support Grant, redistributed Business Rates and principal formula Police Grant and distributed to local authorities in England. The distribution of Formula Grant takes into account the relative need to provide services in an area and the relative ability of an area to raise council tax locally, relative to all other authorities providing the same service.

Except for highways maintenance and capital finance, the resident population (measured by the Office for National Statistics&#146;s sub-national population projections) are the main driver of the formula.

 Based on the value of successful bids for Gypsy and Traveller Site Grant, the average cost of providing a pitch on a new local authority site was &#163;57,154 in 2005-06, &#163;93,692 in 2006-07, and &#163;81,615 in 2007-08. This cost will be affected by the location of the site&#151;often sites are on brownfield land which requires remediation, or are some distance from essential utilities&#151;and whether land needs to be purchased. The cost of a new site will also vary according to the number of pitches it provides.</p>
