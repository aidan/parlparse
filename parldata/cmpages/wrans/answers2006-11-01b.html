learners of all ages, the Government published its National Languages
Strategy: &#145;Languages for All: Languages for Life&#151;a
strategy for England&#146; in December 2002. To oversee the
implementation of the strategy, the Secretary of State for Education

schools the funding will provide continuing support for initial and
existing teacher training as well as training for support staff. To
date we have trained over 2,000 new primary teachers with a specialism
in languages. Last October we published, in hard copy and online, our
Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages, which sets out learning objectives
for the four years of Key Stage 2. It is supported by a national
training programme, guidance and a planning
tool.</p><p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="61101w0007.htm_para4"><a name="0611021001215">The funding will
also support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11 to
18-year-olds, including alternative qualifications and vocational
options at Key Stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils
in their studies. We are also funding a range of projects and materials
to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which
will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support.
For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to
produce &#145;Languages Work&#146;, a suite of materials designed
to promote the value of language learning, support take up of languages
beyond Key Stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future
employability.</p><p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="61101w0007.htm_para5"><a name="0611021001216">Our Key

expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance
table scores to include more language qualifications. Most
significantly, in September 2005 the new national, voluntary languages
recognition scheme, the Languages Ladder, became available nationally.
The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is currently
available in 21 languages. It differs from existing approaches to
assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language
for reading, writing, listening and speaking. To date over 800
centres&#151;including local authorities and specialist language
colleges&#151;have registered to take part in the scheme, with over
10,000 learners entered for qualifications across all sectors taking

review will examine the scope for action in the following areas: with
secondary schools to support them in making available a wider range of
more flexible language courses, so that more young people continue
language learning even if they are not doing a full GCSE course;
further strengthening the incentives for schools and young people to
continue language learning post-14; with Further Education and Higher
Education institutions, to examine what more can be done to widen
access to and increase interest in language learning among the student
population; with employer organisations, to consider what more they can
do to promote the value of language skills for business and to give
stronger market signals to young people about language skills and
employability; and finally, what broader communication effort is needed

Bradshaw:</b> Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control
(IPPC) is a development from the system of Integrated Pollution Control
which was established under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 with
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution set up as the regulator. That
body became part of the Environment Agency (EA) on its formation in
1996. The EA has continued to maintain and develop the high level of
expertise necessary to regulate the wide variety of often complex
industrial activities covered by the Act and the wider variety covered
since 2000 by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations. Indeed,
the level of expertise needed has increased as a result of the
requirements of IPPC, which themselves have become fully apparent only
in the light of implementation since
2000.</p><p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="61101w0011.htm_para3"><a name="0611021001651">Even if a
comparable breadth of expertise could be found at an attractive cost as
a result of a tendering process, the EA would itself still be left
inevitably with a range of inspection-related tasks,
including:</p><a name="61101w0011.htm_brev0"><a name="0611021003855"><ul><p class="tabletext">(i) managing the

issues are
present.</p><p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="61101w0011.htm_para5"><a name="0611021001653">However, the
EA is already using private companies to assist with the assessment of
applications for IPPC permits. Contractors are used by the EA to
undertake monitoring of industrial releases. This work is undertaken to
tight standards and specifications set by the
EA.</p><p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="61101w0011.htm_para6"><a name="0611021001654">The EA is
continuing to develop its risk-based approach to inspection and the
assessment of compliance with permit conditions. Commitment by an
operator to the verification of its environmental performance by an
independent third party verifier is taken into account by the EA's
officers and can result in a reduced level of inspection and
charges.</p><br>

Friend the Prime Minister informed the House in a written ministerial

at the 20 October informal meeting in Lahti of heads of state or
Government and President Putin, there was a constructive discussion of
the EU&#146;s external energy relations, in particular our
relationship with Russia. There was unity among EU partners on the need
to build a close and legally binding partnership based on mutual,
long-term benefits based on the principles of the energy charter treaty
and the declaration agreed at the G8 summit in St. Petersburg in July
this year. These principles include market-based rules, market opening,
and transparency and reliability across the whole of the energy
relationship. The EU will shortly start negotiations with Russia on a
new comprehensive agreement to replace the 10-year-old partnership and
co-operation agreement. The EU agreed that these principles should form
the core of any new agreement. The Government stand by and will apply
these principles firmly, and are counting on Russia, as a key energy
supplier to downstream markets, to do the same. The Government see the
energy relationship with Russia, and the way in which this relationship
is likely to develop, including its EU dimension, firmly within the
context of this principle-based relationship. For his part, President
Putin stated his conviction at Lahti that energy co-operation should be
based on principles of predictability of the energy markets and the
mutual dependence of suppliers and
consumers.</p>

<i> Note:</i>  The NHS Cancer Plan sets out new goals to reduce
waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. The ultimate goal is that no
one should wait longer that one month from an urgent referral for
suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good
clinical reason or through patient choice, it is hoped to achieve this
by 2008. For some uncommon cancers like acute leukaemia,
children&#146;s and testicular cancer, this is what most patients
already experience. For those patients that are routinely referred but
subsequently diagnosed with cancer there will be a maximum one month
wait from diagnosis to treatment by the end of 2005. There will also be
a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all
cancers by 2005. There is a series of staged milestones towards this
goal: Maximum one month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment
guaranteed for children&#146;s and testicular cancers and acute
leukaemia by 2001. Maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment
for breast cancer by 2001. Maximum two month wait from urgent GP
referral to treatment for breast cancer by 2002. Maximum one month wait
from diagnosis to treatment for all cancers from 2005. Maximum two
month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers from
2005.  <i> Source:</i>  CWT-Db, Department of

Finished admission episodes A finished admission episode is the first
period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare
provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of
in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the
year. Specialty Care is needed when analysing hospital episode
statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties, such
as acute. Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and
attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses,
operations or other recorded information. Ungrossed data Figures have
not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.
Data quality HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and
primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and
social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage
submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise
inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES
processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some
shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i><i> </i>HES, The

between 2002 and 2005, as drug treatment services are generally
designed to meet the needs of a range of substance misusers, rather
than for specialised cannabis

percentage change in the number of people entering drug treatment
between 2003-04 and 2005-06 where cannabis has been identified as the
primary substance of misuse is an increase of 117 per cent. The
percentage increase relates to numbers accessing treatment and not
increases in the numbers using the drug. These figures in fact suggest
that the Government&#146;s substantial investment in drug treatment
is paying dividends, with quicker access to more effective treatment
for drug misusers.</p><a name="subhd_178"><a name="61101w0018.htm_sbhd6"><a name="0611021000192"><h3 align="center">Identity

Afghanistan after more than two decades of conflict, makes raising
domestic revenues one of the highest priorities of the Government of
Afghanistan. DFID supports the Government&#146;s revenue raising

sizable contribution over time. Other, more significant reforms that
are making immediate contributions to meet this challenge include the
establishment of a large taxpayers office, improvements in income tax

Legislative Council elections in January this year, the Quartet (US,

contribute up to &#163;12 million to the TIM, of which &#163;9
million has so far been committed to specific programmes. The European

97,000 Palestinians have received needs-based allowances. These
allowances have supported health care workers, teachers and the most
vulnerable citizens in Palestinian society. Over 2.4 million litres of
fuel have been provided for emergency generators at water pumping
stations, waste water facilities, hospitals and health centres in Gaza.
This has enabled essential services to continue after damage to
Gaza&#146;s only power station in an Israeli air strike. DFID funding
is contributing to allowances for poor Palestinians, health supplies,
and to repair, maintenance and running costs for electricity, water and
sanitation
services.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0611021000015"><a name="dpthd_13"><a name="61101w0023.htm_dpthd0">Northern
