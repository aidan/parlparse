The following table shows the UK European parliamentary electoral regions, the number of MEPs to be elected for each region in June, and the local government electorates as at December 2003. The&nbsp;administrative unit for counting the votes in the European parliamentary elections in June is the local authority area. Electorate figures for these are available from the recent Office for National Statistics table &quot;UK Electoral register 1&nbsp;December 2003: Local government electors&quot;, which can be accessed on the ONS website at www.statistics.gov.uk.

<p><a name="40419w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement on the process by which High Court judges are <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;selected and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;appointed.  [165612]</p>








<p><a name="40419w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor recommends to Her Majesty those candidates who best meet the published criteria for appointment to the High Court Bench.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w01.html_para1">
Recommendations are based on the results of the recent selection round. Advertisements in the national and legal press in July 2003 invited applications for appointment to the High Court. In addition, the senior judiciary were invited to nominate candidates. A wide consultation exercise sought evidence from senior judges and others to the extent to which all candidates met the criteria. This evidence was assessed by independent sifters and moderated by senior civil servants who then submitted advice to the Lord Chancellor and senior judiciary on the degree to which candidates met the criteria for appointment. After discussing that advice with the senior judiciary, the Lord Chancellor decided on a list of candidates considered to be appointable to the High Court.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 3W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w01.html_para2">
Individual recommendations about appointment to the High Court are made by the Lord Chancellor, after consulting the senior judiciary, from those classified as appointable and having regard to the specific needs of the High Court at the relevant time.


</p>







<p><a name="40419w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement on the Department&#039;s proposals for the selection and appointment of High Court judges.  [165615]</p>









<p><a name="40419w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Constitutional Reform Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish a Judicial Appointments Commission. The Commission will be responsible for selecting candidates for appointment as High Court judges, as well as other judicial appointments. The manner in which the Commission does so will be for it to determine, subject to the overriding criterion that selection must be on merit, and subject to any guidance which the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs may issue, for example, in requiring the Commission to seek to expand the pool of candidates from which a selection may be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w01.html_para3">
Having made its selection, the Commission will put forward one name for each post to the Secretary of State. He will normally be expected to recommend that candidate for appointment to the Queen, but he will have limited powers to ask the Commission to reconsider, once, or to reject a particular candidate, once, or to require the selection process to be rerun. The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs will have no power to recommend to Her Majesty the appointment of a candidate of his own, who has not been selected by the Commission.

This answer failed to take into account payments made under Very High Cost Case Contracts administered separately by the Legal Services Commission. The highest total payments were in fact made to John Rees who received in the region of &#163;664,000. I apologise for this error.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w01.html_para4">
Care should be taken not to misinterpret these payments as an indication of annual earnings for work carried out in the year for the following reasons:

<ul>

<p><a name="40419w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Government decided not to proceed with its proposals for reforming the House of Lords this Session, in view of the determined opposition to the proposals in the House of Lords, and the consequent threat to the legislative programme. Instead, the Government is seeking further discussion of the ways in which the role, powers, procedures and composition of the Lords should be reformed.

<p><a name="40419w02.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs whom the Government consulted about the proposed establishment of a Supreme Court.  [165610]</p>








<p><a name="40419w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Government issued a consultation paper, &quot;Constitutional Reform: a Supreme Court for the United Kingdom&quot; on 11&nbsp;July 2003. The consultation period closed on 7&nbsp;November 2003 and 174 replies were received from a wide range of interested organisations and individuals. The responses can be viewed on the Department&#039;s website.

<p><a name="40419w02.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how much money has been spent on planning the Supreme Court.  [165611]</p>








<p><a name="40419w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The spend to date on planning the Supreme Court is approximately &#163;113,000. This consists of fees of &#163;19,000 on the search for potential sites for the Supreme Court. A further &#163;94,000 has been committed on the analysis and evaluation of the building options, completion of the Treasury &#039;Green Book&#039; style economic appraisals and, more recently, detailed work on feasibility and outline design.


</p>







<p><a name="40419w02.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the implications of the proposed Supreme Court are for the judicial appeals process.  [165616]</p>








<p><a name="40419w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The UK Supreme Court will assume the current jurisdiction of the Appellate Committee of the&nbsp;House of Lords and the devolution jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Combining these jurisdictions in a new court will not affect the appeals process, but will offer improvement in the efficient management of work load through enhanced facilities and services within the court and greater flexibility for hearing cases.

a complaint remains unresolved, the case is referred to the BBC for review. These procedures are additional to any right to seek legal redress through the courts in respect of any alleged unlawful action.

I regret that information relating to the 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 schemes is not available. Nor is it possible to say how many have applied each year but were not eligible. Without establishing their circumstances it is not possible to say how many others would have been entitled to payments but did not apply.

Major customers for science and technology in the MOD outline their requirements, which align with MOD&#039;s priorities and high level needs, and a detailed research programme is designed to deliver these strategies. This approach is designed to draw together Government, industrial and university sectors in new partnerships, such as Defence Technology Centres, while at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time maximising the opportunities for wider commercial exploitation from MOD investments.

<p class "tabletext">Owing to the small NES samples sizes for Newport and Bristol, estimates of the average earnings of central government employees cannot be provided for these areas.

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

<p><a name="40419w10.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 There are currently 60 citizenship Advanced Skills Teachers. Eight of these are based in the North West Government Office Region, though none specifically in St. Helens, South. Around 400 individuals have completed initial teacher training for citizenship education since 2002 and this will rise to around 600 at the end of the 2003/04 academic year. The Department does not hold records on appointments of Newly Qualified Teachers.

<a name="40419w10.html_para3">
&#163;15&nbsp;million was made available to schools to support citizenship and personal, social and health education in 2001&#150;02. Since 2002&#150;03 schools have decided how much to spend from their total budgets to support citizenship. Schools are able to spend this in the way that best met&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their needs, including spending on teachers&#039; professional development. Since the financial year 2000&#150;01 the Department has spent &#163;3&nbsp;million to support the development of a range of resources and activities for citizenship education, many of which have been made available to schools free of charge.

 Local authorities with social service responsibilities have a statutory general duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who are in need by providing a range of services appropriate to meeting those needs.

 During the first four years of their courses medical students have the same student support as any other eligible higher education students; and pay the same contributions to fees. The Government have made a number of proposals to safeguard access to higher education for those from low income families. Around three in ten students will receive means tested maintenance grants of &#163;2,700, and over half will be eligible for full or partial grants, as well as bursaries and other support from universities under arrangements agreed by the Office of Fair Access.

Fees for English domiciled medical students in years 5 and 6 are currently paid by the Department of Health. These students also qualify for means tested NHS bursaries in their fifth and subsequent years of study. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that they will, if necessary, take measures to ensure that any increase in the level of tuition fees will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w13.html_para1">
Under our proposals, arrangements for repayment of non means tested fee loans will, for all graduates, be heavily subsidised: graduates will repay their loans at zero real rate of interest and only when their income exceeds &#163;15,000 per year. Repayments will then be made at a rate of 9&nbsp;per cent. of income above &#163;15,000. According to Graduate Prospects, GPs can expect to earn in excess of &#163;46,000 a year at the start of their careers.

 The National Literacy Strategy puts phonics&#151;both analytic and synthetic&#151;at the heart of literacy teaching in Key Stages 1 and 2. It advocates a strong emphasis on word level work (particularly phonics) and guided reading in the early years, with a gradual shift to place more emphasis on sentence level work (particularly composition in writing) in Key Stage 2.

<p><a name="40419w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 From a position where many schools were teaching very little phonics, the National Literacy Strategy has transformed literacy teaching in primary schools. Its approach is soundly based on international research and best practice. The teaching of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phonics has contributed to primary schools&#039; achievement in maintaining world class standards, with tens of thousands more seven and 11-year-olds now achieving the expected level in reading for their age.

[165333]</p>








<p><a name="40419w14.html_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The Active Citizens in Schools (ACiS) pilot aims to build on aspects of the Millennium Volunteers (MV) programme and encourage 11 to 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year olds in schools to make a commitment to volunteering in line with the citizenship curriculum, encourage them to become Millennium Volunteers when they reach the age of 16 and help to engage them in the wider democratic process. Over 4,000 young people have been involved in ACiS. The interim evaluation suggests that ACiS has to date been encouragingly successful, particularly in terms of the number of young people involved and the diversity of opportunities that have been developed. The DfES is planning to roll out the initiative through the extended schools programme from 2004.

<p><a name="40419w14.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 My Department has supported many projects in these areas since June 1997. In respect of schools and further education, the following programmes have been instigated:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Music Standards Fund was established in 1999 to protect and expand LEA music services. Approximately &#163;270&nbsp;million will have been invested by the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">13 &quot;Wider Opportunities&quot; pilots in music have been undertaken; in March 2004 I announced &#163;1.5&nbsp;million investment to help LEAs develop their own pilots.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Music and Dance (Aided pupil) Scheme began in 1981. The Department has spent a total of &#163;79.914&nbsp;million on the Scheme from 1997&#150;98 to 2003&#150;04. A new complementary national grants scheme for exceptionally talented children will be piloted from September 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">181 of the 259 designated specialist arts colleges since June 1997 have a performing arts (music, dance and drama) or music focus. Specialist schools receive a one-off capital grant of &#163;100,000 and additional recurrent funding of &#163;126 per pupil per year for each of the four years covered by their specialist school development plans.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Dance and Drama Awards, for post-16 students, have cost &#163;55&nbsp;million since they were announced in 1998, with a further &#163;15&nbsp;million allocated for 2004&#150;05.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Dance is one of six areas of activity within the National Curriculum programme of study for physical education. Between April 2003 and September 2006, we are investing over &#163;459&nbsp;million to transform PE and school sport.</p>

<p><a name="40419w14.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 According to OFSTED most pupil referral units (PRUs) are well run. Where this is the case they offer a curriculum that has both breadth and depth which is delivered innovatively, they make a very positive contribution to their pupils&#039; outcomes, including improving their behaviour and attendance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many hours of education per week a child attending a pupil referral unit is required to receive; and what the average number of hours per week received is.  [165474]</p>








<p><a name="40419w14.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 A child attending a pupil referral unit (PRU) because he or she has been permanently excluded from school should receive a suitable full time education appropriate to their age and Key Stage. So too, where possible, should pupils subject to fixed term exclusions of 15 days or more. DfEE Circular 11/99 suggests that 20 hours or more constitute appropriate full time education. All local education authorities confirmed that all permanently excluded pupils were in receipt of suitable full time education in September 2002.

<p>
<a name="40419w14.html_para1">
The average hours received could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. PRUs also provide a valuable service, with other institutions, for young people. However, the time that pupils spend at the PRU each day will vary according to their needs. Such pupils might include dual registered pupils (i.e. remaining on their school roll and attending the PRU for specific educational modules e.g. additional basic skills tuition or anger management), sick children, respite for children who have been bullied, and teenage mothers.

The UK&#039;s implementation of the IPSPS Code does not require ports to monitor chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) traffic. However the Home Office and Customs are taking forward a programme to install radiation detection equipment at points of entry into the UK (including airports, seaports and the Channel Tunnel). Under this initiative Customs Officers, who are responsible for detecting and deterring illicit import and export of radioactive materials, have received specialist training in operating the equipment and the incident response procedures.

As required by the ISPS code each port will detail how it is going to achieve access control to its restricted areas, and this may include subjecting vehicles (including lorries), persons and their possessions to checks and searches. In addition ports will be required to formalise pass systems to help prevent unauthorised access to these operational areas of the port. Access control and how to maintain pass systems are covered in the PFSO training courses and security instructi9ons that have been issued to industry.

 The UK Government have ratified the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) which deals among other issues with traditional knowledge and prior informed consent.

 Restrictions on freedom of movement have made it more difficult for Palestinians to take advantage of the European Communities/Palestinian Liberation Organisation interim Agreement. This has contributed to a deep economic crisis. According to the World Bank, 60&nbsp;per cent. of Palestinians live on less than the UN poverty threshold of US$2.10 a day. The Government and EU partners regularly call on both sides to implement their roadmap obligations, including the easing of restrictions on the movement of persons and goods.

<p><a name="40419w27.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There are a number of reasons to explain why some people whose asylum applications were unsuccessful in 2003 have not yet been removed. The removal of a person is complex and several factors have to be taken into account before we are able to effect removal. These factors include assessing the various factors relating to an individual&#039;s removal and overcoming various barriers to removal, such as documentation issues and a lack of co-operation from receiving countries.

Every effort is made to remove people as quickly as possible after refusal or the exhaustion of appeal rights. And we are taking action to overcome these obstacles. We have negotiated four new returns agreements in the last seven months, and are progressively extending biometrics in visas for countries where we know there is a problem. In the Asylum and Immigration Bill We are proposing penalties of up to two years for those who destroy their documents or won&#039;t cooperate with redocumentation, simplifying the appeals process to stop people lodging multiple appeals to frustrate removal, and encouraging voluntary removal by ending benefits for those whose claims have failed.

The CRB will then liaise with the police to ensure the correct details are recorded.

<p><a name="40419w29.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The United Kingdom Immigration Service is working in close co-operation with both Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise and Humberside Police to combat illegal immigration through Immingham docks.

Such operations are undertaken by a team of four or five immigration officers from the MFST who are specialists in freight search techniques and who are assisted by one or more Humberside officers who have local intelligence and operational knowledge. MFST and Humberside immigration staff continue to work closely with Immingham carriers to improve checking systems in Belgium and Holland and so reduce the risk of the port being targeted by potential illegal immigrants. The programme to install freight screening and detection equipment overseas provides for deployment at feeder ports serving UK Channel and North Sea ports including Immingham.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what response he has made to the recommendation in the Internal Review Report 2003 that the prison working day should be increased.  [164398]</p>








<p><a name="40419w32.html_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The internal review of the strategic oversight and management of the public sector prison industries in England and Wales (2003) was fully accepted by the Prison Service Management Board. While none of the review&#039;s 44 recommendations contained a specific recommendation that the prison working day should be increased the text did note that ideally industrial workshops should operate standard working hours of around 36 hours per week. The review also noted that operational demands and restrictions precluded this from being achieved across the prison estate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para8">
There are currently over 300 industry workshops which operate for an average 26 hours per week. This contributes nearly 13,000,000 hours of purposeful activity for prisoners a year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para9">
The Prison Service is committed, wherever possible, to extending the working day for prisoners. For example a plastics workshop at HMP Ranby operates for 96 hours per week, employing prisoners on three shifts (including a night shift). The Prison Service has to strike a balance between allowing more prisoners to access places and enabling individual prisoners to work a longer day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para10">
The Prison Service are exploring the possibility of developing Service Level Agreements with prisons that will stipulate the number of operating hours a workshop will open, the number of prisoners employed and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualifications offered alongside a target for achievement. This will help both to establish a minimum period each workshop should open and improve performance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what response he has made to the recommendation in the Internal Review Report 2003 that prison work should reflect the working week outside prison.  [164399]</p>








<p><a name="40419w32.html_spnew11"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Prison Service Management Board fully accepted the recommendations contained in the internal review of the strategic oversight and management of the public sector prison industries in England and Wales (2003). While none of the reviews 44 recommendations contained a specific recommendation that prison work should try and reflect the same kind of working week as outside the review did note that wherever possible the prison regime should try and reflect the same kind of working week as that found outside.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para11">
There are several aspects to reflecting the working week on the outside including not only extending the working day where possible but also setting and maintaining reasonable production levels. In addition it is important to have part-time working to accommodate prisoner learning. In addition there are other models for bridging the gap between prisons and the community&#151;the work with National Grid Transco is a good example of using the time prisoners spend in prison essentially for training followed by actual work in the community.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 112W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para12">
It is not practical, as the review acknowledged, to fix a figure on the number of hours a workshop should be open&#151;as different categories of establishment have different operational demands. However the Prison Service is committed, wherever possible and subject to operational constraints, to extending the working day for prisoners. There are examples in the Prison Service where this has been achieved. As part of implementing the review&#039;s recommendations the Prison Service is also seeking to improve production levels where needed as well as encouraging more demanding and creative work where it is possible to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w32.html_para13">
Linking work and education for the large number of unskilled prisoners with numeracy and literacy difficulties as well as with poor or non-existent work histories is a key part of enhancing the working week. In many instances key skills have been embedded into practical training courses in prisons&#039; workshops. Using &#163;7.36&nbsp;million of the Offenders Learning and Skills Unit&#039;s recent Capital Modernisation Fund, from Learning to Earning, 77 classrooms adjacent to workshops have been constructed to support the integration of key skills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into training programmes. Additionally these classrooms are increasingly able to support the wider key skills&#151;Working with Others, Problem Solving, Improving Own Learning and Performance. All three wider key skills relate to the work ethic. The value placed on these skills by employers is evident from their inclusion in Modern Apprenticeship frameworks in mainstream vocational training.

At the same time the Prison Service is a significant consumer of a large range of products and there are sound economic reasons for producing for internal consumption.

We are, however, developing a range of policies in this area:In June last year we published the consultation paper, &quot;Safety and Justice&quot;, which set out the Government&#039;s strategy to tackle domestic violence in England and Wales. It set out proposals under three key headings: prevention; protection; and justice and support. And it included proposals for non-legislative as well as legislative measures, which now form part of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, which was introduced into the House of Lords in December last year.

SARCs will be considered as part of a wider strategy to improve services for victims of sexual offences. The Government are also considering options for the development of a national rape helpline.

 The significant increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disruption to their families, particularly their children, supports the need to respond specifically to the needs and characteristics of women offenders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w34.html_para11">
The Women&#039;s Offending Reduction Programme (The Programme), published on 11&nbsp;March 2004, is a three-year programme of work that aims to promote a more specific and joined up response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w34.html_para12">
In order to reduce the number of women in custody and increase the potential for diversion the Programme will focus on improving sentencers&#039; confidence in community disposals that offer appropriate packages and interventions and are better tailored to meet the particular needs of women offenders. The Programme includes, for example, the development of women specific community-based interventions such as the &#039;Real Women&#039; offending behaviour programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w34.html_para13">
Two key target groups are women with mental health problems and women with substance misuse problems. The Programme will operate in tandem with the Department of Health&#039;s Women&#039;s Mental Health Strategy and the National Drugs Strategy so that women offenders can access appropriate treatment in the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w34.html_para14">
For women who do need to be held in custody, resettlement is a vital element of the Programme. More effective re-integration into the community for women prisoners on release should have a positive impact on re-offending rates. The implementation of the Women&#039;s Estate resettlement strategy will ensure that good family ties are maintained to minimise the impact on children separated from their mothers, and necessary local community links are made to meet the range of women&#039;s resettlement needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w34.html_para15">
The Programme&#039;s priorities contribute to the wider Home Office aims of reducing offending and re-offending and will also reflect and support the objectives of the new National Offender Management Service that will come into operation in June 2004.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 131W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40419w37.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 TB incidents in Scotland occur sporadically and tend to be geographically scattered across the country. They are generally associated with the introduction of infected cattle from Ireland or parts of England and Wales where TB is endemic. In contrast, most TB incidents in England occur in a number of traditional &quot;TB hotspots&quot; or endemic areas, thus showing a high degree of geographical clustering. Reactor numbers per incident and the proportion of confirmed incidents in Scotland are lower than in the endemic TB areas of England. This tends to make TB incidents in Scotland quicker to resolve by testing and removal of infected animals. Recurrent and chronic TB incidents are much more common in the endemically affected areas of England.

<p><a name="40419w37.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The 20&nbsp;per cent. figure is the average annual increase in the number of TB reactors slaughtered for the period 1990 to 2001. The average number of herd breakdowns over the same period is 18&nbsp;per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w37.html_para3">
In countries where there is no significant wildlife reservoir, cattle controls based on regular tuberculin testing, culling, movement restrictions (including tracing and contiguous testing) and slaughterhouse checks have been effective in controlling the disease. In many European Union countries, TB incidents in cattle herds are at a very low level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w37.html_para4">
In some parts of Great Britain, however, current cattle control measures are not proving effective in controlling the disease. It is not possible at present to quantify those elements of local disease spread that are due to wildlife as opposed to cattle spread, or to other factors.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 143W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40419w40.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK is currently negotiating with other European Union Member States a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases. This Regulation is a key part of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme. It will put in place a legislative framework to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which are powerful greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w40.html_para6">
The Regulation will introduce specific measures related to the containment, use and recovery of fluorinated gases, together with a general obligation to take all abatement measures that are technically feasible and cost-effective. In addition the Regulation will provide for restrictions on the placing on the market of some products and equipment that contain fluorinated gases, and a reporting regime for producers, importers and exporters.


</p>







<p><a name="40419w40.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons in each year since 1995 from mobile and vehicle air conditioning; and what the forecasts are for future years.  [165452]</p>








<p><a name="40419w40.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A 2003 report commissioned by Defra indicated that emissions of hydrocarbons (MFC 134a) rose steadily from 1995&#150;2000, from approximately 140&nbsp;tonnes in 1995 to approximately 600 tonnes in 2000. This rise was due to the rapid growth of MFC-based mobile air conditioning (MAC) systems in new passenger vehicles from 10&nbsp;per cent. in 1990 to 50&nbsp;per cent. in 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w40.html_para7">
The report forecast that MFC based MAC systems would be fitted to approximately 75&nbsp;per cent. of new cars by 2010, and associated emissions would continue to rise to a peak of approximately 1,270 tonnes of MFC 134a in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w40.html_para8">
The proposed new EC Regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases includes provisions which would lead to a phase out from 2009 of air conditioning systems with fluorinated gases with a global warming potential higher than 150.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w40.html_para9">
The Government have made it clear that they welcome the overall aim of the draft Regulation to reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gases that it covers and the environmental benefits that will be delivered. These reductions in emissions will form part of the wider efforts being taken to combat climate change.

 The UK&#039;s target under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5&nbsp;per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12. (The base year is 1990 for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and 1995 for fluorinated compounds.)

UK emissions in 2002, the most recent year for which final data are available, were 15.3&nbsp;per cent. below the base year level. Provisional estimates made by my Department suggest that in 2003 UK emissions were between 14 and 15&nbsp;per cent. below those in the base year. The increase on the previous year was linked to greater consumption of coal relative to natural gas for electricity generation. We believe on the basis of projections, including the effects of policies under the UK Climate Change programme, that the downward trend in emissions will be resumed, and that the Kyoto target will be met.

 For a waste to be classified as &quot;hazardous&quot;, it must normally be listed as such in the European Waste Catalogue. Nappies are not listed as hazardous. It is open to member states to determine that other wastes are hazardous where these display one or more of the hazardous properties specified in the Hazardous Waste Directive at above the thresholds the directive specifies. Waste such as nappies would be considered under property H9 (infectious). However, to be considered hazardous there would need to be a high risk that infectious substances were present in the waste at a concentration above that naturally encountered. Since the source population for household waste is healthy, the risk of infection is very low and nappies do not therefore meet the criteria necessary for a &quot;hazardous&quot; classification.

 The Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF) met in Jeju, Republic of Korea, to discuss the action needed to factor environmental considerations more fully into the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Commitments on water, sanitation and human settlements. I represented the UK. Together with Lesotho&#039;s Minister of Natural Resources, Mr.Monyane Moleleki, I co-chaired an interactive session on how integrated water resource management (IWRM) plans can make a key contribution to the sustainable provision of water and sanitation.

<p>
<a name="40419w44.html_para0">
The output from this session and two following ones were summarised in the Jeju Initiative, adopted by the GMEF on 31&nbsp;March. This sets out what contribution Governments and UNEP, with other multilateral institutions, can make in these areas. The Initiative will be reported to the Twelfth Meeting of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development.

<p><a name="40419w45.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Since the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set water companies annual leakage targets. This has helped to achieve a significant reduction in leakage, from 4,505 Megalitres per day in 1996&#150;97 to 3,623 Megalitres per day in 2002&#150;03. Most companies are now at their economic level of leakage which is the level at which it would cost more to further reduce leakage than to supply additional water from other sources. The Director General of Water Services publishes leakage data annually in the &#039;Security of Supply, Leakage and the Efficient Use of Water&#039; reports, copies of which are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available in the Library of the House. The Government&#039;s approach to demand management was confirmed by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State in March 2004 in her Principal Guidance to the Director-General of Water Services.

The programmes cover a wide range of chemical parameters plus routine biological monitoring for the purposes of both assessing compliance with standards and general assessments of environmental quality.

In general, there was little difference in the quality of core information (patient, reporter, suspect drug and reaction details) provided via electronic and paper yellow cards. A significant proportion (93&nbsp;per cent.) of electronic reporters intend to continue reporting via the Internet. The working group and the MHRA are currently assessing method&#039;s to promote and increase the awareness and usability of the electronic yellow card amongst health professionals.

<a name="40419w46.html_para13">
A new website providing rapid and direct access to the electronic yellow card is at www.yellowcard.gov.uk. This was launched on 19&nbsp;February 2004 and the working group MHRA are in the process of linking this with other health-related websites. The findings from the evaluation will be presented to CSM for consideration and to inform future enhancements to the electronic yellow card.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many people, broken down by age, suffered from adverse drug reactions, in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;England, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;each region and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;each strategic health authority in each year since 1997; and how many of those reactions were fatal;  [163498]

<p><a name="40419w46.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme. Approximately 20,000 reports of ADRs are reported to the MHRA/CSM through this scheme each year, of which approximately 3&nbsp;per cent. report a suspected ADR with a fatal outcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w46.html_para14">
There are five regional monitoring centres (RMCs) that act locally on behalf of the CSM to collect reports of ADRs and to stimulate ADR reporting through local initiatives. These are Mersey, Wales, Northern, West Midlands and Scotland, which was established in 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w46.html_para15">
The attached tables contain the total number of suspected ADR reports and ADR reports with a fatal outcome received via the yellow card scheme from 1997 to 2003 inclusive. The figures are broken down by age groups: 16 years and under, 17 to 59 years and 60 years and above. Included in the tables are the numbers of suspected ADR reports and reports with a fatal 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 168W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
outcome received from the five RMCs. A breakdown of ADR data by health authority is not available, as this information is not collected as part of the yellow card scheme. Data from the yellow card scheme cannot be used to measure the frequency of an ADR in a particular region or health authority, as spontaneous ADR reporting is associated with an unknown and variable degree of under-reporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w46.html_para16">
It is important to note that the submission of a suspected ADR report does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Additionally, the use of medicines may vary between different age groups. Use of medicines in the elderly, for example, is higher than in other age groups and elderly patients are more likely to be using combinations of medicines.

 Current requirements are those set out in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the National Health Service (Appointment of Consultants) Regulations 1996. To become a consultant in the NHS a doctor must be included on the specialist register held by the General Medical Council (GMC)

Procedures for the appointment of staff in independent sector treatment centres are a matter for the relevant independent healthcare providers.

</p>


<p>

The scheme is managed by NHS Professionals for Doctors but not centrally funded, allowing strategic health authorities to make local arrangements to place doctors on the scheme. Local reports suggest a further 60 doctors had been appointed on the scheme.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that it has developed a risk profile of the microbiological risks to public health from illegally imported meat.

<p>
<a name="40419w51.html_para3">
On the basis of the risk profile, the FSA does not believe there is currently the evidence to suggest the need for a formal risk assessment. However, the FSA will continue to monitor the available data and review the risk profile.

The United Kingdom public health bodies involved in the investigation of outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease have not traced any outbreaks of human disease in the UK to illegally imported meat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w51.html_para5">
The FSA&#039;s advice to UK consumers is that illegally imported meat should not be eaten because it will not have been subject to proper controls at the point of production and will have evaded export controls in the country of origin and import controls at the port of entry to the EU. These controls are designed to verify compliance with food safety standards, and such illegal imports cannot legally be sold in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w51.html_para6">
The FSA has advised local authorities, which are responsible for enforcement of imported food and food safety legislation, that all illegally imported food products, including meat, should be removed from the human food chain. The FSA is also working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and HM Customs and Excise to assist in the targeting of enforcement work to detect and seize illegal meat imports.

<sup>(70)</sup>&nbsp;The introduction of the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for coding case of death in 2001 means that data for 2001 onwards may not be completely comparable with data for years before this date. Analysis of data for tuberculosis suggests that figures for ICD-9 and ICD-10 are broadly comparable, but detailed analyses of other notifiable diseases has not been undertaken. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution.<br>

Notes:<br>

Members of the Medicines Act advisory committees such as the CSM and its working groups are required to follow a code of practice relating to declarations of interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The code is rigorously followed at each meeting to ensure the integrity of the advice given to the Licensing Authority by those committees. None of the members of the CSM&#039;s expert working group have a personal interest in GlaxoSmithKline or any of the other companies which hold marketing authorisations for SSRIs.

To date the expert group has met nine times and has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completed the most comprehensive review yet undertaken of the safety of SSRIs in paediatric use. An interim report, which provides information on the key evidence considered by the group up to July 2003 and the action that has been taken as a result of the group&#039;s advice, was published on the MHRA/CSM website in September 2003. The expert group is now focused on completing its task of reviewing all the data related to the use of paroxetine and the related drugs in adults, specifically focusing on suicidal behaviour, withdrawal reactions and the dosage recommendations.

As part of the ongoing in-depth review, the expert group has recently re-evaluated the original dose finding studies carried out for the licensing of paroxetine. The expert group initially reviewed one of the dose finding studies for paroxetine in October 2003. On the advice of the expert group, the manufacturer was then asked to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide data to justify the current dosing recommendations for all indications as part of the European review of the risks and benefits of paroxetine. The expert group reviewed the completed data set at their meeting on 27&nbsp;February 2004.

 Patients with mental health difficulties benefit along with other patients from the reduction in delay in assessment and treatment the four-hour target requires. Concerns were expressed last year by clinicians about the minority of patients who clinically need more than four hours in accident and emergency (A&E). In response to this the final December 2004 target was adjusted at the end of 2003 to a minimum operating standard of 98&nbsp;per cent. This gives all trusts up to 2&nbsp;per cent. headroom to manage clinical exceptions and other patients still in A&E after four hours. The number of patients with mental health difficulties who clinically need more than four hours in A&E is very small.

The decrease in the number of national health service beds in some sectors reflects service improvements away from in-patient stays. We are aiming to deliver as many services as possible in the most low tech and local environment with more support in peoples&#039; homes and the community. More procedures are taking place in out-patients and community settings which used to require hospital admission. At the same time, more consultations and treatments are taking place outside hospitals in the community and being delivered by different groups of staff. General practitioners are starting to offer treatments and consultations, which were once only done by hospital consultants. Similarly, there is an increase in the range of work undertaken by nurses. Many of the changes in the way services are delivered have been supported by the Modernisation Agency and through collaboration and learning between different parts of the NHS. This redesign of services has allowed the NHS to treat more patients and offer more convenient services.

The NHS Plan did, however, recognise a need for more general and acute beds and set a target of 2,100 extra by 2004. The latest available statistics for 2002&#150;03 showed that general and acute beds increased by 1,600

To ensure that waiting time targets are met, patient choice increased and value for money improved, the NHS will be making much greater, but more structured use of the independent sector from next year.

 Information on the Department&#039;s task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews is given in the annual publication &quot;Public Bodies&quot;. This publication explains that such groups have a short-term focus and when their work comes to an end they are disbanded. These groups are usually created to give expert advice to the Government on a specific issue and are usually expected to remain in operation for less than two years. They are not separate statutory bodies. As such, they have no capacity to employ staff or hold assets in their own right, and rely on secretariat and other support from the Department and sometimes other interested bodies. They will not normally have any formal separate budget allocated to them, and accountability for expenditure will remain with the body to whom any funding is allocated.

<i>Department of Health</i>: The Department is committed to ensuring that all its purchases of timber and timber products meet the requirements of the United Kingdom Government timber procurement policy. Following publication of revised guidance to Departments on sustainable timber procurement in January 2004, the Department has revised its standard Invitation to Tender to ensure that all tenderers are aware of and comply with the policy.

<p><a name="40419w62.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 All independent sector providers that expressed an interest in response to advertisements in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities were asked to complete and return a pre-qualification questionnaire. Detailed analysis of the information in the questionnaire enabled the selection of a group of short-listed bidders based on their financial standing and ability to deliver high quality clinical services. This group was invited to submit bids for the contracts to manage and run the proposed new treatment centres. The subsequent selection of the preferred bidders followed careful evaluation of the submitted bids. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation criteria included clinical quality, infrastructure, information management and technology, human resources, legal, financial, speed of mobilisation and delivery, and value for money. There was a structured scoring mechanism against each of these criteria and total scores assessed between bidders.

<a name="40419w62.html_para4">
The national implementation team co-ordinated the evaluation of submitted bids. Bids were evaluated and ranked by specialist teams consisting of members of the national implementation team, their advisers and local national health service sponsors and experts.

 The possibility of urine based drug therapies providing a route for human-to-human transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other diseases has been considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and at a European level by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP). There is no evidence of human-to-human infection of CJD caused by urine based drug therapy and epidemiological evidence does not suggest a risk for urine-derived medicinal products from patients with sporadic CJD. However, as a precautionary measure, the CSM has advised that urine from a country with one or more cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) should not be used as a source of human urine to produce medicinal products for the United Kingdom.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of adverse drug reactions he estimates are reported; and if he will make a statement.  [163493]</p>








<p><a name="40419w67.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In the United Kingdom, the yellow card scheme allows health professionals to report suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 248W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
voluntary basis to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). There is a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w67.html_para1">
All voluntary reporting systems suffer from under-reporting. The proportion of suspected adverse drug reactions, which are reported, is very variable. Under reporting is thought to occur less frequently with newly identified, serious and unlabelled reactions (those reactions which are not yet included in the product information).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w67.html_para2">
Studies in UK hospitals (Smith et al 1996) and general practice settings (Martin et al 1998, Heeley et al 2001) have estimated that around five to ten per cent. of all suspected adverse drug reactions experienced by patients are reported to CSM and MHRA through the yellow card scheme. The study in general practice carried out by Heeley et al (2001) combined serious and non-serious ADRs in this estimate of under reporting of ADRs. This study also provided a breakdown of the estimates of under-reporting of reactions classified as serious or non-serious and labelled or unlabelled, and estimated that general practitioners report between 30 and 50&nbsp;per cent. of serious unlabelled adverse reactions to CSM and MHRA via the yellow card scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w67.html_para3">
Under-reporting does not necessarily detract from the ability of drug safety monitoring systems to identify new and important drug safety hazards. The MHRA and CSM are continually working to increase the quality and quantity of reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme in order to increase the potential for rapid identification of new drug safety hazards.

Phase two began in 1998 and involves more intensive studies in a smaller number of countries. The Department funded the United Kingdom contribution to phase two.

 Children are entitled to free dental treatment under the National Health Service, including free dental examinations every six months.

About a quarter of all adults are exempt from charges or pay reduced charges for NHS dental treatment. Under current arrangements, adults may have dental examinations at six monthly intervals if they wish.

<a name="40419w69.html_para6">
If annual dental examinations were made free to all adults in England, patient charge revenue would be reduced by around &#163;65&nbsp;million per annum. Under the present dental payment system for general dental services, the total cost would be increased if the change stimulated demand for more dental examinations and these also led to some additional NHS dental treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w69.html_para7">
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recently produced draft guidance for consultation, which proposes that the interval between dental examinations for patients should be tailored to meet their needs on the basis of an assessment of disease levels and risk of dental disease. If accepted, we would expect the new contractual arrangements for dentists which are currently under discussion with the profession to reflect this approach which is aimed towards care tailored to the clinical needs of patients. Under the new contract proposals, the link between treatments and payments will be abolished. Instead, dentists will be paid a guaranteed annual income for an agreed level of NHS commitment and will be free to decide treatments for their patients on the basis of clinical need, including the frequency of dental examinations.

<p><a name="40419w71.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Since the introduction of national health service-funded nursing care in October 2001, residents in care homes providing nursing care should not have to pay for the continence supplies they need. The NHS will ensure that the care home either receives continence products free of charge, or will make a payment to the care home for continence provision. Guidance issued to primary care trusts in September 2001 and March 2003 was consulted upon with a wide range of stakeholders, including care homes providing nursing care. The guidance stresses the importance of the NHS consulting local providers about continence provision to ensure that, as far as possible, the arrangements meet their needs concerning delivery and storage.

<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 It is the responsibility of UK Transplant, a special health authority based in Bristol, to match and allocate organs from deceased donors to suitable patients on the national transplant list, whether national health service or private, according to allocation rules agreed by national organ advisory committees.

<p>
<a name="40419w73.html_para0">
It is the responsibility of local transplant centres or clinicians working in private practice to assess the suitability of a potential live organ donor and obtain approval from the Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority if required.

<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The rules for allocating organs are publicly available on the UK Transplant website at www.uktransplant.co.uk. They are regularly reviewed by the medical profession in consultation with other health professionals, the Department and advisory groups. The system of allocation differs according to the type of organ; whether it is a heart, lung, kidney, liver or cornea, but there are some overall guiding principles which ensure as far as possible proper matching of organs to patients and equality of access to the organ available. All eligible patients, whether national health service or private, have to be registered on the relevant national transplant list and will be allocated a suitable organ when one becomes available.

<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Healthcare professionals are responsible for assessing and prescribing oxygen therapy for patients, including those suffering from cluster headaches. The new contract, being developed to support introduction of a modernised, integrated, oxygen service during 2005, will require service contractors to supply oxygen in a way that best meets the needs of the patient, as set out in the patient&#039;s prescription.

<a name="40419w73.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Pain Management</h3>





<p><a name="40419w73.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Sheerman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how his Department guarantees that the quality 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 267W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

[165349]</p>








<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The process for commissioning health services involves the establishment of service level agreements between primary care trust commissioners and providers for various specialties. These set the framework for the monitoring of all services, including pain. Strategic health authorities would not normally become involved in this process except in cases of serious difficulty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w73.html_para1">
The commissioning process ensures that quality services are provided and it is for providers to ensure that they take account of developments in pain services, such as the recommendations in the Clinical Standards Advisory Group report on pain or the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Pain Society booklet, &quot;Pain Management Services&#151;Good Practice&quot;.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 268W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
he estimates can be gained from the expansion of shared service centres for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;financial services and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;human resources.  [164899]</p>








<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 It is not possible to estimate precisely the level of savings from expanding either financial services or human resources (HR) as these depend on a number of factors. The level of savings at each trust will depend on the age of their existing information technology systems, their cost base and number and type of staff they employ, how their services are delivered at the moment and the volume of transactions that are undertaken. The speed of any roll-out will also dictate the level of savings and is equally dependent on similar local circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w73.html_para3">
However, it is estimated that by 2009&#150;10, total savings from the use of shared service centres in the national health service will be about &#163;35&nbsp;million per annum on HR and &#163;60-&#163;75&nbsp;million on financial services.

<p><a name="40419w73.html_wqn8"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what responsibilities social services departments have to support destitute British nationals.  [165494]</p>








<p><a name="40419w73.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 If an adult British citizen approaches a council with social services responsibilities for help, the council should determine whether the person is ordinarily resident in its area or in urgent need. If so, the council should carry out a community care assessment if it believes that the individual adult&#039;s needs are such that s/he may be provided with community care services. If, on the basis of a community care assessment, the individual is deemed eligible for community care services, the council should provide those services and, thereafter, review both needs and services at frequent intervals. This process applies to all adult British citizens whether they are destitute or not. In some situations, a council may have to provide substantial help, including residential accommodation, if a destitute British citizen is returning to, or arriving in, the United Kingdom and cannot access benefits and housing immediately.

A number of initiatives have been put in place to improve access to advice, including the Just Ask! website. A national telephone advice service will be available nationally from summer 2004 following a successful pilot. CLS leaflets provide information on legal rights and details of local service providers can be found in the CLS Directory, available at a number of public locations and online. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee&#039;s current inquiry into the adequacy of civil legal aid provision is considering access to civil legal and advice services. An independent review is also evaluating the effectiveness of the CLS and is due to report in late April 2004.

 It is not the Government&#039;s practice to discuss the internal processes that underlie the handling of pay negotiations. All concerned within Government are working together to take forward the Government&#039;s firm and fair approach to civil service pay, which is that pay should not jeopardise the imperative of improving services, but should take account of the need to retain, recruit and motivate staff within the spending and delivery plans set in the Northern Ireland Budget.

The need for such research was identified as one of a number of research priorities within the Regional Drug and Alcohol Action Plan and the intention was to provide a report to the Department by October 2003.

<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mrs. Iris Robinson, dated 6&nbsp;April 2004:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">You tabled a Parliamentary Question asking for what reasons Royal Mail has been denied permission to erect a post box at Lansdowne Road, Newtownards. As the issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">I understand that Royal Mail submitted a written request on 7&nbsp;January 2004 seeking permission to locate a post box at Lansdowne Road, Newtownards. The proposed location of the box was shown to be 5 metres from the junction of Lansdowne Road and Ten Acre (a side road leading to houses occupied mainly by elderly people).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Following discussions with the Traffic Police, our local Section Engineer replied to Royal Mail on 16&nbsp;January 2004 indicating that the proposed location was not suitable due to concerns that vehicles stopping so close to the junction to post mail would have compromised traffic safety. However, it was suggested that if the box could be located a minimum of 15 metres from the junction, at the back of the footway, this would be acceptable. This distance ties in with the minimum length of waiting restriction commonly marked on the ground at road junctions to reinforce current law (i.e. it is an offence to park a vehicle within 15 metres of a junction regardless of whether the road is marked with double yellow lines).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">It would appear that Royal Mail has somehow misinterpreted the content of our reply, which clearly indicates that Roads Service would grant approval for an alternative location close to that initially proposed. I have asked our Section Engineer to contact the Royal Mail to clarify the position so that the post-box can be provided as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="40419w80.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 One parent has complained to the Department of Education about the weight of schoolbags. The Department has not issued guidelines or carried out a medical assessment on this matter. There are no plans to introduce, as standard practice, the provision of personal lockers for school children. The Department&#039;s School Building Handbook provides for either cloakroom space or moveable lockers in schools. It is, however, a matter for school authorities to decide what provision should be made at a particular school. Also, parents have a responsibility to protect the health and welfare of their children by ensuring that only essential materials are carried in schoolbags. Similarly, pupils are also responsible for making decisions as to the books and learning materials they need to carry to and from school each day.

The Department of Education is required by law to have regard to the general principle that pupils shall be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents.

While it is the Department&#039;s policy to encourage the integration in school of Traveller children with other children, there are no plans to phase out provision at St. Mary&#039;s for so long as there is a demand for places in the school from the parents of Traveller children.

 It is not possible to estimate the financial cost without incurring disproportionate costs.

The Department&#039;s businesses routinely move work around locations in order to optimise their services. Our information technology enables this to be done without incurring extra costs.

<p><a name="40419w82.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The Department has set out clear arrangements within the Performance and Development System guidance for allowing staff to raise issues about their appraisal and about their performance mark. This guidance also makes clear that individuals do have the right to be accompanied by a colleague, or Trade Union representative, where a member of staff raises a disagreement. PDS was developed using the best features from previous systems, in line with Cabinet Office recommendations and with the input of managers, staff and Trade Unions. It is similar to that used by some other Government

<p><a name="40419w82.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The Performance and Development system was developed with input from staff, managers and Trade Unions, and in line with Cabinet Office recommendations. It was supported by independent consultants who researched and advised on best practice in both public and private sectors. The system provides a fair and objective assessment of performance against that of people at the same level doing similar work, a stronger focus on personal development, and more regular feedback, all of which is intended to improve motivation and performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w82.html_para2">
This is only the end of the first year of the system, it is therefore too early to have tangible evidence of the results on motivation and performance.

 The Performance and Development System (PDS) replaced seven legacy systems. Most of the features of PDS are not new, and existed in previous legacy arrangements. These have not been costed previously, all good employers have appraisal arrangements in line with Investors in People standards. While there have been additional costs this year, as there would be in any organisation introducing a new policy these have not been excessive, around 2&#150;3 hours for each member of staff.

The campaign also included other communications media. Commercial poster sites have not been used for this campaign. However, local publicity posters, e.g for display in community premises have been produced. The costs for these cannot be disaggregated.

<p><a name="40419w82.html_spnew9"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The advertising media for the &quot;Pick It Up, It&#039;s Yours&quot; campaign was procured using the Government&#039;s publicity agency COI Communications. This achieves maximum value for money by exploiting economies of scale across Government departments to negotiate the most favourable rates.

 The advertising agency used for this campaign is Delaney Lund Knox Warren (DLKW). They received an estimated &#163;815,171.06 (ex VAT) for their services.

2.&nbsp;Please note that these figures for 2003&#150;04 refer only to the main payment run i.e. they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8&nbsp;per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<br>

3.&nbsp;Figures are not held for the first two years of the scheme as payments were only made to those on certain benefits. Figures have been kept since it was known the scheme would be extended to all those aged 60 or over.<br>

 Five schemes are currently under development. Of these two have received provisional approval from my Department. They are:

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Midland Metro extension&#151;Birmingham to Five Ways and Wednesbury to Brierley Hill (estimated total cost &#163;227&nbsp;million; expected construction start 2005 and expected completion 2008); and</p>

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w85.html_para10">
Three schemes have received approval but the estimated cost subsequently increased. The value for money of the schemes therefore needs to be reappraised. They are:

</p>

<p>


</p>

Bids have also been received for Merseytram Line 2 and extensions to the Nottingham Express Transit. The Department is also in discussions with promoters about further extensions to the Midland Metro, Sheffield Supertram, Tyne and Wear Metro, Merseytram, Manchester Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w85.html_para12">
Currently the Department&#039;s approach to the assessment of appraisals of light rail schemes includes:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Promoters of major local transport schemes submit their bids for central funds as part of their Local Transport Plan (LTP).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The business case supporting the bid should be written in accordance with the Department&#039;s New Approach to Appraisal (NATA), details of which can be found on the Department&#039;s appraisal website: www.webtag.org.uk. NATA involves assessing the impact of the proposal against the Government&#039;s five objectives for transport: economy, safety, integration, 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 310W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>accessibility, and the environment. The NATA approach includes the analysis of both monetised and non-monetised costs and benefits.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department&#039;s officials examine the case presented for funding, including the benefits, costs, risks, affordability and public acceptability. This usually requires a period of dialogue with the promoters in addition to the information submitted through the written business case.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department issues guidance to promoters of schemes to help them prepare a business case that meets the Department&#039;s requirements.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A pre-procurement business case is needed to secure Provision View for funding, which is dependent on the necessary statutory powers being obtained, and the scheme design or costs not changing substantially as a result of further work to obtain powers and the procurement process.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Once statutory powers have been obtained and tender received from bidders an updated business case is needed if details of the scheme have changed to secure Full Approval for scheme funding.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w85.html_para13">
The Department leaves the choice of procurement method to the promoter of a scheme, although on larger schemes it will usually consult with the promoter on the approach being taken from an early stage. Promoters may present a case for PFI or capital funding via the same business case process. Capital funding for public transport schemes is usually split between section 56 grant and borrowing approvals.

Since weaknesses in the then existing system of safeguards were exposed in the early 1990s, I am advised the IAEA has developed new and powerful safeguards measures, in particular to strengthen its ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities in non-nuclear weapon states. Such measures include those specified in the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements, approved by the Board of Governors in May 1997. The UK has fully supported the work of the IAEA in this regard and our assessment continues to be that its safeguards verification activities are the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and that a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement in combination with an additional protocol thereto, should be considered the new verification standard for non-nuclear weapon states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

 The Centre for Defence Medicine, now the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), was formally opened and became operational on 2&nbsp;April 2001. It replaced the Royal Defence Medical College that was located in Gosport and was formally closed at the end of March 2002. The Operational Health Research Division, the academic focus for defence medicine created in April 2004 embraces professional and academic staff based in Birmingham who were part of the Royal Defence Medical College. The Defence Post Graduate Medical Deanery, which was located in Portsmouth, is also based in Birmingham, but does not form part of RCDM. In addition 110 military medical personnel are working within the MOD Hospital Unit at the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (UHBT), delivering health services to military and civilian patients.

UHBT is also the focus for the MOD&#039;s aeromedical evacuation capability. Transfer of other functions from Portsmouth, which are under the control of RCDM, such as radiology and telemedicine, are being considered as part of the option to move all medical training to Birmingham.

The allocation of the national budget of SCG for DFGs to each region is made on the basis of a formula.

These indices are updated annually. The allocation according to the formula is limited to the total amount that the authorities in each region have said they need to cover 60&nbsp;per cent. of their planned expenditure on DFGs. If the formula allocates more than this amount the residual sum is reallocated to other regions in proportion to their need. For the 2004&#150;05 allocations, a further damping mechanism was used to ensure that no region had a cut of more than 2&nbsp;per cent. in its allocation compared with the previous year.

 The Tower Hamlets Housing Action Trust (HAT) has completed its work on budget (including &#163; 123&nbsp;million of Government assistance) and one year ahead of its original completion target of March 2005. It has exceeded its original objectives for the building of new homes or the improvement of existing ones to the highest standards; ensuring effective, sensitive and responsive maintenance and management of homes; promoting diversity of tenure within the HAT&#039;s estates; and improving the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area, including improved jobs opportunities, youth and community facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419w99.html_para1">
Nearly 1,000 new homes have been built. Only one tower block, and one sheltered housing scheme, are to remain&#151;both of which will have been extensively refurbished by the end of the HAT programme.

In the period 1997&#150;2000 an estimated 80&nbsp;per cent. of new dwellings in the gateway were built on previously developed land, which is above the national target of 60&nbsp;per cent. and the gateway strategy aims to at least maintain this trend. Detailed allocation of land for new development will be undertaken through the statutory plan-making process by local planning authorities.

Both the child element of child tax credit and child benefit are already paid in respect of each child in a household, according to income.

However, an analysis, based on results from the General Household Survey for Great Britain in 2000, estimated that, of all dependent children living in families: 9.1&nbsp;per cent. were living with a never-married lone mother; 0.7&nbsp;per cent. with a widowed lone mother; 7.1&nbsp;per cent. with a divorced lone mother; and 5.1&nbsp;per cent. with a separated lone mother. Corresponding estimates were not made for the proportions of all dependent children living in families who were living in lone father families, because of small sample numbers. Overall, 2.6&nbsp;per cent. of all dependent children living in families were living in lone father families. These estimates are not comparable with those from the 2001 Census, since they relate to a different time, and cover the whole of Great Britain rather than England and Wales.The full results, published in an article in Population Trends 109, are available in the House of Commons Library and may also be seen on the National Statistics website at:http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population/PT109.pdf</p>

<p>
<a name="40419106.html_para2">
Land degradation takes a number of forms, including depletion of soil nutrients, salinisation, soil erosion, vegetative degradation, and deforestation. All of these types of degradation cause a decline in the productivity of the land, reducing potential yields and posing a potential threat to the rural livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419106.html_para3">
Existing estimates of the current global extent and severity of the problem of land degradation should be considered indicative at best: land degradation is something that cannot be easily monitored and measured. Responding to the need for a global overview of land degradation, the Global Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD), published in 1992, became the first comprehensive soil degradation

GLASOD is limited, however, and the need for more objective, qualitative approaches, using nationally-based data rather than global or regional figures, is widely recognised. New international initiatives are underway to develop national data acquisition on land degradation, using GIS (Geographic Information Systems), remote sensing and local assessments.

 Good governance and economic growth are crucial requirements for poverty reduction in Africa. Our experience and research shows that broad based economic growth and poverty reduction can only be sustained where there is effective government. Investment is vital for growth and businesses will only invest if they feel confident that they will benefit from successful investment and perceive the risks of expropriation to be low. The priorities for improving the business environment will depend on country context.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the published objectives were of the rapid reaction mechanism financed on the General Commission Budget in 2002; what his Department&#039;s involvement in the mechanism was; what results it achieved; and what assessment he has made of its value for money.  [165180]</p>








<p><a name="40419111.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Detailed descriptions of the objectives for the EC Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) are outlined in the Commission&#039;s Annual Report 2003 on the European Community&#039;s Development policy and the implementation of external assistance in 2002 (p 70&#150;73) and in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities published on 31&nbsp;January 2002 (volume 45 L29, pps 1306). A copy of this is available in the parliamentary Library or via the Commission website at http://europa.eu.int/eurlex/en/archive/2002/l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;02920020131en.html.

These include, preventative action during emerging crises, acute crisis management, post conflict reconciliation and post-crisis reconstruction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para1">
As with other parts of the Commission budget DFID engaged in discussion around funding for the RRM through the annual budget negotiation process led by HM Treasury.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para2">
In 2002 the rapid reaction mechanism resulted in funding contributions towards, among other things, the stabilisation of Afghanistan, Peace-building in the horn of Africa, reconstruction in the Palestinian territories, conflict mitigation in Nepal and Peace-building in Sri Lanka.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para3">
The EC is best placed to carry out value for money assessments for individual budget lines through it&#039;s own performance monitoring mechanisms.

<p><a name="40419111.html_wqn2"><b> John Barrett: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) if he will list the meetings at which his Department has been represented on the delivery of sustainable development across Government as co-ordinated by the Ministerial Sub-committee of Green Ministers;  [165433]

<p>(2) what meetings his Department&#039;s Green Minister has attended in the last 12 months in that role.  [165434]</p>








<p><a name="40419111.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 I am a Member of the Ministerial Sub-committee of Green Ministers (ENV(G)), but it has been established practice under successive Governments not to disclose information relating to the proceedings of Cabinet Committees. This practice is now formalised by Exemption 2 of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<a name="40419111.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Uganda</h3>





<p><a name="40419111.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Boris Johnson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development for what reason food aid to Teso in north-east Uganda was distributed through the World Food Programme.  [165519]</p>








<p><a name="40419111.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Over the last 12 months DFID has provided &#163;6.4&nbsp;million specifically for food relief in the north and east of Uganda. This support is channelled through the World Food Programme, which works with NGO partners to distribute food at a local level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para4">
Over 1.5&nbsp;million people are now displaced in northern and eastern Uganda, requiring a huge and ongoing humanitarian response. DFID channels support for food relief through WFP because it is the UN agency mandated to provide food aid in such a large-scale emergency. It is the only agency in Uganda equipped with the necessary staff, resources and experience required to respond adequately to the situation.

<a name="40419111.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Vitamins and Minerals</h3>





<p><a name="40419111.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Watson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many people&#039;s health his Department estimates has been damaged as a result of lacking essential vitamins and minerals.  [165255]</p>








<p><a name="40419111.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not conduct its own global health estimates, but uses those produced by the international bodies mandated to do this such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). FAO 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Apr 2004 : Column 408W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
estimate that more than 2 billion peoples health in the world is affected by a lack of essential vitamins and minerals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para5">
DFID is working to tackle malnutrition through a wide range of health, education and food security policies. DFID&#039;s position paper on food insecurity, &quot;Eliminating Hunger&quot; sets out a strategy for helping poor people access an adequate variety and quantity of safe, good-quality food. Since 2001 DFID has also provided core funding of over &#163;440&nbsp;million to WHO and UNICEF whose activities include directly providing essential vitamins and minerals to the most needy, particularly children who are at risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para6">
DFID is also funding research into improving the nutritional content of crops, including vitamins and minerals.

<p><a name="40419111.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what value for money guarantees he is seeking regarding EU aid spending in Zimbabwe.  [165544]</p>








<p><a name="40419111.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 All spending by the European Community is subject to rigorous review, evaluation and audit procedures. The European Court of Auditors is responsible for appropriate audit of EC programmes, including programmes in Zimbabwe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40419111.html_para7">
Concerns about the exchange rate used by the European Commission were raised in a report of the European Court of Auditors. DFID&#039;s understanding is that those concerns were limited to part of the spending of the European Development Fund (EOF) that was converted into Zimbabwe dollars during 2002. Humanitarian aid, which is largely funded from the EU budget rather than the EOF, was therefore not affected. Humanitarian aid is in any case very largely used to procure food and other goods outside Zimbabwe and would not be converted into Zimbabwe dollars. The European Commission&#039;s view is that use of any other exchange rate would have contravened either Zimbabwean law or the EC&#039;s international obligations.
