 Government recently passed legislation through the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 to bring improvements for education and training for young people detained in the youth secure estate. It makes local authorities responsible for learning for young people detained in youth custody and aligns arrangements in custody with the mainstream learning sector for the first time. This aims to increase consistency and continuity of learning for young people entering and leaving youth custody.

<i> [holding answer 15 March 2010]:</i> Housing benefit is an income-related benefit administered by local authorities to assist people on low incomes who need help to pay their rent. Tenants in the private rented sector have their benefit entitlement restricted to an amount considered to be reasonable for the area and their accommodation needs. As from 7 April 2008 the local authority uses the appropriate local housing allowance rate, based on the area where the person lives and the size of their household, to determine the maximum amount to be included in the housing benefit calculation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="100322w0007.htm_para3"><a name="10032217000156">In the case of single people aged 25 years and over and couples with no dependent children, the local housing allowance rate for a one-bedroom properly would normally be used to calculate their benefit entitlement. However, if they choose to live in a property where they do not have either exclusive use of two or more rooms, or exclusive use of one room, a bathroom and toilet and a kitchen or facilities for cooking, the shared room rate would apply.</p>

3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4.

5. The figures are based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br>
7. Incomes are presented in 2007-08 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.<br>
8. Families are defined as a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children, including same sex couples (civil partnerships and cohabitees) from January 2006. A household is made up of one or more families. Families can include individuals over state pension age.<br>
9. The median income is the income of the middle person in the population, such that half the population have incomes below the median and half the population have incomes above the median. The median is used instead of the mean income because the mean is affected by outlying cases with very high income values. This is consistent with relevant public service agreement indicators and the Households Below Average Income publication.<br>

 The Government's declared aim is to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Our determination to do so is as firm as ever and this is demonstrated by introducing the Child Poverty Bill. The Child Poverty Bill will bring new impetus to eradicating child poverty by 2020. It will provide a definition of success and sets a framework to guarantee that Government and their partners at national and local levels make a clear and vital contribution towards ending child poverty.</p>

 For both small and large companies, the increase in national insurance contributions in 2011 represents only a very small proportion of their total costs. Therefore, in the climate of stronger economic growth forecast by the Treasury and independent commentators in 2011 and beyond, the Government expect the rise in national insurance contributions to be affordable, and any impact on employment to be limited.

 HS2 Ltd assessed the comparative business cases of new high speed and conventional lines between London and the West Midlands, which would deliver a 35 minute and 20 minute reduction in journey times respectively (assuming the conventional line, like the high speed proposal, included no intermediate stations between the two conurbations).</p>

 Discussions are taking place with Northern Rail to plan and justify the provision of additional vehicles to meet peak-hour capacity requirements in the northern cities, and the Department for Transport has already agreed some contract changes with Northern Rail, whereby a net 18 additional diesel vehicles will be used to lengthen certain train services.

 The Government are taking a number of steps to ensure consumers are assisted in understanding the support available to them. The Government support a one-stop shop through the Energy Saving Trust which provides free advice to consumers on energy saving as well as providing easy access to the full range of Carbon Emission Reduction Target offers. This is supported by the Government's overarching Act on CO2 marketing campaign which demonstrates the benefits of the energy saving measures offered under the Carbon Emission Reduction Target as part of coverage in national television, press, radio and online. We have recently conducted qualitative research among consumers to help deepen our understanding of attitudes, behaviours, motivations and barriers for home insulation. Longer term, we have set out our intention as part of the 'Warm Homes, Greener Homes' strategy to continue to improve and simplify consumer access to, and navigation of, energy saving information. This will combine with effective branding and marketing to build awareness and trust in the available products and services.</p>

 The supplier obligation (now termed the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target) has been set over three-year cycles precisely to allow Government to reflect on its successes and to evolve the scheme so that it only pulls through the most energy efficient products with the most potential to provide for household sector carbon emissions reductions. The measures eligible for each phase are subject to full public consultation. The consultation on the April 2011 to December 2012 extension of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, which concluded on 14 March 2010, specifically asked whether Government should introduce up front sunset clauses for products when they reach a certain level of market penetration. Consultation responses are now being considered.</p>

 Ethiopia is one of the world's poorest countries, and a high priority for development. The UK's development programme aims to reduce poverty in Ethiopia, and to support progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Encouraging progress has been made in recent years.

A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. The episode types used for deliveries are "delivery episode" and "other delivery event".  2. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures that may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer included in admitted patient HES data.  3. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  4. Small numbers: To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced. In this case it has not been possible to suppress an additional number as all others have been published. For this reason the total has been suppressed so that the value of the replaced figure cannot be calculated.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> The information is the number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2004-05 to 2006-07) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Counts for the different diagnoses shown are not necessarily mutually exclusive and therefore summing the different diagnoses is not possible (e.g. a patient may have a DVT and a PE in a single episode, and would be counted once in each relevant column-double counting would occur if the values were summed).<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Diagnosis is recorded in HES using ICD10 codes. ICD10 code I80.2 is used for a diagnosis of DVT where there is no further information on the site of the thrombosis. However DVT may also be recorded under a number of different codes, although these codes may also include cases which are not considered deep. The full list of relevant ICD10 codes is as follows:<br>
I80.0 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of superficial vessels of lower extremities<br>
I80.1 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of femoral vein<br>
I80.2 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of other deep vessels of lower extremities<br>
I80.3 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of lower extremities, unspecified<br>
I80.8 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of other sites<br>
I80.9 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of unspecified site<br>
O22.2 Superficial thrombophlebitis in pregnancy<br>
O22.3 Deep phlebothrombosis in pregnancy<br>
O87.0 Superficial thrombophlebitis in the puerperium<br>
O87.1 Deep phlebothrombosis in the puerperium<br>

<i> Note</i>:<br>
Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer included in admitted patient HES data.<br>

We want to see the elimination of all Direct Payments under Pillar I of the CAP. Direct Payments are an expensive and inefficient mechanism and undermine the ability of farmers to be truly competitive. They do not help farmers to tackle the challenges of the future and our policy is therefore to see them phased out by a carefully managed transition by 2015-20. A sustainable CAP would comprise of EU spending on agriculture that would be based on the current Pillar II, allowing a considerable reduction in total spending by the EU on agriculture and bringing this into line with other sectors.</p>
