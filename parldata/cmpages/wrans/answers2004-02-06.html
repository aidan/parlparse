<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lyons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what improvements in health care have taken place in Afghanistan since the end of the war.  [150623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Since April 2002 72 hospitals, clinics and women's healthcare centres have been rebuilt. The Ministry of Health has established a Child and Adolescent Health Department and a Department of Women and Reproductive Health to tackle high infant and maternal mortality rates.
<P>

<a name="40206w01.html_para1">The World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development and the European Community are helping the Afghan Ministry of Health, through NGOs, to provide a basic healthcare service to the entire population. The package consists of services for (i) maternal and newborn health; (ii) child health and immunisation; (iii) nutrition; (iv) communicable disease; (v) mental health; (vi) disability; and (vii) supply of essential drugs.
<P>

<a name="40206w01.html_para2">Immunisation is having a real impact. 12&nbsp;million children have been immunised against polio and 16&nbsp;million against measles since 2002, saving 30,000 lives. Cholera and diarrhoeal diseases are being tackled through health education, water chlorination and the construction of wells throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="40206w01.html_para3">Recruiting, training and deploying health care workers (especially women) is a real challenge, especially in rural areas. The absence of female health workers is being addressed by the World Health Organisation, which is running a variety of health courses to boost the number of skilled birth attendants, nurses and midwives.
<P>

<a name="40206w01.html_para4">Despite the substantial investment in the provision of basic health care in Afghanistan, the effective delivery of services across the whole of the country will take many months. But efforts to improve the health of people in Afghanistan will need to continue for many years and will require the support of the international community over the long term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w01.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I have listed the devolved DFID offices that take decisions on local spend and policy. Based on wide experience, DFID considers that country programmes are best planned and managed within the country concerned, subject to the size of programme being such as to warrant the costs.

<a name="40206w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 30&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 570W, and in connection with the 28th Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, Session 1999&#150;2000, HC 431, Inland Revenue/EDS Strategic Partnership, Re-tendering the contract in 2004, Paragraph 54, and Minutes of Evidence (HC 431-i) Questions 14 and 40, who the board member responsible for Mr. John Yard's division on 12&nbsp;April 2000 was; on what date he commenced planning for retendering the Inland Revenue's information technology service; and on what date it was decided that a market-making exercise would be held prior to retendering that contract.  [153408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Board member responsible for Business Services on 12&nbsp;April 2000 was Tim Flesher, who at that time was the Inland Revenue's Deputy Chairman. As I stated in my answer of 16&nbsp;December 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 803W, planning for the ASPIRE project began in January 2001.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy not to collect national insurance contributions from individuals who will reach state pension age during the course of a financial year where those individuals will be unable to accrue any additional rights to contributory benefits in respect of those contributions.  [153409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The UK national insurance scheme operates on the "pay as you go" principle so that the contributions paid by people of working age fund the benefits of people who are currently claiming benefit. The Government believes that it is right that working people between the ages of 16 and the state retirement age should contribute to the payment of benefits of those not in work and to the funding of the NHS.

<i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The 2003&#150;04 mid-year review of expenditure found that the Children's Fund was underspent in the first half of the year.
<P>

<a name="40206w03.html_para0">The Department met representatives from the main voluntary sector organisations involved in the Fund, the LGA and the ADSS on 18&nbsp;December to discuss the review and assess its impact. Officials then wrote to all Children's Fund partnerships on 19&nbsp;December 2003. We advised partnerships that where our decisions at the mid-year review had compromised their ability to meet contractual obligations, we would revisit them. Furthermore, we set aside some money to assist where there was a likelihood of staff redundancy or premature closure of services. The Children's Fund regional teams discussed this in detail with partnerships during January, identifying where we should restore funds taken back in the mid year review. This process was completed at the end of January.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action she is taking to encourage co-defendants to sign up to the Coal Health Handling Agreement; and if she will make a statement.  [147199]<P>

<a name="40206w04.html_spnew3"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The small number of outstanding issues is principally a matter for resolution between the claimants' solicitors and the co-defendants.
<P>

<a name="40206w04.html_para5">The two main groups of co-defendants are small private mines, which produced coal during the nationalised period and who have concurrent liability with British Coal and the successor companies, such as UK Coal who have consecutive liability. Negotiations with both groups are advanced. At the end of January, representatives of the DTI, the Claimants Solicitor's Group (CG) and the small mines will take part in a three-way mediation exercise to attempt to resolve the outstanding issues between them.
<P>

<a name="40206w04.html_para6">The Department has been working with its claims handlers to develop a mechanism for paying interim awards to men who worked for small mines. The first payment went out in December 2003.
<P>

<a name="40206w04.html_para7">Discussions with the successor companies to sign up to the Claims Handling Agreement have also reached an advanced stage. UK Coal and the CG have recently

produced new information regarding dust levels in successor mines. The parties' experts are currently reviewing these reports and further negotiations will take place shortly. If the remaining issues cannot be resolved through negotiation, mediation will be explored.

 Table 1 records the number of company compulsory liquidations by region classified according to groupings of Official Receivers' Offices from 1999 to 2002 and the first three quarters of 2003. Statistics have not been provided prior to 1999 because of boundary changes.

 Existing electricity trading arrangements incentives market participants to deliver secure supplies and to manage the effects of intermittent generation, along with other risks, in so doing. Our proposals for BETTA will ensure that market participants in all parts of Great Britain face a uniform set of trading arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40206w06.html_para3">Analysis carried out as part of the White Paper process shows that the electricity system could cope with an increasing reliance on renewable generation, including wind. The White Paper analysis also highlights that as the proportion of intermittent generation increases, so does the cost of maintaining stable supplies. These costs need to be managed and new ways found to minimise them. We are already funding research into this through the DTIs Renewable Energy programme and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's SUPERGEN programme. In addition, as part of our current capital grant programme we allocated in 2002 an additional &#163;4&nbsp;million to facilitate the demonstration of new control, storage and metering technologies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the progress of discussions between NATO and the EU regarding a European Security and Defence Policy mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [153324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The UK's vision for Bosnia is a sovereign, independent and united country, with a democratic and accountable government, a free market economy and tolerance of minority rights. We expect it to fulfil its obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. We wish to see Bosnia on an irreversible track towards European and Euro Atlantic integration. Getting there will require an evolution in the presences of the international community, including the EU and NATO. NATO Foreign Ministers agreed in December 2003 that the Alliance should start work with the EU on planning a possible EU mission under Berlin Plus arrangements. The Brussels European Council also in December 2003 endorsed this. Against this background, NATO and EU officials are taking forward planning on a possible EU mission, without prejudice to any formal decision at the June Istanbul summit to terminate SFOR.
<P>

<a name="40206w06.html_para6">The UK fully supports this process and wants to see NATO successfully terminate its SFOR mission in Bosnia, probably at the end of 2004, while maintaining a limited military operational presence in the country. This would be a significant step in Bosnia's development towards a self-sustaining future. We want to see an EU-led presence, which is robust, credible and able to 



<P>
<P><I>6 Feb 2004 : Column 1100W</I><P>
provide a safe and secure environment allowing the EU to take forward its objectives in Bosnia. The UK has offered to take the first lead of this EU-led mission.
<P>

<a name="40206w06.html_para7">The UK wishes to see the residual NATO presence run defence outreach activities such as defence reform and Partnership for Peace programmes. We also believe it should retain some operational activities, such as hunting for indicted war criminals and counter-terrorist operations.
<P>

<a name="40206w06.html_para8">Bosnia provides an opportunity for NATO and the EU to put their commitment to co-operation into practice in the first major Berlin Plus operation. Effective consultation at all levels will be crucial. The EU will need to develop a joined-up approach, linking its economic, civil, development and military instruments. The UK looks forward to supporting these efforts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1) what steps have been taken in relation to the European Council's decision to begin the improvement of the preparation of European Union operations having recourse to NATO assets and capabilities; when such steps were taken; what further steps are envisaged; and if he will make a statement;  [153325]

 The Conclusions of the 12&#150;13&nbsp;December 2003 European Council welcomed the Presidency paper on "European Defence: NATO/EU consultation, planning and operations." This sets out how the European Union's collective crisis management capacity can be strengthened, particularly in the field of planning. The European Council invited the Secretary General/High Representative, Javier Solana, to propose measures for the improvement of the preparation of European Union operations having recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, and for the establishment of a cell with civil and military components. The European Council concluded that these measures should enter into force as early as possible in 2004.
<P>

<a name="40206w07.html_para0">We look forward to the Secretary General/High Representative's initial report, which will be a basis for discussion among EU member states and with NATO and will lead to further, more detailed work. The Government supports the strengthening of NATO/EU planning links and of ESDP planning capacity, particularly in the civilian/military area. The Presidency paper reflects UK priorities and we will remain in touch with the Council bodies and other member states as work to implement it is taken forward.

 The Government expects initial implementation of the Strategy to concentrate on the four priority areas tasked by the European Council when it adopted the European Security Strategy at its December meeting: effective multilateralism with the UN at its core, the fight against terrorism, a strategy towards the region of the Middle East and a comprehensive policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government are committed to the full implementation of the Strategy to help bring coherence and greater robustness to the EU's external policies.
<P>

<a name="40206w07.html_para2">The UK's security posture is already in line with the analysis behind the European Security Strategy. As outlined in the Strategic Defence Review New Chapter, we have already taken steps to ensure our forces are configured to respond to the new global threats of the post September 11th world by making our armed forces more flexible, with improved global reach. The UK has long argued for improved European defence capabilities, coherence in bringing together the EU's existing tools, both civilian and military, and a strong transatlantic link. The European Security Strategy sets out the framework to achieve this.

 Requests made by an hon.

 UK forces report all fatalities of which they are aware arising from incidents in which they were involved but it is not always possible to confirm whether fatalities have occurred during a particular incident. For example, in some incidents we believe Iraqi dead may have been taken away by their compatriots before UK forces could investigate. In other incidents UK forces have been forced to withdraw before any Iraqi fatalities could be confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All Challenger 2 crew members are equipped with a full set of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), which includes boots, gloves, a respirator and NBC suit. Crews are also trained to operate their vehicles whilst wearing this equipment. In addition to the NBC IPE issued to each Challenger 2 crew member during Operation Telic, further individual protection was provided through the issue of a prophylactic drug (Nerve Agent Pre-treatment System (NAPS)). NAPS is to be taken orally, when ordered to do so, during preparations for operations. Further protection against the-effects of nerve agents was provided in the form of atropine injectors. Atropine is self-administered following exposure to nerve agent poisoning.
<P>

<a name="40206w08.html_para1">The length of time personnel could wear NBC IPE while in armoured vehicles and the effect on their operational efficiency would vary according to the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40206w08.html_para2">As stated in the National Audit Office's report, none of the Challenger 2 tanks that went into action in Operation Telic was fitted with operational Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) filters. NBC filters were available in theatre but, owing to difficulties with asset tracking, were not issued to front line units in time to be fitted during the war-fighting phase of the operation. By the time NBC filters were issued to front line units, the NBC threat was deemed to have reduced significantly owing to the attrition of possible means of delivery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the crews of Challenger 2 tanks which went into action in Operation Telic without their operational nuclear, biological and chemical filters fitted <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;wore individual NBC suits continuously and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;had NBC suits with them for immediate use if attacked.  [152768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All UK military personnel deployed in Iraq were issued with NBC Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) which they were required to carry with them at all times. Challenger 2 tank crews would have carried their NBC suits inside their vehicles during operations and would have worn them if the National Contingent Commander or local commanders deemed it necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what procedures were in place during Operation Telic to alert the crews of Challenger 2 tanks to nuclear, biological and chemical attack.  [152770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 UK forces have well established procedures for the dissemination of NBC information to all locations, units, sub-units, down to individual sections and vehicles. This applies equally to static locations and manoeuvre units, and relies on the transmission of appropriate warnings and alarms over the normal Combat Net Radio, backed up with visual and audible warnings and alarms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> Frontline commands, theatre commanders or Directors of Equipment Capability (DECs) can each generate requests for Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR). These are passed to the Permanent Joint Headquarters for endorsement. DECs, in co-operation with Integrated Project Teams in the Defence Procurement Agency or Defence Logistics Organisation, investigate if it is possible to fulfil the requirement through the purchase of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment. Where this is so a business case is drafted. This is then passed through an accelerated approvals process, which allows procurement action to be taken in the minimum amount of time. In most cases, the approvals process can be carried out in around a week (and in some cases as little as 24 hours). The need to ensure coherence of UORs with operational plans and priorities, to explore alternative ways of meeting the requirement or to confirm that a feasible solution can be delivered within acceptable timescales can in some instances add to the length of time needed to approve individual business cases.

 It is not our practice or that of previous governments to place copies of the reports from Service Board of Inquiry in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40206w08.html_para3">A Service Board of Inquiry is an internal fact finding investigation undertaken by the services for their own use, into the circumstances surrounding a particular accident or incident. There is a principle of confidentiality associated with BOI proceedings, which is intended to encourage the provision of forthright evidence. Accordingly, external distribution of BOI reports is usually limited to the next of kin of service personnel killed in in-service accidents, to HM Coroners to assist in their preparations for Inquests, and to other bodies with statutory duties to investigate incidents.

Details were sent to all Border Inspection Posts, local authorities, the State Veterinary Service, Meat Hygiene Service and to HM Customs. All the enforcement bodies concerned deal with such safeguard measures on a regular basis and are familiar with the procedures and vigilance necessary for dealing with affected products. On 28&nbsp;January a further prohibition on imports of live birds from affected countries was issued in line with action agreed by member states in the EU and guidance issued to The State Veterinary Service and HM Customs.

 The test, which is generally used, for the detection of TB in translocated badgers is a test for antibodies (the Brock Test).

 The absolute number of new TB incidents disclosed every month is closely correlated to the rate of testing. Hence, the majority of incidents are detected in the winter months (October through March), when most herds are tested.
<P>

<a name="40206w09.html_para12">However, if the data are adjusted to take into account the seasonality of TB testing, there does not appear to be a clear seasonal pattern in the rate of new TB incidents disclosed each month (i.e. it is not possible to conclude that the herd incidence of bovine TB in certain months of the year is consistently higher than in other months).
<P>

<a name="40206w09.html_para13">Because of the difficulty in studying seasonality of TB infection, there are few reports investigating this aspect of the disease. However, the results of one such investigation was reported in a paper by Wilesmith et al (1982) <sup>1</sup> . They examined seasonal variations in the risk of acquiring infection between 1971 and 1976 for a Dorset cattle herd during an extensive TB herd breakdown. The data indicated that the April/May period presented the time of greatest risk. This correlated with possible exposure to re-infection at the start of the grazing season, exposure lasting for a relatively short time. However, re-exposure to infection was not necessarily the same as re-exposure to pasture, since some stock were out-wintered.

[150847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> is transmitted over time there is evidence that hyper variable regions of its genome change, although most of the genome remains stable. Changes can be identified using molecular biological techniques. Hyper variable regions may change in both intra and interspecies transmission. There is no reason to believe that, except for very rare adaptive changes, the rate of mutation will increase as a strain moves between species.
<P>

<a name="40206w09.html_para18">The rate at which mutations occur depends on the region of the genome. Hence, single nucleotides have an average rate of change of about 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>9</sup>  per nucleotide per generation. However, tandem repeats that show variable numbers (variable numbers of tandem repeats, or VNTRs), show a greater rate of change. Spoligotype changes are intermediate in rate between VNTR and single nucleotide mutations.
<P>

<a name="40206w09.html_para19">We use two main techniques to detect genetic variation in <i>M. bovis</i>. The first of these, spoligotyping, exploits a polymorphic region direct repeat (DR) locus in the genome that is composed of multiple 36bp DR copies interspersed by unique spacers, with strains varying in the presence or absence of spacers. The VNTR method targets 6 alleles (A-F) that vary in the length of internal repeat units, permitting strains to be differentiated on the number of repeats at each target; i.e. 7&#150;5-5&#150;4-3&#150;3-3 would have 7 copies of allele A, 5 of B, etc. High throughput facilities for both of these techniques exist at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency

(VLA), allowing the molecular typing of about 4,000 to 5,000 strains per year. Our current models of the population structure of <i>M. bovis</i> suggest that the VNTR loci evolve faster than the DR repeat locus. Thus spoligotyping provides a global picture of the population structure and epidemiology of <i>M. bovis</i> in Great Britain, while VNTR typing has proved useful as a fine scale method for detecting local changes in the <i>M. bovis</i> population.
<P>

<a name="40206w09.html_para20">The evolution of the members of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex has led to specific host preferences; hence <i>M. tuberculosis</i> appears human restricted, while <i>M. bovis</i> consists of a series of clones with a wider mammalian host range. The process of host adaptation probably involves a number of discreet mutations, which would all need to revert to reverse the host adaptation. Back-mutation i.e. the reversion of mutations, occurs very infrequently. The rate for a specific single nucleotide reversion would be about 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>9</sup>  X 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>9</sup>  ( or 10 <sup>-</sup>  <sup>1</sup>  <sup>8</sup> ) per nucleotide per generation. Indeed, if some of these mutation events were deletions they could not revert without the re introduction of the DNA. These questions are being investigated using laboratory based molecular biological techniques at the VLA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Robust conclusions about such questions are difficult to make because the ecology of the North sea is complex and variable, and cod can eat a broad spectrum of food items. The current low level of cod abundance suggests that over the North Sea as a whole cod are unlikely to be food limited, although one cannot exclude the possibility of periodic local effects. As top predators, there are relatively few species with which large cod are likely to be in direct competition.

 Existing models already show that the removal of large fish from the stock increases the threat to recruitment and hence further increase the threat of stock collapse.

 As part of the work of the EU Scientific Technical and Economic Committee, scientists evaluated the effect of the closed area for North Sea cod in the 2001 spawning season, and they showed that there was little significant benefit to the spawning potential of cod in 2001. Studies showed that fishing effort was diverted to areas with a lower density of cod, including areas that were ecologically sensitive, but then moved back once the closure ceased.

<a name="40206w10.html_para0">Discarding occurs when fisheries unavoidably catch small fish below the minimum landing size, or fish that are caught in excess of individual species quotas in a mixed fishery. The discard problem is under regular review, but a ban on discards is not yet considered to be practicable.
<P>

<a name="40206w10.html_para1">The European Commission published an action plan in November 2002 which suggested a number of options to reduce discarding, including consideration in the medium term of a discards ban. The UK and other member states have welcomed the Commission's intention to try out the ideas in its action plan through a series of pilot projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A range of activities involve industry participation in the collection or interpretation of fisheries data. These include the formal collection of data on landings, fishing effort and discards; data collected on a range of chartered commercial fishing voyages during 2003&#150;04 under a DEFRA-NFFO-CEFAS Fisheries Science Partnership programme; and an on-going dialogue about stock assessment and management between fishermen and scientists at meetings of the North Sea Fisheries Commission Partnership. ICES is currently investigating the role of industry data through the Study Group on the Incorporation of Additional Information from the Fishing Industry into Fish Stock Assessments (SGFI), which is attended by departmental scientists.

<a name="40206w10.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress she has made in the introduction of compulsory sorting grids in bottom trawls used for industrial fisheries to reduce the by-catch of juvenile round fish.  [150314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In some Industrial fisheries, such as for North Sea sandeels, by-catch of juvenile round fish is believed to be low. In others there is a range of options which can be used to reduce by-catch e.g. closed areas or closed seasons. At present there are no plans to require the use of compulsory sorting grids in the industrial fisheries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Grey or blackfish is the colloquial expression used to describe undeclared, mis-reported or mis-recorded landings of fish, usually of quota stocks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Current fishery models predict that to reach a low level of fishing mortality consistent with optimal use of the cod stock requires a sustained five-fold reduction in the fishing rate, and could produce an average SSB long term that is 10 times higher than at the present fishing rate. This would be about 550,000 tonnes if the number of young cod entering the stock does not change from the current level. It is not possible to provide separate estimates for sub areas of the North Sea.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_wqn21"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The ICES estimate of the 2003 spawning stock biomass (SSB), comprising fish of mature age, was 53,000 tonnes. The Advisory Committee on Fishery Management regards this figure as uncertain owing to concerns about the accuracy of recent landings data. ICES does not provide separate estimates for areas IVa and IVb.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Removing adult cod is expected to have relatively little effect on the survival or growth rates of juvenile cod, but could significantly affect the production of eggs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the main cause is of mortality in juvenile cod in the North Sea.  [150485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 ICES reports that for ages 0 and one, the majority of mortality is natural (predation by other fish species, seals and seabirds, disease etc) and that for ages two and over most mortality is caused by fishing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_wqn24"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of the use of separator trawls as a means of reducing by-catches on non-target species in mixed fisheries; and what regulations govern their use.  [150487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Separator trawls have been investigated to separate haddock, whiting and saithe from cod, flatfish, monkfish and nephrops. Some promising results have been obtained but much depends on correct rigging of the net. The use of separator trawls is not required generally in UK or EU regulations but a type of separator trawl is required for vessels wishing to fish in part of the area closed during the Irish Sea cod spawning season.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_wqn25"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the implications for the sustainability of a fishery of concentrating on the catching of immature fish and leaving the bulk of mature adults untouched.  [150948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A heavy immature fishery reduces the number of fish that survive to maturity, and therefore diminishes the replacement of the existing mature spawning stock. Even if mature fish were not exploited their numbers would therefore dwindle in the long term.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_wqn26"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the effect is of catching <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;mature cod and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other species on the survival of juvenile and immature stocks, with particular reference to those which have reached sexual maturity and survived two spawning seasons.  [149127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew26"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Catching large mature cod reduces the total egg production of the adult cod stock. To ensure sustainability of the cod and its fisheries a sufficient amount of mature cod need to breed (currently the advice is for 150,000 tonnes in the North sea). At lower levels of mature stock the production of young cod is put at risk.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_wqn27"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under what circumstances the North sea sand eel quota would be reduced to below the level of the historic landing tonnage.  [150848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew27"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Decisions on Total Allowable Catches for sand eels&#151;as for other quota stocks&#151;are taken annually by EU Fisheries Ministers on the basis of advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). If the scientific evidence suggests that TACs and quotas should be set below the level of historic catches, the UK would support this. The provisions on North sea sand eels agreed at the December Council of Ministers include not only reduced quota for 2004 but also new effort regulations to improve management of the stock.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the characteristics of the gear used by the Scottish white fish fleet are in terms of its selectivity in catching cod and haddock.  [149117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w10.html_spnew28"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The selectivity of both cod and haddock in trawls and pair seines is determined mainly by codend design, the most important characteristics of which are mesh size, twine size, presence of a strengthening bag and other elements of construction. The current legislation on technical measures for the North sea provides selectivity which is appropriate for haddock but is less satisfactory for cod which mature at a larger size.

 Fluoride is ingested throughout life as a normal component of food and water. Many of the numerous published studies of the effects of fluoride in animal tests and in human populations shed light on the effects of lifetime ingestion of fluoride. They include studies on diseases which are commoner at older ages, such as cancer and hip fractures. There are no known adverse effects on health outcomes from the usual range of fluoride intakes in the United Kingdom. There is however growing evidence from a number of studies that the protection from tooth decay derived from the fluoridation of water continues into old age.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what cost savings have been made in his Department since the introduction of the Information Technology Procurement Centre of Excellence; and how these were calculated.  [151049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w13.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 A centre of excellence was established within the Department of Health in June 2003 to integrate the essential functions which underpin the successful delivery of all types of acquisition-based programmes and projects. As cost benefits will not accrue until improvements start to take effect, it is too early to measure cost savings. All centres of excellence are currently developing future plans, and as part of this process, measurement of savings will be defined.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the reasons for wide variations in MRSA bacteraemia statistics between hospital trusts; and whether the variations are linked to the size of the sample numbers used.  [145043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40206w14.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Generally methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia rates will be higher in trusts that care for more vulnerable patients and that undertake more invasive and high-risk specialist care. A high rate does not necessarily mean that these trusts are poor performers in either infection control or other performance measures but indicate a need for further investigation. For example large teaching hospitals may import infections when patients are transferred in for specialist care.
<P>

<a name="40206w14.html_para2">A proportion of bacteraemias in all types of hospital are preventable and the aim is to lower MRSA bacteraemias overall. It is important that all trusts
