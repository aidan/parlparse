 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has given no advice to local authorities specifically concerning councillors who hold Cabinet positions on two different authorities.

 The Standards Board for England is currently consulting on a review of the code of conduct for Members. The review includes consideration of whether there is a case for the addition to the code of a provision which would allow Members to disclose certain information in the public interest. Any recommendations the Standards Board may wish to make for amendments to the code will be considered by Ministers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The role and effectiveness of the Standards Board and the operation of the ethical framework for local government has recently been the subject of reviews by

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will rank local authorities by percentage increase in amount received in revenue support grant plus national non-domestic rates in the period from 1999&#150;2000 to 2005&#150;06.  [1156]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50526w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 A table has been placed in the Library of the House showing the percentage change year-on-year on a like-for-like basis (i.e. after adjusting the base year for changes in the funding and functions of local authorities) of formula grant for the period 1999&#150;2000 to 2005&#150;06, together with the average percentage change over this period. Authorities have then been ranked by the average percentage increase over the period within class.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Formula grant consists of the sum of the following grants (where appropriate):

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Revenue Support Grant;</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">Redistributed Business Rates;</p>

<a name="stpa_3">SSA reduction Grant (SSA Review), SSA Reduction Grant (Police Funding Review) and Central Support Protection Grant were damping grants provided to protect authorities from year-on-year changes in Revenue Support Grant, Redistributed Business Rates and Police Grant. In 2001&#150;02 Central Support Protection Grant was replaced by floor and ceiling damping within Revenue Support Grant for authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities. In 2002&#150;03, floor and ceiling damping was extended to all authorities. Floor and ceiling damping refers to the increase year-on-year in formula grant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">As different classes of authorities provide different services it would be inappropriate to compare all authorities. Please note that the Combined Fire Authorities became precepting bodies in 2004&#150;05, and therefore the average percentage increase in formula grant for these authorities refers to the two-year average for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.

 Current planning guidance for all electronic communication developments is set out in planning policy guidance note 8 (revised) (PPG8). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also issued a code of best practice on mobile phone network development. The code provides detailed guidance on best practice for public consultation. In September last year the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned the University of Reading and Arup to undertake an independent study to assess the impact that the code has had since its introduction. This forms part of the Government&#039;s review of all the planning arrangements surrounding telecommunication masts.

 In Spending Review 2004 (SR04), the Government made available over &#163;1 billion of new Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) resources for the period 2006&#150;08. No decision has yet been taken on how these resources will be allocated. The Government are carefully examining the options available, in the light of responses to the recent consultation with key stakeholders such as local authorities and Local Strategic Partnerships. An announcement on the allocations will be made as soon as possible once we have completed our consideration.

 While the security situation is relatively calm in Darfur, banditry is now the biggest security threat to humanitarian operations there.

Intimidation of humanitarian workers including United Nations personnel throughout April was reported in the UN Secretary-General&#039;s April report to the Security Council. This has continued in May: in South Darfur, two truck drivers, contracted by the World Food Programme (WFP), were shot and killed by unidentified attackers on 8 May; and five Sudanese NGO workers were detained by the Sudanese Liberation Army on 11 May.

 Donor co-ordination takes place at a number of levels: internationally, regionally and within partner countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is the main international forum for bilateral donors to discuss co-operation and increased effectiveness of development assistance. As well as annual high-level meetings for heads and deputy heads of development agencies, there are a number of working parties and groups dealing with specific subject areas.

<a name="50526w02.html_para4">
The Paris High Level Forum in March this year brought together Ministers, heads of aid agencies and other senior officials from 60 partner countries, bilateral donors and the main multilateral institutions, to agree ways of making aid more effective. The Paris Declaration is the best statement yet of internationally agreed best practice on aid effectiveness with around 50 commitments, plus indicators and targets, to improve country ownership and donor harmonisation and alignment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w02.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_9">The EU also provides a mechanism to increase coordination and harmonisation among member states. Last year the EU agreed an Action Plan on Harmonisation which included measures to improve co-ordination of EU development assistance at country level. The World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring and annual meetings also provide an opportunity for donors to coordinate policy on aid and development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w02.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_10">There are also co-ordination mechanisms at regional level. For example the Strategic Partnership for Africa seeks to support poverty reduction in Africa by increasing the quality and quantity of aid.

<a name="stpa_11">At country level the World Bank led Consultative Groups review overall progress on poverty reduction and donor commitments to help governments achieve their poverty reduction objectives. The development of Poverty Reduction Strategy papers or similar national development strategies provides an opportunity for developing countries to coordinate donor support. In some countries partner governments lead donor co-ordination processes aimed at improving the overall coherence of donor support (for example, the Government of Tanzania are leading a joint assistance strategy). In some countries, donors have begun to undertake joint strategic planning. For example, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and DFID are developing a joint plan in Cambodia. There are also sector co-ordination processes in many countries particularly in health and education where many donors are present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50526w02.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_12">DFID is working hard to improve the effectiveness of co-ordination and to increase developing country voice at all these levels. A principal concern is that there is no international forum in which total aid allocations to each country are reviewed. We believe that this results in some countries consistently receiving less than their fair share of aid.

It has enabled the EU to launch three peacekeeping operations: in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2003); Macedonia (2003); and Bosnia (December 2004).

Most recently, a Civil/Military Cell has been established to strengthen strategic planning for joint civil/military missions. It is still recruiting staff; once recruitment is complete, it will play an important part in the EU&#039;s efforts to improve the co-ordination of its wide range of security instruments in order to act more coherently and effectively in crisis management, not least in liaison with other key actors, such as the UN and the African Union.

<i>[holding answer 23 May 2005]:</i> Import and export entry clearance can now be handled, via electronic means, from any location. Given this, it is sensible to locate clearance activity where the best service can be provided to UK trade. Dover has three times as many staff as Chatham and, unlike Chatham, can provide a 24-hour service, seven days a week.

 The Government&#039;s Improving Behaviour and Attendance Programme plays a crucial part in the drive to reduce antisocial behaviour in schools. We have a range of measures in place to reduce truancy and poor behaviour and reinforce parental responsibility for their child&#039;s behaviour. They include in-school Learning Support Units, multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams, key workers for children at risk of crime, police in schools, and positive activity programmes in the school holidays. The programme also includes training for all school staff in managing pupil behaviour and preventing violence, as part of the Secondary National Strategy and Primary pilot. And we are encouraging schools to begin working together in collaborations to jointly tackle behaviour and attendance issues, greatly reducing the problems of persistent truancy and disruptive behaviour through early intervention and shared resources.

 Central Government make a substantial investment in skills development through local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) who determine how public funding for training is allocated in their area. The latest available figures for the Hertfordshire LSC do not separately identify plumbing. The LSC is currently providing &#163;2,398,803 overall for learning in the construction trades, including plumbing. Construction has been identified as a high priority area by the Hertfordshire LSC for 2005/06.

 This Government is wholeheartedly committed to the principle of real choice for parents and pupils so that they can choose between excellent local schools, including those with a distinctive ethos or specialism. Parents have the right to express a preference for whatever school they wish their child to attend and we want as many parents as possible to be able to send their child to their preferred school.

<a name="stpa_115">We have introduced a number of measures to make it easier for the best schools to expand in line with parental demand including making dedicated capital funding available for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools. Schools wishing to expand must follow a statutory process&#151;consulting interested parties and publishing a statutory notice. The final decision is taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or an independent Schools Adjudicator. Our guidance to SOCs and adjudicators makes it clear that there is a presumption in favour of approving proposals to expand a successful and popular school.

 There is no national limit for secondary school classes as there is for infant classes of five, six and seven-year-olds. The average size of secondary school classes taught by one teacher nationally is 21.7. In Hertfordshire the average is 20.8. Only 8.7 per cent. of Hertfordshire&#039;s secondary classes have more than 30 pupils and there are no classes at all above 35 pupils.

In terms of resourcing schools in Hertfordshire, in 2005&#150;06 Hertfordshire have had an increase in their School Formula Spending Share of 5.5 per cent. per pupil.

Local authorities were given their funding allocations for children&#039;s centres in early April. The Department has not estimated how much additional funding will be given to children&#039;s centres from sources other than public funds. However centres will provide services that have grown from a range of existing provisions which have a number of funding streams eg health services, Jobcentre-Plus, family support and early education.

Notes:<br>

1. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels the operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>

2. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; administration error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls (i.e., the data is ungrossed).<br>

2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes, so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>

4. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and 



how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

 Following the publication in February 2004 of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#039;s clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems, we advised all primary care trusts (PCTs) to offer a minimum of one cycle of &quot;in-vitro fertilisation&quot; (IVF) by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria, and to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term. The survey of PCTs, conducted by the National Infertility Awareness Campaign and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Infertility, published on 1 April 2005, indicates that good progress is being made towards a minimum national level of provision of one cycle of IVF to eligible patients.
