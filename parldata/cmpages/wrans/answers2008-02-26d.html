 There is currently no sensitive and reliable diagnostic test for bovine TB in live badgers in the field. Bovine TB is most reliably detected by post mortem examination or by the less sensitive method of taking clinical samples (for example, blood, urine, tracheal swabs and faeces) from anaesthetised live badgers. Tissue samples are then confirmed by culture <i> of Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i> M. bovis</i> ) in the laboratory. However, <i> M. bovis</i><i> </i>grows very slowly so culture results can take six weeks to several months to come through. Various blood tests can be used to measure the immune response to bovine TB, one of which takes about 30 minutes, and has about 80 per cent. sensitivity in detecting severely infected animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="80226w0001.htm_para3"><a name="08022649000047">The drawback of these tests for live badgers is the need to anaesthetise the badger in order to sample it, hence they are suitable for research purposes only.</p>

 National and local government and police forces work closely to achieve a high reporting standard for road accident data. Very few, if any, fatal accidents do not become known to the police. However, research conducted on behalf of the Department has shown that an appreciable proportion of non-fatal injury accidents are not reported to the police. There is no legal duty in Great Britain to report personal injury road accidents to the police, provided the participants exchange details at the scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="80226w0002.htm_para9"><a name="08022664000065">Research has also shown that pedal cycle casualties are underrepresented in the road accident data (STATS19). In particular, accidents in which the pedal cyclist is the only participant are not likely to be reported to the Police. Recent research using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) shows that many accidents not recorded in the police data are the result of a person (often a child) falling from a bicycle with no other vehicle involved.</p>

 If, as we understand, such devices are likely to be used mainly as an alternative to walking or cycling then their potential in terms of congestion relief and of carbon emission reduction is likely to be minimal. No detailed assessment of legislative requirements has been made but primary legislation would need to be amended to permit their use on public footpaths or on the pedestrian footway alongside the public highway. There is provision in section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 that would allow the Secretary of State to permit by way of an order their use on the vehicular part of the public highway. The Secretary of State has no plans to make such an order. The Secretary of State has had no discussions with her EU counterparts on this subject.</p>

In 2007, the EU presidency did this on more than 20 occasions in both meetings and public statements. The EU has issued two further declarations on the death penalty in Iran already this year. We also discuss human rights issues bilaterally with Iranian officials in London and Tehran. In the last 12 months we have raised serious concerns about the use of death penalty on seven separate occasions.

<i> [holding answer 25 February 2008]:</i> Assessment of the 101 service in the initial live areas found that the service has successfully improved public access to and satisfaction in community safety services. Through greater partnership working and better information from the public about what problems are happening where, the 101 service has helped local police and councils to target their resources more effectively and efficiently and improve the delivery of those services to the public. We welcome Sir Ronnie Flanagan's endorsement of these benefits in the final report of his review of policing, particularly in support of better neighbourhood management.</p>

It is for this reason that we will be continuing to provide funding for the national 101 infrastructure, as well as providing a tool kit to help local areas to improve local services and develop locally funded 101 services where possible.</p>

 The Government will consider carefully the findings of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs when it submits its advice in late April 2008.

 We have no plans to make membership of a gang, in and of itself, an offence. The Sentencing Guidelines Council has already declared that, where an offender operates in a group or gang, this should be regarded as an aggravating factor, indicative of a higher than usual level of culpability, to be taken into account in sentencing (Guideline on Overarching Principles: Seriousness, 16 December 2004).</p>

The latest analysis, from the 2006-07 BCS, shows victims of crime were more likely to report that crime and fear of crime had a high or moderate impact on their quality of life than those who had not been victims. This analysis can be found in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin Crime in England and Wales 2006-07, a copy of which can be found in the House of Commons Library.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 February 2008]:</i> Overall, since 2003 there has been a reduction in long term vacancy rates in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West, and they are broadly on trajectory. For a number of years up to 2003 vacancy rates in the North West were increasing. However, since 2004 the vacancy rate trend in the North West shows a marked improvement. We expect long term vacancy rates in housing market renewal pathfinder areas both in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West to fall as they move into the next phase of their interventions.</p>

 The latest assessment of progress towards Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 is included in the annual &#147;State of the World&#146;s Children Report&#148; by the United Nations Children&#146;s Fund (UNICEF) published in January 2008. Overall in 2006, global child deaths reached a record low of 9.7 million, down from 13 million in 1990. The report showed that solid progress has been made in a number of countries such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_573"><a name="80226w0019.htm_para5"><a name="0802273000158">The report also highlighted that a concentrated push is required to accelerate progress in West Africa and parts of Asia to cut child deaths. MDG 4 is inextricably linked to MDG 5 (to improve maternal health) as 40 per cent. of children under the age of five are dying within a few days of birth. This is why the Prime Minister has called for 2008 to be a year of action towards meeting the MDGs especially those concerned with child mortality (MDG 4) and maternal health (MDG 5), which remain the most off-track.</p>

 The vast majority of pharmacy students already study the subject as a first degree rather than as an equivalent or lower level qualification. The redistribution of &#163;100 million by 2010 would enable the same number of pharmacy students to be funded as now but with even more studying the subject as a first degree. In that way we will increase and widen participation which is our top priority. We also value those who have already got a first HE qualification and who want to retrain in a different subject. There will be opportunities for them available, for example, through Foundation Degrees and employer co-funded provision.</p>

The first such review should take place starting in December 2008, in the light of entry data for the 2008/09 academic year. That would be an opportunity to have another look at pharmacy and other subjects in the light of the data that will then be available.</p>

 The Government&#146;s student finance package is designed to ensure that finance should not be a barrier to a higher education course. Student loans from the Government are not like commercial loans: interest is paid at the rate of inflation, so in real terms students only pay back what they borrowed. For income contingent loans available since 1998, repayment is linked to earnings and borrowers only repay if their earnings are over &#163;15,000; from April 2012 they will be able to take up to five years &#145;Repayment Holiday&#146; and those taking out a student loan from 2006 have their debt cancelled after 25 years.</p>

In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one.

Following a tender exercise, carried out by the national cancer action team, nine training centres have been selected and were appointed in January 2008. The pilot is due to run for a period of 18 months with an evaluation being carried out towards the end of the project. The evaluation will make recommendations for the future and among the success criteria will be patient outcomes and satisfaction, the competency of surgical training, assessment, accreditation and value for money.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="3"><i> Notes:</i><br>
<i> FCE</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
Cancer treatments i.e. radiotherapy and chemotherapy could take place in other settings, for example a patient could be classed as a &#145;regular attender&#146; or these treatments may occur in out-patients.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
Primary diagnosis codes used for cancer and neoplasms: C00-D48<br>
<i> Secondary Diagnoses</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care, Secondary diagnosis codes used for Radiotherapy session: Z51.0<br>
Secondary diagnosis codes used for Chemotherapy session: Z51.1<br>
<i> Changes to Coding Classifications&#151;OPCS4</i><br>
Operative procedure codes were revised for 2006-07. 2006-07 data use OPCS4.3 codes, whereas earlier data use OPCS4.2 codes. All codes that were in OPCS4.2 remain in OPCS4.3, however the OPCS4.3 codes enable the recording of interventions and procedures which were not possible in OPCS4.2. In particular OPCS 4.3 codes additionally includes high cost drugs and diagnostic imaging, testing and rehabilitation. You may also find that some activity may have been coded under different codes in OPCS4.2. These changes need to be borne in mind when analysing time series and may explain any growth over time. More information about OPCS4 changes are available on the Connecting for Health website www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk.<br>
<i> Main Procedure/Intervention</i><br>
The main procedure/intervention is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode.<br>
<i> Secondary Procedure</i><br>
As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 (three prior to 2002-03) secondary operation fields in HES that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

1. MIC means minimum inhibitory concentration and is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that will inhibit the visible growth of a micro-organism after overnight incubation. The MICs shown for the specific antimicrobials define the cut-off for resistance to these antimicrobials.<br>
2. Due to variations in the retrieval and confirmation of isolates submitted in different years, the data on resistance prevalence are statistically weighted. This is done to avoid resistance estimates being under representative of sites that have a low retrieval rate and over representative of sites that have a high retrieval rate.<br>

 The Government have prescribed that the annual canvass form that is sent to every household each autumn contains a provision allowing an elector to request a postal vote application form. The Government have expanded the information that is included on the poll card that is sent to electors at an election, and it now includes information about how to apply for a postal vote and the deadline for making a postal vote application at the forthcoming election.</p>

While this increased the amount of data needed when electors completed their forms, this was balanced by the removal of the requirement for a witness signature. The available information suggests that the levels of disallowed postal votes remain low. We will wish to keep the matter under review and to explore the issues involved with the Electoral Commission and Association of Electoral Administrators.</p>

Once the deployment of the system is complete in spring 2008, ViSOR will become the first IT system to be jointly shared across probation, prison and police services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_738"><a name="80226w0034.htm_para2"><a name="08022722000862">Going forward, the newly revised and deliverable NOMIS programme will continue the roll-out of the prison NOMIS database to public prisons. At the same time, the programme will be replacing at-risk case management systems in probation areas, as well as providing a simple read-only database, that will allow staff in both services to have access to important information held on each others' systems to support the management of offenders. In addition, the OASys project, as well as improving the offender risk assessment systems in both prisons and probation, will also provide, for the first time, a single national database of offenders who fall within the agreed scope of offender management.</p>

NOMS has invested &#163;14.5 million since 2003 to help prisoners access accommodation on release.

 Public safety remains paramount and there is no relaxation of standards. The Prison Service Instruction issued in November 2007 identified additional measures to ensure suitable prisoners are allocated to open conditions. This includes: arrangements to ensure that categorisation reviews take place at six monthly intervals for all prisoners in the last 30 months of their sentence; reviews after successful completion of Release on Temporary licence; and that prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months in custody be considered as soon as possible after sentencing.</p>

 Prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) may be considered for release by the independent Parole Board once they have completed the period of imprisonment considered necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence (the tariff period). This period is set in open court by the trial judge when passing sentence. The Parole Board may direct the release of such a prisoner only if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined. The Secretary of State may release such prisoners at any time only if exceptional circumstances exist which justify release on compassionate grounds.</p>

The numbers of self-harm incidents reported here are based on information supplied by prisons through the Prison Service Incident Reporting System. Many self-harm incidents often involve the same individuals, and changing numbers of incidents at different prisons can reflect the movement of such prisoners. Self-harm is a high volume incident that can be subject to technical and recording problems. While the system provides a sensible indication of the scale of self-harm the numbers of incidents should not be treated as absolute.<br>

1. Information has not been provided for the total number of tests that tested positive as this can be calculated by using the percentage of positive tests and the number of tests carried out.<br>
2. There are two types of MDT&#151;random and targeted. The random MDT positive rate is one of the prison service's key performance indicators. Initially, 10 per cent. of every prison's population was tested each month under the random programme, but since 1999 prisons with a population of 400 or above have tested 5 per cent. The reduced level of random testing was expected to be compensated for by an increase in targeted testing. Due to contractual obligations, some contracted out prisons have continued to test at the 10 per cent. random level.<br>

 Acquisition of goods and services in the Prison Service is now undertaken by procurement professionals utilising the national procurement system as part of the process.

 The objectives for completion of sentence plans by offender managers are laid out in the National Standards for the Management of Offenders 2007. The standards specify that offender managers should complete a sentence plan on all offenders under their supervision in the community, and upon those covered by phases 2 and 3 of the roll-out of the Offender Management Model. The standards also specify the time scales for completion and review of sentence plans. A target of 90 per cent. has been set for the timely completion of sentence plans on offenders in the community.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> To ensure that no individual can be identified from statistical tables, we use conventions for the rounding and suppression of very small numbers. All numbers which appear in national tables have been rounded to the nearest 100 if they exceed 1,000 and to the nearest 10 otherwise. Numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive have been suppressed, being replaced in the table by a long dash &#145;&#151;&#146;. It has been necessary to suppress other figures whenever it would be possible to calculate the value of a suppressed number by a means of simple arithmetic. The rule applied in these circumstances has been to suppress the next smallest data item provided its value is strictly less than 20.<br>

<i> [holding answer 22 February 2008]:</i> We published impact assessments on the proposed changes to the child care registration and fee arrangements as part of the consultation exercises. On the registration requirements, our assessment did not show an effect on the supply of childminders as we are making only minor adjustments to the existing arrangements. The new system of regulation will provide Ofsted with the information it needs to determine whether essential standards of child welfare have been met and our proposals were supported by a majority of respondents in our consultation exercise last year.</p>

As we made clear in the impact assessment and the consultation document, we are not proposing to remove the current subsidy for registration and inspection costs and we would intend to phase in changes to the fee arrangements over three years, with the changes not complete until 2010. Local authorities are required to secure sufficient childcare available to meet the needs of working parents and have allied powers to assist providers. The fees consultation exercise closed on 20 February 2008 and we will carefully consider all the responses before publishing the Government's response in the spring.</p>

planning around an individual child or children. While the use of FGCs is for local authorities or other agencies to determine in individual cases, the Government have taken steps to encourage their use where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_813"><a name="80226w0045.htm_para0"><a name="08022722003782">The Government&#146;s statutory guidance &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; explains how FGCs can be used as part of systems to plan for children in need and to help in safeguarding children. It is clear that, where there are plans to use FGCs in situations where there are concerns about possible harm to a child, they should be developed and implemented under the auspices of the Local Safeguarding Children Board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_814"><a name="80226w0045.htm_para1"><a name="08022722003783">FGCs are specifically commended in the revised Children Act 1989 Court Orders statutory guidance, published earlier this year, and included in the practice flowchart. In all applications for care proceedings, local authorities will be required to show what efforts have been made to enable the child to live with wider family and friends. An FGC would be an excellent means for a local authority to demonstrate how they have fulfilled this duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_815"><a name="80226w0045.htm_para2"><a name="08022722003784">An FGC is a complex service to provide and requires high levels of skill and competence. We have responded to concerns from stakeholders that there is a lack of skill and knowledge available in the field to deliver effective family group conference services. For this reason, we announced in &#147;Care Matters: Time for Change&#148; that we would fund a programme of regional training events to equip managers and practitioners with the necessary skills to develop and sustain the family group conference model.</p>

 Schools have a statutory duty to promote pupils&#146; well-being. An important contribution to this is developing pupils&#146; social and emotional skills. To help schools do this, the Department is rolling out the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme, a comprehensive whole-school approach which includes a focus on school climate, learning opportunities for whole classes, learning and teaching approaches and continuing professional development for the whole staff of a school. Since the primary SEAL programme was launched in June 2005, over 60 per cent. of primary schools have started to implement SEAL, and we expect the first 15 to 20 per cent. of secondary schools to implement SEAL by July 2008. By July 2011, all schools will have had the opportunity to be supported to implement SEAL.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what research his Department has commissioned on methods used in different schools to tackle bullying; what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of different methods of preventing bullying; and what steps his Department is taking to tackle the causes of bullying in schools.

 The Department has taken a wide range of measures to tackle the causes of bullying and is providing around &#163;1.7 million for anti-bullying programmes this year. Through the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme, we are developing skills in pupils including empathy, a sense of social responsibility and assertiveness which directly contribute to a school climate in which bullying cannot thrive.</p>

We are currently preparing further advice on how to prevent and tackle the bullying of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

The Education and Inspections Act 2006 also provides head teachers with the power, to such extent as is reasonable, to regulate the conduct of pupils when they are off-site or not under the control or charge of a member of staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_826"><a name="80226w0048.htm_para2"><a name="08022722005454">We have issued the Anti-Bullying Charter, which includes a detailed list of questions for the school community to consider when formulating its anti-bullying policy. We have worked with and funded a number of partners, including the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), who arrange the annual Anti-Bullying Week and provide a range of advice and support to local authorities; ParentLine Plus, who run a helpline for parents whose children are being bullied and provide other resources through their &#145;Be Someone to Tell&#146; campaign; and ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) who currently run peer mentoring schemes for the Department. We also fund awards for anti-bullying work as part of the Princess Diana Memorial Awards scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_827"><a name="80226w0048.htm_para3"><a name="08022722005455">We have asked the National Strategies and Anti-Bullying Alliance to work with schools and local authorities to ensure the guidance is effectively implemented on the ground and we are monitoring this very closely. We have also asked the National Strategies to provide challenge and support to those schools which have been identified as weak or ineffective in their approach to dealing with bullying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_828"><a name="80226w0048.htm_para4"><a name="08022722005456">My Department has gone out to tender on research into the effectiveness of anti-bullying strategies. This should help inform any further development of Government policy in this area as well as helping schools decide which anti-bullying strategies are most effective in a range of circumstances. Our partners in the Anti-Bullying Alliance, and the National Strategies work at a local level to advise schools on their anti-bullying policies and monitor the implementation of the various anti-bullying strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_857"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para6"><a name="08022722005611">Improving progression towards further and higher education and encouraging young people to continue learning for longer is vital to improve the life chances of young people and meet our economic needs. The total number of 16 to 18-year-olds in education and training increased by 15,500 to 1,547,000 at end 2006, the highest number ever. The 14-19 reforms&#151;outlined in the &#145;14-19 Education and Skills Implementation Plan&#146; (2005) and &#145;Raising Expectations: staying in education and training post-16&#146; (March 2007) are designed to encourage more young people to continue learning for longer and to gain the qualifications they need to progress to further and higher education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_858"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para7"><a name="08022722005612">Last month the Government published &#147;World Class Apprenticeships: Unlocking Talent, Building Skills for All&#148;. It set out a wide range of steps which will improve apprenticeships for the future and ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all qualified young people by 2013. This will play a major part in raising the participation age in learning to age 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_859"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para8"><a name="08022722005613">We also aim to increase participation in higher education (HE) towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30, with growth of at least 1 percentage point every two years to 2010/11. In November 2006 the then Department for Education and Skills published &#147;Widening participation in higher education&#148;. It showed the policies being pursued in four areas&#151;raising educational attainment, raising aspirations, improving applications and admissions, and measuring performance&#151;which individually and collectively help to encourage and enable people from a wider range of backgrounds to go on to HE. Since the publication of &#147;Widening participation in higher education&#148; my Department has announced that the successful Aimhigher initiative will continue for another three years in its efforts to raise young people's attainment and aspirations and improve their progression. The Government have also launched nine regionally-based excellence hubs&#151;university partnerships which are delivering a national programme of outreach opportunities for gifted and talented learners, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_860"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para9"><a name="08022722005614">The Government are convinced that there is much to be gained by encouraging stronger partnerships between schools and universities and wants every secondary school to have a university partner. To that end, last year the Department for Children, Schools and Families and my Department jointly published &#147;Academies, Trusts and Higher Education: prospectus&#148; which sets out one way in which universities can work more closely with schools to create a better understanding of HE, encourage a wider range of applicants and ensure young people are properly equipped to make the most of HE.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the Youth Opportunity Fund and Youth Capital Fund, with particular reference to hard-to-reach and disadvantaged children and young people who are not involved in formal organisations.

 The Youth Opportunity and Capital Funds (YOF and YCF) were established in April 2006 as complementary, universal funds operating under a single management framework. The funds demonstrate how innovative and creative young people can be when they are truly empowered, delivering a wide range of high quality projects and activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_865"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para14"><a name="08022722005662">Interim findings from the independent evaluation of the funds were published in July 2007: Research report number DCSF-RR004 is available on the DCSF's website. The research found that the funds were meeting their objective to give young people a voice through consultation and control over resources. Local authorities had involved young people in the design and development of the funds, with young people involved as decision-makers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_866"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para15"><a name="08022722005663">Overall, around 570,000 young people have benefited directly from the funds. In addition, management information shows that over a third of the young people involved as decision makers or project leaders were from traditionally disadvantaged groups. The guidance for the funds is clear that particular care should be taken to encourage those groups who face barriers to participation. This includes young people from low income families, young disabled people, young care leavers, looked after young people, young offenders, young carers, young refugees, young lesbians and gay men, young black and minority ethnic people, travellers and those in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_867"><a name="80226w0049.htm_para16"><a name="08022722005664">On the basis of this evidence it was agreed in comprehensive spending review 2007 that the funds should continue until at least 2011, at the current rates of funding with an additional &#163;25 million of new investment being made available in the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
