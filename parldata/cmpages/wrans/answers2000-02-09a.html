To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what average saving in energy consumption he estimates would be made if new houses were constructed using best available techniques for energy conservation in place of the requirements of current building regulations.  [108019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 New dwellings might have an annual energy consumption for space heating and hot water around half that of dwellings built in compliance with current building regulations if built using best available techniques that take account of factors such as capital and running costs, buildability and environmental costs.

<BR>
I have been asked by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the provision of a pedestrian crossing on the A36 trunk road at South Newton as these are operational matters for the Highways Agency.
<BR>
A written representation was received from Wiltshire County Council last December asking the Agency seriously to consider a pedestrian crossing at South Newton. In addition, Mr. West, a County Councillor for the area, has also asked orally for a pedestrian crossing to be provided there.
<BR>
The reason for providing a crossing is that a large part of the village is cut of from the village shop by a heavy traffic flow, and there have been personal injury accidents involving pedestrians crossing the A36 at this point. When taken together, these factors support the case for the provision of a crossing.
<BR>
A signal controlled crossing is to be provided and detail design work is programmed to commence in Spring of this year. We expect the crossing to be operational by Winter 2000. The estimated cost of this scheme is &#163;30,000.

<a name="00209w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 131-32W, on airline accidents, if new boundaries for public safety zones at airports were defined following the receipt of the advice from NATS Ltd.  [108215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We have accepted NATS' advice that it is feasible to base public safety zone boundaries on risk contours around airports, and NATS are well advanced with the detailed work to redefine the boundaries for us on this basis. We hope to bring the new boundaries into effect, together with guidance to local planning authorities, in the spring.

<a name="00209w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Fearn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had concerning the Open Skies policy in relation to regional airports in England and Wales during <i>(a)</i> this parliamentary session and <i>(b)</i> the last parliamentary session.  [108634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In June 1998 we offered to bilateral partners with whom we did not already have liberal agreements unrestricted third/fourth freedom access to all UK regional airports, as long as UK airlines were also allowed to operate on the same routes. Some 17 countries have accepted the offer and it has been discussed in virtually all air services negotiations held since June 1998.

<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Lepper: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the proposals to be put forward by <i>(a)</i> Japan, <i>(b)</i> Norway and <i>(c)</i> other states on whales and whaling to the forthcoming meeting of the parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, indicating the position of Her Majesty's Government in relation to these proposals.  [108492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Japan and Norway have put forward four proposals to downlist whale populations to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). These are the North-east Atlantic and North Atlantic Central, the West Pacific and Southern Hemisphere stocks of Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and the Eastern North Pacific stocks of Grey whales (Eshrichtuis robustus.) We have already made clear to both countries our opposition to these proposals on the grounds that they would undermine the moratorium on commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW). This position was endorsed by the majority of EU member states at a recent informal meeting of EU experts.
<P>

<a name="00209w01.html_para1">The meeting of experts, which acts as a precursor to the formation of a common EU position through the Council of Ministers, also considered three resolutions concerning the relationship between CITES and the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are two 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 153W</I><P>
competing resolutions: one from Japan, that seeks to weaken the primacy of the IWC in the field of managing and conserving whale stocks; and one from the United States, which underscores existing arrangements. In addition there is a simple consolidation of all extant CITES resolutions on whaling proposed by the CITES Secretariat. The majority of member states agreed that the EU should seek the withdrawal of the US and Japanese proposals in favour of the simple consolidation of resolutions which will preserve the existing arrangements between the two Conventions.

<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will issue guidance to local authorities on allowing housing in cases where a woman has left the area in which she was living as a result of domestic violence and has moved to a different authority area; and if he will make a statement.  [108727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 People who are fleeing domestic violence are regarded as homeless by virtue of sections 175 and 177 of the Housing Act 1996. Authorities should consider whether applicants are vulnerable as a result of having suffered violence or abuse from a person with whom they 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 154W</I><P>
are associated. If so, they will have a priority need for accommodation. When discharging their duties under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1996, authorities must have regard to how suitable the location of that accommodation is. Threats of violence would clearly be a factor in their decision making.
<P>

<a name="00209w01.html_para4">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions revised draft Code of Guidance on the Allocation of Accommodation and Homelessness, due to be published in the Spring, gives clear messages to local authorities about the approach they might take where women need to leave their home because of domestic violence. It also encourages authorities to refer to the voluntary Inter-Borough Agreement on out-of-area- placements of homeless households in the private rented sector, which has been agreed between member authorities of the Association of London Government. This sets out a framework for co-operation and consultation between member authorities. Although this addresses the particular context of London, the principle and policies advocated apply equally across all areas where there is a need for out-of-area placement.

 The Health and Safety Laboratory is currently in negotiations with a preferred bidder under PFI to rationalise its estate. This involves locating the Laboratory on a single site at Buxton. If Ministers are satisfied that the final proposals represent value for money, approval will be given. A decision on the project is due in Summer 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact on the stock of affordable homes of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Court of Appeal's judgment does not affect the supply of affordable homes. However, it is likely to affect the ability of some tenants to afford rent increases which would have been capped under the Order.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact on rents of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions ex parte Spath Holme Limited that the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 (SI 1999 No. 6) was ultra vires.  [108784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew5"><B>  Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The judgment is likely to lead to significant increases in fair rents that would have been capped under the Order. The impact will vary between regions. However, provisional analysis of rents registered by rent officers in England and Wales shows an average difference between the amount capped under the Order and the uncapped amount of &#163;5.61 per week.

[108786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has no powers to intervene to prevent disproportionate increases in rent. It is for rent officers and rent assessment committees to decide whether and by how much to increase the rent for tenancies registered under Part IV and Part VI of the Rent Act 1977. They must follow the rules set out in Section 70 of the Act and have regard to leading court judgments on the assessment of a fair rent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the potential impact on business associated with each of the following planned deregulation proposals (a) the disposal of houses by local authorities in England, (b) amending section 7 of the Building Act 1984 and (c) eligibility to drive a private hire vehicle outside London.  [108776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> A consultation exercise was carried out last year on the proposal concerning the disposal of houses by local authorities in England. Following this, an assessment of the potential impact on business has been produced, and is currently under consideration.
<P>

<a name="00209w02.html_para0">The proposals to amend Section 7 of the Building Act 1984 arose from proposals made by the Better Regulation Task Force. A forthcoming consultation will seek to identify the impact of amending Section 7, and this will be fully assessed by means of a Regulatory Impact Assessment prior to making a deregulation order.
<P>

<a name="00209w02.html_para1">The issues surrounding the eligibility to drive a private hire vehicle outside London are being considered in the light of consultation responses from business and other interested parties. If these result in a deregulation order, Cabinet Office guidance on making such an order will be followed. This guidance requires that a Regulatory Impact Assessment be produced.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the economic impact associated with each of the following deregulation orders and contracting out orders on business (a) the Deregulation (Parking Equipment) Order 1996, (b) the Deregulation (Motor Vehicles Tests) Order 1996, (c) the Deregulation (Building) (Initial Notices and Final Certificates) Order 1996, (d) the Deregulation (Exchangeable Driving Licences) Order 1998 and (e) the Deregulation (Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles) Order 1998.  [108775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 [holding answer 7 February 2000]: The five listed orders were laid prior to the requirement, introduced in August 1998, to produce Regulatory Impact Assessments looking at all economic impacts of proposals. At that time, Compliance Cost Assessments were required, but only for proposals expected to impose costs. Since, under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, deregulation orders are not allowed to impose burdens, no such assessments were prepared in these cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what options for additional capacity on the Thameslink rail route have been proposed since June 1999; and what is the timetable for such options.  [109108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The loan of four class 317 units from WAGN and two class 319 units from Connex has resulted in longer trains on Thameslink services, providing 3,900 extra seats per week, and an extra train path from 26 September 1999. The SSRA are currently evaluating proposals for new rolling stock and further additional train paths on the Bedford to London section of the route. They are also investigating other options for additional capacity on this section. The earliest any further additional capacity could be provided by the acquisition of new rolling stock is September 2001.

Similar regulations dealing with new buses and coaches used on local and scheduled services will be introduced this year. The regulations cover a wide range of features which will improve access for older people as well as for disabled people: for example, improved handrails which will benefit those with poor dexterity and the use of colour and tonal contrasts to assist those with low vision.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the outcome of the Montreal conference on the Biosafety Protocol.  [109081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Montreal conference, at which I represented the United Kingdom Government, was a success. Countries throughout the world agreed by consensus on 29 January to adopt the Biosafety Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. We achieved our goal of securing a Protocol that is robust in protecting biodiversity, and effective and workable for those who have obligations under it.
<P>

<a name="00209w03.html_para34">The Protocol will ensure that developing and developed countries alike will be able to take informed decisions, on the basis of scientific information including a risk assessment, about whether to import certain living (genetically) modified organisms (LMOs) that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. In the absence of scientific certainty, due to insufficient scientific information and knowledge, and consistent with Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration, countries will be able to take such decisions on import on a precautionary basis in order to avoid or minimise any potential adverse effects, and to take into account the impact of LMOs on the value of biodiversity to indigenous and local communities.
<P>

<a name="00209w03.html_para35">Where importing countries lack a domestic regulatory framework for taking decisions on the import of LMOs, they will be able to do so under the Protocol. In the case of LMOs intended for intentional introduction into the environment, this will be on the basis of information provided in advance by the exporter. In the case of LMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing, importing countries without domestic legislation will be able to take decisions on the basis of information provided through a clearing-house mechanism established under the Protocol.
<P>

<a name="00209w03.html_para36">Further provisions in the Protocol lay down minimum documentation requirements for LMOs moving between countries. These requirements are categorised according to whether the LMO is intended for intentional introduction into the environment, for contained use, for direct use as food or feed, or for processing, or for other purposes. The Protocol also requires work to be undertaken on the options for a regime for liability and redress to be completed within four years of its entry into force.
<P>

<a name="00209w03.html_para37">The effectiveness of the Protocol in achieving its objective of contributing to biosafety is strengthened by specific recognition that trade and environment agreements should be mutually supportive with a view to achieving sustainable development.




<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 160W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00209w03.html_para38">The Protocol is a significant step forward in ensuring proper evaluation of any risk to biodiversity from the transboundary movement of LMOs that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health. It will complement national and regional law in many parts of the world and enable other countries to benefit from experience elsewhere, including the United Kingdom and Europe, and to protect their biological diversity.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the value of that part of the contract between the Ministry of Defence and Shorts Missile Systems that will be spent in the United Kingdom.

I presume both questions refer to the High Velocity Missile contract placed on 6 December 1999. The value of that part of this contract that will be spent in the United Kingdom is 98% of the overall contract cost which as stated in the press release is around &#163;200M. I am afraid that I am unable to let you know how many missiles have been ordered as it is considered that the release of this information would be harmful to our national security interests and would also be in breach of a third party's commercial confidences.

 The land at Thiepval barracks was last subject to a major review in 1997. The resulting report contained classified information regarding the layout of the barracks and proposed development.

<P>
<a name="00209w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As part of my Department's on-going efforts to reduce overstretch in the Army, I am pleased to announce that a contract has been let to provide for less manpower-intensive and more modern communications equipment in the Balkans. The contract, with BAe Systems, will provide for wide area communications in support of the UK's contribution to the NATO Multi National Divisions in Bosnia and Kosovo. While maintaining the UK's responsibility to NATO's peacekeeping forces, it will enable us to bring home some 150 Royal Signals personnel by the end of the year. It is also an excellent example of the SMART Procurement Initiative by demonstrating the advantages of working closely together with industry to deliver the equipment our front-line troops need. The contract is specific to the Balkans theatre of operations and does not affect the Army's wider communications requirements. The cost of this equipment will be met from the Contingency Reserve.

 The terms and conditions with regard to publicity about research projects undertaken by contractors on behalf of the Home Office vary depending upon the detailed circumstances of the contract. As a rule, research contracts with the Home Office require contractors not to make public statements concerning the work without the prior consent of the Department. In practice, this usually means that contractors do not discuss findings of research before publication but are free to do so afterwards. I am committed to ensuring that any research commissioned by my Department is published once it has been properly validated (save in subject areas where the protection of national security or the prevention of serious crime require that the research can only be used for internal purposes). I have agreed a protocol with my Director of Research governing the publication of the Home Office research reports. I have placed a copy in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has taken to ensure that current overstayers will not lose the right to a suspensive appeal against a decision to remove them taken after 1 October.  [109544]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Section 9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides for a minimum three month period during which overstayers can apply to regularise their immigration status. If they do so, and the application is refused after the new removal procedures are implemented, the old procedures will apply to their case after 1 October and a suspensive right of appeal will be retained.
<P>

<a name="00209w05.html_para2">The Immigration (Regularisation Period for Overstayers) Regulations 2000 came into force on Tuesday 8 February. The period runs from now until 1 October 2000, which is the day before the Human Rights Act 1998 is expected to come into force, and thus lasts for a minimum of almost eight months.
<P>

<a name="00209w05.html_para3">I shall shortly write to all Members, giving details of the scheme and how an application should be made under it. I shall place copies of the information leaflet we have produced in the Library.

<P>

<a name="00209w05.html_para4">The scheme is solely intended to retain a suspensive right of appeal to the Immigration Appellate Authority for those overstayers who make a specific application to us during the period. It is by no means an amnesty: the same considerations apply whether an application under the scheme is made or not. All overstayers should be aware that a decision to remove them from the United Kingdom is, and will, remain the normal response to their unlawful behaviour. Only when the compassionate circumstances outweigh the public interest in maintaining an effective immigration control will we allow them to remain.

<P>
<a name="00209w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Refuges are funded by a range of sources, rather than directly by central Government. In some cases, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, through the Housing Corporation, provides capital and revenue funding. Other income comes from the rents paid by users (who may be relying on Housing Benefit support), local authorities, charities, trusts, private donations and their own fund-raising activities. Some refuge projects work in partnership with Housing Associations. Because of this the information requested is not available.

Ultimately, it is for the Home Secretary to lay an Order before Parliament setting out any changes, but before doing so we shall wish to consult the British Shooting Sports Council for their views.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he has taken to improve the efficiency of police firearms licensing departments in respect of the criticisms made in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary report in 1993.  [108820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In the years immediately following the publication of their 1993 Report on Firearms Licensing, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) paid particular attention to firearms licensing departments during their inspection of individual forces, having regard to the shortcomings identified in the report. In general, HMIC was satisfied that most forces had taken those steps identified by the Inspectorate to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in this area.
<P>

<a name="00209w06.html_para0">Since the publication of the 1993 Inspection Report, there has been considerable change in the field of firearms licensing following the tragic events at Dunblane and the subsequent legislation. There have also been wider changes, for example in the role and effectiveness of computer systems. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is, therefore, drawing up new inspection protocols for firearms licensing departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 599W, on his proposals to restrict the right to elect trial by jury, <i>(a)</i> if it is his intention to allow (i) either the prosecution or defence, or both, to petition the Crown court for an oral hearing of an appeal against the determination of mode of trial by magistrates, where an oral hearing is not requested by the judge and (ii) only circuit judges to hear appeals in the Crown court against the determination of mode of trial by magistrates, and <i>(b)</i> if the prosecution and defence will be able to adduce additional evidence, over and above that presented to the magistrates, during the course of an appeal to the Crown court against the determination of mode of trial by magistrates, and if they will be able to call witnesses and expert witnesses to give oral testimony.  [109208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> The appeal would be a re-hearing by a circuit judge of the magistrates decision. It would be open to either of the parties to seek an oral hearing in the notice of appeal, and it would be for the discretion of the judge whether to allow an oral hearing to take place. It would also be for his discretion whether to allow the parties to adduce further evidence (including, in the unlikely event that it would be necessary, evidence from expert or other witnesses) in support of their representations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 599W, what parts of criminal proceedings in the Crown Court may at present be heard in chambers by a single judge; what estimate he has made of the number of Crown Court sitting days that would be taken up by the hearing of appeals against the determination of mode of trial by magistrates, what items are included in the cost of (i) a written and (ii) an oral appeals; and on what basis he reached his estimate of the number of defendants who would appeal against magistrates' decisions on mode of trial.  [109209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> Business which may be heard in chambers by a single judge (pursuant to Crown Court Rule 27) includes applications for bail and for the extension of time-limits, and appeals against the decision of magistrates on those issues. In estimating the cost of appeals against mode of trial, the generous assumptions have been made that in 25 per cent. of cases the defendant might appeal, and that 17.5 per cent. of cases will require an oral hearing. In total, less than 650 judicial hours would be spent on these appeals per year. The costs have been based on court time, prosecution costs and legal aid standard fee rates. The reply I gave to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), on 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 599W, contained a typographical error: it is estimated the number of defendants who would appeal is 3,000, and not 3,900 as stated.

 I have today signed with the Minister of the Interior of Hungary, Dr. Sandor Pinter, a Memorandum of Understanding on Co-operation in Combating Illicit Drug Trafficking, Organised Crime, International Terrorism and Illegal Immigration. The agreement provides a framework within which law enforcement agencies and prosecuting authorities in our two countries can develop their close working relations in preventing, detecting and investigating all forms of serious and organised national and international crime. It is an important step forward in combating the common threat from criminal activity both within and beyond Europe.

[109669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The new powers of entry, search and seizure will come into force on 14 February 2000. In accordance with section 145 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, a Direction has been made which will ensure that immigration officers exercising these powers, and their existing powers of arrest under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, must have regard to the relevant 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 172W</I><P>
provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Codes of Practice. A copy of the Direction is being placed in the Library. It is also being sent to members of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) User Panel and will be made available more widely via the IND website.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para0">The use of the new powers will be restricted initially to a team of immigration officers involved in a joint pilot scheme with the Metropolitan police. This pilot scheme will enable the powers to be tested in the operational arena before more widespread use of the powers is considered.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the results of police forces' bids for funding from the Crime Fighting Fund to recruit police officers.  [109672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 All 43 police forces in England and Wales bid for a share of the Crime Fighting Fund to recruit 5,000 police officers over and above the number they had otherwise planned to recruit over the next three years commencing April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para1">The total number of officers which forces bid for came to 8,220. As all forces meet the gateway criteria set out in the Bidding Guidelines, I have, in allocating funding for the 5,000 officers between forces, taken into account the information which they provided in support of their bids.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para2">The table shows the number of police recruits each force has bid for, the number they have been allocated in each year of the scheme and in total, and the funding each will receive in year one of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para3">The numbers of officers in years two and three are provisional at this stage. They are dependent on forces meeting the continuation criteria for benefiting from the Fund in those years.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para4">Forces tell us that, without the additional resources from the fund, they are planning to recruit a total of 12,478 police officers (new recruits to the service) in the three years commencing in April 2000. Their estimates reflect the decisions they and their police authorities have made about the way in which they will use the resources available to them next year, and the assumptions they have made about funding and budget levels in the two following years which have yet to be settled. The money from the Crime Fighting Fund will be used to recruit 5,000 officers over and above the number forces plan to recruit over the three-year period.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the number of police officers in each police force area in England and Wales, and in total, for the latest available date; and, if he will list the total number of <i>(a)</i> police officers and <i>(b)</i> civilian support staff in England and Wales for each year from 1990.  [109673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The information is set out in the tables. At the end of September 1999, the total number of police officers in England and Wales was 125,464. The number of officers in the 43 forces (excluding officers seconded to the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and central service) was 123,050. At the end of September 1999 there were 53,254 civilian support staff in the police service.

<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 174W</I><P>
Constabulary and including representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities on the re-classification of police service personnel. The Working Group recommended that greater recognition should be given to the important contribution that civilian support staff make to operational policing. Civilian staff now account for 30 per cent. of total police service personnel.
<P>

<a name="00209w07.html_para7">From March 2000, police service staff will be categorised within three bands as (a) operational, (b) operational support, or (c) organisational support. The new information, to be collected annually by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, will provide a more accurate reflection of the deployment of all police service personnel.

 We continue to receive disturbing reports of human rights violations against ethnic minorities from many parts of Burma. These violations include arbitrary killings, rape, torture, mass arrests, forced labour and forced relocations. We take every opportunity to condemn these violations: for example, the UK co-sponsored the UN General Assembly resolution adopted last November which contains strong condemnation of the appalling catalogue of human rights violations in Burma, including against ethnic minorities.

 We take every opportunity to raise with the Burmese authorities our concerns about the violations of human rights of ethnic minorities, including the Karen people. We support the work of the UN agencies, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' work on Burma's Western border and UN Development Programme's projects in ethnic minority areas all over Burma. We also support the international non- governmental organisations working under difficult conditions in many of the ethnic minority areas. In Thailand, we provide humanitarian assistance through the Burma Border Consortium (&#163;270,000 this calendar year). We continue to encourage political dialogue between the Burmese regime and democratic leaders, including ethnic minorities.

 The SPDC have persistently refused any visit to Burma by Judge Lallah, the present UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights. We have co-sponsored resolutions both at the UN Commission on Human Rights and at the UN General Assembly expressing concern at this lack of co-operation. Several UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, are in Burma doing excellent work, but some parts of Burma are not accessible to them, largely because of civil unrest due to the regime's continued oppression of ethnic minorities. We deplore this oppression and call on the regime to enter into a dialogue with democratic groups, including ethnic minorities, to resolve Burma's political impasse.

 Forced labour is one of the key areas of concern in Burma. We condemn it wherever it occurs.

 We fully support the work of the OSCE Mission to Moldova in their efforts to reach a political settlement in the Moldova/Transdniestria conflict. We will continue to press for complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Moldovan territory by the end of 2002, as agreed at the OSCE Istanbul Summit in November 1999. We have provided funding for several projects in support of reaching a settlement including, for example, part-funding a constitutional workshop, attended by members of the Moldovan and Transdniestrian experts groups, in December 1999; and funding a seminar "Living with Conflict--the Role of Local Authorities" in September 1999. We are also funding training of six Moldovan journalists at the BBC, to enhance their reporting skills and to promote balanced media coverage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps Her Majesty's Government have taken to persuade the Government of Guatemala <i>(a)</i> to prosecute the murderers of street youths, with particular reference to murders in which the police are believed to have been involved, and <i>(b)</i> to give better general care and protection to Guatemala's street children.  [109039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We regularly raise human rights concerns generally, and those of street children specifically, with the Government of Guatemala. For example, we have lobbied the Guatemalan Government to enact its Child Code legislation, which would offer greater legal protection to children.
<P>

<a name="00209w09.html_para1">Our Embassy in Guatemala has made a number of inquiries about the state of investigations into the murders or abuse of street children. NGOs working in this area suggest that abuse of street children by state agencies has decreased in the past few years. Street children are more frequently incidental victims of the prevalent violent street crime in Guatemala. There is also an increasing incidence of serious violence between the street children themselves, mostly as a result of an increase in drug trafficking and addiction by and among these children.
<P>

<a name="00209w09.html_para2">The European Union is providing 200 million euros in 1997-2000 towards projects supporting the Peace Programme in Guatemala. The UK's contribution amounts to about &#163;24 million. About a third of the EU funding is dedicated to establishing a National Civil Police Force and strengthening the administration of justice. We expect one consequence of the reform of the police and judiciary to be better treatment of street children. We also indirectly promote human rights and challenge impunity through our support for the UN Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA).
<P>

<a name="00209w09.html_para3">In addition to working with the Guatemalan Government to protect and care for street children, we also provide support directly. In 1999 we gave &#163;13,500 to an NGO, Toybox (known locally as El Castillo), to finance building a hostel for rehabilitating street children outside Guatemala City. In 1998 we gave &#163;75,000 to Toybox for a similar project.

 Domestic violence is an abuse of human rights and cannot be tolerated in a civilised society. Our policy in this area aspires to the eradication of domestic violence in all its forms. The Northern Ireland Regional Forum on Domestic Violence was established in 1995 to bring together Government Departments, other public bodies and voluntary organisations to promote co- operation and liaison in this area. The forum has four main policy aims: to heighten awareness of domestic violence, highlighting domestic assault as a crime, to improve services to victims to challenge perpetrators' attitudes and behaviour and to improve the information base.

(12) Up to 1995-96 the code for "non-NHS institution" included non-NHS hospitals, nursing homes, health care and residential institutions. In 1996-97 the category was sub-divided so that admissions from non-NHS hospitals formed a single classification.<P>

<P>

(13) The definition of "non-NHS run hospital" includes hospices. We cannot disaggregate these data, but it seems probable that a high proportion of the discharges are to hospices.<P>

(14) Figures for 1997-98 are provisional and no adjustments have been made for shortfalls in data.<P>

 We are determined to reduce in-patient and out-patient waiting lists and times. The waiting list is now 87,000 below the level inherited. We remain on track to achieve our manifesto commitment to reduce waiting lists by 100,000 from the level inherited. As waiting lists have fallen, so have waiting times. The average waiting time of those on the list was 12 weeks at the end of November 1999--three weeks less than at June 1998.

<a name="00209w13.html_para1">We are taking action to reduce out-patient waiting times. Patients referred urgently with suspected breast cancer can now be reassured they will not wait longer than two weeks for an out-patient appointment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the circumstances surrounding the establishment by Southend Primary Care Group of a Primary Care Trust with special reference to the recent ballot of general practitioners in the area.  [108871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 [holding answer 7 February 2000]: As indicated in national guidance, the application to establish a Primary Care Trust (PCT) in Southend was considered against national criteria. Local consultation was carried out by South Essex Health Authority in accordance with the requirements set out in the Primary Care Trusts (Consultation on Establishment, Dissolution and Transfer of Staff) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999-2337). The resulting consultation report indicated that broad local support was evident for the Southend PCT application.
<P>

<a name="00209w13.html_para7">A recent letter, which approves the establishment of Southend PCT, clearly sets out an expectation that the PCT will be able to demonstrate an increased level of support and commitment from local general practitioners before becoming operational this April. In addition, all PCTs are expected to ensure that GPs, nurses and other front-line staff are fully engaged and committed to delivering the service improvements that PCT status will attain for their communities.

 In relation to public health, all consignments of fresh meat and poultry meat imported into the UK, whether from other EU member states or third countries, must have been produced in accordance with harmonised Community rules. These rules include the licensing, structural and veterinary supervision requirements to be applied in abattoirs, cutting plants and cold stores. Slaughterhouses in third countries have to comply with hygiene standards at least equivalent to those which apply in the EU before imports can be permitted.
<P>

<a name="00209w14.html_para4">Ensuring that third countries supplying the EU market comply with Community requirements is the responsibility of the European Commission. The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office is responsible for arranging and carrying out inspections in those countries, but national officials can and do report to the Commission on investigations they may have carried out.
<P>

<a name="00209w14.html_para5">All consignments of fresh meat and poultry meat imported from third countries are subject to veterinary checks, including checks on accompanying veterinary health certification, on entering the EU to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and that they have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport.
<P>

<a name="00209w14.html_para6">It would not be compatible with World Trade Organisation rules to ban imports of meat because of the animal welfare standards under which it had been produced. The Government are considering how to promote wider international consensus on farm animal welfare. The EU, with UK support, is seeking greater recognition of farm animal welfare considerations in WTO rules.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> Under the surveillance proposed, State Veterinary Service (SVS) officials will identify the farms on which BSE cases born after 1 January 1996 were born.

 Most food law enforcement is carried out by local authorities, and will continue to be after the Food Standards Agency is established. MAFF is responsible for the enforcement in England and Wales of fresh meat legislation. This is carried out in licensed premises by the Meat Hygiene Service, an executive agency of MAFF that will transfer to the Food Standards Agency. MAFF also enforces dairy hygiene controls at production holdings in England and Wales, and responsibility for this will also transfer to the Agency. MAFF's ongoing responsibilities after the establishment of the Food Standards Agency will continue to include the enforcement of some functions relevant to food safety, in particular on residues of pesticides and veterinary medicines and on animal health, in addition to some enforced by local authorities.

<P>
<a name="00209w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We supported the request by the Danish and Dutch delegations, at the June 1999 Agriculture Council, that the Commission review the operation of the meat inspection system established by the EU Fresh Meat Directive with the aim of basing inspection methods more on risk assessment principles. In response, the Commission undertook to carry out a wide-ranging review of the current meat inspection system. Encouragingly, discussions between my officials and Commission representatives on the ongoing exercise to consolidate and simplify existing EU food and veterinary legislation, including the meat hygiene Directives, have also indicated that the Commission sees risk-based inspection systems as the way forward.
<P>

<a name="00209w16.html_para0">We have also drawn to the Commission's attention the concerns of the farming and meat sectors about over-regulation of the meat slaughtering and processing industries and about the apparent lack of uniformity in individual member states' application of Community rules on charging for meat inspections. We will continue to take every opportunity to press the Commission to modernise meat hygiene controls and to ensure that trade in the EU is carried out on a level playing field.

Much of the rescheduled debt relates to contracts entered into the 1970s and 1980s, when ECGD did not record exposure by the nature of the goods exported. However, recent researches indicate that the amount of debt, all rescheduled, currently owed by HIPCs and which resulted from military sales is only &#163;12.7 million or 0.67 per cent. of the total.

 Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

<a name="00209w18.html_para3">For the periods in question, three private sector staff are recorded as having been seconded to the Department. One was from the Guardian Media Group plc between September 1997 and December 1997, one from Sacker and Partners between October 1997 and February 1998, and the third from CSL Managed Services between August 1999 and February 2000. Other inward secondments of three months or more recorded centrally in the above periods were mainly from local government and other parts of the public sector outside the civil service.

 The State Second Pension is designed for those who are employed, particularly low earners, and those who are unable to work regularly due to caring responsibilities or long-term disability. Individuals will not be able to accrue entitlement to the State Second Pension by virtue of receiving contributory or income-related Jobseeker's Allowance. As with people in other age groups, those in the five years before the statutory retirement age will be able to build up entitlement to the State Second Pension if they have a low income from employed earnings at or above the Lower Earnings Limit, through qualifying caring responsibilities or long-term disability.

As the Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question regarding the number of males and females who are in receipt of the national minimum wage in Amber Valley.
<BR>
Definitive estimates on the number of people that have benefited from the national minimum wage are not yet available. Currently available estimates for assessing the effect take data from both the New Earnings Survey and the Labour Force Survey and adjust them for known limitations in each. However, the latest adjusted estimates are based on data for the spring (March - May) 1999 Labour Force Survey and this period spans the introduction date for the national minimum wage legislation. As a result, the adjusted estimates may be giving a misleading picture of the effect of the minimum wage legislation since employees might legitimately have been earning below the minimum wage rates in March 1999.
<BR>
The currently available estimates were published in an ONS First Release on 14 October and show that the number of people earning below the minimum wage rates fell significantly between 1998 and 1999. A copy of this first release is available in the House of Commons Library.

<BR>
The new Earnings Survey (NES), carried out in April of each year, is a 1 per cent. sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes. It does not capture information relating to the self-employed. However, I am only able to provide estimates of the percentage of employees whose earnings lie within specified ranges, rather than numbers, because appropriate factors to gross the survey results to accommodate this sample frame are not currently available. Additionally, I am unable to provide data for financial years prior to 1997-98 since estimates of annual earnings are not available. Data for the 1999-2000 financial year will be available when the NES 2000 is published in November of this year.

The available information, from the 1998 and 1999 New Earnings Survey, is presented in the attached table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00209w21.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 To calculate the estimated reduction in litigation, the number of claims issued over two period of six months were compared. These were May to October 1998 and May to October 1999. This comparison showed that the total of originating proceedings (excluding family and insolvency) commenced in total declined by 23 per cent. The calculation of the estimated shortfall in fee income was based on a combination of actual income from April to December 1999 and three months of forecast income to March 2000. Income for 2000-01 is expected to be &#163;308 million. The calculated level of new income from the changed fees in a full year has been downgraded by 9 per cent. for 2000-01 to allow for the fact that the higher fees will not apply for the whole of the financial year and a small decline in workload.

Neither is it possible to estimate the benefit to public funds. Although the Compensation Recovery Unit of the Department of Social Security (CRU) will seek to recover any state benefit from the amount of damages paid, the CRU does not record whether monies recovered were in relation to a case supported by legal aid throughout, partially supported by legal aid or financed in another manner, eg with the support of a trade union.

 The Government announced on 27 February 1998 that it accepted in principle the recommendations of the National Heritage Committee. As my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor said in another place on 22 November 1999, <i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> column 169, legislation will be brought forward when Parliamentary time allows. The Lord Chancellor is setting up an interdepartmental working group of officials to review the law relating to the payments to witnesses in criminal proceedings and the publication of information in advance of criminal trials. The review will inform the Government's decisions about the form of legislation required to implement the National Heritage Committee's recommendations. The review will consider how the requirements of the European Convention of Human Rights affect the law of contempt.

 The Cabinet Office began a review of pay and grading delegation within the Civil Service in September 1998. The interim report was published in April 1999 and the findings contributed to the Report on Performance Management, published on 15 December, in support of Sir Richard Wilson's Report to the Prime Minister on Civil Service Reform. The Civil Service will now implement the reform programme and, in particular, the modernisation of its performance management and pay systems.

 Individual Departments and agencies have delegated authority to determine the circumstances when staff may have time off work. Within this framework, Departments and agencies have been consistently encouraged to be sympathetic towards requests for special leave in appropriate circumstances. Last year the Cabinet Office published a resource pack "Managing Attendance in the Public Sector: Putting Best Practice to Work" to help public sector bodies manage attendance in a fair, consistent and supportive way. One of the recommendations was that the public sector organisations should provide or arrange access to welfare and counselling services, and that staff should be encouraged to make full and effective use of those services.

 My Department's policy on recycling materials reflects our overall approach for waste management to reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.
<P>

<a name="00209w22.html_para2">We are currently preparing a sustainable development strategy for greening the Cabinet Office's and its Agencies' operations taking account of Government policies and best practice. This strategy will include waste reduction targets taking account of the Government target

<P><I>9 Feb 2000 : Column: 228W</I><P>
for all Departments to recover a minimum of 40 per cent. of total office waste, with at least 25 per cent. of that recovery coming from recycling or composting in 2000-01. We are undertaking a waste audit and will use the results of the audit to establish baselines, against which the targets can be set and performance measured. The Cabinet Office agencies are similarly working towards the Green Ministers target. We currently recycle paper, cardboard, bottles and cans.
