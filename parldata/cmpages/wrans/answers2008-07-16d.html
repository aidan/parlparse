 The Identity and Passport Service provides, on a regular basis, details of all processed reports of lost, stolen and destroyed British passports to Interpol and the UK Border Agency. It also offers a passport validation service (PVS) to approved organisations that are subject to UK money laundering legislation. PVS enables these organisations to confirm that a British passport, which is presented by the holder to support a transaction, is current and has not been reported lost, stolen or recovered. When applications for passport renewals are received by IPS, there is an automatic check that the expiring passport has not previously been reported lost or stolen. Steps such as these reduce the value of stolen British passports, because they are more likely to be identified should they be used to operate financial services to enable travel or to be used to obtain a new passport in a false identity. This reduces the value and hence demand/sales of lost and stolen British passports.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 15 July 2008]:</i> The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts annual surveys of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. In the North and East of Afghanistan, where security, alternative livelihoods and governance are improving, poppy cultivation fell in 2007. The number of provinces free from poppy doubled from six to 13. In 2008, the Government of Afghanistan&#146;s target is for over half of all provinces to become poppy-free. While we remain concerned by sustained opium production figures in the insecure South, we welcome the UNODC&#146;s prediction that overall poppy cultivation will decrease slightly in 2008. We continue to work with the Afghan Government, donors and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to sustain success in the North and East and to target operations against the drugs trade in the South.</p>

 The Government are deeply concerned about reported serious, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the Democratic People&#146;s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Our ambassador in Pyongyang raised concerns about labour camps, as well as wider human rights issues, with Kim Young Nam (President of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#146;s Assembly) on 2 July. We will continue to take every appropriate opportunity, bilaterally and through the EU and the UN, to press the DPRK to engage with the international community on human rights and to improve its record in this area.</p>

 Aminopyralid has been granted provisional authorisation for use as a herbicide on grassland, following an evaluation of relevant data by the Pesticides Safety Directorate. These data indicated that Aminopyralid may remain in plant material from treated land and pass into the manure of livestock which eat such material. Susceptible crops may be adversely affected by the residues in the plant material.</p>

As with all plant protection products, users should always read and follow the label instructions; this is a statutory requirement.

 Aminopyralid is a herbicide designed for selective broad-leaved weed control in grassland. It is of low toxicity to mammals. Damage to vegetables from Aminopyralid residues in manure has arisen in part because the substance can persist in grass, hay or silage, and passes through the mammalian digestive system largely unaffected into the resultant manure, rather than being broken down.</p>

PSD has now assessed additional information from the manufacturer that confirms that using manure which may contain residues of Aminopyralid in ground used to grow vegetables does not have implications for human or animal health. Even if manure were derived from animals fed only grass, or silage made from grass treated with Aminopyralid and plants took up all the aminopyralid present in that manure, the highest residues would not give rise to consumer health concerns and the vegetables should be safe to eat.</p>

 As a result of the recent theft of a laptop, the Ministry of Defence has initiated an investigation into the details of all lost or stolen electronic media since 2003. This investigation involves the collation and examination of reports from across the Department including final disposal action, where available. While every effort is being made to gather the information as quickly and accurately as possible, not all the details are currently available. In addition, it should be noted that details of such incidents were not collated centrally before 2003 and therefore will not be available.</p>

No centralised records were maintained before 2003 and it has therefore not been possible to provide the information for earlier years. The figures below continue to be adjusted as a result of additional thefts and losses along with subsequent clarification of historic incidents. As a result of the investigation into details of electronic media lost/stolen since 2003 which I announced on 31 March 2008, (Official Report, column 517W), details on the number of USB data storage devices reported as lost or stolen from the Department since 2003 are set out in the following table.</p>

 We have developed a range of community sentences that can be used by the courts for young people. In addition we have provided out of court disposals which are particularly suitable for dealing with low level offences without the need for recourse to the courts.</p>

The young offender must agree to undertake reparation and rehabilitation in a contract agreed with the panel. The Act will extend the circumstances in which a referral order can be made and allow a second one to be made in exceptional circumstances. In the Act we also introduced a new generic community sentence for young people, the Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO), which will replace nine existing community sentences. The YRO has 14 different requirements that may be added to an order and is designed to increase the options available to sentencers to deal with young offenders in the community with effective and tailored interventions. The YRO also provides two further requirements for serious and persistent young offenders that are set as alternatives to custody.</p>

The Agency receives around five million phone calls each year, almost three hundred thousand new applications for maintenance and over two million change of circumstances requests as well as general correspondence. In addition people employed by the Agency may be on holiday, training, or ill when a particular task arises and you will appreciate the Agency needs to be able to allocate work to balance workloads and provide the best possible service. The Agency provides a full service to clients from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and from 9am to 5pm on Saturday. It is not possible for an individual caseworker to be available to a client over this period, therefore the majority of clients will not deal with the same caseworker but with the same team, any member of which will be able to resolve their query and reply to correspondence.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. Regional data is only available on a consistent basis from 1994-95, so no results are available for 1990.<br>
5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
6. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
7. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are.<br>
8. Proportions of working age adults in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>

<i> [holding answer 12 June 2008]: </i>As part of the first stage of consultation the proposed location for the eco-town at Curborough was set out in the consultation document &#147;Eco-towns&#151;Living a greener future&#148;. Through promotional material we have said that more information is available on our website, and this includes links to the initial expressions of interest by the promoter for the shortlisted locations, including Curborough. These provide further details about the location. The proposal for an eco-town at Curborough has since been withdrawn by the promoter.</p>

 The need for consistent and creative approaches to charging was highlighted in the recent Audit Commission report &#147;Positively Charged&#148;.

This was prepared with the Disability Rights Commission, and provides schools and LAs with practical tools to improve their effectiveness. It helps them to make reasonable adjustments for disabled pupils, and to review and revise their accessibility plans. These show how schools will increase access for disabled pupils to school premises and facilities, to the curriculum, and to information in alternative formats.

The drugs strategy &#145;Drugs: Protecting Families and Communities&#146;, published in February 2008, introduced families as a key priority and highlighted the need for support to prevent future problems for children. This proposed a programme of intensive support services to reach the most chaotic families through the Family Interventions project; and Family Pathfinders to develop local systems and services that improve outcomes for families at risk.

 The Department's principal estimates of the number of young people of academic age 16 to 18 who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) are based on data from a range of administrative sources and the Labour Force Survey (LFS), and are published annually in a Statistical First Release each June. The most recent publication can be found via the following link: http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000792/index.shtml. These data are used to measure the Department's target to reduce the number of young people NEET by 2 percentage points by 2010 (from a baseline of 9.6 per cent. at end 2004).</p>

As a sample survey, LFS estimates of NEET are subject to sampling error, and these estimates are not as accurate as the official measure outlined above. However, they allow monitoring of in-year trends in the numbers of young people NEET.</p>

Both of these sources are sample surveys, and provide information on young people from a single cohort rather than across the 16 to 18 age range. While the estimates of NEET produced from these sources are not accurate as the SFR measure, they are useful in providing breakdowns of NEET by characteristics and background.

 The Government welcome the recent adoption by the Council and European Parliament of a regulation establishing the European Institute for Innovation and Technology (EIT). The regulation provides a solid basis for the EIT to support European innovation through the creation of partnerships (to be known as &#147;Knowledge and Innovation Communities&#148;) between existing excellent universities, research organisations and businesses in strategically important fields. The Government consider that a high calibre independent Governing Board, which is due to be appointed shortly, will play a key role in building the EIT&#146;s reputation. The board is expected to develop detailed operational criteria in the coming months, which will enable the first KICs to be launched around spring 2010.

 Over the next five years, changes in food aid costs will be driven by rises in prices of food and fuel, and by increases in the number of people receiving food aid. The World Food programme (WFP) and other agencies estimate that about 100 million additional people may have been rendered food insecure globally as a result of recent price rises. This year, WFP&#146;s revised estimate of its total global requirement is approximately &#163;2.4 billion. This represents a 54 per cent. increase compared to the original 2008 requirement. WFP notes that its 2008 requirement may increase further still.</p>

The package is designed to address both short term needs and long term solutions. It includes some $60 million (over &#163;30 million) in support of recent appeals by the UN World Food programme for countries most at risk.</p>

 The link between energy and fuel price rises on the one hand, and the levels of spending required between 2008 and 2015 to reach the water and sanitation millennium development goals on the other, is complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_632"><a name="80716w0025.htm_para4"><a name="080716114000327">Nevertheless, it is clear that fuel prices will increase the costs of MDG delivery and may reduce the availability of Government resources to meet these costs.</p>

However we do not have data on Gambia and Somalia. Ethiopia and Eritrea are both &#147;off track&#148; to achieving the MDGs on sanitation, Eritrea is considered to be &#147;on track&#148; for the Water MDG, but, Ethiopia is &#147;off track&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="80716w0025.htm_para6"><a name="080716114000329">DFID is providing support for the achievement of water and sanitation MDGs, including some programmes in the countries listed. In Ethiopia, first transfer of our &#163;75 million investment to support the Government's Universal Access program has been made. This will support investments in rural and urban water supply and sanitation. In Eritrea, we have recently agreed a &#163;6 million rural water and sanitation project with UNICEF. In 2006-07 DFID spent &#163;8 million on humanitarian activities in Somalia, a proportion of which went towards projects with water components.</p>

 Prices of food, construction materials, boats and other commodities have risen significantly in Burma since the Cyclone struck in May.

DFID is also in the process of commissioning longer term research on a range of technical and political economy aspects of the design and implementation of social transfer programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="80716w0026.htm_para6"><a name="080716114000568">DFID is working in different ways in over 20 countries. In Pakistan, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia this means supporting the development of national social protection strategies. In Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Kenya we are funding major social transfer programmes while in other countries such as Ghana we have helped support smaller pilot projects. We are also helping Brazil and South Africa to share their experience of using social protection to reduce poverty with other developing countries.</p>

 It is very difficult to estimate the number of Zimbabweans who have left the country by regular and irregular means since the March 2008 elections.

 We continue to refer to key research reports commissioned since 1999. A &#147;Systematic Review of Public Water Fluoridation&#148; published by the University of York in 2000 found no significant association between water fluoridation and goitre, bone disease or any other systemic illness, but called for further research to strengthen the evidence base. &#147;Water Fluoridation and Health&#148;, published by the Medical Research Council in 2002, endorsed the University of York&#146;s recommendations and suggested priorities for further research. Copies of both reports are available in the Library. Accordingly, the Department commissioned the University of Newcastle upon Tyne to investigate bio-availability (absorption of fluoride, The report, the &#147;Bioavailability of Fluoride in Drinking Water&#148;, a Human Experimental Study published in 2004, showed no statistically significant differences between absorption of fluoride from naturally fluoridated and artificially fluoridated water.

 The NHS Next Stage Review final report, &#145;High Quality Care for All&#146; was published on 30 June; copies of this publication have already been placed in the Library. The review, led by two thousand frontline clinicians and staff across each strategic health authority in England, examined services across eight &#145;pathways of care&#146;, including long-term conditions. The report responds to the challenges identified locally to deliver the improvements to the wider system that will enable these local priorities to be met most effectively.</p>

 All primary care trusts (PCTs) have a duty to undertake and publish equality impact assessments (EqIAs). These are not centrally collected by the Department. However, the Healthcare Commission has conducted audits of national health service trusts to look at whether trusts have published the required information. Each PCT is required under the equality legislation to equality-impact assess their functions, policies, strategies and procedures. The Healthcare Commission when inspecting PCTs will assess the quality of the EqIA which will go towards their annual rating.</p>

 The Transforming Community Equipment and Wheelchair Services Programme (TCEWS) was set up in 2006 to design a radical new model for delivery of both community equipment and wheelchairs in England. The remit of the programme was to place service users and carers at the heart of any new service model and build on the strengths of the third and private sector. The overall aim was to develop a new high quality system for delivering equipment which would give those supported by the state the sort of choice and control they have not previously enjoyed. Responsibility for assessment of need remains with local health and social care commissioners.</p>
