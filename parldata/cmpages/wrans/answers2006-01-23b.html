 The Commissioners have been notified, by solicitors acting for a number of residents, of potential claims against them for damages arising from the improvements carried out by the Commissioners to premises in Ufford street, Mitre road and Webber street. This matter is the subject of potential litigation and it is therefore inappropriate for the Commissioners to make disclosure of documents outside the legal process.

 We have introduced &quot;accessibility planning&quot; into the local transport planning process to encourage local authorities and other agencies to assess more systematically whether people can access transport services in their areas. This process covers all forms of transport from buses, coaches and taxis to cycling and walking networks. Making provision for disabled people is a condition against which the resulting Local Transport Plans (LTPs) are assessed.

<a name="stpa_34">At a local level, we are supporting the continued introduction of low floor buses in Gravesham. The Kickstart project (services 495/498 between Kings Farm, Christianfields, Gravesend Town Centre, Pepper Hill and Bluewater), launched in March 2005, introduced low floor single deck buses to the route replacing minibuses which were inaccessible to wheelchair users. The introduction of the new vehicles was combined with a programme of work to introduce raised kerbs and bus boarders on this route.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_35">The Department continues to invest in accessibility improvements in Gravesham through LTP funding. Kent county council, Gravesham&#039;s local bus provider, Arriva and the Gravesham Access Group (which represents disabled people in the district) work in close partnership to identify priorities for funding. This includes identifying stops which require raised kerbing, dropped kerbs or hard standing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_36">LTP funding has also resulted in a &#163;14.5 million investment in Fastrack, the new bus based transit system serving Gravesend, which will have fully accessible vehicles and roadside infrastructure designed in accordance with current best practice. Due to commence in March 2006, Fastrack will have bus boarders at all Gravesham stops to complement the fleet 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Jan 2006 : Column 1726W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of new low-floor vehicles, providing level access for all passengers. All Fastrack stops will also be fitted with real time information displays.

<a name="stpa_37">Arriva estimates that at present over 70 per cent. of their Gravesham buses are low floor. They also endeavour to ensure that all staff receive disability awareness training.

<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_38">Rail services in Gravesham are also generally accessible, a situation that will be enhanced with the completion of Ebbsfleet station. When opened, this station will offer high standards of accessibility and will be served by trains which meet the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 (RVAR) operating on the Integrated Kent Franchise. This will provide fast access to Stratford International and London St. Pancras stations (both of which will be fully accessible) and also south to Ashford International together with access to &#039;Eurostar&#039; services to Belgium and France. The new station will have ample parking including convenient spaces reserved for disabled passengers.

<a name="stpa_39">More generally disabled people in Gravesham, as elsewhere in the country, will also benefit from the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). We have already laid regulations which will, from 4 December 2006, lift the transport exemption in Part 3 of the for land-based public transport, vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used on leisure and tourism transport services. We will also be consulting shortly on draft regulations to set an &quot;end date&quot; of no later than 1 January 2020 when all trains will have to meet RVAR and to apply those regulations to older trains when they are refurbished.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises that the rapid depletion and mismanagement of water resources are a major threat to Yemen&#039;s development and future stability. Yemen receives relatively little aid in relation to its levels of poverty, and few donors are operating in Yemen. To improve the effectiveness of the aid which Yemen receives, DFID is helping the Government of Yemen and donors to improve the co-ordination of donor aid and persuade donors to support Government of Yemen policies rather than unco-ordinated projects. An important part of improving aid effectiveness is that donors focus their assistance in a few areas, and do not duplicate assistance from other donors.

DFID also encouraged the Government of Yemen to include the NWSSIP into its new plan for tackling overall development and poverty reduction, to help ensure that water management is considered in other areas of government policy.

 There have been several outbreaks of cholera across Zimbabwe in the past two months, which is not unusual at this time of year. In Harare, there have been five suspected cases with three deaths. There have been other outbreaks, including in the Chikomba district (219 suspected cases and seven deaths), and the Buhera district (51 suspected cases and three deaths). While the Harare figures remain low by comparison and do not yet constitute an epidemic, the danger of cholera spreading rapidly through urban areas with high population density remains high.

<a name="stpa_111">The Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, supported by the World Health Organisation, has led investigations into suspected cases in Harare and notes that, although many cases have been presented with symptoms suggestive of cholera, only a few have been given a positive diagnosis following laboratory tests.

Should the problem escalate, DFID stands ready to offer additional assistance in the form of funds for procurement of commodities as well as provision of technical expertise according to need.

 The performance of the company responsible for security scanning is under constant review with regular meetings being held between representatives of the company and representatives of both Houses of Parliament. A number of teething problems occurred during the first weeks of the new contract last year; these appear to have abated and there has been no cause for complaint in the last two months. Some of the concerns raised were related to the interface between the screening and the mail processes, and both organisations involved have worked hard to improve these. No assessment has been made of the environmental consequences of the journeys required to process the mail, in view of the need for extensive off-site security screening in the current security climate.

Setting the threshold at &#8364;1,000 would allow a large number of UK artists to receive royalties.

 The Government take the recent increases in gas prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. We understand that this creates tough trading conditions, especially for energy intensive users, and we are aware of a few companies having reduced production in response to the very high prices since November. This will, of course, have a negative impact on UK industrial output, but in terms of overall GDP this will be relatively minor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">Provisional data for October 2005 shows that UK retail gas prices for small, medium and large industrial users were below the EU15 median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices that might differ from these averages. I am also aware, from my industry visits and meetings, that, there is some evidence that gas prices in the UK for some of our very large industrial users are above those on the Continent, and I recognise the risk that this presents to UK competitiveness. Officials are working closely with Industry and Ofgem, with a view to help, wherever possible, to mitigate the situation and reduce these impacts.

 Sections 1 to 4 of the Patents Act 2004 will bring UK patents legislation into line with the revised European Patent Convention (&quot;EPC&quot;). These provisions will be brought into force at the same time as the revised EPC itself takes effect. This is desirable in order to maintain consistency between the UK and European patents systems. It is uncertain exactly when this will be, because the revised EPC takes effect two years after the 15th state has ratified or acceded, or (if earlier) three months after the final state has ratified or acceded. At present I understand that 14 states have done so, and that includes the UK. The revised EPC, and the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act, are therefore unlikely to take effect before mid-2008.

<p>
<a name="60123w24.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_183">More pro-active policing and increased police effectiveness may cause an increase in recorded crime. Use of CCTV, for example, may lead to recording and detection of assaults which would otherwise have gone unreported and unrecorded.

<a name="60123w25.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The production figures were lower in 2001 as the Taliban had imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation in July 2000 in order to manipulate the world price for the illegal product. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery and drove up the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government.

<a name="60123w25.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The lack of viable central state and war-damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan created conditions in which opium cultivation could thrive once again.

 In November 2005, the UN Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODC) confirmed the poppy cultivation and production figures for the 2004&#150;05 season from their annual survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes, a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004, despite a significant 21 per

cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield in 2004&#150;05. UNODC will provide an early indication of this season&#039;s (2005&#150;06) production figures in their Rapid Assessment Survey, which is due to be published in the next couple of weeks.

<p>
<a name="60123w25.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">While the UNODC figures were encouraging last year, we need to be cautious about the future. There is a risk that cultivation and production may increase again in the next 12 months&#151;initial reports suggest that farmers in some provinces are threatening to return to cultivation. Our goal is to ensure that the downward trend in cultivation and production is maintained in the long term. We are working hard with the Government of Afghanistan and other international partners to ensure the Government of Afghanistan is able to deliver on this goal.

However, these have decreased in recent years and the Government of Indonesia is keen to ensure good inter- communal relations, including by working with Muslim and Christian community leaders to reduce tensions.

<a name="stpa_43">In my written statement to Parliament of 20 December 2005 I set out the impact of the EU budget settlement for the UK&#039;s future Structural Funds allocations. The UK will receive approximately &#8364;2.6 billion in Convergence funding (previously called Objective 1 funding) for its poorest regions. Cornwall and West Wales and the Valleys will receive full Convergence funding, while the Highlands and Islands will receive phasing-out Convergence funding averaging approximately two-fifths of the intervention rates for the UK&#039;s future full Convergence regions. The UK will also receive approximately &#8364;6.2 billion in Competitiveness funding for its other regions. Of this, South Yorkshire and Merseyside will receive phasing-in Competitiveness funding averaging approximately one-third of the intervention rates for the UK&#039;s future full Convergence regions. We have now started the process of deciding how the UK&#039;s remaining Competitiveness funding should be allocated between our nations and regions. Finally, the UK will receive approximately &#8364;0.6 billion in Co-operation funding. The Government will also need to agree with the Commission how this should be allocated.

Notes:<br>

1. The link with earnings was broken in November 1980.<br>

2. The average earnings figure is for full-time employees in the April of that year and has been taken from the New Earnings Survey prior to 1998 and from Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings since 1998.<br>

3. The year refers to the year of uprating. From 1980 to 1985 this took place in November, in 1986 it occurred in July and since 1987 annual uprating has taken place in April.<br>

 With regard to part <i>(a)</i> and <i>(c)</i> of the question, the information is not available. The Government is currently inviting notifications from affected pension schemes to the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), and is therefore obtaining some information on the number of members facing pensions losses due to company insolvency. In due course, information will also be collected on individual members in schemes qualifying for FAS. Based on our most recent data collection for the FAS, we know of around 70,000 non pensioner members in schemes that are potentially eligible for assistance from the FAS as a result of their schemes being wound up in circumstances of insolvency or where the employer no longer exists.

The Pensions Regulator only holds the present status of a scheme and only those schemes that have completed winding up procedures are included in these figures.

Notes:<br>

1. A wound up scheme is one which has notified the Pensions Regulator (or its predecessor the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority) that it has completed winding up procedures.<br>

2. Schemes are required to notify the Pensions Regulator of changes in scheme status as soon as is reasonably practical. This means that the data for the year ended 31 March 2005 is provisional.<br>

3. The figures are based on information held on the register as at 11 January 2006. The effective date for the completion of wind up is based on the last scheme status change date.<br>





4. Figures for 1997&#150;8 commence on 2 April 1997 because, where the date at which the scheme completed winding up procedures, prior to 1 April 1997 cannot be ascertained, a default value of 1 April 1997 is used as the date on which the scheme wound up. As a result a very large number of schemes are recorded as wound up with a scheme status change date of 1 April 1997, even if they had wound up at some earlier date. Including schemes with this default date in the table would significantly overstate the number of schemes that wound up during 1997, so a start date of 2 April has been used for 1997&#150;98.<br>

5. Total membership includes active, deferred and pensioner members. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these numbers.<br>

6. During 2005&#150;06 the Pensions Regulator will continue with its plans to issue a scheme return form to all occupational pension schemes that are registered in the UK. This will provide the Pension Regulator with access to enhanced data in future years.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The policy change is assumed to take place from 2006&#150;07. In part (a) the Basic State Pension (BSP) is assumed to be uprated by prices growth (including underpin) in 2006&#150;07, 2007&#150;08, 2008&#150;09, 2009&#150;10 and uprated by earnings growth from 2010&#150;11. In part (b) it is assumed that the BSP would be uprated by prices growth (plus underpin).<br>





2. Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with the pre-Budget report 2005 assumptions.<br>

3. Savings in income-related benefit (IRBs) such as pension credit and housing benefit, and potential increases in tax revenue, are estimated using the DWP policy simulation model and April 2006 benefit rates. Savings are assumed to be a constant proportion of the estimated gross cost over time.<br>

 The Dukedom of Leinster is the Premier Dukedom of Ireland created by Letters Patent in 1766. Gerald Fitzgerald the late 8th Duke of Leinster formerly sat in the House of Lords by virtue of a Viscountcy of Great Britain. This Viscountcy was created by Letters Patent in 1747.

<a name="stpa_83">The late 8th Duke had proved his succession to the Viscountcy of Great Britain and took his seat on 21 October 1976 on the death of his father Edward the 7th Duke who died in March 1976. The late 8th Duke subsequently established formally his succession to the Dukedom in March 1977. Following the 8th Duke&#039;s death in December 2004, his only son Maurice Fitzgerald submitted a claim through the Crown Office, to prove his succession to the peerage.

<a name="60123w38.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">The 1998 National Adult Dental Health showed that the proportion of adults with no natural teeth had fallen from 37 per cent, in 1968 to 12 per cent. in 1998. The 2003 National Child Dental Health Survey showed that the proportion of 12 year old children with decayed, missing and filled teeth had fallen from 93 per cent. in 1973 to 38 per cent. in 2003. 12 year old children in England now have the best oral health of their age group in Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w38.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_96">The Government recognises that major inequalities in oral health remain. For example, in 2003, the probability of having obvious decay experience of the primary teeth was about 50 per cent. higher in the lowest social group than in the highest social group. The Department published a new oral health plan for England, &#039;Choosing Better Oral Health,&#039; in November 2005. This sets out a range of measures that have the potential to reduce these inequalities including the fluoridation of water supplies. The Government have amended the legislative 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Jan 2006 : Column 1844W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
framework governing fluoridation to give people in areas with high levels of dental decay a real option of having their water fluoridated.

Notes:<br>

1. The percentages of the population registered with a dentist (or registration rate) have been estimated by including patient registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient&#039;s address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.<br>

2. Estimates have been calculated using population estimates for the nearest year for which data are available. 1997&#150;2000 percentages have been calculated using 2001 population estimates. 2005 percentages have been calculated using 2004 population estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique hospital episode statistics (HES) patient identifier (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality<br>

PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment are poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

4. Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls In data, that is, the data is ungrossed.<br>

Main operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example, time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Time waited (days)<br>

Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical or social suspension.<br>
