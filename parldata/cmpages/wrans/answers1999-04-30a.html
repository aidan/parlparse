<P>
<P>
<a name="90430w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the cost of paying the &#163;100 winter allowance through the basic state pension and <i>(b)</i> the cost of paying the winter allowance separately.  [82283]<P>

<a name="90430w01.htm_sbhd1"><H4><center>Birth Certificates</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90430w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the purposes for which his Department and its Executive Agencies require a birth certificate to be provided by <i>(a)</i> employees, <i>(b)</i> contractors, <i>(c)</i> those applying for employment or contracts and <i>(d)</i> other persons.  [82768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90430w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 This Department and its Agencies require new employees to provide proof of identity and their date of birth, and the provision of their birth certificate is one means of doing this. However, a birth certificate is required only in the absence of other documentation, usually a passport. The Department and its Executive Agencies do not ask for birth certificates from contractors or from those seeking a contract.
<P>

<a name="90430w01.htm_para0">The Benefits Agency does not insist on seeing birth certificates of new claimants of social security benefits to verify their identity, except when they are claiming certain benefits such as retirement pensions and child benefit. For other social security benefits, other forms of documentation are also acceptable.
<P>

<a name="90430w01.htm_para1">The Child Support Agency will ask for sight of a qualifying child's birth certificate where there is a paternity dispute to establish whether or not the non-resident parent is shown on the birth certificate. It is unlikely that the Agency will request a birth certificate in any other circumstances, as the dates of birth of qualifying children are verified for the purposes of child benefit.

<P>
<a name="90430w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90430w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK has exclusive fishing rights within the UK 0-6 mile limits and there is only limited access for other Community fishing vessels within our 12 mile limits. It follows that the majority of enforcement activity within the territorial waters adjacent to England and Wales involves UK fishing vessels.
<P>

<a name="90430w01.htm_para2">Details of sightings and boardings of fishing vessels in British Fishery Limits adjacent to England and Wales are held by the Ministry. However, this information is not recorded in a way which would enable detailed information to be provided in respect of the territorial waters adjacent to England and Wales without incurring disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 28 April 1999]:</i> The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The Government do not see a case for requiring companies to ballot employees before making donations to political parties.

 The new framework for the regulation of the accountancy profession, which I announced on 28 April, does not affect the bodies recognised under the Companies Act 1989 to supervise auditors, of which there are at present five. However, the framework establishes three new independent boards covering ethical standards, investigation and discipline, and auditing standards, which largely replace existing bodies and whose work will underpin particular aspects of auditor regulation. These bodies will come under the scrutiny of a new independent Review Board and appointments to them, and to the Review Board, will be made by an independent Foundation.

<a name="90430w03.htm_para3">My Department has a major part to play in helping to build an inclusive and diverse society. We are seeking to secure race equality and cultural diversity objectives in the funding agreements made between DCMS and its sponsored bodies; in monitoring the Lottery distributors' new strategies; in setting the agenda of the new DCMS regional consortiums and in encouraging the development of local authority cultural strategies. I am following developments in the media as broadcasters and programme makers examine their role in engaging ethnic minorities as audiences and in creative roles.

The Department is considering a number of measures aimed at increasing representation in the higher grades, including the development of staff with potential in the feeder grades and more direct recruitment at higher levels.

It continued to rise until June 1998 [to 72,100]. It has since fallen by 29 per cent. (21,200), to stand at 50,900 by the end of February 1999. We fully expect this downward trend to continue.

<a name="90430w04.htm_para1">In a survey conducted by the NPD in 1997, it was estimated that in 1996 approximately 94 per cent. of all pacemaker implants were recorded on the database.

 The Department does not hold this information. However, the National Pacemaker Database has 377 United Kingdom patients (including implants under the National Health Service and in private practice) registered as having received a Sensolog 2033 pacemaker implant, 268 of which are for the 2033T.

 We have no plans to review current arrangements for the recording of patients with pacemakers. The maintenance of patient records is a matter of clinical practice and is not subject to regulation. The voluntary recording of pacemaker implants by clinicians with the National Pacemaker Database is endorsed by the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group, the professional body for clinicians practising cardiac pacing.

[82403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90430w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Information recorded by the National Pacemaker Database indicates that the following companies have, at some time, supplied pacemakers to United Kingdom pacing centres: Medtronic, Pacesetter (St. Jude Medical), Vitatron, CPI Guidant, Biotronik, Siemens, Sultzer Intermedics, Telectronics, Sorin Biomedica, ELA, Cordis, Biotec, Medico, Implantronik, APC Medical, Paladin, Precimed, Medcor, LEM, American Optical, Coratomic, Arco, Cardiac Control Systems, Lucas, Corporel.

 Pacemaker manufacturers are primarily responsible for issuing information to hospitals if a fault associated with any of their products is identified. If the Medical Devices Agency determines that a significant risk remains to the safety of pacemaker patients, it issues advice to clinicians at all United Kingdom pacing clinics to assist them in patient management.

Figures are provisional, no adjustments have yet been made for shortfalls (i.e. the data is ungrossed). The table shows numbers of finished consultant episodes (FCEs) by primary diagnosis and age, in NHS hospitals in England for the financial year 1997-98. An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within a year.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many dental practices have closed in each year since 1990 as a result of <i>(a)</i> retirement of the dentist and <i>(b)</i> the inability of the dentist to sell the practice as a going concern.  [82331]<P>

 Diana Children's Community Nursing Teams are funded by the Government to provide care and support in the home for children with life threatening illnesses and their families. The teams do not depend upon public subscription and will not impact upon the fundraising activities of charities already active in this area--who have welcomed this initiative for the additional resources it brings to this small but extremely vulnerable group of children. The distinction to be made between the Memorial Committee, which was formed to consider ways in which the Government might commemorate the life and work of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Memorial Fund, which is a charitable foundation with its own trustees, has been expressed throughout discussions within the Committee and repeated in communications with the media.

 Last year, 1998-99, my Department spent an estimated &#163;109.2 million on programmes to promote energy efficiency. Of this, over &#163;6 million can be identified as being specifically earmarked for promotion of energy-efficient lighting. In addition to this direct expenditure, the Energy, Environment and Waste Directorate has developed and provided finance for broader initiatives, including the Market Transformation Strategy and our high profile campaign, "Are You Doing Your Bit", which will have had a positive impact on the promotion of energy-efficient lighting.

 Local authorities are responsible, under Part I of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, for paying disabled facilities grants towards the cost of disabled adaptations. Whilst the Act places no restrictions on the type of adaptation that may be eligible for grant assistance, it does require authorities to satisfy themselves that the works are necessary and appropriate for the occupant and that they are reasonable and practicable, given the age and condition of the building. These requirements are necessary to ensure that public money is used effectively, and we have no plans to change them. However, local authorities are required in Guidance to involve the

The amount that the applicant is expected to contribute towards the cost of the adaptations is determined by a means test, but there is nothing in the Act to prevent applicants from paying for additional work from their own resources.

 The Government recognise that transport issues are significant in considering the causes of social exclusion, and my Department has been giving priority to gathering information in this area. The Department is currently undertaking research to gain a better understanding of how transport affects social exclusion. Once this research has been completed, we will be in a better position to estimate the impact of different transport measures. In the meantime, we will continue to keep the impacts of the fuel duty escalator on social exclusion under review.

 We remain committed to the policy of providing support for Kosovar refugees within the region. However, a special unit has been established in Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) to enable a flexible response to any requests from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) to provide temporary refuge to evacuees from the Kosovo region. Kosovars recognised as refugees in the United Kingdom are entitled to be joined by their pre-existing spouse and minor dependant children under the terms of the family reunion concession. In compelling compassionate circumstances, the concession might be extended to other family members who formed part of the refugee's family unit before he fled to seek asylum. Arrangements are being made to deal with outstanding asylum applications, and to give particular priority to those where there are compelling compassionate circumstances, thus enabling families to be reunited under the terms of the concession.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> HM Treasury currently operates two websites, HM Treasury (www.hm-treasury.gov.uk), and The Euro (www.euro.gov.uk). The UK Debt Management Office, an executive agency of HM Treasury operates the DMO site (www.dmo.gov.uk). All three sites are run from the HM Treasury server and share running costs. There are currently no non-departmental public body websites.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para0">HM Treasury's website cost approximately &#163;20,000 to set up in September 1994. Operation costs initially were &#163;8,000 a year for a leased line, and one full-time Range C post (Internet Editor). The Euro site was set up in May 1998 at a cost of &#163;7,000. Current operating costs for both sites are around &#163;60,000.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para1">Topics covered on the HM Treasury site include News Releases, Budget information, economic information, speeches, savings, guidance. The current average number of hits per month is 832,829.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para2">The euro site provides information on business preparation for the euro. The average number of hits per month is currently 191,366.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para3">The expenditure for each of the next three years is difficult to estimate, but server and personnel costs are likely to be around the current level.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para4">The United Kingdom Debt Management Office website was set up in January 1999 at no additional cost. The website operates on the Treasury server with additional running costs of &#163;50 per annum for domain name registration. The site is edited by DMO staff, with no additional staff costs.
<P>

<a name="90430w07.htm_para5">Topics covered are news releases, publications and background information on the DMO. It is too early to establish hits per month, but the site has received 76,254 hits to date. Estimated costs for the next three years are nil.

<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 1999 : Column: 293</I><P>
These included a series of ten productivity road shows held throughout the UK, at a cost of &#163;95,000. These were attended by over 600 representatives of business, education and training providers. The debate has generated a widespread response from all these sectors and the public.

<a name="90430w08.htm_para6">The pre-Integrated Transport White Paper National Road Traffic Forecasts published by the Department of Environment Transport and the Regions in 1997 make allowance for the impact of 6 per cent. per annum real fuel duty increases between 1996 and 2002 on car use and commercial traffic. By 2002, these increases are estimated to reduce total motorway traffic by nearly 2.5 per cent. below what it would otherwise have been. The reduction in traffic between 8 am and 9 am is about 2 per cent. The 1997 forecasts do not distinguish between individual roads and cannot therefore be used to provide a separate estimate for the M25.
