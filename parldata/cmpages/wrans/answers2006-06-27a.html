clearly articulates a Unit Commander's commitment to the care of

factors of the environment, the trainee population and the type of

policy mandates that minimum levels of supervision are determined from
the Unit Commander's Risk Assessment and must be articulated against

[79473]</p><p><a name="06062748000259"><b><a name="06062748001555">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Although the circumstances of the incidents on 17
March 2004 and 9 June 2006 were significantly different, lessons learnt
from incidents such as that in 2004 have enabled the Highways Agency to
better manage the recent event. The nature of the earlier incident
enabled traffic to pass safely the site of the accident; the more
recent one resulted in fire and damage to infrastructure which
prevented this from taking
place.</p><p><a name="06062748000260">Since 2004 the
Highways Agency has improved capability for the evacuation of the
motorway through detailed and tested joint operating procedures with
the local emergency services in the event of a major incident. It has
also developed detailed incident management procedures such as the
capability to implement rearward relief; the process by which trapped
vehicles are turned on the carriageway and returned to the previous
exit. These procedures include the support and welfare of motorists
where they cannot be assisted from the
site.</p><p><a name="06062748000261">The period since
the 2004 incident has seen significant developments in the Highways
Agency&#146;s capability to minimise congestion caused by incidents.
The introduction of the Regional Control Centres as part of the Traffic
Officer Service and the commencement of the National Traffic Control
Centre provide an ability to divert traffic away from an incident
through strategic signing, and around an incident through tactical
signing and
direction.</p><p><a name="06062748000262">The
Highways Agency has substantially strengthened its ability to detect
and respond to incidents and reduce the resulting congestion. The
Traffic Officer Service on the M25 and other motorways is enabling
significantly increased resources to be more quickly available at the
scene to support the management of the incidents. Traffic officers
worked well with emergency services on 9 June to minimise the duration
of the incident and quickly restore the motorway to a safe condition.
The emergency procedures were implemented and motorists received both
welfare and medical assistance as
necessary.</p><p><a name="06062748000263">The
Highways Agency has continued to develop its Incident Support Unit
service on the M25 and, following its successful contribution to
incident management on the M25, implemented similar service on most of
the strategic road network. In addition the Regional Control Centres
are proactively monitoring the road network to detect quickly incidents
and improve communication between responders with the aim of reducing
the clearance
time.</p><p><a name="06062748000264">All major
incidents are reviewed soon afterwards jointly by the Highways Agency
and emergency services to identify lessons to be learnt in dealing with
future incidents. There is an ongoing programme to continually develop
incident management capability including innovations such as central
reserve screens to prevent visual distraction of motorists on adjacent
carriageways and specialist equipment to support the clear up
operation.</p><br><notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 262W</b><br><p><a name="06062748000265"><b><a name="06062748001556">Andrew

police to observe the recovery
operation.</p><p><a name="06062748000270">The
Highways Agency repaired the nearside boundary fence and used a
specialist environmental sub-contractor to clean the road surface. This
enabled the carriageway to be opened safely for the public after the
vehicles and debris had been
removed.</p><p><a name="06062748000271">Essex police
carried out the incident investigation, co-ordinated the recovery
operation, and set the diversion signs. They also allowed the trapped
clockwise traffic between junction 29 and the incident to escape using
lanes 2 and 3. Throughout the duration of the closure, the variable
message signs advised motorists that this section of the M25 motorway
was closed. Contractors undertaking road works on the A128 were
contacted by Essex police and agreed to change the mechanism of
temporary traffic lights at the road works in order to give priority to
diverted traffic travelling south from the

behaviour programmes in reducing re-offending (McGuire, 2002; Pearson
et. al., 2002; Lipton, et. al., 1998). However, UK research examining
the effectiveness of the Enhanced Thinking Skills programme in prisons
has produced mixed results. An evaluation of the programme before it
was accredited found that reconviction fell considerably after
treatment (Friendship et. al., 2002). Further studies since
accreditation have found no differences in reconvictions between
programme participants and matched comparison groups (Falshaw et. al.,
2003; Cann et. al., 2003). These findings might be explained by
differences in programme delivery and implementation or research design
limitations. The current Home Office research programme includes
further research on the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes
based on more effective and rigorous research
designs.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06062748000042">Road Deaths

the police are empowered under section 172, Road Traffic Act 1988 to

is an offence not to give that information if possible. Under section
99, Transport Act 1968, the police can examine and copy records
relating to commercial vehicles and their drivers. It is an offence not
to provide those records, which may provide information relevant to an
accident investigation, or to obstruct the police. Details of the

E. Smith:</b> The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has been
in operation for less than two years, and the benefits of the move to
prevention based fire and rescue services are already evident.
Provisional figures for the year to June 2005 show significant
decreases in the number of deaths and injuries, the number of primary
fires and the number of deliberate fires. In 
<br><notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 294W</b><br>England, by comparison to the previous year, there has been a 21 per
cent. fall in deaths in accidental dwelling fires. The number of fires
to which the fire and rescue service were called fell by 25 per cent.
Within the primary fires category, there was a fall of 7 per cent. in
the total number of building fires including a 10 per cent. decrease in
non-domestic building fires (i.e. commercial premises, schools, etc.).
Deliberate primary fires fell by 20 per cent. That is a tribute to the
way our fire and rescue services have exercised their duties and powers
under the
Act.</p><p><a name="06062748001225">The
Government have received representations about charging by fire and
rescue services for non-fire-fighting related work; operation of
Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP) under the National
Framework; and about the 24 hour delay on powers on entry to domestic
premises for fire investigation purposes. On charging, the matters for
which fire and rescue authorities may charge are set out in The Fire
and Rescue Services (England) Order 2004. We keep that under review and
will consult on any changes that we propose. For the National Framework
we have recognised that it can assist fire and rescue services in
forward planning if the framework has a longer life than one year. We
have therefore introduced a two-year Framework for 2006-08 following
consultation with the Fire and Rescue Service. Finally on fire
investigation, the powers available to the fire and rescue authorities
are at least equivalent to those available to the police. Nonetheless,
we are considering the points made in conjunction with the Arson
Control Forum.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06062748000070">Flag

develop and use the RSDF in the development of regional and sub
regional policies. It has been, or is being, used in the development of

the review of the Regional Economic Strategy and the Phase 1 review of

calculated according to their age and the number of sessions they

local authorities. However, with a view to delivering the aim of
achieving appropriate integration of health arid social care
information systems in England by 2010 the Department&#146;s NHS
Connecting for Health agency has undertaken a number of national
initiatives to support local action. These include the establishment in
2005 of the electronic social care record board (ESCRB). The board has
responsibility for overseeing national implementation of the
electronic: social care record and ensuring consistency of its
implementation by local authorities with social services
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="0606289000761">The
board engages with the work of the national health service national
programme for information technology to enable sharing of information
across traditional boundaries. The board is providing advice and
guidance, and will establish national standards for the electronic
exchange of information between health, education and social care
agencies in support of implementation of the electronic social care
record, whilst recognising the independence of local authorities. It
will ensure appropriate links are made with NHS electronic patient
records and children's electronic information
systems.</p><p><a name="0606289000762">Under the
auspices of the ESCRB, a study has been commissioned into the options
for national implementation of the electronic single assessment process

health and social care. Consultation has been undertaken with health,
social care and supplier representatives, and a report is due later
this year.</p><p><a name="0606289000763">A variety of
information systems and tools are now available to support this
process. There have been successful local deployments of such systems
by national programme suppliers notably in the programme's North East
and Eastern clusters. They are subject to the same strict access
controls as apply to national programme-delivered patient healthcare
records, requiring the use by social workers of a smartcard with
identification and a pass code, which can only be obtained upon
verification of identity and through a formal user registration
process. These systems have demonstrated the value of the technology
and its potential to support the rapid development of integrated
multi-agency working across all client
groups.</p><p><a name="0606289000764">In addition,

In addition, the National Assembly has approved the financial year

remainder devoted to building capacity within the Afghan counter
narcotics law enforcement and criminal justice agencies responsible for
bringing traffickers to justice. However, UK resources will not, on
their own, be sufficient to bring about a sustained reduction in the
amount of land under poppy cultivation. As partner nation for counter
narcotics, the UK is therefore working hard to ensure that
international assistance is targeted in line with the priorities set
out in the National Drug Control Strategy. We have supported the
establishment of a Counter Narcotics Trust Fund to which a number of

However, sustainable drug elimination strategies take time,
particularly when the challenges are as severe as they are in
Afghanistan. After last year's decline, this year's cultivation figures
are unlikely to decrease further as consolidated progress in areas
where governance, security and access to livelihoods have improved, is
still being outpaced by increased planting in the more lawless south,
including Helmand province. Our deployment to Helmand is part of the
broader international support for the reconstruction effort, which is
vital to the success of the Government of Afghanistan's counter
narcotics campaign and to the sustained reduction in the cultivation,
production and trafficking of opium poppy.</p><p><a name="0606289000861"><b><a name="0606289001877">Mr.

level, there are some ad hoc links between the Taliban and traffickers
where their specific interests coincide. Recently, there has been
evidence that the Taliban are encouraging Afghan farmers to grow opium
poppy and in the South, including Helmand, the Taliban have encouraged
farmers to resist Government eradication efforts. It is unclear how
much the Taliban use drug money to facilitate their operations. There
are some signs of contacts at the strategic level. We continue to

been a high priority country for CN assistance since 2002. The UK law
enforcement and criminal justice budget for 2006-07 is over &#163;20
million. Within Afghanistan the UK, as key partner nation, has helped
to establish the counter narcotics police of Afghanistan
(CNPA)&#151;the lead national drugs law enforcement agency, with its
headquarters in Kabul and seven provincial offices&#151;through
training, mentoring and equipping the force. The UK also co-ordinates
the mentoring of senior officers within the CNPA and has contributed
&#163;1.5 million to the Afghan Law and Order Trust Fund which
supports salaries and purchases of equipment for the CNPA.
Additionally, the UK has assisted the establishment of a Counter
Narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force, and is providing mentoring on
prosecution and investigation. The UK is also helping to strengthen the
borders of Afghanistan through contributions to border management
assistance in Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan.</p><p><a name="0606289001588">In Jamaica, the main focus of
our training has been to ensure that Jamaican law enforcement agencies
become more effective crime fighting forces and in particular are able
to dismantle organised drug syndicates, by enhancing their
investigation techniques and ability to gather intelligence and
evidence. Training has also been provided to the coastguard on
interdiction techniques and to deter illegal drug trafficking into and
out of Jamaica, as well customs training at airports.</p><p><a name="0606289001589">In Turkey, CN training is
delivered through the UK/Turkey Prime Ministers' Action Plan, agreed at
the UK/Turkey summit in May 2004. Our CN training assistance to Turkey
concentrates on intelligence capability with a view to facilitating
joint operational work with UK law enforcement to tackle trafficking in
drugs.</p><p><a name="0606289001590">In Iran, the UK
supports operational engagement to tackle drug traffickers, providing
technical advice to Iranian law enforcement agencies, in particular the
anti narcotics police, on how Iran can further improve its performance
on supply reduction. We are also helping to strengthen border
management capability, and improve drug detection work, mainly through
contributing to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Iran CN
programme.</p><p><a name="0606289001591">In
Pakistan, the UK is helping to improve Pakistan's CN capacity through

building at sea and airports. We also assist judicial CN training to
help to improve the criminal justice processes to bring drug

of a court's consideration of an allegation of rape. In addition the
Public Prosecution Service has trained all its prosecutors in the use
of &#145;special measure&#146; provisions which are designed to
assist victims and vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give best
evidence. Further training is planned in relation to sexual offence
cases. The sexual violence strategy currently being developed for
consultation will also make an important contribution to the
