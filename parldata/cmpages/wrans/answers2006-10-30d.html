 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to the answer of 1 February 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 590W, on benefits, what assessment he has made of the impact of widening the housing benefit extended payment scheme from April 2004 to include those in receipt of <i> (a)</i> incapacity benefit and <i> (b)</i> severe disablement allowance; and if he will make a statement.

 From April 2004 we widened the scope of extended payments by introducing a parallel scheme for people moving into work from either incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance. In 2005, it is estimated that 5,000 customers or their partners who received either incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance received an extended payment when they moved off benefit and into employment.</p>

 New claims to severe disablement allowance were stopped on 6 April 2001. From that date new customers need to apply for incapacity benefit or income support on grounds of incapacity. At that time youth rules were introduced to incapacity benefit, whereby those incapable of work before the age of 20 (25 years old in certain circumstances) are eligible for the benefit without needing to meet the national insurance contribution condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="61030w0001.htm_para2"><a name="06103065000077">Existing severe disablement allowance customers, apart from those aged under 20 years old on 5 April 2001, have not been transferred onto incapacity benefit.

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="61030w0001.htm_para3"><a name="06103065000078">Entitlement to severe disablement allowance does not passport its recipients to other benefits, such as housing benefit, in the way that income support and income related jobseeker's allowance do. Many customers on severe disablement allowance may also qualify for income support and so be passported to other benefits in that way. People on severe disablement allowance with a low income, but not also receiving income support would need to be considered for housing benefit on low-income grounds.</p>

 Research conducted for Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in 2003 indicated that less than 1 per cent. of companies had failed to take out employers' liability (compulsory) insurance (ELCI). The research was carried out to investigate allegations that companies were having problems in obtaining ELCI, because of difficulties in the cost and availability. Due to the low overall level of reported non-compliance no attempt was made to assess regional differences.</p>

In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependant on the contribution record of the deceased individual. This means that the number of accounts held on the system accrues as NINOs are allocated each year to all UK children who reach 16 years and persons from abroad requiring a NINO are added.</p>

Changes in HIV prevalence and sexual behaviour were tracked through the National Youth Survey.

The fiscal crisis is mainly the result of the withholding of clearance revenues by Israel and a downturn in domestically generated revenues. The suspension of budgetary support by donors has played a less significant role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="61030w0007.htm_para7"><a name="06103073000082">The suspension of budgetary support has been necessary following the Hamas-led Government&#146;s failure to renounce violence, recognise Israel and sign up to previous peace agreements. However, the international community is doing what it can to address the humanitarian situation. The European Community has increased its aid from &#8364;250 million to &#8364;340 million this year. UK bilateral aid levels have remained constant at &#163;30 million this financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="61030w0007.htm_para8"><a name="06103073000083">A Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) has been set up to support Palestinians directly instead of going through the Palestinian Authority. DFID intends to contribute up to &#163;12 million to the TIM and the European Community is contributing &#8364;105 million. So far the TIM has delivered 2.6 million litres of fuel to keep water, sanitation and health care facilities running; allowances for over 63,000 Palestinian Government workers; and welfare payments to over 40,000 of the poorest Palestinians.</p>

 No. The exception from the compulsory use of child seats or boosters by children permitted by the directive is for taxis. Updated regulations came into force on 18 September 2006 in Great Britain. For this purpose, they apply the exception to licensed taxis and licensed private hire vehicles only. Drivers of these vehicles cannot be expected to know in advance which and how many child seats or boosters may be required by child passengers. However, funeral directors do liaise with bereaved families over arrangements and therefore can arrange to take into account the need for child seats/boosters for child passengers when travelling in dedicated funeral vehicles.</p>

 The Highways Agency is committed to minimising the impact of the trunk road network (in England) on both the natural and built environment and to playing a full role in implementing the Government&#146;s Biodiversity Action Plan. Where appropriate, the agency undertakes works to mitigate for the impact of its operational, maintenance and improvement works, which may include the provision of animal welfare measures. These measures include the provision of animal crossings in the form of tunnels and adapted farm crossings and underpasses. Appropriate fencing may be included to both prevent animals crossing the carriageway and direct the animals to a safe crossing facility. They also undertake specific enhancement measures, such as the provision of bat boxes as part of commitments set out in the Highways Agency Biodiversity Action Plan (HABAP).

A decision on how the Government will proceed (about whether it will call in the application for further public scrutiny and determination by the Secretary of State, or alternatively allow the council to determine the application itself) will be made in the near future.</p>

 There is no right of appeal against a statutory grant of planning permission which has been enacted by Parliament and part 5 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO), in particular, contains no powers, only entitlements. We have no records of part 5 permitted development rights being exercised by statutory undertakers. Statutory undertakers have their own permitted development rights in part 17 of schedule 2 of the GPDO, though there is nothing to prevent a statutory undertaker from enjoying the benefit of any of the other permitted development rights in the GPDO that might apply to their land in a particular case. Were there to be a dispute about whether permitted development rights applied in a particular case, it might be resolved either by an application made to the local planning authority for a certificate of lawfulness to confirm the existence of such rights in respect of a particular development proposal, or by enforcement action taken by the local planning authority.</p>

 The following table shows monthly average farm gate milk prices in pence per litre for the last 12 months for the United Kingdom. The average prices are calculated from monthly surveys of milk purchasers conducted in England and Wales by DEFRA, in Scotland by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department and in Northern Ireland by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The farm gate price is the average price received by producers, net of delivery charges. No deduction has been made for super-levy.</p>

Latest estimates are that in 2009-10 approximately &#163;13.5 million of efficiencies will result from the establishment of Natural England, and from its decision to outsource its corporate service functions to DEFRA&#146;s Shared Service Organisation.</p>

 The Environment Agency (EA) is required, in accordance with HM Treasury's guidance and the &#147;polluter pays principle&#148;, to recover the full costs of regulation from those it regulates. The EA has worked with the farming sector to develop a straightforward, least-cost approach for farmers. It is for the EA, as the regulator, to assess the level of effort required to meet the pollution prevention and control requirements. In parallel, my Department continues to encourage the EA to demonstrate full transparency on what costs are for. The EA is also being set targets to drive efficiency throughout the organisation and gains will in turn offset charges as appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="61030w0014.htm_para1"><a name="0610311000411">In response to concerns raised by the industry, the EA presented a proposal on subsistence charging in February this year. The EA's proposals were accepted by the British Poultry Council as well as other intensive livestock trade associations in May. A subsistence charge of &#163;1,471 for an existing small farm and &#163;1,844 for an existing large farm will therefore be charged to the industry from August 2007 until March 2008, provided that the industry stages its applications over the three month application window (from 1 November 2006 to 31 January 2007).</p>

 The Department has been working closely with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to improve our understanding of how Campylobacter infection develops and spreads.

This includes a DEFRA/FSA joint-funded three year survey, starting in 2007, to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in UK flocks of chicken for meat production.</p>

As a result, priority action at farm level has focused on the importance of meeting good biosecurity standards. This action reinforces wider food hygiene initiatives in the commercial and domestic food handling settings.</p>

 I have consulted closely with the chairman and chief executive of British Waterways about the in-year cut of about 7 per cent. of grant in aid amounting to &#163;3.94 million. They accept that Government have provided &#163;524 million in funding for British Waterways since 2000, of which &#163;452 million was for waterways in England and Wales. Over this period, British Waterways has substantially improved the state of its waterways and has eliminated the safety backlog. It has also concluded substantial regeneration and property projects and facilitated the restoration of some 200 miles of derelict canals. The current assessment of the effect of the reduction in the 2006-07 budgets is that there is likely to be some delay to capital works and a setting back of the date by which British Waterways will be able to reduce year-on-year the requirements for grant in aid from Government.</p>

 The works programme for each year is planned to fit with the expected parliamentary timetable. Over the past three years approximately &#163;17 million has been spent in each summer recess on works projects across both Houses, of which approximately 60 per cent. (&#163;10 million) has been in the Commons. The Commission has estimated the effect of a two-week sitting period in September 2006 on the basis that such sittings and the works programme were planned from the previous November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="61030w0015.htm_para0"><a name="0610314000098">If projects in the Palace and in those buildings housing Members stopped work for two weeks, an additional one/two week period would be required for project close down, making safe, then restarting. This means the overall impact on the works programme would equate to a total delay of up to three or four weeks out of the period over the summer recess from the end of July to mid October.</p>

(an additional &#163;2.5 million across both Houses or &#163;1.5 million for the Commons) of the cost of recess works in a normal summer. The additional costs would arise primarily from the need to increase evening and weekend working to complete projects more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="61030w0015.htm_para2"><a name="0610314000100">This figure for 2006 is substantially higher than the figure of &#163;90,000 for additional works costs in 2003 and 2004 given in my written answer of 5 July 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1083W, because it is impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been.

for the parliamentary estate. The Parliamentary Estates Board has expressed the view that the Palace structure and infrastructure will need a higher level of maintenance and refurbishment over the next few years to halt further deterioration in its condition. Key elements are the needs for a major overhaul of the cast iron roofs, renewal of much of the internal infrastructure of pipes and cabling, fire compartmentation and automatic fire detection systems, and further stone restoration. It is unlikely that this can be completed effectively if all the work is confined to recesses, whether or not there are September sittings.</p>

 The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 introduce a default retirement age of 65 together with procedures whereby the employee has a right to request that he or she be allowed to continue in work beyond the employer's normal retirement age. The employer has a duty to consider this request, and if both employer and employee agree the employee can continue in work. This will move towards a culture where a retirement decision is influenced by the individual circumstances and preferences of employers and employees, rather than an assumption about the norm. These arrangements were introduced in order to deliver the Government's labour market objectives recognising the need for workforce planning and avoiding adverse impact on the provision of occupational pensions and other work-related benefits.</p>

Once the legislation has bedded in, we intend to carry out a follow-up survey, to inform the review of the default retirement age in 2011. We will also explore, with the Office for National Statistics and the Department for Work and Pensions, the process for collating better statistical data on employee retirement intentions and behaviour.</p>

 Equalised maintenance packages for the RAF's Harrier GR7/9 fleet were introduced in 2005. This has improved aircraft availability by an average of two aircraft per day. The airworthiness of the aircraft is also considered to have benefited from equalised maintenance packages but this aspect has yet to be quantified. The total technical support and man hour requirement of the new scheduled maintenance cycle is similar to the previous arrangements, albeit delivered more effectively; accordingly, there have been no measurable cost savings to date.</p>

 QinetiQ performs research under contract to the Ministry of Defence to support the Department's duty of care to submariners during both normal operations and in an emergency. Over the last five years, this research has included experiments that involve goats in hyperbaric chambers. The Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC) reviewed this work in 2003 and confirmed the need for continued investigation into sequential improvements in escape and rescue procedures and the necessity of experiments on large animals.</p>

 The judicial pension schemes make provision for the immediate payment of accrued pension benefits to judges who are required to retire on grounds of ill health. Under the 1993 Judicial Pension Scheme there is an enhancement of service in the event of ill-health retirement prior to the age of 65. According to the available information, about 9.7 per cent. of judicial retirements in the period between 1992-93 and 2005-06 have been on health grounds. In the first six months of 2006-07 the corresponding figure has been 8.8 per cent.</p>

Additionally the Government have funded discrete projects run by Victim Support, including &#163;1 million this year to pilot enhanced services to victims of crime. The annual funding for the past 10 years is set out in the following table.</p>

Under the new contract, the numbers of dentists provided are performers and are defined as a dentist who has been set up on the Dental Practice Division Payments online system by the PCT to work under an open contract as at 30 June 2006. The number provided is a count of individuals listed as performers on open contracts.  3. Under the new contract arrangements PCTs agree with providers a specified annual level of NHS dental treatment. The provider is committed under the contract to providing this level of service&#151;he or she may do this personally or through other dentists he or she employs (they must however be listed within the PCT contract as potential performers of NHS services). 4. Most NHS dentists do some private work. Figures provided do not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.  5. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS BSA may be notified of joiners or leavers to or from the GDS or PDS up to several months, or more, after the move has taken place. Information is up to date as at 16 October 2006.  6. Hospital and community dental services or services provided privately have been excluded from the numbers.  7.

 Since the dental reforms introduced on 1 April 2006, primary care trusts have been responsible for commissioning dental services, including orthodontic treatment, to meet the needs of their local areas.

The monitoring system now measures case assessments and overall orthodontic courses of treatment that typically last between one and two years.

 The Government's vision is that women should have easy access to supportive, high quality maternity services, designed around their individual needs and those of their babies. Any decisions about reconfiguration of services should be made at local level as local commissioners and managers are in the best position to determine the needs of their local population. Reconfiguration does not necessarily mean reducing service capacity, but rather affords local managers the opportunity to build local services that are fit to deliver 21st century maternity care, recognising the fact that services may need to be delivered differently, and in different locations&#151;for example in community based settings. By 2009, all women will have choice over where and how they have their baby, from a range of settings, including hospitals, midwifery-led units and at home. A home birth or a birth in a midwifery-led unit, should be a realistic option for all women with uncomplicated pregnancies. The choices offered to women should fall within the safety net of an emergency network that is readily available, should the need arise.</p>

 The Government&#146;s vision for woman-focused, family-centred care as well as choice in maternity services is pivotal to the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services. The standard requires national health service maternity care providers and primary care trusts to ensure that the range of ante-natal, birth and post-birth care services available locally provides real choice for women (including home births) and that local options for midwife-led care will include midwife-led units in the community or on a hospital site to all women who have been appropriately assessed.</p>

The choices offered to women should ensure access to an emergency network that is readily available, should the need arise. The Government have further demonstrated their commitment to choice in maternity in the White Paper &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&#148;, published on 30 January this year, which pledges to raise the profile of maternity services and encourages doctors to support birth choices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="61030w0040.htm_para8"><a name="06103155001076">Ultimately, decisions about the patterns of maternity service delivery are matters for local NHS trusts to determine, taking into account local population needs, priorities and resources.</p>

 There are no statistics on the number of plastic bags produced or used in Northern Ireland. However, UK figures show UK consumers use an estimated 10 billion plastic bags a year.

It is hoped that all the major retailers will sign up to the code and agree to set targets for a reduction in the number of disposable bags handed out at the point of sale. The Department also supports a number of other initiatives including Baglady Productions&#146; NEEDabag 2 project which aims to encourage alternatives to plastic bags, promote recycling, encourage people to refuse plastic bags and increase awareness of all issues relating to litter and waste and the &#147;Wake up to Waste&#151;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle&#148; campaign aimed at raising consumer awareness of waste management issues and the part each person can play in reducing the amount of waste we produce.</p>

 It would be impracticable to set targets or a time scale for the elimination of the differentials in public housing between the two communities. All allocations by the housing executive and registered housing associations are made on the basis of need as determined by the points awarded under the Common Selection Scheme which was equality proofed and subject to detailed consultation. In some areas demand is greater than supply, while in others, the opposite is true and allocations cannot therefore be made within prescribed time scales.</p>

 My officials met with Waltham Forest local authority and its partner, &#147;EduAction&#148;, on a number of occasions to discuss Fresh Start proposals for Church Mead Junior School. During these discussions Ofsted visited the school and noted it had made satisfactory progress since it was placed in special measures and good progress since the previous monitoring inspection. It was not, therefore, a strong candidate for a Fresh Start, which is normally reserved for intractable cases of failure. Although the school could not be supported with additional Fresh Start funding under the programme&#146;s criteria, the local authority took the decision to close the school in August 2006 and it reopened as Willow Brook Primary in September with a new head teacher.</p>

 Section 47 of the School Standards and Framework Act enables the Secretary of State to make regulations governing the way in which local authorities must, and in some cases may, distribute funding to the schools they maintain. The most recent set of these regulations is the &#147;School Finance (England) Regulations 2006&#148;. The mixture of prescription and discretion within these regulations enables each local authority to tailor their distribution mechanism to the needs and circumstances of their schools.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 October 2006]:</i> There are two main routes by which we publish post-16 attainment results at institutional level. These are the achievement and attainment tables (AAT) for 16, 17 and 18-year-olds and the further education benchmarking data published by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).</p>

The tables report the achievement of 16, 17 and 18-year-olds that have completed advanced level studies. Students are reported against the institution where they are on roll.</p>

The most recently published tables for 2005 cover the 2003/04 and 2004/05 academic years and are published by DfES through the following web-link:</p>

 As set out in the 2005 pre-Budget report, the Government welcome the banking industry&#146;s commitment to establish a scheme to allow genuinely unclaimed assets to be reinvested in the community. The Government and industry have agreed that the definition of an unclaimed asset should generally cover bank and building society accounts where there has been no customer activity for a period of 15 years, as that will best identify those accounts that are genuinely unclaimed. No assets have been invested as work on setting up the scheme is ongoing.</p>

The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

 There has been limited progress on reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) this year. Significant progress before the elections on 1 October was unlikely, but as I made clear in my statement to the press of 2 October, it is important that the reform process is now resumed so that BiH can continue its process of normalisation and move closer towards the EU and NATO. Constitutional reform and implementing the necessary reforms to conclude the Stabilisation and Association Agreement should be the top priorities for BiH in the coming months.

This report recommends that the future EU Special Representative (EUSR) will play a central coordinating role amongst the international community in BiH.

 There has been little progress towards the implementation of the October 2005 Agreement on Police Restructuring, which is a key condition for the conclusion of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. This is largely because of obstruction by Republika Srpska (RS) politicians. As I made clear in my statement to the press of 2 October, it is imperative that progress is made in the coming months. I raised the matter with both RS President, Dragan Cavic, and RS Prime Minister, Milorad Dodik, when I met them in London on 7 June and 25 July 2006. The full text of the 2 October statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at:</p>

 I visited Colombia on 12-15 October as part of a wider visit to the region to inspect UK engagement to combat the flow of cocaine to the UK. In Bogota, I called on the Vice President, Foreign Minister and Defence Minister to discuss current co-operation and the Colombian government&#146;s own serious commitment to this task. I emphasised in all meetings the importance which the UK attaches to co-operation to tackle the drugs problem, the essential nature of strict adherence to international human rights standards and the need for Colombia to develop its democracy and economy. All interlocutors gave clear commitments on these important issues. I also met a number of Colombian police and military personnel who are directly engaged in tackling drugs trafficking and which the UK supports, in particular through a number of training projects including bomb disposal, de-mining and rules of engagement. It is not our practice to name those involved in operational matters, nor to make public any records of discussions of operational matters.

 The Council of Ministers agreed on 25 September a common position on the Commission's proposal for a new directive on nominal quantities for pre-packaged products. The proposal, as amended by the Council, would deregulate all pre-packaged products except wines and spirits, though member states which currently maintain quantity restrictions on milk, butter, pasta or coffee, or on white sugar, would be able to retain these for a transitional period of five years (six for white sugar). The United Kingdom supports this proposal, which is a valuable step towards simplifying the corpus of EU legislation and removing out of date restrictions.

 UK forces in Iraq are not detaining any senior officials from Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime. US forces in Iraq are detaining 10 senior officials on the ground that it is necessary for imperative reasons of security under the authority conferred by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1546 and 1637. The US is also detaining on behalf of the Government of Iraq and at its request a further 67 senior officials under Iraqi criminal procedures. These individuals will be prosecuted in the Iraqi courts. We understand the Government of Iraq is itself detaining at least one senior official of the former regime, but we are not able to confirm numbers or the legal basis of their detention.</p>

 During the last Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review cycle, the UK, both nationally and as part of the EU, worked hard to secure consensus on ways to ensure that there is a cost associated with withdrawal from the Treaty. This work was in response to North Korea's announcement of its intention to withdraw and drew widespread support, but did not achieve the consensus required for the change to be implemented. We believe that progress made on this area during the 2005 NPT Review  <br>
