 Following a firm decision to remove statutory controls on European foul brood inspections would no longer be targeted on this disease, although inspectors would continue to offer advice on its control as they do at present for other serious but non-statutory diseases. The inspection programme would be planned to maximise control of American foul brood which is more serious, less widespread and unlike European foul brood does not lend itself to control through husbandry techniques.

 The effectiveness of measures to control European foul brood is subject to continuous assessment by the National Bee Unit and details of the incidence and treatment of the disease are published annually on its website. The use of antibiotic treatment has proved successful in many circumstances and colonies have recovered which would previously have been destroyed. Experimental use of the &quot;shook swarm&quot; technique, which does not use antibiotics, shows considerable promise for future control.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.

<a name="stpa_56">There are other ways of diverting wood from landfill, such as re-using or recycling it as a raw material in construction or for manufacturing wood based products. To encourage this, wood is one of the priority materials under the Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which was established to create markets for recycled materials. By 2006 WRAP are aiming for a 150,000 tonne increase in the recycling of waste wood into added-value end markets.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the amount of wood going into landfill; and what action she plans to take to reduce this amount. [195800]</p>








<p><a name="st_80"><a name="41116w08.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government have no basis for estimating the amount of wood being disposed of in landfills. However, it is committed to reducing the UK&#039;s reliance on landfill, in order to reduce its environmental impact and because landfilling is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste. This commitment applies to wood as it does to any other waste material. As a result, the Government encourages the re-use or recycling of wood as a raw material in construction or in manufacturing wood based products or used as a fuel, rather than being sent to landfill. In particular, wood is one of the priority materials under the Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), which was established to create markets for recycled materials. By 2006 WRAP are aiming for a 150,000 tonne increase in the recycling of waste wood into added-value end markets.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many <i>(a)</i> reported cases of and <i>(b)</i> successful prosecutions for breaches of maximum residue levels from pesticides there have been in each of the last five years.  [197581]</p>








<p><a name="st_88"><a name="41116w09.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The UK&#039;s surveillance programme for pesticide residues in food is overseen by the independent Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC). In 2003, 4,071 samples of imported or UK-produced food were tested for up to 149 different pesticide residues. The Maximum Residue Level (MRL) was exceeded in 27 (0.7 per cent.) samples. For previous years, the percentage of exceedances is similar, at around 1 per cent. All the results are available on the PRC&#039;s website at www.prc.org.

<p>
<a name="41116w09.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_62">MRLs are not safety limits. Statutory Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) have been established for many thousands of individual pesticides in individual crops. The purpose of MRLs is to regulate trade in treated food. They indicate that any pesticide was applied to crops or foodstuffs in accordance with the conditions of use set by the UK regulator, the Pesticides Safety Directorate, or equivalent organisations overseas. They are always set below, often far below, safety limits. The safety limit depends on many factors, which include the properties of the pesticide, the amount of residue, amount of food being consumed and whether this is in a single meal or over a longer period, and the body weight of the consumer (e.g. adult, child, infant).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w09.html_para3">

The county of Dorset, one of the early high performers on recycling, continues to make a substantial contribution to achieving national recycling targets.

 The UK has recently published a draft policy paper for consultation on the issue of aid conditionality, &quot;Partnerships for poverty reduction: changing aid conditionality.&quot; This paper (produced jointly by DFID, HM Treasury, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) makes a commitment to reducing the burden of conditionality while recognising the continuing relevance of conditions. After a period of consultation, DFID plans to finalise this policy statement in the first quarter of 2005.

<a name="stpa_105">DFID supports a range of reforms to improve the way that public money is spent and accounted for, and the way that public services are provided, especially to poor people. We recognise the sensitivity and contested nature of many policy reforms, including the privatisation of public services. This highlights the need for careful country-specific analysis to ensure that reforms are appropriately designed, as well as strong country ownership of any such initiative. DFID&#039;s draft policy suggests that in future we should only support reforms where partner governments have had space to debate&#151;including where appropriate in Parliament&#151;the full range of policy options, and have made their own decision informed by clear evidence of the benefits to poor people. As the UK policy paper makes clear, aid terms and conditions must support, not &quot;buy&quot; reform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w16.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_106">To improve the quality of policy design and implementation around issues such as privatisation, DFID continues to press for increased use of analytical tools such as Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA). By mid-2004 some 150 PSIA activities were being carried out. The results of this work are already indicating the need for a more careful use of policies such as privatisation: both in the nature of the reform of organisations, and in the need to ensure that the social protection functions of these organisations are taken into account. DFID recognises that there is a need to increase the number, and to improve the quality of PSIA, and to ensure that the results of PSIA are used effectively in the policy process. The World Bank has committed to more careful consideration of the significant distributional consequences of policies that they support. This will include greater use of PSIA to inform the policy choice. The Bank has also committed to report at the next annual meetings in 2005 on progress in the use of PSIA.

It is planned that the design authority for navigational buoys, as well as the supply of related mooring materials, will be transferred to the successful bidder who will have commissioned their own research to determine a solution that offers best value for money. Provision for this forms part of the range of services included in the Invitation to Negotiate. Separate discussions have been held with the General Lighthouse Authorities (Trinity House, Northern Lights and Irish Lights), non-departmental public bodies sponsored by the DfT, to determine whether they could take over the maintenance and upkeep of navigational buoys but it was concluded that such an arrangement offered little benefit to the MOD.

<a name="stpa_122">This is the second stage of the survey of family court cases concerning children and expert medical evidence, conducted by the ADSS this year following the judgment in the case of R <i>v.</i> Cannings. The first stage of the survey, the results of which are already in the Library, looked at the cases of children who were the subject of current care proceedings. Across the 130 local authorities who responded to first stage of the survey, disputed medical evidence featured, or was anticipated to feature, in only 47 out of 5,175 cases. Where the impact of this evidence was known, there was a change to the local authority&#039;s care plan in one case. The first 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Nov 2004 : Column 1294W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
stage of the survey did not consider children who were already the subject of a care or related order, which has been the subject of the second stage survey.

<p>
<a name="41116w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_123">Across the 127 local authorities that responded to the second stage survey, which was conducted during July and August 2004, 28,867 children were the subject of care orders or freeing orders on 31 March 2004. 26 cases involved a serious disagreement between medical expert witnesses. Of these, five cases involved a serious disagreement between medical expert witnesses in which any doubt has been expressed about reliability of the evidence following the judgment in R <i>v.</i> Cannings. Of these five cases, the care plan remains unchanged in three cases. In one case the plan had been changed already in light of new information reviewed in 2003 and in one case further consideration of medical evidence by the court is being awaited.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w19.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_124">The figures collected in this survey will not include any care orders which have previously been discharged through the courts on the basis that it is safe for the child to do so, quite independently of any specific review being undertaken by the local authority. Approximately 1,000 applications for discharge of current care orders are made each year, of which around 80 per cent. are granted. This survey only includes children who are currently under the care of the local authority&#151;not cases where the care order has been discharged.

<p>
<a name="41116w19.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_125">Expert witnesses&#039; medical evidence is only one of the many factors in the complex and difficult decision-making process that surrounds the safeguarding of children through the courts. As the survey shows, very few cases where children are currently being looked after by local authorities depend on the evidence of medical expert witnesses.

<p>
<a name="41116w19.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_126">The courts must have access to the best possible expert witnesses, and the Chief Medical Officer is currently leading a programme of work, expected to be completed by early 2005, to ensure the availability of competent, quality-assured medical expert resources to the family courts.

<a name="stpa_127">In addition, as I indicated in my statement to the House on 17 June, I am also now issuing a Local Authority Social Services Letter setting out key aspects of the recent Appeal Court cases of Re LB and Re LU, which make clear the implications of the criminal court judgment in R <i>v.</i> Cannings on family proceedings, and also details the case of Dr. Colin Paterson, currently suspended by the General Medical Council, pending an appeal, as a result of his activities as an expert witness.

<a name="stpa_128">Research undertaken by the Department has included &quot;The Skills for Life Survey: A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills&quot; (DfES, October 2003). This research provides an up-to-date assessment of the level of basic skills need for literacy, numeracy and ICT among adults aged 16&#150;65 years old in England. A copy of this survey has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

<p>
<a name="41116w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_129">In addition the Department is currently undertaking a longitudinal panel survey of adult basic skills learners, tracking a sample of learners and non-learners with a view to identifying the returns to basic skills learning (early findings from this study will be published in 2005). The Department has also conducted evaluations of the literacy and numeracy pathfinders that were established to test the new Skills for Life learning infrastructure. This included a survey of learners who had received training in the pathfinder areas to explore their experiences of literacy and numeracy learning. More details of DfES research are available through our website: www.dfes.gov.uk/research.

<a name="stpa_139">In 1999 the Government gained a commitment from LEAs to provide a full-time education for all permanently excluded pupils by September 2002. Findings from the EPEP survey indicated that on 30 September 2002, 143 LEAs were offering full-time education to pupils permanently excluded from school, and seven LEAs were not. Since this survey, better systems have been put in place to track pupils. Currently two LEAs are not providing full-time education for all their pupils. The Department continues to work through the Children&#039;s Services Improvement Advisers to support LEAs to sustain this commitment and provide high quality, full-time educational provision for all permanently excluded pupils.

As a result of these projects, AWM incurred &#163;16.2 million of revaluation losses and &#163;12.9 million of revaluation profits; though, since AWM was able to account for this on a portfolio basis, this produced an audited net property loss of &#163;3.3 million.

<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">The MHRA, in association with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, routinely carries out market surveillance by sampling and testing &#039;off the shelf medicines on the UK market for authentication. The target products for this surveillance are based on intelligence and risk assessments. To date, none of the tests has identified a counterfeit product.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">Due to the global nature of the problem of counterfeit medicines, the MHRA continues to liaise closely with international regulatory partners, the pharmaceutical industry and international law enforcement agencies to ensure that the tackling of counterfeiting medicines remains a prioritised and co-ordinated activity.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">The MHRA is actively consulting with the pharmaceutical industry and technology the providers in the area of its work on technical developments in product security, which are aimed to further safeguard the integrity of the medicines supply chain. This includes work with the National Patient Safety Agency and the NHS Patient and Supply Agency on the potential use of bar-coding medicines and blood products to increase patient safety. In addition, work is being done with the United States Food and Drug Administration in the use of sophisticated &#039;fingerprinting&#039; to identify active pharmaceutical ingredients as a means of product verification.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of <i>(a)</i> the differences between the MHP and MHEG digital standards and <i>(b)</i> the implications of one being preferred for use in the UK.  [198260]</p>








<p><a name="st_216"><a name="41116w22.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 MHEG-5 and MHP are closely related open API (application programming interface) standards for interactive digital television.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w22.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_149">MHP is a more advanced, complex and capable API which was developed several years after MHEG-5 was chosen by the UK free-to-air terrestrial TV broadcasters for the launch of their digital TV services. To enable the kinds of advanced interactive service which MHP can offer (but MHEG-5 cannot), the TV set needs to be connected to a telephone line, or other telecoms network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w22.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_150">MHP receivers are more expensive than MHEG-5 receivers; the MHP suite of standards is not yet complete or stable. To date, very few MHP applications 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Nov 2004 : Column 1306W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have been developed and interoperability problems are beginning to surface in countries (eg Italy) which are early adopters of MHP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_151">MHEG-5 is much more mature. Almost all digital terrestrial TV receivers in the UK incorporate MHEG-5, whereas other countries are seeing their market split between relatively expensive MHP receivers and simple &quot;zapper boxes&quot; without any API at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w22.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_152">A DTI-commissioned study on the technical issues of coexistence of MHEG-5 and MHP based services and on migration to MHP was completed in May 2002. Since then, further investigations, supported by DTI, have led to demonstrations of interactive services receivable on both MHEG-5 and MHP receivers. Work to align the two standards more closely is nearing completion. Manufacturers can now easily produce receivers supporting both standards. This MHP/MHEG capability is expected to be incorporated in &quot;baseline&quot; MHP receivers available across Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w22.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_153">The UK is well-placed to switch over to digital terrestrial TV, with MHEG-5 in the vast majority of receivers providing support for a raft of desirable interactive services. As MHP matures and becomes established in other markets, there is the prospect of the widespread adoption of MHP/MHEG-capable receivers in UK, particularly when the &quot;main&quot; TV comes up for replacement. This would open the way to an organic extension of simple interactive services based on MHEG-5 to advanced applications using MHP, taking advantage of a telecomms connection which users may well be persuaded to extend to their main receiver over the next few years.

 Because gas markets in other EU economies are less liberalised and competitive than those in the UK, there is not much open trading in wholesale markets and it is difficult to make meaningful price comparisons with those in the UK. On the Continent wholesale prices tend to be set through contract and linked to oil. However, unofficial data indicates that UK wholesale gas prices in October 2004 were comparable with wholesale prices at Zeebrugge in Belgium and the TTF trading hub in the Netherlands.

<i>[holding answer 4 November 2004]:</i> There are two types of liquid gas, liquid natural gas (LNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Natural gas is liquefied for storage or long distance transportation purposes. Currently there is little LNG used in the UK and its usage cannot be separately disaggregated from natural gas data. The latest annual figures for UK consumption of liquid petroleum gases (butane and propane) in 2003 were published in table 3.4 of the 2004 edition of the Digest of UK Energy Statistics. In 2003 UK consumption of LPG was 2.9 million tonnes of which 0.84 million tonnes were used by industry and 0.34 million tonnes by households. It is not possible to split this usage between heating and other energy uses such as cooking.

In practice MFP is calculated as a residual and is therefore subject to significant measurement error. For example MFP can be influenced by the mis-measurement of inputs, especially of the capital stock. Consequently, estimates of MFP are subject to substantial variation.

<a name="stpa_178">Nevertheless, the Government do recognise the value of critically evaluating estimates of MFP when undertaking productivity analysis, and considers estimates produced by a range of bodies including the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the University of Groningen and the US&#039; National Bureau of Economic Research. This MFP data are used to provide contextual information to support the analysis of labour productivity growth.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Nov 2004 : Column 1315W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

Because of the additional cost of the meter and the administrative infrastructure that supports it, prepayment tariffs are customarily higher than those of other payment methods, although the differential will vary from company to company. Prepayment meter users may, therefore, be able to reduce their energy bills by switching supplier, as well as by seeking a cheaper, simpler payment method, which will, for most customers, be direct debit.

We currently process benefits in all the offices within your constituency. The processing teams in each of these offices operate with 8 staff or less and we have concluded that we should consolidate the benefit processing work into a larger site. The move to a centralised operation will concentrate expertise and experience, ensure consistency of decision-making and bring continuity of service, thereby improving customer service.

Notes:<br>

1. Case load figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2. Figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. Figures are based on persons claiming severe disablement allowance, long term or short term incapacity benefit, credits only cases, and those persons claiming IB but who have their benefit extinguished for reasons such as an overlap with another benefit, or because of hospitalisation.<br>

4. Some IB/SDA end dates will have been estimated at the end of a quarter, where the true end date is not known.<br>

5. A person is counted only once in each year, regardless of the number of times they claim and subsequently leave each benefit. If however a claimant makes a claim to IB/SDA in more than one year shown then they will appear in each year&#039;s figures.<br>

6. SDA is not available to new claimants from 6 April 2001. From this point, disabled people, whose period of incapacity begins before the age of 20 (or 25 if in education or training before the age of 20), may be able to receive incapacity benefit without having to satisfy the national insurance contribution conditions. SDA recipients aged below 20 at the cut-off point will transfer on to IB at the long-term rate in April 2002. Existing recipients can continue to receive the benefit for as long as they satisfy the conditions of entitlement for the benefit.<br>

7. Figures for the latest period (2003&#150;04) will increase in due course because of late notifications not yet recorded on the computer system.<br>

8. Commencements include all benefit recipients and national insurance credits only cases.<br>

 There is no plan to relocate fire brigades, only to rationalise control services at a regional level. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that this will have implications for existing fire control staff. However, the skills of these staff are generally transferable, so there will be a premium on ensuring both that people who are not going to find jobs under the new arrangements are helped to relocate and secure other jobs and that the service will continue to operate in the most effective way. If staff were to lose their jobs, the redundancy package would be a matter

Implementation of the new contract is being supported in Northern Ireland by the investment of new monies in excess of &#163;44 million over 3 years.

<a name="stpa_372">The identity cards scheme will be covered by the Data Protection Act 1998 and will comply with the data protection principles set out at Schedule 1 of that Act. This will include the right of people to check the information recorded about them subject to exemptions set out in the Data Protection Act eg in cases of national security. The draft Bill sets clear limitations on the information which can be held on the scheme and requires the consent of a card holder before a check is made except in limited, specified circumstances such as checks by the police when a person has been arrested.

<p><a name="st_506"><a name="41116w55.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Identity Cards Programme has met a range of companies, including those in the IT sector, as part of its market sounding activities. Market sounding is the process of assessing the reaction of the market (that is, all potential suppliers considered collectively) to a proposed requirement and procurement approach , and is recognised as best practice in Government procurement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w55.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_373">Priority for market sounding to date has been given particularly to the smartcard and biometric sectors where the technology is developing quickly, standards are evolving and there is uncertainty about future trends. Seminars targeted at the IT sector have been run in conjunction with Intellect, the trade body for the UK based information technology, telecommunications and electronics industry and other events are being planned to address the wider requirements of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w55.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_374">Market sounding focuses on suppliers as a whole, rather than the merits of individual suppliers. It includes no element of supplier selection (choosing suitable suppliers) or bid evaluation (looking at proposals, technical solutions or prices). There is no commitment of any kind involved&#151;on either side nor any advantage to be gained by a supplier by getting involved. Further it is stressed that there is no formal procurement underway at the moment.

Together these different work strands will enable the EU to adopt a more intelligence-led, outcome focused policy towards managing the external border and combating illegal immigration.

<a name="stpa_377">The UK supports the continuing need to work in partnership with third countries to improve the management of migratory flows, addressing the factors that encourage or force people to leave their countries and preventing illegal immigration, including people smuggling and trafficking.

The Immigration and Nationality Directorate Intelligence Service, among others, was asked by the Commission to trial the system.

The system allows member states (MS) to notify events such as large scale migration, movements of suspect ships and other information to combat illegal immigration.

Legislation has also been introduced to restrict the capacity to authorise marriage involving non-EEA nationals to designated register offices, which will enable us to focus our enforcement efforts into a more concentrated area, and also allow intelligence and expertise on marriage abuse to be built up in these dedicated centres. In addition, a new pre-marriage lawful status eligibility requirement will be introduced for marriages involving non-EEA foreign nationals to further deal with those seeking to circumvent immigration controls by entering into sham marriages. This would give registrars the power to refuse to accept notification of marriage in the absence of a document from the Home Office or an entry clearance for marriage.

 Prisoners in London establishments spend an average of 9.7 hours a week engaged in work related purposeful activity. The Prison Service continues to provide work opportunities for as many prisoners as possible. The figure is an average for all prisoners in London establishments. These establishments are mainly local prisons which serve the courts, and contain a high proportion of remand prisoners. As remand prisoners are not obliged to undertake work, their numbers bring down the overall average of work related hours. Additionally, local prisons are most likely to experience high levels of overcrowding and the amount of work available for each prisoner will naturally diminish as the population increases.

 In 1996, a study was conducted at Her Majesty&#039;s Young Offender Institution (HMYOI) Aylesbury by &#039;Natural Justice&#039;, a research charity investigating the relationship between nutrition and criminal behaviour. They reported a significant reduction in offending behaviour amongst young offenders who had taken nutritional supplements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w59.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_401">Half of the young men participating received pills containing vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids. The other half received placebo or dummy pills. The researchers recorded the number and type of offences each of the prisoners committed in the nine months before they received the pills and in the nine months during the trial. They found that the group that received the supplements committed 25 per cent. fewer offences than those who had been given the placebo.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w59.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_402">The results were independently reviewed by the Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) at the Home Office. RDS acknowledged that the results of the study showed a positive effect on behaviour. However, the number of participants involved was small and the study did not follow through to see whether re-offending reduced or continued once the trainees had left the establishment. This made it very difficult to validate wider implications from the results.

<p>
<a name="41116w59.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_403">Natural Justice have plans to replicate the project on a much broader scale. Approval was given in October 2002 for Natural Justice to have access to Warren Hill and Stoke Heath if they could satisfy ethical requirements and obtain funding for the research. On similar grounds, the Scottish Prison Service approved access to Polmont.

<a name="stpa_404">Beyond this research, other work is taking place to ensure that individual prisoners are encouraged to eat healthily, and that the food provided is nutritious.

<p><a name="st_543"><a name="41116w59.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The specific information requested is not available. A wide range of counselling and support mechanisms are available to prisoners. Counselling in drug and substance misuse is provided in every prison establishment as part of the Counselling, Assessment, Referral and Treatment (CARAT) programme. Individual establishments also have arrangements for the provision of professional counselling services through both primary care trusts and local voluntary sector providers. Referrals to outside counselling services can be made through psychology, health care, the chaplaincy and mental health in-reach teams.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41116w59.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_407">In common with arrangements in the community, counselling services are generally provided during normal working hours and not on a 24 hour basis. 24-hour support is, however, normally available to prisoners through listener schemes, whereby prisoners who have been trained by the Samaritans are available to provide emotional support to other prisoners. Prisoners also have access to the Samaritans by telephone.

<p>
<a name="41116w59.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_408">By their very nature many counselling and support services operate on a strictly confidential basis. While comprehensive information about the reasons for seeking counselling is not available, the areas covered include physical, emotional and sexual abuse; family issues and relationship problems; suicidal and self-harm tendencies; substance abuse; and offending behaviour.

 As a service provider, the Prison Service is fully aware of its obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act and seeks to ensure it meets the needs of all visitors, including those with disabilities. Visitors accompanied by an assistance dog are welcome at prison establishments and certainly would not be excluded on this basis. However, a reasonable adjustment may need to be made to accommodate the dog and to ensure there is no distraction to patrol or passive drug dogs on site. For this reason, it is advisable that the prison is notified of any special requirements in advance of the visit.

 All establishments must appoint a race relations liaison officer to provide information to staff and prisoners on national and local policies and to monitor race relations within the establishment. Race relations liaison officers are allocated a core minimum of eight hours a week, with additional hours dependent on the nature of the establishment. An increasing number of establishments have also appointed full-time diversity officers. These are usually prisons that are large, have a large minority ethnic prisoner population, or are in an isolated location making community links difficult to organise.

<p>
<a name="41116w61.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_419">Speeding offences are also dealt with by fixed penalty notice. Fixed penalty income usually goes to the Consolidated Fund. Under the provisions of the national safety camera programme, however, local partnerships of police, magistrates courts and local authorities can net off as much income from fixed penalties resulting from camera enforcement as is needed to meet the approved costs of such enforcement. Income cannot be netted off for other purposes. The London Partnership, of which the Metropolitan police are part, was established in 2002. In its first year, it netted off approved costs of &#163;4,549,380.

 No. Overseas students are already allowed to take part-time employment during term time up to a maximum of 20 hours per week. They are also allowed to work full-time during vacation periods. This follows the general principle which traditionally allows students to take employment that is incidental to study and to supplement their income. It strikes a sensible balance between the permitted number of working hours and the minimum of 15 hours of organised daytime study required by the Immigration Rules. There are no plans to change this.

<p><a name="st_565"><a name="41116w62.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Penalty notices for theft and criminal damage will be targeted at low level offences, normally those committed by first time offenders. The operational guidance issued to the police advises that the value should not exceed &#163;200 for theft with values over &#163;100 deemed exceptional, and over &#163;500 for criminal damage with values above &#163;300 deemed exceptional. Where an officer considers an offence suitable for a fixed penalty notice he is required to consult the victim and advise that this will remove the possibility of a criminal court awarding a compensation order. However, compensation may still be pursued through the civil courts.
