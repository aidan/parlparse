 On 26 August the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) jointly published a consultation paper on draft regulations for transfer to the ownership of the water and sewerage companies of private sewers and lateral drains which drain to the public sewerage system in England and Wales. The consultation, supplemented by a series of workshops held jointly with WAG, seeks final responses by 18 November. To date, DEFRA has received many representations from the drainage industry. The current consultation follows earlier consultations on the subject in 2003 and 2007, to which DEFRA also received many responses, and is available via the DEFRA website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="101111w0001.htm_para7"><a name="10111164000094">In addition to the formal consultation process, DEFRA has been working closely with a steering group including the water industry regulator Ofwat, the Environment Agency, Water UK, the Consumer Council for Water, WAG, other Government Departments and representatives of local authorities, the insurance industry, house builders and the drainage industry. DEFRA has also held meetings with more specialist groups including representatives of the pump installation and maintenance industry, to hear their views and gather evidence. Representations from the independent drainage sector have focused on concern about the approach taken by the water and sewerage companies to the procurement of maintenance services after transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="101111w0001.htm_para8"><a name="10111164000095">The current impact assessment was published with the August consultation paper. It estimates the transfer to result in an increase in annual sewerage bills in the range £3 to £14. This includes the cost of the transfer of private pumping stations, based on an estimated number of 22,000. It also contains a Small Firms Impact Test and considers the benefits to householders including reduced incidence of blockages, which can result in sewer flooding. It is not anticipated that incidence of surface water flooding will be significantly affected. The impact assessment will be updated in the light of the outcome of the consultation.</p>

 In my written ministerial statement on 16 September 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 64-66WS, the Government announced proposed changes to arrangements for the provision of interpretation and translation services across the justice sector.

Until the work is complete it is not possible to provide an accurate assessment of any potential costs arising from the directive.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not retain central records of the staff turnover rate in individual country offices and has not made a specific assessment of the impact of staff turnover on project outcomes. The majority of DFID staff in-country are locally engaged staff (known as Staff Appointed in Country) who provide a high level of continuity in managing programmes and projects. Around one-third of staff in-country are UK-based Home Civil Servants, who typically serve between one and three years in post before moving to another job. The timing of moves for UK-based staff are carefully managed by heads of country offices in order to minimise the impact on programme outcomes.</p>

 Following the spending review settlement we are now scrutinising all aspects of departmental expenditure, to ensure that we deliver the most effective range of services possible at the best value for money. Access to Work will be part of this. Budgets for directly delivered programmes such as Access to Work are subject to in-year review and it is not possible to specify in advance the amounts that will be spent. Information on spend is however available after the end of a financial year.</p>

Our assessment is that both communities in Jos have suffered discrimination in various ways, and appalling loss of life in inter-communal violence this year.

 Whether a visiting Minister of a foreign government is entitled to immunity from arrest in the UK will depend on the status of the person concerned, whether they are travelling on official government business, as well as on other considerations. By virtue of their office, immunities will attach to visiting Heads of State, Heads of Government and Ministers of Foreign Affairs, as well as, by extension, other Ministers who travel by virtue of their office. The extent to which such immunities may attach to other visiting senior officials will fall to be determined case by case depending on their status and the reasons for their visit to the UK.</p>

The performance element of pay is colloquially known as a bonus, but it is a misleading description because the performance-related element of pay is not additional, it is part of the departmental pay bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="101111w0002.htm_para55"><a name="10111178000185">For the senior civil service (SCS) performance incentives are paid primarily as non-consolidated performance payments. Any award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers and awards are made to those judged to have made the greatest in-year contribution to business objectives. There is no restriction on the nature of the contribution but it must benefit the Department or defence more widely. Recommendations for awards are considered by moderation committees and must be linked to clear evidence of delivery.</p>

Those employed as senior fixed term appointees (FTAs) are on individual contracts and have a higher percentage of pay set to performance awards which are judged against stringent and stretching delivery based objectives. Some have staged payments and it is now usual to pay a smaller annual performance award with the remainder deferred for two to three years and judged against the delivery of medium to longer term objectives. Performance is judged by line management with assistance from senior officials, stakeholders, remuneration committees and in some cases internal audit.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 November 2010]:</i> The defence and security treaty strengthens the United Kingdom's bilateral relationship with France and offers significant operational, technological and financial benefits. These will be achieved through sharing development and equipment costs, eliminating unnecessary duplication, coordinating logistics, and aligning our research programmes. The treaty also provides the framework for closer co-operation, and improved interoperability, between our armed forces. It will lead to more capable and effective forces and improve our collective defence capability to the benefit of NATO, the UN and the EU.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 November 2010]:</i> In the context of contributing to deficit reduction, my Department has sought to achieve savings through a series of radical reforms and by taking a tougher approach to efficiency. Within a smaller spending envelope, this is leading to reductions in real activity, i.e. lower programme spend in particular areas-such as spend previously provided via the RDAs.</p>

 Our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of public funds for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible.

HEFCE will monitor the financial health and sustainability of institutions to protect the public investment in higher education.
