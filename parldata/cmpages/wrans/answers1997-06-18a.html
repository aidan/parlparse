<P>
<a name="70618w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Past criteria for inclusion in the au pair scheme reflected restriction to unmarried young people mainly from western European countries and the exclusion of countries which proved a significant source of immigration abuse. We have no plans at present to review the scheme.

<P>
<a name="70618w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Clark: </B> 
 In the first instance, it is for the Minister responsible for each particular agency to ensure that it is operating efficiently and the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review will help this process. In addition, agencies submit their proposals on efficiency as part of the efficiency planning process and in the 1996 Next Steps Review published in March, there is a great deal of comparative data for agencies including an evaluation of their performance against their efficiency targets. We are committed to providing government which costs less and delivers more which includes Next Steps agencies operating efficiently by emphasising the need for training and enhancing the use of benchmarking and target setting.

<a name="70618w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The LSE study into performance-related pay looks at only one Department, that of the Inland Revenue. The study was sponsored by the Public Services Tax and Commerce Union and covers perceptions about performance management and performance pay amongst 1,200 of the Inland Revenue's 55,000 staff. The study is not yet complete and has not been released. I am therefore unable to comment on it at this stage. If the study does raise issues of general staff concern, the Inland Revenue, as a good employer, will discuss these with the staff and trade unions involved.

 Tackling obesity is a particularly challenging problem.

However in 1995 15 per cent. of men and 16.5 per cent. of women were obese, highlighting the gravity of the problem. Obesity is a long-term problem and needs a long-term strategy.

Safety is the paramount consideration and positive evidence of this, including the results of specified toxicological tests, is required before approval is given.

The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt initiative, which aims to reduce the debts of qualifying countries to affordable levels, will play an important part in helping to achieve this. My right hon.

<a name="70618w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Responsibility for monitoring illegal fly tipping, clearance of the wastes involved and pursuing offenders, lies with a number of organisations. The Environment Agency is actively working with these organisations to gather reliable information on fly tipping and other forms of illegal waste disposal.
<P>

<a name="70618w04.html_para1">Most notably a co-operative exercise is planned between the Environment Agency, Local Government and the Tidy Britain Group to survey the incidence of fly tipping twelve months on from the introduction of the landfill tax.

<P>

<a name="70618w04.html_para2">Further co-operative surveys are planned with the emphasis on improving the quality of data collected by using standard definitions of waste types and quantities.
<P>

<a name="70618w04.html_para3">The evidence of increased fly tipping gathered to date is not conclusive, and may reflect increased public awareness and concern over fly tipping rather than a demonstrable increase in incidents. Nevertheless the Environment Agency are treating this matter very seriously and are working with local authorities to co-ordinate any necessary enforcement action.

 Local planning authorities already have adequate powers to influence the siting of transmission masts for cellular phone networks that are more than 10 metres in height. Under the prior approval procedure of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, local planning authorities have the opportunity to say whether they wish to approve, within 28 days, details of the siting and appearance of permitted mast development of up to 15 metres high proposed by licensed telecommunications code system operators outside protected areas. The authority is able to refuse approval if it considers there to be a serious threat to amenity. A full planning application must be made to the local planning authority for all masts proposed in protected areas, such as a National Park, area of outstanding natural beauty or conservation area, and for all masts of more than 15 metres in height elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's response to the Environment Committee's Report has been issued today and copies have been placed in the Library. The response addresses the Committee's conclusions and recommendations relating to Government policy on pollution control, planning, waste management and health issues. It also comments on the Committee's criticism of the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency has issued its own response, which covers the majority of the Committee's recommendations, since these concern the Agency's enforcement role.
<P>

<a name="70618w05.html_para1">The Government has welcomed the Select Committee's careful consideration of this issue and sees the report as a very valuable contribution to public debate, not only on this important subject, but also on broader issues of environmental protection. The Government's response affirms its commitment to regulation industry to prevent harm to human health and minimise impacts on the environment as a whole. The Committee has made a number of trenchant criticisms of the Environment Agency's regulation of the cement industry. In particular it found inadequacies in the Agency's public consultation procedures, lack of consistency in application of environmental standards and deficiencies in the regulation of Castle Cement's Clitheroe works. The Government is deeply concerned that the Committee should have felt it necessary to make such criticisms. The Environment Agency has accepted the Committee's criticism and responded to it positively, with an extensive plan of action designed to bring about better public consultation, improve research and guidance and contribute to further studies of the health effects of pollutants.
<P>

<a name="70618w05.html_para2">I have made clear in discussions with the Agency that the Government expects it to be a fair and rigorous regulator in all its dealings with industry. It must set appropriate standards which fully protect public health and the environment, and then enforce them firmly. The Agency's management has assured me that it is committed to the changes which are needed to ensure that industrial pollution is controlled in a manner which will command the full confidence of Parliament and the public. I can assure Members of this House that I intend to hold the Agency to that promise.

 The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 already makes it an offence to sell a car, in the course of a business, with a false odometer reading. Some prosecutions are also taken under the Theft Act 1968.

 Awards under the Historic Buildings Repair Grant scheme to Hopetoun House Preservation Trust over the past 5 years have amounted to &#163;272,400. In addition, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise have provided &#163;72,600 towards refurbishments. These sums, paid from programmes for which I am responsible, have contributed towards work which has been satisfactorily completed.

 No. I have instituted a review of options for implementing our election manifesto pledge to grant the Post Office greater commercial freedom, and against this background the Post Office have agreed to suspend their Crown office conversion programme. However, whilst the Government are committed to a nationwide network of post offices, the location of individual post offices must remain an operational matter for the Post Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Miller: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what was the outcome of the Energy Council meeting held on 27 May. [4832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Council considered several issues and received reports on matters of interest. I represented the UK.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para0">The Council discussed gas market liberalisation and the renewable energy green paper. First, the gas liberalisation directive: progress was made which I believe puts us on course to achieve a liberalising measure. Discussion centred on three key issues; a framework for market opening, take or pay contracts and emergent markets and regions. I emphasised the Government's commitment to the single market and called for a positive commitment to gas liberalisation through an effective third party access regime as well as market opening so that customers can get the benefits of competition.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para1">On the basis of the views expressed the presidency concluded that on market opening a qualitative approach with quantitative criteria could form the basis for a compromise. This should include power generators and large industrial customers as eligible customers; a minimum percentage opening of gas markets; the possibility of Member States limiting market opening above a certain level; and a progressive market opening. On take or pay contracts discussion focused on the possibility of derogating from the directive if problems arose with future contracts. The presidency concluded that there was support for a system characterised by transparency, well formulated criteria and the involvement of national independent gas authorities and 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 1997 : Column: 190</I><P>
the Commission in any such decisions. On emergent markets the presidency concluded that there was broad support for the proposal to allow Member States only now developing a gas market and those not directly connected to another EU system and having a single external supplier, to derogate from parts of the directive. On emergent regions there was support for further consideration of an approach whereby regions eligible for derogations were listed in an annex.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para2">The presidency's proposals were recognised as a step in the right direction and a good basis for progress in further discussions at a possible second Council on 24 June.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para3">Council also reached agreement on a resolution on the Commission's Green Paper on a renewable strategy. There was some discussion of the Commission's proposal for a Council decision concerning a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community-ALTERNER II. I emphasised that the UK was very positive about renewable and keen to achieve increased targets for renewable energy electricity generation.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para4">There was an exchange of views on the Commission communication on an overall view of energy policy. I welcomed the communication as a first step in the review of Community programmes with an energy component and supported the concept of a framework programme to provide greater transparency for the citizens of Europe and value for money. In order to dovetail with this framework, I suggested ALTERNER II should be limited to a tighter two year programme. The Commission is expected to present a further communication before the end of 1997.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para5">Council conclusions were agreed on climate change and energy policy. They recognised the contribution of actions towards climate change commitments particularly in the development of a renewables strategy, energy efficiency standards, long-term agreements with industry and an electricity industry initiative to address environmental concerns. The conclusions call for further analysis, the preparation of a post-Kyoto action programme and a strategy for the promotion of combined heat and power.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para6">The Commission will submit a revised proposal on energy objectives which will take into account the European Parliament's comments.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para7">The Council noted Commission progress reports on the external dimension of energy networks, the Energy Charter Treaty, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and information on agreements with industry on energy savings and on co-generation.
<P>

<a name="70618w10.html_para8">The first structured dialogue on energy with the countries of central and eastern Europe (CEECs) focused on energy efficiency and Trans European energy Networks (TENs). CEEC ministers outlined the measures they were taking to increase energy efficiency, develop renewable and meet EU standards. The progress being made with the help of EU programmes, particularly in the areas of TENs, was welcomed and it was agreed that co-operation should continue.

<a name="70618w10.html_para10">It is for a well informed, individual purchaser to decide for himself what he needs in his own particular case. As for any other hardware or software supply issue, the details of conformance and performance are best covered in a discussion or specification and agreed by commercial negotiation. The law already provides a remedy for the purchaser of defective goods under The Sale of Goods Act 1979 and for services under the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, and I see no need for fresh legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many secondary schools in Staffordshire offered the teaching of more than one foreign language to <i>(a)</i> GCSE level and <i>(b)</i> A level in the latest year for which figures are available; what assessment he has made of the advantages of all such

schools offering more than one foreign language to these levels; and what plans he has to change the national curriculum requirement in respect of the number of foreign languages to be offered. [4032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The latest figures we have are for the 1995-96 school year and relate to pupils attempting GCSE or GCE A level examinations in two or more foreign languages. We do not have separate information on how many pupils were actually taught the languages. All of the seventy-one secondary schools in Staffordshire had pupils tgaking at least two GCSEs in foreign languages. The most popular languages were French, German and Spanish. Forty-six had pupils taking at least two GCE A levels in foreign languages. French and German were by far the most popular languages at that level.
<P>

<a name="70618w11.html_para2">All secondary schools must now teach pupils at least one modern foreign language, and they are free to offer more than one if they have the resources to do so and the demand is there. Foreign language learning is important in promoting international understanding, and in providing insights into other cultures, and our own. For the United Kingdom as a trading nation, competence in modern foreign languages is of crucial importance in an increasingly competitive world. Nineteen modern foreign languages are eligible to be National Curriculum foundation subjects.
<P>

<a name="70618w11.html_para3">We have promised stability in the National Curriculum at key stages 1 to 3 until the year 2000. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority are currently monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the revised National Curriculum introduced in schools in 1995, and will provide advice to Ministers in due course on the need for and nature of any future modifications.

<a name="70618w12.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 We are currently developing a range of measures to encourage young people to continue their education after the age of 16, which will carry forward the commitments made in our election manifesto within the limitations of current public expenditure plans. This will be our Target 2000 programme. I hope to be able to make an early announcement on the details of a number of initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what percentage of <i>(a)</i> female and <i>(b)</i> male children leave school at 16 years, broken down into local authority areas; and if he will make a statement.[3668]<P>

<P>
<a name="70618w12.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The following table shows the percentage of 16 year olds who had left school by LEA in 1994-95. Many who leave school at 16 will continue with their education and training, for example in further education colleges, sixth form colleges or in the workplace. Figures for males and females separately could only be made available at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for education and Employment what plans he has to help secondary school children who suffer from dyslexia. [3973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We need first to ensure that dyslexia is picked up before children reach secondary school. The Code of Practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs emphasises the need for the <i>early </i> identification of special educational needs. The proposals for a national curriculum for initial teacher training and baseline assessment will help teachers identify children with dyslexia when they first start school. Beyond that, the Department is currently funding a number of research projects directly related to dyslexia. One in particular at the Manchester Metropolitan University, aims to establish those practices for assessment and intervention which teachers have found effective for use in the ordinary classroom. We will make sure that the findings from these projects are disseminated to teachers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w12.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Morris: </B> 
 Each local education authority is responsible for setting its own budget and deciding its priorities between and within services, including special educational needs. The Government's role is to set the overall framework for the funding of local authority services nationally, and to determine the way in which national "standard spending" totals are distributed between local authorities, through the standard spending assessment system. The way in which we propose to develop policy on provision for special educational needs will be set out in the forthcoming education White Paper.

 The White Paper setting out the Government's agenda for raising standards in schools will be published in early July. We are planning a period of consultation going well into the Autumn term. We want all those involved in education to join in that process and are seeking the most effective ways of making sure they are aware of and can respond to the proposals. We will be setting out details of the consultation process when the White Paper is published.

 The secretariat of the independent Women's National Commission has been transferred to the Department of Social Security along with five other officials from the Sex and Race Equality Division in my Department. The rest of that Division will continue to deal with issues affecting equality of opportunity for men and women (and racial equality) in education, training and employment.

 Unauthorised absence blights pupils' educational chances. With our partners in the education service we will be examining the scope for reinforcing parents' understanding of their legal responsibilities for ensuring regular attendance at school, including wider use of home/school agreements. We will also be consulting about new guidance for schools and LEAs drawing on good practice in effective follow-up of unjustified absences and will encourage greater use of existing enforcement powers where appropriate.

 In the current financial year 1997-98, the specific grant paid under Section 488 of the Education Act 1996 will be supporting some &#163;10 million of expenditure to meet the additional educational needs of Traveller children. The grant provides in the main for the employment of specialist teachers and education welfare officers to help ensure that Traveller children have full access to school, and that parents know and comply with their responsibilities for their children's attendance.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 1997]:</i> The costs to local education authorities of administering the new arrangements for early years education should be less than those of administering the nursery education voucher scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w14.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Mowlam: </B> 
 There are currently 53 members of the Commonwealth all of which issue passports in differing formats and numerous languages. Adding some or indeed all of these documents to the list of specified documents would place an unreasonable burden on polling station officials who already have to be familiar with the standardised passport issued by member states of the European Union. It would be unrealistic to expect the Chief Electoral Officer's staff to recognise and verify the authenticity of such a range of documents which could increase the opportunities for forgery and abuse of the system.

 Information on job creations is not available in the manner requested or by location. However, details of jobs promoted by the Industrial Development Board in 1996-97 are available by district council area and are set out in the table. The Industrial Development Board's own research shows that companies create approximately 70 per cent. of all promoted jobs over a period of three to five years after acceptance of the Industrial Development Board's offer of assistance.

 It is quite normal for company employment to fluctuate in response to market forces and technological developments.

He also visited the European Parliament. At these meetings, Dr. Cunningham indicated the Government's determination to secure a lifting of the ban for all regions of the UK in accordance with the Florence Agreement. The Minister has also met with the Dutch President of the Council and has further plans to meet individual Council members. Further meetings with Commission officials are taking place in the wake of the Scientific Veterinary Committee's report of 11 June.

 One of our key aims is that delivery of service should be simpler and more efficient. Queries on operational matters concerning the War Pensions Agency are for its Chief Executive Mr. Kevin Caldwell. I have asked him to write to the hon. Member.
<i>Letter from K. C. Caldwell to Mr. Hilton Dawson, dated 7 June 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the recent conference of war pensions staff.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has received no representations regarding the conference.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Chief Executive of the War Pensions Agency, approval of a conference of this nature falls within my authority. My approval of the conference followed normal Departmental guidelines and I am content that the conference represented good value for money.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency does not maintain on-site facilities that would be appropriate for a conference of this nature.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The conference, involving 26 delegates of all grades within the Agency, was designed to identify how the Agency could improve the levels of service offered to war pensioners. As you may be aware, the Agency has made significant recent improvements in service levels as measured against Secretary of State targets and to continue this improvement it is important that we seek to identify and resolve any significant barriers to service or performance improvement. The action plans and detailed task lists which were created will help the hundreds of staff in the operational group at the Agency to sustain improved performance. Another great advantage of this event was the opportunity to enthuse and motivate the people who attended--as an accredited Investors in People organisation we look for opportunities to do this.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Events of this nature are extremely rare in the Agency (this is the first in my term as Chief Executive) and are strictly limited to circumstances where the benefit clearly outweighs the cost. I have no hesitation in providing my personal assurance that the conference represented good value for money.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> under the age of 25 years have lost entitlement to benefit following the introduction of the jobseeker's allowance. [1465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para0">Transitional provisions ensured that people who were in receipt of Unemployment Benefit and/or Income Support for the unemployed at the point of change kept entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA).
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para1">Jobseekers lose entitlement to JSA if they fail to be available for work, to seek work actively, or to have a jobseeker's agreement in place. Just under 7,000 people lost entitlement for these reasons between 7 October and 31 December 1996, the latest date for which information is available. Additionally JSA payments (but not underlying entitlement) cease if jobseekers are sanctioned. There were just over 21,000 sanctions in this same period. Separate figures for under 25 year olds are not available.
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para2">Jobseekers who can demonstrate that they would otherwise suffer hardship can receive hardship payments.
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para3">Our welfare to work programme will help get young unemployed people, long term unemployed people and lone mothers off benefit and into work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to change the regulations covering the formulae used by the CSA to assess liability for payments; and if she will make a statement. [1652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 We are aware of the concerns which have been expressed about the child support formula. We will be looking closely at this area over the coming months as part of our wider consideration of the Child Support Agency.

<P>
<a name="70618w16.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what analysis she has made of the proportion of absent parents with a full maintenance assessment who are paying maintenance through the Child Support Agency. [4508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 Recent figures show that only some 32 per cent. of absent parents with a full maintenance assessment and making payment through the Child Support Agency are paying the full amount due.
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para4">Children are entitled to the support of both parents wherever they live. Absent parents need to fulfil their responsibilities. It is not acceptable that so many do not pay the maintenance they owe. Over the coming months we will be looking closely at all aspects of the operations of the Child Support Agency to ensure that it provides an efficient and effective service.

<a name="70618w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 We have no immediate plans to introduce a mortgage benefit. However, this Government is committed to streamlining and modernising the tax and benefit systems to fulfil the objectives of promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthening community and family life.
<P>

<a name="70618w16.html_para5">We recently announced that Martin Taylor (the Chief Executive of Barclays PLC) will lead a Whitehall Task Force to look at the problems caused by the interaction of the tax and benefit systems.

<P>
<a name="70618w17.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Government propose to take a range of initiatives designed to ensure that all fishing vessels in the UK abide by the rules.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 1997 : Column: 219</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70618w17.html_para6">The Fisheries Departments will continue to give priority to fair and effective enforcement. In 1997-98 some &#163;24 million will be spent on enforcement, including surface and aerial surveillance. We are determined to bear down on those who disregard the law. If fish stocks are to be conserved fisheries regulations must be respected.
<P>

<a name="70618w17.html_para7">We have considered whether the existing conditions of fishing licences need to be strengthened to assist enforcement. A matter of particular concern is the practice of allegedly discarding, after inspection at sea but prior to landing, marketable fish which have been sorted, stowed on board and recorded in EC logbooks. This practice appears to be used to evade the proper operation of quotas and is inconsistent with the conservation of fish stocks. Subject to consultation with the Commission and our fishing industry, we propose to introduce as soon as possible a new licence condition which addresses this problem.
<P>

<a name="70618w17.html_para8">The Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen has powers to terminate a fishing vessel's registration if, taking into account any requirement of merchant shipping legislation relevant to its safety or that of its crew, he considers that it would be inappropriate for the vessel to remain registered. In the interests of safety, it is proposed that the Registrar General will serve notice of the intention to terminate the registration of any fishing vessel which fails to hold a valid safety certificate.
<P>

<a name="70618w17.html_para9">In addition, we shall be making arrangements for British Sea Fishery Officers to assist the Department of Transport by detaining in port fishing vessels which do not have valid fishing vessel safety certificates, as well as checking that fishing vessels are manned by crew holding the appropriate certificates, including UK Certificates of Equivalent Competency (CECs) in the case of foreign qualified crew.
<P>

<a name="70618w17.html_para10">Finally, the Department of Transport and Fisheries Departments have reviewed the requirements for masters and officers of larger fishing vessels to be competent in the use of English. It has been concluded that these provisions are adequate. Certificates of competency, including CECs, already require a sound knowledge of English. The more rigorous checking of officers' certificates will help to ensure that these requirements are properly complied within the interests of safety.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Under EU law, member states must operate either the Calf Processing Scheme (CPAS) or the Early Marketing Scheme for veal, or both. The aim of both schemes is to reduce oversupply on the EU beef market following a decline in consumption. The UK has opted for the CPAS because it more directly tackles the problem of the sudden loss of markets for UK calves following the imposition of the beef export ban. As at 13 June 1997, a total of 636,471 calves had been slaughtered of which 597,044 were dairy and 39,427 non-dairy breeds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All beef producers have been affected in varying degrees by the current low market price for finished cattle. Thus all producers, regardless of their geographical location or farming system, would urge the case for affording them special assistance. In considering any case put to us for such assistance, the Government have to be mindful of the tight constraints which currently apply to public expenditure and the extent to which the provision of such assistance would distort the proper functioning of the market. Such distortion might simply insulate producers from the realities of the market-place and encourage unrealistic expectations of the level of future returns.

 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1997]:</i> We have considered this very carefully. The Government act on the scientific advice of the independent advisory committees set up by the Medicines Act 1968 and the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. Their current advice is that organophosphourus sheep dips and pesticides can be used safely in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Further work is in hand to emphasis the importance of using and disposing of these products safely including an updated leaflet "Sheep Dipping" which will be sent to sheep farmers later this year. The Government attach great importance to this work.

We have also asked GMSC Wales and the Welsh Association of fundholding Practices to work with us to determine the direction of Health Care in the Principality, building on current best practice. Changes are needed to the existing arrangements but it is important that they are the right changes.

 Our Manifesto for Wales identified a comprehensive package of measures in support of small firms.

 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1997]:</i> The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 6 May that operational responsibility for setting interest rates would be transferred to the Bank of England; that legislation placing this responsibility on a statutory footing would be introduced as soon as possible; and that, during the intervening period until the legislation came into force, all aspects of the new arrangements for making and announcing decisions on monetary policy would operate on a de facto basis.

 It is the job of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee to set interest rates to achieve the Government's inflation target. In doing that the Committee will take into account a wide range of information, including fiscal policy measures.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) by what means the interests of <i>(a)</i> manufacturing industry and <i>(b)</i> British regions are taken into account by the Bank of England in determining interest rates; [3263]
<P>
<UL>(2) how the views and needs of manufacturing industry in <i>(a)</i> Scotland and <i>(b)</i> the English regions in respect of interest and exchange rates are to be assessed by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee; and if he proposes to incorporate representatives of Scotland and the English regions in the process of considering interest rate changes. [4036]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In determining interest rates, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England will be able to draw on the information gained from business surveys, and the Bank's network of regional agents which cover the whole of the United Kingdom. The bank's agents have widespread contacts with companies, both large and small, and other organisations covering all sectors of the economy.

<a name="70618w20.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list those OECD countries where central banks determine interest rates <i>(a)</i> without regional representation to the Bank and <i>(b)</i> without a contract between bank and Government setting out the bank's targets. [3264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 All central banks tend to take regional developments into account when setting interest rates. The form of regional representation, however, varies across countries with independent central banks. For example, in Germany and the US regional central bank presidents sit on the Committee determining interest rates. In contrast, there is no such regional representation in other countries, such as New Zealand. With regard to contracts, in some countries, for example Germany, central banks determine interest rates without formal agreement with the respective government. In other countries, more less formal agreements exist, as in the case of Canada.

 The Government aim to achieve lasting economic stability through prudent economic management and sound finance. Co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policy will be assisted by having the Treasury representative on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee in a non-voting capacity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w20.html_spnew16"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The new arrangements will ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee is fully accountable for its interest rate decisions to the Government, Parliament and the people. It will be accountable to Parliament through the Treasury Select Committee, which will have the opportunity to examine the Bank's performance on monetary policy on a regular basis.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the performance of the Bank of England in managing the Government's cash reserves. [3240]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70618w20.html_spnew17"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Currently, the Government's cash management is handled by the Bank of England as a part of its money market operations by which short-term interest rates are influenced. It is therefore difficult to separate the costs of cash management from the costs of administering monetary policy. However, the total cash needs of Government are automatically managed through coordination of the Exchequer's accounts at the Bank to minimise the amount of gross overnight borrowing required by Government.

<P>
<a name="70618w21.html_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The decision to give the Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest rates means that it is important to separate the Government's debt and cash management from the conduct of monetary policy to avoid conflicts of interest. The separation is intended to ensure that debt and cash management decisions continue to be taken in such a way as to minimise the cost of financing the Government's borrowing needs subject to risk and are not influenced by short-term monetary policy considerations (and <i>vice versa</i>).

The Bank has offered valuable policy advice with regard to debt management and has conducted operations for the Government in the gilts market in an efficient and professional manner. The Bank has taken the lead in recent reforms to gilts market structure, notably gilt repo and preparations for gilt stripping, that have been widely praised by market participants.

2. These figures exclude 10 per cent. collection costs in respect of contributions for sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties--Member States deduct this from their contributions for levies and duties before making their contributions available to the Community.<P>

3. The revenue available to the Community also includes relatively small amounts of miscellaneous revenue derived from such sources as the sale of publications, disposal of property etc.<P>
