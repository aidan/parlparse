 We now have over 1,400 children&#146;s centres up and running providing services to, predominantly, the most disadvantaged communities. The National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS) findings on the early impact of 150 of the first Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) (November 2005) identified that of those families in the most disadvantaged areas served by SSLPs, 86 per cent. of the parents in the sample were benefiting from Sure Start. However, this evaluation also found that some of the most socially excluded groups could not be shown to be benefiting from living in a SSLP area. Although the NESS methodology could not identify whether any of the children in the sample had actually attended a Sure Start centre or not, we have taken a number of steps to ensure that the most excluded partners benefit.</p>

It provides advice about how children&#146;s centres can tailor their services to meet the needs of fathers, including non-resident parents, how staff should be encouraged to engage proactively with fathers and specific areas where fathers may require additional support.

The Practice Guidance makes clear that local authorities must work with those organisations that have a track record of understanding local needs and delivering services that improve children&#146;s outcomes. In addition, we require local authorities to consult and consider using all private, voluntary and community sector organisations in the area when planning and developing children&#146;s centres services. In 2008, local authorities must review all centres developed in 2003-06 to ensure that maximum use has been made of good quality local private, voluntary and community sector suppliers and repeat this exercise every two years. We expect local authorities to keep evidence that they have carried out the required reviews.</p>

No specific concerns that would have suggested that the integrity of the effluent pipe system at Pirbright was at risk, were raised with DEFRA as licensor and regulator.

However, it had been recognised that the system was old. The HSE informed DEFRA Ministers, on 17 August, that leaks could have occurred from the system. On the same day, DEFRA contacted the IAH, which that afternoon put into effect a plan controlling access and strengthening biosecurity measures for movement of people and vehicles.

 The latest figures based on the position at 31 March 2007 are that 6,854 staff across the department have declared that they are disabled. As a proportion of staff who have declared a disability status of 115,525, this equates to 5.93 per cent. of staff. Individual agency figures are contained in the following table.</p>

However, we are aware that not all disabled staff declare their disability for departmental records, and the true figure may be higher than the figures shown. For example, the 2006 DWP Staff Survey (which is completed anonymously), showed that 13 per cent. of respondents considered themselves to have a long standing health condition or disability.</p>

As we roll out we are asking each member of staff to check the personal information we hold about them and to declare whether they consider themselves to be disabled. A further joint communications exercise with departmental trade unions to highlight the importance of individuals providing this information is also planned.</p>

By linking all of the main benefit application services (e.g. income support computer system, pensions Strategy computer system) to CIS, the Department is able to keep customer records fully updated and is able to provide immediate notification of change of circumstances when they occur.</p>

 None. The purpose of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is to hold a record of a person&#146;s DNA which can be matched against DNA taken from crime scenes. If there is a match the police are notified and make further inquiries. The NDNAD holds the person&#146;s name, date of birth, ethnic appearance, gender, a link to any record on the police national computer, and information about the police force which took the sample. This is sufficient for the police to be able to contact the person if required. It is not necessary for the NDNAD itself to hold the person&#146;s postal address.</p>

In order to keep address information accurate, it would be necessary to monitor changes of address of the 4 million people on the database.

<i> [holding answer 8 October 2007]:</i><i> </i>It is for each member state to determine, in accordance with its own laws, what action might be appropriate in particular cases. Regular discussions, however, are held with EU counterparts, both at ministerial and official level, about a range of judicial cooperation issues including, from time to time, about bringing to justice alleged genocidaires from Rwanda. No one fleeing prosecution in that country should expect to find safe haven or to enjoy impunity within the EU.

 It is important that pay arrangements for the police are both fair and affordable, for the taxpayer as well as the police service. This is why the Government asked Sir Clive Booth to conduct a review of police pay. His recommendations were published in a written ministerial statement on 21 February 2007, and they recommended an interim index linking increases in police officer pay to increases in the public sector. This was the basis of the 2007 pay offer to police officers. The Government made clear in their ministerial statement of 21 February that Sir Clive Booth's recommendations would be taken forward through the Police Negotiation Board (PNB). We are disappointed that the PNB failed to reach agreement. The matter has now been referred to the Police Arbitration Tribunal. Before my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary makes her decision on the police pay award for 2007, she will consider very carefully the recommendations that result from this process.</p>

In 2000 this was about 14.5 per cent. of regional gross value added; regional GVA figures for 2006 are not yet available, but the comparable figure is likely to be about 15.4 per cent. For imports of goods, equivalent figures are &#163;10.7 billion and 17.6 per cent. in 2000, and &#163;14.1 billion and 17.1 per cent. in 2006. Similar data for regional trade in services are not available.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of whether there is sufficient capacity in existing regional medium secure units to meet the need for such places in each region; in which regions there is an assessed shortfall; what the extent is of the shortfall in each case; and what plans are in place to address the shortfall. [156082]</p>

<p><a name="st_308"><a name="07101054000798"><a name="71009w0021.htm_spnew11"><a name="07101054001142"><b>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</b>
 Data on capacity for medium secure services are not routinely collected by the Department. The Department works to support local commissioners, as it is the responsibility of local commissioners to assess service needs in their area and plan accordingly. A capacity review of high and medium secure services was completed in January 2006 in order to inform policy on this issue and to help support commissioners. This capacity review took into consideration historical utilisation, changing legislation (e.g. draft Mental Health Bill and public protection orders), court sentencing trends, prison transfers and the needs of different patient groups (e.g. women, learning disabled men, patients with dangerous and severe personality disorder and deaf patients).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="71009w0021.htm_para10"><a name="07101054000799">The review concluded that the need for medium secure capacity was gradually rising and robust local commissioning plans were necessary to ensure that there was strategic planning on a regional basis to deliver additional medium secure capacity in a co-ordinated way and to ensure that commissioning delivered good value for money. As at January 2006 when the review took place, there were 29 national health service medium secure units providing around 1,972 beds, with a further 1,500 beds provided by the independent sector. This has now increased and there are 32 NHS medium secure units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="71009w0021.htm_para11"><a name="07101054000800">The capacity review set out three projections for increases in medium secure capacity, based on variations in trends. The low projections were the lowest capacity increase likely and the high projections were the highest capacity increase likely. The medium projections were the most likely and, in subsequent discussions with stakeholders, the medium projections were thought to be reasonable. An extract from the review with a breakdown of capacity and projections by catchment areas is shown in the following tables. In total, the medium projections in the capacity review predicted an increase in capacity of 614 beds for men and 85 beds for women between 2005-06 and 2010-11, so a total of 699 beds. The NHS is on course to exceed this projected increase in capacity in medium secure services, as long as outlined local plans are followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="71009w0021.htm_para12"><a name="07101054000801">The NHS have been working on local commissioning plans to ensure strategic planning on a regional basis. These local commissioning plans are under constant review by local commissioners and are updated to take account of changing local circumstances.</p>

1. The NHS Information Centre has investigated with North West Strategic Health Authority and North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust the reason for the reported decrease in the number of FCEs with an operation. The main cause of this decrease is that between 2002-03 and 2004-05 the trust stopped recoding certain procedures as being performed in a day case setting and started recording them as being performed in outpatients. Information is not available centrally on total procedures performed in outpatients. Data reclassification issues are being picked up by the Information Centre and the Audit Commission. From April 2007 onwards the trust will revert to counting this activity as a day case.<br>
 2. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
 An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
 3. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE) with an Operation<br>
 A count of FCEs with an operation is the number of episodes with at least one coded procedure field. Please note that more procedures are carried out than finished consultant episodes with an operation. For example, patients under going a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures&#151;removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one&#151;counted in a single finished consultant episode.<br>
 4. Data Quality<br>
 Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Ungrossed data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 The Government do not carry out independent assessments of the heroin and poppy production in Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation figures are measured by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures do not take into account the control of land on which poppy is cultivated. Nor has there been a study defining locations of heroin laboratories on land inside or outside of government control. But there is a clear link between poppy cultivation and insecurity, shown by the fact that over 75 per cent. cultivation takes place in the least secure southern provinces. In the more secure central and northern regions, cultivation generally appears to be decreasing or stabilising. The number of &#147;poppy free provinces&#148; has increased from six in 2006 to 13 in 2007, demonstrating that where the integrated approach set out in the government of Afghanistan's national drug control strategy can be brought to bear, it is delivering results.</p>

 Gross domestic product (GDP) per head calculations rely on information about economic activity (GDP) and population. All GDP calculations are made by the overseas territories (OTs), who employ either specialised statisticians or analysts. The accuracy of GDP depends on the analytical input that such small offices are able to devote to calculating it. Population data are based on a census, which is usually carried out every few years, as in the United Kingdom. Population estimates have to be made for intermediate years.</p>
