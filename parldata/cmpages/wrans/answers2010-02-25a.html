 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason the Rural Payments Agency has decided to carry out remote sensing mapping induction in Gloucestershire; what the average time taken to process information gathered by the process is; for what reason such processes have delayed the award of single farm payments; and if he will take steps to expedite any payments so delayed. [317706]</p>

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="10022594000080"><a name="100225w0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="10022594000966"><b>Jim Fitzpatrick</b>
<i> [holding answer 22 February 2010]:</i> All European Union member states have a requirement to inspect at least 5 per cent. of single payment scheme (SPS) applications each scheme year to confirm eligibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="100225w0001.htm_para0"><a name="10022594000081">The majority of these eligibility inspections are carried out by RPA using remote sensing. Remote sensing uses very high resolution satellite images to check the land area in a selected zone and then to check it matches what the farmer has claimed for on the SPS application form. The geographical zones to be inspected are selected as far as possible in counties not having been previously selected and this explains why part of Gloucestershire has been included. Claims in these zones are targeted using a risk-based approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="100225w0001.htm_para1"><a name="10022594000082">RPA employs a specialist contractor to undertake preliminary checks using remote sensing. When the findings reach RPA, they are checked against the SPS claim and the Rural Land Register (RLR) and then if necessary conveyed to the farmers concerned. In previous years remote sensing inspection cases have generally been paid later in the regulatory payment window, which closes on 30 June. This year and because RPA has been more successful in paying farmers earlier non payment of remote sensing cases appears more pronounced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="100225w0001.htm_para2"><a name="10022594000083">Owing to the complex and scientific nature of analysing thousands of hectares of land cover and topography using satellite imagery, RPA inevitably discovers instances where it is difficult to interpret what the imagery is showing, for example because of atmospheric conditions or apparent land use and management changes, which require further clarification with the farmer. This year has also been more complex because of the work to update all of the boundaries, position and accuracy of the land in the RLR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="100225w0001.htm_para3"><a name="10022594000084">RPA must ensure that findings from these inspections are taken fully into account before a claim can be paid, which often necessitates ongoing communications with farmers to reach an accurate outcome. Because of the range of checks on claims some will inevitably take longer than others to complete. Remote sensing processing is being carried out as quickly as possible and RPA is working to make these payments as soon as possible.</p>

Intimate searching runs a significant risk of causing internal damage, particularly where the subject is non-compliant.

 The Nimrod MR2 and Hercules C130K aircraft perform other tasks aside from long-range search and rescue. We therefore cannot comment on actual capability levels as this is classified information.</p>

The maximum time on task is dependent on a wide range of factors including load, configuration and weather, and this can be extended through use of diversions as far afield as Iceland in the north or indeed the Azores in the south. Additionally, the Hercules C130K has the capacity to air-to-air refuel which could significantly extend its time on task if it was required.</p>

 The Nimrod MR2 will be taken out of service on 31 March 2010, and will be replaced by the substantially more capable Nimrod MRA4. The MRA4 production programme remains unchanged, but the aircraft will be introduced into service at a slower rate as part of a package of key adjustments to the Defence programme announced on 15 December last year. During the period of transition we intend to use other assets to fulfil its various roles. We do not currently have any plans to lease aircraft to fulfil the long range search and rescue tasks undertaken by the MR2.</p>

 Since coming to office in 1997 the Government have developed a number of initiatives, both nationally and locally, to tackle child poverty. Salford has built on these national policies and developed their own local strategy to drive their child poverty agenda forward.

Children's Centres provide a liaison point with Job Centre Plus to offer parents information on employment and skills and co-ordinate community-based learning and training. Their work is underpinned and further enhanced by the introduction of 35 community workers and teams of lone parent advisers, who are also located within the centres.</p>

</ul><a name="100225w0009.htm_brev7"><a name="100225107000218"><ul><p class="tabletext">Your question refers to 'investigations'. It may be helpful to provide some background information on the way in which we carry out our investigatory compliance work, which has changed significantly over recent years. Prior to our strategic review in 2005, our practice was to carry out all investigations as formal statutory inquiries under section 8 of the Charities Act 1993. We now carry out a wider range of compliance work dealing with problems in charities. This includes assessment cases, monitoring, non-statutory investigations that we call regulatory compliance cases, as well as section 8 statutory inquiries. We now reserve statutory inquiries only for the most serious cases of regulatory concern. Last year, for example, we conducted 1,504 assessment cases and 211 monitoring cases, and completed 167 regulatory compliance cases and 21 statutory inquiries.</p>

However, I have looked at our statistics for both non-statutory investigations and statutory inquiries for the last three complete financial years going back to 2006-07 and can provide the following information.</p>
</ul><a name="100225w0009.htm_brev9"><a name="100225107000220"><ul><p class="tabletext">In relation to (a), we have carried out 29 investigations regarding political activity since 2006-07, out a total of 736 investigations. These 29 investigations were to examine allegations or concerns about inappropriate political activity and campaigning by charities, or charities making political donations or giving support to a political party. I should point out that revocation of charitable status is not a legal remedy if a charity has broken political campaigning rules. Our role in these cases is to make good the breach (for example, to ensure inappropriate payment by a charity to a political party is repaid) and ensure steps are taken to prevent recurrence.</p>
</ul><a name="100225w0009.htm_brev10"><a name="100225107000221"><ul><p class="tabletext">As you may know, charities can campaign and undertake political activity but cannot have political purposes. If we find that an organisation, although registered as a charity, does in fact have a political purpose, it cannot be a charity in law. In these cases, we would remove the organisation from the Register of Charities because it was never in fact a charity. Our records show that we have removed two charities from the Register on this basis: one in October 2001 and the other in July 2004. Regarding part (i) of your question, I can confirm that neither of these organisations were mosques.</p>
</ul><a name="100225w0009.htm_brev11"><a name="100225107000222"><ul><p class="tabletext">In relation to (b), our statistical information does not allow us to readily identify on a historical basis cases regarding allegations that a charity may have provided a platform to Hizb ut-Tahrir.

3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes.<br>

 Towns and cities can play a big role in tackling climate change. Many local authorities in towns and cities have set themselves targets to reduce emissions in response to National Indicator 186. We have set out our expectation of how planning authorities in towns and cities can plan new development to ensure carbon emissions are reduced in our Climate Change Planning Policy Statement (PPS) and we will shortly be consulting on a revision to the PPS. As part of the Eco-towns Programme we have set out sustainability standards for eco towns in our eco towns PPS. These include the requirement that the developments as a whole must be zero-carbon.

<i> [holding answer 24 February 2010]:</i> HSE inspectors are in the process of visiting the local authorities which were identified through the questionnaire survey, that is, those local authorities which did not provide sufficient information to demonstrate the adequacy of their arrangements for properly managing asbestos in system-built schools. In total 45 LAs have been identified for visit and to date 14 of these have been visited with three further visits scheduled. The remaining visits are scheduled for completion during March and April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="100225w0015.htm_para9"><a name="100225127000820">It is essential that all schools have arrangements in place to actively and competently manage asbestos whenever it is present. HSE will continue to work with the local authorities, DCSF and schools to ensure that schools both understand their legal responsibilities and act on them.</p>

 No. It is for local authorities in Scotland to ensure landlords are properly registered under guidance from the Scottish Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="100225w0017.htm_para2"><a name="100225127001077">All private landlords in Scotland must be registered (or have applied for registration) with the local authorities where they let private property. Once an application has been submitted it is assessed by the relevant local authority who determines whether the landlord is fit and proper. There are a number of sanctions available to local authorities if a landlord fails to register, or continues to let property after being refused registration. The sanctions include reporting the case to the Procurator Fiscal for prosecution. However, the most popular and successful sanction so far has been the rent penalty notice (RPN). If a local authority serves such a notice, it suspends the tenant's liability to pay rent for the period of the notice. If an RPN is used, the tenant is notified to stop paying rent and, if housing benefit is in payment, the local housing benefit office is informed that an RPN is in place and that housing benefit should not be paid for the period of the notice.</p>

2. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.<br>
4. Figures correspond to Great Britain only, because prior to 2002 these are the only figures available and so this shows the full run on a consistent basis.<br>
 5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
 6. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equivalisation factors.<br>
 7. A family is defined as a single adult or couple living as married (including same sex partners from January 2006) and any dependent children.<br>
 8. Number of families in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand families and proportion of families have been rounded to the nearest per cent.<br>

2 All figures are three-year averages, produced by aggregating the number of deaths registered in each year and mid-year population estimates across each three-year period.<br>
3 Figures are period life expectancies at birth. Period expectation of life at birth for an area in a given time period is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the particular area's age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout his or her life. It is not therefore the number of years a newborn baby in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born In the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br>
4 All figures are calculated using abridged life tables. Deaths of non-residents are excluded from the data for England.

 The figure of 6.54 hours per week is drawn from the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) modelling, which is in turn rooted in current patterns of care. The PSSRU model shows an average package of community-based care for those in the critical Fair Access to Care Services category of around 8.7 hours per week. The PSSRU assumes, on the basis of Personal Social Services EX1 return (PSS EX1) data, that 74 per cent. of this package-around 6.5 hours per week-is home care. The Department then assumes that around 85 per cent. of the home care hours-around 5.5 hours per week on average-is personal care.</p>

 We are not aware of any current shortages of antituberculosis medicines.

The guidelines give advice to companies and encourage early exchange of information.

 LSC funding for this type of provision is part of a much wider and more complex funding framework and any proposals for redistribution would need to be considered in this wider context.</p>

The new funding and planning arrangements set out in Chapter 4 of The Learning Revolution are playing a key role in this transformation and so from August 2011 the Skills Funding Agency will channel funding for informal adult learning in local or sub-regional areas through identified Lead Accountable Bodies. We will invite all local authorities to take part in these new arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="100225w0024.htm_para2"><a name="100225127001930">We are working closely with the Local Government Association, the Local Education Authorities Forum for the Education of Adults, the Association of Colleges, Ofsted and other delivery partners to develop a Lead Accountable Body model that will enable local authorities to discharge this pivotal leadership role. Accepting the role of Lead Accountable Body will enable local authorities to better position their own resources alongside those of the Skills Funding Agency, as part of a local learning infrastructure. This in turn will help to promote the wider personalisation agenda across a number of fronts, and enable other local services, like libraries, to play an important role in broadening choice for local people.</p>

 Following our 2006 White Paper "Further Education: Improving Skills, Raising Life Chances", the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) introduced a code of practice for franchised provision of higher education in further education colleges". HEFCE do not monitor individual franchise agreements between higher education institutions and further education colleges. However, the data provided in the table show that the total number of higher education institutions franchising to a further education college has remained fairly constant since 2006-07, while the number of students  <br>

It is not possible to accurately identify final year students as course timescales can vary, particularly for part-time students. However 36,855 part-time first degree students qualified in 2008/09.
