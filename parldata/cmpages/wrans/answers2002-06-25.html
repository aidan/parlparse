<a name="20625w01.html_wqn0"><B> Linda Perham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what representations she has received from local authorities regarding Public Library Standard 18.  [62679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Councillor Bob Littlewood, the London borough of Redbridge's Cabinet Minister for Culture and Leisure wrote to my right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Blackstone on 16 April 2002. His letter referred specifically to Public Library Standard 3(i) and 18. Other authorities have written either about the standards in general or about other of the standards individually.
<P>

<a name="20625w01.html_para0">PLS 18, in common with the other standards, helps to define authorities' existing statutory obligations under the Public Library and Museums Act 1964 to provide library services that are comprehensive and efficient.
<P>

<a name="20625w01.html_para1">I am monitoring the application of the public library standards through the annual library planning process. Analysis of the 2001 plans shows that nearly all authorities are using the introduction of the standards to plan for improvements in the quality of their library services but that, in many cases, authorities recognise that this will require them to direct more of their budgets into their library services than hitherto. It is for library authorities to ensure that they make the right allocation of resources to ensure the provision of a comprehensive and efficient service within the meaning of the Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if the Comptroller and Auditor General has been given access to all the papers the relevant Government Departments hold on whether Camelot and its associated companies are run by suitable people.  [63642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The National Lottery Commission has given the Comptroller and Auditor General access to all the papers held by the commission which he wished to examine as part of his inquiry into its award of the second National Lottery licence, except those which it would not be lawful for the commission to disclose. A number of Orders opening gateways allowing access to these papers have already been made; action to open the remaining gateways, which relate to the Criminal Justice Act 1987 and the Companies Act 1985 and 1989, is in hand by the Departments responsible for those Acts and should be completed shortly.

<a name="20625w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Jenkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on progress of discussions on the situation at ITV Digital.  [63672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 ITV Digital is in administration and progress with the administration is a matter for the administrators. ITV Digital surrendered the licences granted to it under the Broadcasting Act 1996 on 30 April 2002. These licences were re-advertised by the Independent Television Commission. I understand that the ITC has received six applications and aims to award the licences by 4 July. Decisions on the licence awards are a matter for the ITC.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions she has had with the ITC on the change in hours for regional broadcasting which they are proposing for the Meridian area; and if she will make a statement.  [63865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department was kept informed of progress as the ITC negotiated the Charter for Broadcasting in the Nations and Regions with the ITV companies. The Charter seeks to enhance investment in regional programme production, introduce a more effective regional schedule and strengthen regional accountability. The draft Communications Bill introduces requirements for Ofcom to set Channel 3 services targets to secure quality and levels of investment in programmes produced in the regions for the regions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when she proposes to adopt the new model of television licence fee evasion referred to in the National Audit Office report, "Collecting the Television Licence Fee"; and what estimate she has made of the level of television licence fee evasion for <i>(a)</i> the last month for which figures are available and <i>(b)</i> the last five years.  [64586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department is adopting the new model with effect from today. This will enable the BBC to use these new, improved figures in its annual report and accounts, as recommended by the NAO report.
<P>

<a name="20625w01.html_para2">The new model uses improved data to estimate the number of licensable premises. Consequently the level of estimates of evasion for previous years has been revised upward. The figures from the new model show, as did those from the old model, that evasion has declined steadily in recent years. The new model estimates evasion at 7.8 per cent. at the end of May 2002, compared with 8.6 per cent. at May 2001 and 11.4 per cent. at May 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in what discussions he has participated concerning a successor warhead for Trident; when his last discussion of this subject was; and if he will list the other participants in that discussion.  [63452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 None. We currently have no plans for a replacement for Trident, and no decision on any possible successor system is yet needed. In line with the policy set out in the Strategic Defence Review, we intend to maintain a minimum capability to design and produce a successor to Trident should this prove necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Of the 53,462 United Kingdom service personnel who were deployed to the Gulf during the 1990&#150;91 conflict, the Ministry of Defence has records of the post codes for 45,302 who are still alive, of which 3,817 are in Scotland. The post codes were gathered between 1996 and 2001 for the purposes of a series of epidemiological studies and may now be out of date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the <i>(a)</i> budget and <i>(b)</i> timescale is for the programme to improve single living accommodation for armed forces personnel.  [63163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The budget for improvements to single living accommodation is &#163;2 billion.
<P>

<a name="20625w01.html_para3">Project SLAM in conjunction with parallel projects is aiming to deliver 70,000 new or upgraded bed spaces within a 10-year period commencing in 2003.

<a name="20625w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he intends to improve the single living accommodation at RAF Stafford.  [63165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The need to upgrade single living accommodation (SLA) at RAF Stafford was considered when compiling the RAF SLA modernisation programme, (Project SLAM). However, as RAF Stafford was assessed to have sufficient SLA at grade 2 condition or above to meet its long term requirements, it was not included in the programme. Along with other stations with grade 2 accommodation, RAF Stafford will be considered for upgrade once the worst RAF SLA has been upgraded.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the criteria are for prioritising the projects for the improvement of single living accommodation for armed forces personnel.  [63164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Prioritisation is on a "worst first" basis at locations where there is a long term operational need for single living accommodation (SLA).
<P>

<a name="20625w01.html_para4">The worst SLA is defined as grade 3 and below, as assessed against the Ministry of Defence's four tier system laid out in Joint Service Publication 315.

<a name="20625w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence complies with Department of the Environment Circular 18/84 (Town and Country Planning Act 1984) in a similar manner to all Government Departments, non-Department authorities and other Crown bodies regarding submitting and advertising of Notices of Proposed Development (NOPD). The local planning authority treats the NOPD in the same way as they do a planning application submitted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. NOPDs are advertised in the local press by the planning authority in the same manner as a planning application. Standard orange Notices from the planning authority are displayed at the gates of AWE Aldermaston and at the entrance to The Mearings at AWE Burghfield for the statutory 21 days. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 745W</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made in identifying the factors that have caused ill health in Gulf War veterans; and if he will make a statement.  [63551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As a group, Gulf veterans report significantly more ill-health than other comparable groups. A number of possible factors for this have been suggested but peer-reviewed scientific research, confirmed and validated by other researchers, has no identified the cause. Further important research is underway, and the Government is committed to carrying out some such further research. I hope to announce some new areas of research shortly. I would encourage members of the scientific community who have other new ideas to submit proposals for further work to the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC will assess the proposals and recommend to the Ministry of Defence those which it considers to be soundly based and of sufficient scientific merit to justify being taken forward.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will set up a Royal Commission to investigate the causes of Gulf war illnesses; and if he will make a statement.  [63773]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence accepts that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is unusual and related to their Gulf experience. There is evidence that Gulf veterans report more ill-health than other comparable groups. The Government attach great importance to investigating the causes of this and believe that the best way of doing so is through scientific and medical research. A number of important research projects are currently under way and I hope to announce further work shortly. The Government do not believe that a Royal Commission to investigate the causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses would be helpful at this time.

 DFID are rarely involved in funding major infrastructure projects of the sort that would require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in the UK. DFID procedures require environmental screening on all projects above &#163;1 million, or below this threshold if significant environmental impacts are anticipated. The screening is supported by DFID's environmental guide, which provides guidance, such as screening checklists that highlight potential beneficial and adverse impacts. If initial screening indicates that an activity could have significant impacts on the environment, then further investigation must be undertaken, which may include further environmental analysis; a full EIA; or an environmental audit. The objective of DFID's appraisal system is not only to assess potential positive or negative impacts, but also to seek opportunities to improve policy formulation and decision-making, e.g. we are currently undertaking an appraisal of strategic choices regarding Russia's accession to the WTO.
<P>

<a name="20625w03.html_para5">The DFID environmental appraisal process applies to expenditure on policies, programmes and projects. The EC EIA directive, transposed into UK legislation, currently applies to projects (e.g. building new roads, building power stations, etc.), but the EU directive on programmes and plans (2001/42/EC) is in the process of becoming UK law. DFID procedures also allow for intermediate level of investigation&#151;environmental analysis&#151;where a full EIA is not required. In the UK EIA legislation there is no such intermediate form of analysis.

 DFID place as much emphasis on access to appropriate sanitation as they do on access to safe water. Much of the work supported by DFID is for both water supply and sanitation, for example, support to the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council and the Water and Sanitation Program. Therefore, it is not possible to clearly apportion financial expenditure to water supply solely.

<P>
<a name="20625w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Advisory Committee on Programme Management for the Management and Storage of Radioactive Waste was established under European Council Resolution 77/C 192/01 of 18 July 1977. The committee advises the European Commission on the Community Plan of Action in the field of radioactive waste which was last renewed by Council Resolution 92/C 158/02 of 15 June 1992.

[44344]<P>

<P>
<a name="20625w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We have put in place a range of planning guidance to promote a sustainable pattern of physical development and land and property use. Sound planning policies and an effective and efficient planning system are central to the Government's policies to improve eco-efficiency and resource productivity. Our policies concentrate the majority of new development within existing urban areas and in doing so help to reduce the need to travel and safeguard the countryside from unnecessary development. We have a target to provide 60 per cent. of additional dwellings on previously developed land by 2008 which, as a result of our policy changes, has been met.
<P>

<a name="20625w04.html_para6">Planning policy is also supported by a number of fiscal measures aimed at improving environmental outcomes; by encouraging better use of existing property to reduce new build, through a 150 per cent. tax credit for cleaning up contaminated land, and through taxes introduced on landfill in 1996, and on the quarrying of aggregates in 2002. Legislation to apply modern standards of conditions to old mineral workings was extended in 1995 to apply to all such sites, and tougher environmental tests before opencast coal sites can be opened or enlarged were introduced in 1999. Action, both statutory and voluntary, has commenced to limit or remove the more damaging existing planning permissions which threaten the integrity of the sites proposed or designated under the EU's Natura 2000 network. This includes a major voluntary purchase by English Nature of the most important and vulnerable lowland peat bogs in England.

In the event of any meeting being scheduled, officials in this Department would, as a matter of course, liaise with their counterparts in the Scottish Executive.

 Under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 any person who keeps or uses radioactive material must have a certificate of registration from the Environment Agency. The certificates impose responsibilities in respect of security and general management. The Agency carries out a regular programme of inspections to ensure that the conditions of the certificate are being complied with. The Agency would not hesitate to take enforcement action if conditions were not being complied with.

<a name="20625w05.html_para0">The Agency has recently carried out a programme of inspections at sites holding higher activity sources. At most sites security arrangements were found to be satisfactory. In a small number of cases the need for improvements was identified. The Agency will ensure that these improvements are implemented.

<P>
<a name="20625w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> A sequence of mechanisms applies, which enable appeals to be made at various stages in the development of a GM variety prior to the marketing of seeds of that variety.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Before a GM crop variety can be considered for seed registration it must have been assessed at European level for safety to human health and the environment and be approved for placing on the market under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC on the Deliberate Release into the Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms. This directive has now been replaced by the new Directive 2001/18/EC, which has to be implemented by member states by October 2002. Under part C of the new directive, the European Commission and all member states discuss applications for consents to market GMOs (including GM seeds) in the EU and may ask for further information, make comments on, or present reasoned objections to the proposed release. The Commission is required to consult the public while the application is being considered, and these views are copied to all member states. The Commission and member states then make a collective decision on the application, and a marketing consent is either granted or refused. The new directive (like its predecessor) does not have any specific provisions for appeal against the decision to grant or refuse consent. However, it does ensure that if new information comes to light regarding the risks posed by the GMO to human health or the environment, the consent can be altered or revoked as appropriate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The Seeds (National Lists of Varieties) Regulations 2001 provide a three-stage appeal process. On payment of the appropriate fee, persons affected by a proposed relevant decision (which includes proposals to add any varieties, GM or conventional, to the UK National List) may make written representations to the national authorities and/or oral representations to a person appointed by them. The national authorities are required to consider such written and/or oral representations before taking a relevant decision and must give notice of their decision and the reasons for it as well as information about how that decision may be appealed to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Tribunal.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government's position on the proposed EU directive on environmental liability.  [57621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a framework for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays. This represents an important and significant development in EC environmental law. The Government have therefore conducted a public consultation on the proposals, and the UK position on the detail of the proposal will be finalised in the light of the comments received.
<P>

<a name="20625w05.html_para1">In broad terms however, the Government support a regime which is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable, easy to implement, does not damage business competitiveness, and delivers clear environmental benefits.
<P>

<a name="20625w05.html_para2">The partial regulatory impact assessment submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17), indicates that much of the environmental damage covered by the directive is already the subject of existing domestic regimes, but the proposals go further in some respects. The directive would set higher standards of remediation and introduce the concepts of equivalent compensation and interim losses. Further benefits would arise from introducing a regime across the European Community which would harmonise the rules and standards for environmental liability across member states. Provided that the right balance between costs and benefits is achieved, this proposal could therefore play a useful part in safeguarding the environment.

<P>
<a name="20625w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> The main threat to albatrosses and petrels arises from long-line fishing for tuna and toothfish in the southern oceans, in which I understand that no metropolitan UK vessels are involved. Last June the UK signed the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), made under the Convention on Migratory Species. ACAP will require its parties to co-operate in the development and implementation of an action plan for the conservation of these species, encompassing both the control of fishing activities, including measures to mitigate the impact of long-line fishing, and the protection of breeding sites, some of which are in the UK's overseas territories. The RSPB has recently undertaken research into these and other bird species on Gough Island, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<P>

<a name="20625w06.html_para6">The Government are currently in discussion with the authorities of the range state overseas territories to ascertain whether they need new legislation in order to implement the requirements of ACAP. We are also considering the position in respect of the metropolitan UK, and will explore with our partners in the European Union the prospects for wider European participation. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 760W</I><P>
I hope the UK will be in a position to ratify ACAP, possible initially on behalf of some of the overseas territories, later this year.

<P>

<a name="20625w07.html_para3">&#163;1.6 million was spent on an advertising campaign between April 2000 and March 2001 to support the Tackling Tobacco strategy. This was the first burst of a three year campaign and aimed to raise awareness of the links to organised crime and of the penalties for those who are caught smuggling or dealing in illicit tobacco. Among all our audiences there was a steady increase in awareness of Government action and the penalties. Research has shown 41 per cent. awareness of the advertising among the general public. Within trade groups, awareness increased significantly among HGV drivers (at 83 per cent.) and retailers (81 per cent.).

 There are currently 11 dogs operational in Manchester and Hull and five vacancies. When filled, these will bring the total to 16 operational dogs, comprising nine drugs dogs, four currency dogs, and three multi-skilled drugs/tobacco dogs, each with one handler.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 765W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20625w07.html_para6">The consolidation of detector dog resources in large units based in Manchester and Hull has enabled Customs to provide the full range of dog skills (drugs, tobacco and cash) in support of frontier activity across northern England and Scotland. The deployment of the detector dogs is flexible, intelligence led and focused on the delivery of operational impact.

<P>

<a name="20625w07.html_para8">The consolidation of dog resources to Manchester and Hull followed reviews on the usage and outputs of detector dogs, including those based at the former Aberdeen and Glasgow units. The number of dog handler posts in Manchester has remained at eight from 1997 to date. From 1997 to 2001, four posts were based at Hull, increasing to eight posts this year.
<P>

<a name="20625w07.html_para9">Aberdeen dog unit had three posts in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, and the dog unit closed in the summer of 1999. Glasgow dog unit had four posts in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 and five posts in 1999&#150;2000. This reduced to four posts in 2000&#150;01 and the unit closed in summer 2001. When the dog unit at Glasgow Airport was closed in the summer of 2001, the facility was dismantled and the land returned to the British Airports Authority.

 The Department has not issued any guidance on vandalism on the railways as this is an operational matter for the industry. However, the Minister for Transport, John Spellar, spoke at the Trespass and Vandalism on the Railways Conference in October 2001 where he encouraged the leading players in the industry to implement a more coherent national strategy to deliver a sustained, visible and effective campaign to tackle the problem. The Government are pleased to note that all sections of the rail industry recently came together in the National Route Crime Group to examine and promote ways of tackling trespass and vandalism on the railways.

 As outlined in its Strategic Plan, the SRA is currently advancing feasibility work on an upgrade of the Gospel Oak&#151;Barking line and take future growth in freight path demand away from the Dalston&#151;Highbury and Islington section of the East London Line extension. However, it is not expected that existing freight paths using the Dalston&#151;Highbury and Islington section will be diverted away from the route. The freight operators hold access rights with the rail regulator for this section, and the ability to run electric traction and gauge-sensitive traffic on the route means these paths are unlikely to be released.

<P>
<a name="20625w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The initiative in bringing forward proposals for major local transport schemes, including light rail, tram and guided bus schemes, in England outside London, rests with the local transport authority concerned. Officials in my Department and the Government offices are ready to provide information, support and guidance as required and often meet the promoters of individual schemes. In addition, from time to time they arrange forums and workshops for local authorities and their advisers on particular transport modes: workshops have already been held this year on both light rail and guided bus. Officials also regularly provide background information and support to individuals studying and researching this area.
<P>

<a name="20625w09.html_para4">Relevant general guidance, covering all transport modes, which is freely available to all interested parties includes (a) the Department's guidance to local authorities on the preparation of Local Transport Plans (LTPs) (issued in March 2000) and LTP Annual Progress Reports (APRs) (latest edition issued in March 2002) and (b) the Department's guidance on the appraisal of major local transport schemes (most recently updated in May 2002).

 The bus industry is broadly content with the existing regulatory framework and advocates stability.

<P>

<a name="20625w10.html_para0">We are always looking at ways of improving the details of regulation. On 1 March we extended the notice period for introducing or changing a local bus service registration to 56 days, and abolished the rule which allowed local service operators to alter timetables by up to 5 minutes from the registered time without changing the registration. We will soon be consulting on proposals to facilitate the registration of flexibly routed local bus services.

 The principal legislation specifying the design and use of traffic signs (as traffic signs are defined in section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984) to be placed on any road (as road is defined in section 142 of the 1984 Act), is the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 1994, SI 994/1519, as

<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 774W</I><P>
amended by SI 1995/2769 and SI 1995/3107. We consulted last year on draft revised and updated TSRGD and expect to publish the TSRGD 2002 later this year.
<P>

<a name="20625w10.html_para1">Guidance on the design and use of traffic signs is contained in the Traffic Signs Manual. Chapter 7, published in 1997, gives guidance on the design of sign faces. Revised Chapters 4 (design and use of warning signs) and 5 (road markings) will be published with the revised TSRGD. We have also consulted on proposals for publishing updated and revised guidance on the provision of directional signs to tourist destinations in England. Other relevant guidance is published in Local Transport Notes, including LTN 1/94 on the design and use of direction signs, Circulars (Roads), and Advisory Leaflets. Copies of the current Traffic Signs bibliography has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 We remain seriously concerned about the security situation in Pakistan and are appalled by the many incidents of terrorist violence against Pakistani and foreign nationals. The vicious attack on worshippers in an Islamabad church in March and the two recent bombings in Karachi were particularly horrifying. As soon as the news of the latest bombing reached us, I immediately issued a statement expressing our sympathies to the friends and relatives of those killed.
<P>

<a name="20625w11.html_para3">We will continue to urge the Pakistani authorities to sustain their efforts to root out the terrorists and bring them to justice. The threat of war between India and Pakistan has further undermined the security environment in the region.

 We have repeatedly made clear to the Israeli Government that only a political process leading to a comprehensive settlement will produce lasting peace.

<a name="20625w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what support schemes are available from the European Union for small and medium-sized enterprises in Britain; how much funding is available; and what proportion of this funding has been taken up by small firms in the last three years.  [60499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w15.html_spnew8"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The primary source of European Union support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United Kingdom is the European Structural Funds. For the funding period 2000&#150;06 the UK has been allocated approximately &#163;10 billion from these funds.
<P>

<a name="20625w15.html_para5">The priorities for this funding were the subject of negotiation with the Commission which resulted in a number of agreed programming documents being approved during 2000 and 2001. Expenditure under the programmes can be undertaken until 2008.
<P>

<a name="20625w15.html_para6">Since each document was drawn up and negotiated on the basis of the needs of the area concerned, the way in which support for SMEs is addressed varies between programmes. Although each programme includes a number of activities which involve either direct or indirect support to SMEs, the funding under the programmes is not disaggregated in a way that enables the amounts available or spent only for the benefit of SMEs to be easily identified, and it would involve disproportionate cost to provide this information.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> Nuclear materials on licensed civil nuclear sites and in transport are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements set, and monitored by, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). Nuclear power generators comply with the Nuclear Generating Station (Security) Regulations 1996, made under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Other sites comply with Directions made under the Atomic Energy Act 1954 and the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. All civil nuclear material in the UK is subject to Euratom

safeguards and to the terms of the UK/Euratom/IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Radioactive material, in accordance with the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, requires a certificate of registration from the Environment Agency or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The certificates impose responsibilities in respect of security and general management. In addition, the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 require employers to have in place appropriate accounting procedures. The regulatory bodies carry out regular programmes of inspections to ensure compliance and would not hesitate to take enforcement action were there a failure to comply with regulatory requirements.

 The Department is responsible for the management of the interdepartmental programme for addressing the nuclear legacy in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), and Ministers and officials, plus those in other Government Departments are in regular discussion with their counterparts on a range of nuclear issues, not just the security of nuclear waste. The &#163;84 million programme to tackle nuclear problems in the Former Soviet Union was announced to Parliament in July 2000 to cover the period 2001 to 2004, and future funding levels will depend on the outcome of the current Spending Review. The programme has, as one of its priorities, nuclear safety and security issues in Russia. An important element of the UK programme is assisting Russia in tackling the nuclear waste problems associated with the 100+ decommissioned nuclear submarines in NW Russia; particularly the safe disposal and secure storage of spent nuclear fuel from such vessels. Current discussions with Russia centre on concluding a legal framework agreement covering liability, tax and access issues etc.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w17.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Confidentiality is maintained because sex offenders and child abusers are often skilled at evading detection. Combating them is the priority and it is considered that to make public procedures, protocols and arrangements would have a detrimental effect on the ability to monitor and manage risk.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon.

[64367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w17.html_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The G8 summit is taking place in Kananaskis tomorrow and Thursday. The UK has put forward proposals for Africa on trade as part of a larger package of commitments on conflict, education, health, development assistance and debt. G8 members are committed to the objective of duty-free and quota-free access for all products originating from Least Developed Countries (LDCs) at the World Trade Organisation Doha Ministerial in November 2001. The UK sees it as imperative to move forward on integrating LDCs into the multilateral trading system and ensure they can harness the benefits of trade for poverty reduction. The forthcoming G8 summit in Kananaskis offers the opportunity to take forward these issues. The European Commission has estimated that developing country gains from a 50 per cent. cut in tariffs by both developed and developing countries would be in the order of $150 billion, around three times current aid flows.

Ministerial discussions were conducted last year, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Transport discussed it with the American Administration in January. I have asked the Secretary of State for Transport to review all the options and consider the best way forward to restart the discussions formally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Our policy on directly-elected mayors is set out in the 2001 Local Government White Paper&#151;Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public Services. Where local people think that a directly-elected mayor is right for their area, we think they should have the opportunity to vote for one. Councils have conducted extensive consultations with local people, who can also require a mayoral referendum by organising a petition signed by 5 per cent. of local electors or more.
<P>

<a name="20625w19.html_para0">The Secretary of State has the power in certain circumstances to direct a council to hold a referendum, including where it appears that the council has failed to have due regard to the outcome of local consultations. I told the House on 7 March 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 553W, that the Secretary of State did not intend to make any such directions until after we had completed a review of the regulations governing mayoral referendums, following the report "Reinvigorating Democracy? Mayoral Referendums in 2001" which the Electoral Commission published on 1 February 2002.
<P>

<a name="20625w19.html_para1">Since that time we have been putting in place proposals for a comprehensive performance management regime for councils, including independent assessment of their corporate performance. We are giving greater freedoms and flexibilities to all councils, with greater freedoms for high performing authorities.
<P>

<a name="20625w19.html_para2">Within this framework, we believe it will be right for each council to make and justify to local people its own judgments on the outcome of any consultation about proposals for a new constitution. Accordingly, in cases where, in our view, having regard to the outcome of the consultation, the judgment a council has reached does not appear to be justified, our approach will be not to intervene to direct a referendum.
<P>

consultations. These councils judged that the results of their consultation on new executive arrangements did not warrant giving local people the opportunity of a referendum. We took, and continue to take, the view that the consultation results would have justified a referendum.
<P>

<a name="20625w19.html_para4">However, on the basis of the approach I am announcing today, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister does not propose to use his powers in these cases. We believe it is right that we make this clear to the councils today in order to remove uncertainty for them.

 The Secretary of State published proposed changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-west on 20 May 2002. These changes reduced the annual rate of housing provision form that in draft RPG by 15 per cent. The annualised average rate of housing provision for the region is 12,790 dwellings. The annualised figures apply to the period up to 2006 reflecting the 'plan, monitor and manage' approach set out in PPG3 which moves away from the previous 'predict and provide' approach. The proposed changes give weight to avoiding any premature release of greenfield land which would undermine attempts to promote the use of recycled land and the redevelopment of existing unfit and unpopular housing. Tackling low demand and abandonment lies at the heart of the revised strategy. The Secretary of State, in the consultation, on the proposed changes has requested views on whether the changes are sufficient to prevent the unnecessary release of greenfield land or whether there should be further changes to reflect the recommendations made by the Transport, Local Government and Regions Committee in its report on empty homes that no new planning permissions should be granted for greenfield sites.

 The Secretary of State's Proposed Changes to Draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-west were published on 20 May 2002. The distribution of housing provision in the region is dealt with in Policy UR7. The broad split, set out as annual average rates of provision net of clearance, is as follows:

<a name="20625w19.html_para10">The Government are committed to maximising the re-use of previously developed land and the conversion of existing buildings to promote regeneration and minimise the amount of greenfield land being taken for development. Policy UR4 of the proposed draft Regional Planning Guidance regional brownfield target of at least 70 per cent. has been set. This varies from 90 per cent. in Liverpool/Manchester/Salford to 50 per cent. in Cumbria. Further investment will be needed to meet these challenging targets and the Northwest Development Agency's strategies will need to be integrated with those of local planning and housing authorities to regenerate urban areas with mixed and balanced communities.

 The Secretary of State's Proposed Changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-west were published on 20 May 2002. A key part of the strategy is to achieve the renaissance of urban areas by encouraging balanced economic growth and regeneration in a sustainable way. The proposed reduction in the annual rate of housing provision, coupled with an increase in the proportion of housing provided on previously used land from 65 per cent. to 70 per cent. are aimed at delivering this, while avoiding the premature release of greenfield land and promoting the use of recycled land, including the redevelopment of existing areas of unfit and unpopular housing; while supporting the Northwest Development Agency's aim of encouraging more employment in the NW region.
<P>

<a name="20625w19.html_para11">The plan monitor, manage approach will enable the annual rates of housing provision to be kept under continuous review, with an expectation that regional planning guidance will be reviewed and rolled forward at least every five years or more frequently if monitoring reveals clear signs of either under or over provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Between 1 January and 31 March 2002, there were 2,790 households in the South West region accepted by local authorities under statutory homelessness provisions, of which 153 were in the priority need category "vulnerable young person".
<P>

<a name="20625w20.html_para0">The Homelessness Act 2002 will place a statutory requirement on local housing authorities to adopt a strategy for preventing homelessness in their district and ensuring that sufficient accommodation, and any necessary support, is available for people who are, or may become homeless. On 14 March 2002, authorities were invited to submit proposals to the Homelessness Directorate in my Department for funding for local homelessness strategies. 21 authorities in the South West region have submitted bids which are being considered currently.
<P>

<a name="20625w20.html_para1">An Order has been laid for approval by Parliament to extend the groups of people who have a priority need for accommodation under the homelessness legislation. This will ensure that vulnerable homeless people leaving institutions, young people including those leaving care, and people fleeing domestic, racial and other forms of violence get the help they need.
<P>

<a name="20625w20.html_para2">In addition to the funding available for homelessness strategies, &#163;8 million per annum has been provided to local authorities (through the local government finance settlement, with effect from 2001&#150;02) to implement the Homelessness Act. A further &#163;10 million will be allocated in 2002&#150;03 to enable authorities to deliver the Priority Need Order.

 Rent Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which combine Deposit schemes and Rent in Advance/ Guarantee Schemes, can be effective in helping homeless households access the private rented sector. The Government fully recognise the valuable and vital service which Rent Deposit Guarantee Schemes can play in tackling homelessness. This is recognised in our recent report, "More than a roof". It is for this reason that we currently fund a number of rent deposit schemes aroundthe country, and we would expect local authorities

In addition, covering the same period, some 70,000 calls have been logged by the ILA centre in Darlington. These calls are not categorised and therefore are not included.

 The Department has a wide range of targets to deliver its agenda. High level targets are set out in "Delivering Results, A Strategy to 2006", available via the DfES website, www.dfes.gov.uk. These are cascaded through non-departmental public bodies, local education authorities and schools and reflected in their plans. Progress against targets is monitored by the Department, the Office for Standards in Education, the Adult Learning Inspectorate, and by non-departmental public bodies and local partners involved in the delivery of the education, training and skills agenda. The Department publishes information on performance against key targets in its departmental report, which is available from the House of Commons Library, and via the Department's website, www.dfes.gov.uk.

[62027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w22.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The requested information is not held centrally. Universities are responsible for setting their own level of tuition fees for overseas students. Overseas fees are generally around &#163;6,000 to &#163;8,000 per year for an undergraduate course but can range from &#163;4,000 to &#163;17,000 per year depending on the institution, the level and the type of course. The UK Government and other UK organisations provide a number of scholarships and awards to help international students study in the UK. For example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is providing up to 1,000 extra postgraduate and research places through the Chevening scholarship scheme. Universities also have flexibility in dealing with individual students' circumstances and waive or reduce fees where they consider appropriate: a number of universities are currently waiving overseas fees for students from Zimbabwe.

 Total funding for further education in 2002&#150;03 allocated to the Learning and Skills Council is &#163;4.25 billion. This is a &#163;313 million, or 5 per cent., increase over expenditure in 2001&#150;02. The allocations by the Department cover FE sector colleges and do not differentiate between sixth-form colleges and general FE colleges.
<P>

<a name="20625w23.html_para1">The LSC has a budget of &#163;1.35 billion for the funding of LEAs for post-16 education in schools in 2002&#150;03. Comparable figures for LEA spending in 2001&#150;02 are not available. Every school has a Real Terms Guarantee figure based on spending in the baseline year, 2000&#150;01. The overall budget for every school with a sixth form must contain an element which is at least equal to that amount. The 2002&#150;03 LSC funding allocation for two thirds of school sixth forms is higher under the LSC formula than under the Real Terms Guarantee.

 Over &#163;310 million is available to the further education sector over the period 2001&#150;04 for the teaching pay initiative, specifically to recruit, retain and reward high quality teachers and lecturers. This is separate to any general pay increase a teacher or lecturer may receive. We have also introduced training bursaries, and from this autumn we will be introducing golden hellos and (subject to the approval of Parliament) the repayment of teacher loans. All are recruitment and retention initiatives which offer significant financial rewards both to students training to be teachers and lecturers, as well as to those taking up teaching posts in FE shortage subject areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the role and responsibilities of Learning and Skills councils in regard to funding private training providers which provide courses accredited by official examination boards.  [62678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w23.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is able to fund training providers who were not previously eligible for Further Education Funding Council funding and who offer courses accredited by examination boards. It has produced a manual 'Initial Assessment of New Provision' which gives guidance on how it will assess and approve any new providers.
<P>

<a name="20625w23.html_para4">Once a provider has been judged to be a suitable supplier of post-16 learning provision, it is eligible for LSC funds. However private training providers do not have an automatic right to direct funding by the LSC. Local LSCs, as part of their planning work, will carry out a strategic assessment of the adequacy and quality of local provision to determine areas that need to be strengthened or where there are gaps in provision. It is a matter for the local councils to arrange for the delivery of such provision from appropriate existing or new providers.
<P>

<a name="20625w23.html_para5">Local councils also monitor the results of inspections of private training providers. It is crucial that the highest standards are achieved and maintained and, where this is not so, the councils will take tough action to improve or replace the provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 In November last year, the Department for Education and Skills jointly with the Department of Health published statutory guidance "Access to education for children and young people with Medical needs". The guidance sets out minimum standards

<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 830W</I><P>
of education for all children who are unable to attend school due to their medical needs, including those with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME).
<P>

<a name="20625w24.html_para0">Local Education Authorities' responsibilities towards pupils who are unable to attend school because of their medical needs should ensure that pupils are not at home without education for more than 15 working days and that children educated at home receive a minimum of five hours home tuition a week. The nature of the provision must be responsive to the demands of what can be a changing medical condition.
<P>

<a name="20625w24.html_para1">The Chief Medical Officer's report on Children and Young People with ME was published by the Department of Health in January this year, taking into account the recommendations of an independent working group. The report proposes ways in which clinicians and the National Health Service might improve the health and social care of those affected by CFS/ME. It also includes references to education provision.

<P>

<a name="20625w24.html_para2">Schools funding is paid to local education authorities who are required to devolve the majority of funding to head teachers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many national training organisations have been wound up; how many have been replaced by skills sector councils; and how many will not be replaced.  [63969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We have not wound up any national training organisations although we removed their formal recognition from 31 March 2002. National training organisations are independent bodies and are free to carry on as entities in their own right. The continued funding, operation and staffing of former national training organisations are decisions for the board of each organisation.
<P>

<a name="20625w24.html_para3">We are, however, establishing a smaller, stronger network of sector skills councils in sectors where employers can demonstrate their proposals meet stringent sector skills councils' standards. Former national training organisations may make proposals for a sector skills council licence although it has never been the intention to replace national training organisations with sector skills councils on a head to head basis.

 Data from NIRS fed into two regular pensions related national statistics publications issued by the Department. The publications were "Contributions and Qualifying Years for Retirement Pension" and "Second Tier Pension Provision". The most recent published data relates to the financial year 1995&#150;96. NIRS2 is now able to produce the data required for the Department's statistical publications and departmental analysts are currently working on processing and investigating NIRS2 data covering the financial years up to 2000&#150;01. It is intended that publication will resume later this year.

<P>
<a name="20625w26.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) report on Sefton council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para0">The BFI reports that the council has actively demonstrated a strong commitment towards raising standards within its benefits service and has many areas of good practice. The report also shows that Sefton has some scope for making improvements.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 835W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para1">The report notes that a single housing benefit and council tax benefit claim form had been introduced and that this was broadly in line with BFI's national model.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para2">Inspectors found that 94 per cent. of the claims examined had been assessed accurately and that the supporting evidence had been considered. A weakness was identified in the evidence gathered about earnings and capital.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para3">There were some delays in processing renewal claims and inadequate checks on claims that were not renewed. BFI also found that the council did not have a benefit overpayment policy and lacked the necessary management controls to be assured that overpayments were dealt with correctly.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para4">The council has taken positive steps to counter benefit fraud. The performance of the counter fraud team was found to be effective, systematically achieving successful prosecutions although the council had not offered administrative penalties or issued a caution since introducing its prosecution policy. Investigation work might also be targeted more effectively to increase the number of benefit frauds detected.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para5">Following a best value review by the council of its benefits services, elected Members had approved new investment to increase the number of staff allocated to benefits and improvement to IT.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para6">Sefton administered some &#163;73 million in housing benefits in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para7">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para9">A BFI best value inspection report on the benefits service is also published today and has been placed in the Library. It examines the service from a customer service and value for money point of view. For best value, inspectors found that Sefton council provided a fair or one star benefits service, which would probably improve to be equal to that of high-performing authorities.

<a name="20625w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The list in Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant contains broad headings, designed to ensure that all serious offences are caught. It is for the requesting state to decide whether the conduct in question falls within one of the headings.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para11">In the United Kingdom (UK), depending on circumstances, if issued by a judicial authority in the UK, "swindling" would include offences under the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para12">The UK has a number of offences which could fall into the category of "racism" and "xenophobia".

<a name="20625w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government are not responsible for the law of another European Union member state. It will be for the requesting state to establish that the offence in respect of which extradition is sought is one covered by the Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant.
<P>

<a name="20625w26.html_para13">The Government believe those who break the law of France while in that country should be returned to stand trial there, irrespective of whether the conduct is an offence under United Kingdom law. In the same way, we would expect France to return someone who had broken the law here even if the conduct was not contrary to French law.

[63331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The European arrest warrant system will operate in Gibraltar, as stated in Article 33 of the Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between member states.

 The Government believe that those who break the law of another European Union (EU) member state while in that country should be returned to stand trial there, irrespective of whether the conduct is an offence under United Kingdom law, in the same way that we would expect our EU partners to return someone who had broken the law here even if the conduct was not illegal in the person's country of nationality.

(2000), copies of which are in the Library, states that there is some suggestion that, for offenders in general, cannabis use is associated with a slight inflation of criminal involvement. However, for offenders who use heroin and crack/cocaine, whether or not they also use cannabis makes little difference to their considerably higher level of offending.

 The British digital passport is one of the most secure in the world. It is machine readable and complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard for passports. It contains a digital photograph and a digital signature of the holder, and the personal identification page is protected by a clear plastic laminate incorporating a holographic device which further protects the portrait. The personal identification page is also protected by a series of laser perforations. The use of special paper and printing techniques provide added security. The security features in the passport document remain under continuing review in case a feature is compromised by fraudsters.

<a name="20625w28.html_para4">The United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) is considering the use of biometrics (fingerprints, iris, facial recognition) in passport books and cards both to further enhance security and to prevent the issue of multiple passports in the same identity.

Death rates for cancer have fallen considerably during the 1990s for both England and the north east GOR.

Overall, hospital admission rates for serious injury have increased between 1995&#150;96 and 1999&#150;2000, although the number of years for which these data are available is not sufficient to establish a clear trend. The north east GOR has higher admission rates than the England average throughout this period and the gap has widened between England and the north east GOR both in absolute and relative terms (from 9 per cent. higher in 1995&#150;96 to 15 per cent. higher in 1999&#150;2000 in relative terms).

 The UK Biobank represents a database that can be used to investigate the combined effects of genotype, lifestyle and environmental exposures on the risk of developing the common multi-factorial diseases of later life. Policies on the ownership of intellectual property arising from research using the data contained within the UK Biobank have yet to be finalised, and are the subject of on-going consultation. Current thinking is that ownership of such intellectual property will reside with the organisation that hosts the workers undertaking the research. A key issue to be resolved is whether either the funding bodies or the hub should seek to retain any control over the intellectual property and whether this would be acceptable to the organisations hosting such research. A condition of using the UK Biobank is that, after a short period of time to allow for the preparation of publications or filing of patent applications, all results generated from analysis of the samples or data held must be added to the central databases and hence be made available to other researchers.

<a name="20625w33.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he expects to set up a new programme for the development of cardiac units in the UK.  [63606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w33.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2002]:</i> The expansion plans for cardiac units in England are part of the comprehensive programme of development in cardiac services set out in the national service framework for coronary heart disease. The expansion programme is being pursued to ensure that heart patients are treated according to need rather than location. Consequently, investment is being focused on those parts of England with historically low capacity in cardiac surgery. Capital developments are taking place in Papworth, Wolverhampton, South Tees, Bristol, Sheffield, Blackpool, Liverpool, Central Manchester, South Manchester, Leeds and Plymouth. These developments will be completed in 2006. Any further expansion in capacity will be considered in terms of its ability to deliver the standards of care set out in the national service framework. In addition, from 1 July, patients who have been waiting for more than six months for a heart operation will be offered the choice of treatment elsewhere, which will enable more patients to be treated more quickly.

 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> The Government recognise that delayed transfers of care are a problem across the south east and east Sussex has been acutely affected. East Sussex county council, in consultation with Surrey and Sussex health authority and the local national health service trusts, is currently exploring all possible options for reducing these delays.
<P>

<a name="20625w33.html_para0">Local authorities were required to provide a written statement of their proposed use of additional funding and the targets for reductions of delayed transfers. Progress towards targets has been monitored by the Department through the weekly reporting process and the capacity maps submitted to the Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w33.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what estimate he has made of the number of persons affected by wet age-related macular degeneration in one eye only who will pay privately to be treated by photodynamic therapy;  [63900]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many persons have a treatable form of wet age-related macular degeneration;  [63892]
<P>
(3) what plans he has to introduce speedy treatment of those with early wet age-related macular degeneration;  [63899]
<P>
(4) what advice he intends to issue on restricting the treatment of <i>(a)</i> cataracts, <i>(b)</i> glaucoma and <i>(c)</i> diabetic retinopathy to persons in whom both eyes are affected; and if he will make a statement;  [63895]
<P>
(5) what assessment he has made of draft NICE guidance that those with an eye in which the sight is worse than 6/36 should not be treated by photodynamic therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration; and if he will make a statement as to the number of persons who would go blind as a result of its implementation;  [63896]

</UL><P><I>25 Jun 2002 : Column 862W</I><P>
<UL>
<P>
(6) how many persons NICE recommends should be treated by photodynamic therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration; and if he will make a statement;  [63893]
<P>
(7) what advice he intends to issue to ophthalmologists concerning the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration in one eye only;  [63894]
<P>
(8) what assessment he has made of the increased risk to a person with sight in one eye only of <i>(a)</i> injury and <i>(b)</i> disease leading to blindness;  [63897]
<P>
(9) what steps he intends to take to ensure early diagnosis of wet age-related macular degeneration affecting the other eye of a person in whom one eye is already affected.  [63898]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20625w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 24 June 2002]:</i> A study sponsored by the Macular Disease Society in 2001 estimated that there were 182,000 people with age-related macular degeneration with a best eye visual acuity below that judged appropriate for certification as blind or partially sighted. It is estimated that 10 to 15 per cent. of those will have the "wet" type of the condition, for which photodynamic therapy is intended as a treatment. However, it is not possible to say how many of those are affected in only one eye.
<P>

<a name="20625w33.html_para1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published their final appraisal determination (FAD) on the use of photodynamic therapy as a treatment for age-related macular degeneration on 12 June. The appraisal process has not yet been completed and NICE have not made any recommendations on photodynamic therapy. NICE are seeking the views of consultees during the appeal process and will consider carefully any points that are made.
<P>

<a name="20625w33.html_para2">NICE's recommendations may change as a result of the appeal process; it would therefore be inappropriate for the Department to comment at this time. The Department will consider the implications of the final NICE guidance. The earliest guidance could be available to the NHS is at the end of July or early August, providing there are no appeals.
<P>

<a name="20625w33.html_para3">The NICE guidance on photodynamic therapy will not have implications for the treatment of cataracts, glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy.

<P>

<a name="20625w34.html_para0">The role of redundancy committees is set out in the University Commissioners' Model Statutes which arises from the Education Reform Act 1988. Academic staff in medical schools who are employees of a university will be covered by statutes adopted in line with the model.
