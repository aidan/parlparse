 The policy of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;as set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3)&#151;is not to set region-wide targets or quotas for affordable housing. Targets are more appropriately set at the local level as they are, necessarily, derived from local circumstances and assessments. The figures set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the South West (RPG10) are, therefore, not a target but an indicator against which the provision of affordable housing can be monitored. Although better quality information than currently available is needed to assess how we are progressing against this indicator, we do know that we are not yet providing sufficient affordable homes. That is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has accepted Kate Barker&#039;s recommendation that there should be a step-change in housing supply. Over the coming months, we will be consulting on a package of proposals designed to

The Housing Corporation&#039;s Approved Development Programme (ADP) for the financial years 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 is worth &#163;188.2 million and will deliver approximately 6,000 affordable homes in the South West.

PPG3 requires that Local Planning authorities should plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable and special needs housing. The provision of affordable housing is a local authority responsibility and should be made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs.

<p><a name="40719w05.html_wqn0"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the health impact of the implementation of traffic congestion charges in cities where there is experience of their operation.  [184388]</p>








<p><a name="40719w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Mayor of London introduced a scheme to reduce congestion in central London in February 2003. Early indications suggest that congestion charging has resulted in a significant reduction in road traffic in central London. The First Annual Monitoring Report by Transport for London (TfL) considered the direct effect of the congestion charge on air quality would be relatively modest. TfL&#039;s Second Annual Report estimated small decreases in both PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  particles and nitrogen oxides in the charging zone. It is too early, however, to assess fully the air quality changes and thus to calculate the implied impact on health. GLA/TfL estimated that congestion charging would result in between 150 and 250 fewer reported accidents, involving injury, per year within Greater London. TfL&#039;s Second Annual Report highlighted that the recent pattern of decreasing levels of accidents within the charging zone is continuing, and there is no evidence of detrimental change in road traffic accidents within or around the zone.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures his Department <i>(a)</i> has put in place and <i>(b)</i> plans to put in place regarding the implementation of the Dangerous Goods Safety Advisors scheme throughout the transport industry.  [184590]</p>









<p><a name="40719w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The requirement for the appointment of Dangerous Goods Safety Advisers stemmed from EU Directives 96/35/EC (June 1996) and 2000/18/EC (April 2000). Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 257 implemented the requirement into national legislation&#151;The Transport of Dangerous Goods (Safety Advisers) Regulations 1999 (as amended). The 1999 regulations were later subsumed into Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 586&#151;The Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2004. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jul 2004 : Column 16W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
This legislation implemented the requirements of the EU Framework Directives for Rail and Road, which required member states to align their national legislation with the international requirements for the transport of dangerous goods by rail and road. Similar legislation is in place in Northern Ireland.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many diabetic retinopathy sufferers have had their driving licences revoked in each of the past three years; how many appealed against the decision; and how many had their licence subsequently returned.  [184633]</p>








<p><a name="40719w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Information on the total number of revocations over the last three years for drivers who have diabetic retinopathy is not available without incurring disproportionate costs. When a licence is revoked, the driver is always offered the opportunity to provide fresh evidence, which in such cases would normally be in the form of further visual field charts. If the new fields satisfy the standard, a licence will be re-issued. No information is readily available on how many drivers have their licences returned on this basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w05.html_para1">
Since 2001, 18 drivers revoked because of diabetic retinopathy have formally appealed to a magistrates court in England and Wales or to a Sheriff Court in Scotland. Three went to a full hearing and of these two were dismissed and one was upheld and a new licence was issued. The other 15 appeals were withdrawn and eight have subsequently been issued with licences following the submission of fresh visual fields which met the required standard.

Together with our forces in Kabul, we now contribute around 580 personnel to the ISAF, and are also engaged in providing wider support to security sector reform in Afghanistan. Looking ahead, and as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced to the House on 30 June, we have offered to deploy the Headquarters of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps to lead ISAF in 2006.

<p><a name="40719w08.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Caplin  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 July 2004]:</i> The training objectives of each of the cadet forces are broadly similar, differing only to reflect the traditions and ethos of the parent Service. They support the key themes of the Government youth policies by providing training aimed at capacity building, maximising personal potential and social inclusion. Training is undertaken by cadets under two broad headings: military training and adventurous training in the approximate proportions of 60 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively. The military training functions are as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">a. To provide the opportunity for young people to exercise responsibility and leadership, and to learn from the Services how they can be best developed.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">b. To impart a basic knowledge and understanding of the role of the armed forces.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">c. To encourage those who have an interest in the Services to be aware of the career opportunities the armed forces have to offer.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w08.html_para1">
The adventurous training includes activities that are arduous and include an element of risk to test the courage and endurance of cadets and develop their qualities of character.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w08.html_para2">
The military training syllabi contain such topics as turnout and drill, skill at arms, shooting, map and compass, fieldcraft, and first aid. Rock climbing, mountain walking, canoeing, caving, offshore sailing, sub aqua diving and parachuting are just some of the approved adventurous training activities undertaken by cadets with the view to making them better citizens.

<p><a name="40719w09.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The main activity of the Ministry of Defence is to deliver security for the people of the United Kingdom and the Overseas Territories by defending their security, including against terrorism, and so to act as a force for good by strengthening international peace and stability.

As part of its responsibility to take care of all its personnel the Ministry of Defence, through the Defence Medical Services, provides comprehensive medical services, to standards at least equal to the NHS, to Servicemen and women in peace, war and operations other than war in order to maintain military capability. In the main, primary care is delivered by the single Services. Secondary care for Service personnel is usually provided through routine treatment within the NHS unless there are operational reasons to do otherwise. In the UK, medical services for families of Servicemen and women are usually provided within the NHS. Overseas, the Ministry of Defence is committed to providing medical services for families accompanying Service personnel which are comparable to those provided by the NHS.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 15 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column 835W, on the STEPS agreement, what his present estimate is of the total payments over the 20 years&#039; contract that will be paid to Mapeley STEPS Ltd. for the Chancellor&#039;s departments.  [184339]</p>








<p><a name="40719w13.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 In their report on the STEPS deal, the NAO estimated that the Departments would pay Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd. some &#163;1,500 million over the 20 years of the contract. This relates to the major contract price element (the facility price) for serviced accommodation. The NAO noted that this cost reflected the Departments anticipated requirements which may vary over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w13.html_para1">
Taking this uncertainty into account, the figure contained in the NAOs report remains a reasonable estimate of the likely total Facility Price payments due to Mapeley over 20 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w13.html_para2">
In addition to this the contract provides a flexible framework in which we are able to transact with Mapeley to provide a range of services including, utilities, business rates, and major and minor building works. Under the contract the cost of these additional services are charged on to the departments separately and will vary according to demand.

 The Departments made payments that were provided for in the contract and due to Mapeley STEPS Contractor Ltd. in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. By its nature any serviced accommodation contract provides a flexible framework for provision of a variety of services. In the case of the STEPS contract the Departments are able to transact with Mapeley to call off services including the provision of Major and Minor change works and the payment of Utilities. These are in addition to the fixed facility payment element due under the contract for serviced accommodation.

 It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the value of the Government art collection, which has no current market valuation. The current monetary value of a work of art can be accurately assessed only at the time of purchase or sale or by professional valuation.

The BIOT Government and the US authorities collaborate on all aspects of the conservation and protection of the natural environment of Diego Garcia and, where appropriate, of the outer islands of the Territory. In this context, the US authorities on Diego Garcia have established a Natural Resources Management Plan and they expend considerable resources on environmental conservation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w17.html_para2">
However, these problems can only be resolved through a political rather than military solution. Continuing human rights abuses in Chechnya by federal and local forces can only undermine attempts to advance a genuine political process and reconciliation.

The report concluded that the Republic of Congo failed to meet agreed minimum common standards and was therefore undermining the credibility of the Kimberley Process. We support the decision to expel and stand ready to consider any request from the Republic of Congo for technical assistance to help it meet the standard required and thereby eventually re-join the Process.

 Through our Consulate-General in Jerusalem and the British Information Service Office in Gaza we conduct discussions with the Palestinian Authority on a range of issues. These crucially include how the UK can support the Palestinian Authority in meeting its obligations under the Roadmap; work with the Palestinian Authority to build its capacity on security is one such example. My noble Friend Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean last visited the Palestinian Authority in January 2004. The Consulate-General offers a full visa and consular service in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territories.

The UK is a significant bilateral donor of development assistance in the Occupied Territories.

Her Majesty&#039;s Government legislates through Orders in Council either because Parliament has provided for delegated legislation under a particular Act to be made in that way, or because a Prerogative power is being exercised which can be given legislative force in no other way.

The overwhelming majority of children arriving in the UK do so legitimately and safely and give no cause for concern.

<i>[holding answer 14 July 2004]:</i> The Immigration Service does not routinely collect data on children arriving in the United Kingdom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w22.html_para1">
Child Protection Officers are based at Heathrow Airport and at the Croydon Asylum Screening Unit in order to strengthen the links between the police and the Immigration Service to counter child trafficking and problems associated with unaccompanied minors. In addition social services have recently placed staff at the Croydon Asylum Screening Unit to work alongside Immigration Service staff advising them on child welfare issues. A scoping study is also being undertaken to examine the feasibility of social work teams being based at the major ports of entry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w22.html_para2">
The Immigration Service also participated in Operation Paladin Child, initiated by the Metropolitan Police Child Protection Command to define the nature of child migration from non-EU countries to the UK via Heathrow, and which also involved the NSPCC and Hillingdon Social Services. The report into the operation&#039;s findings made a number of recommendations, including the creation of multi-agency partnership teams at major ports.

<p><a name="40719w22.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 It is well known that terrorists use false and multiple identities to help undertake and finance their activities in the UK and abroad. An identity card scheme would disrupt the use of false identities by terrorist organisations, for example in the money laundering and organised crime, which support their terrorist activities. Such operations are generally perpetrated over long periods of time.

The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) provides funding to the higher education institutions and further education colleges it funds to widen access and improve provision for disabled students. It publishes an annual series of performance indicators that cover access, progression, retention, research, graduate employment and disability. The allocation of funds reflects the proportion of students that each institution recruits who are in receipt of the disabled students allowance (DSA).

<p><a name="40719w28.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The London Schools Admissions System (LSAS) has been developed by the Local Education Authorities (LEAs) in London to create an infrastructure which will simplify the secondary school admissions process for London parents. From September 2005, all 33 London boroughs and eight adjoining LEAs will co-operate to process applications for secondary schools. Parents will be able to apply for up to six maintained secondary schools on a single application form. Individual admission authorities will continue to consider applications under their published arrangements, but where an applicant is eligible for a place at more than one school the LSAS will offer the applicant the available school ranked highest on their application form. This will ensure that no child gets more than one offer and that more children are offered a school place on the national offer date of 1 March. We are confident that because fewer children will be left with no offer of a school place, the LSAS will help to reduce the anxiety and frustration which many parents, pupils and schools feel under the current application system.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from Essex LEAs&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data are subject to change by the LEA. Section 52 is collected at local authority level, not constituency level, so the figures provided are for Essex LEA. 1997&#150;98 figures are for Essex LEA prior to local government reorganisation. From 1998&#150;99 onwards parts of Essex LEA became Southend and Thurrock LEAs. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. This change in calculation is identified by the use of italics. The 2002&#150;03 figure is calculated by taking all the LEA expenditure, excluding CERA and Youth and Community, and dividing it by the FTE pupil numbers in maintained pre-primary, primary, secondary and special schools.<br>

3. The figures shown are calculated by dividing the LEA expenditure by the number of pupils in maintained establishments, Essex has a large proportion of its pre-primary pupils educated outside mainstream establishments. If these are taken into account then the unit cost in 2001&#150;02 reduces to approximately &#163;3,110 and in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;3,300.<br>

4. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

5. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

Much bed capacity can be released through simply reducing the current, often substantial, temporary peaks and troughs in bed occupancy.

Trusts have identified improving the way they use their bed capacity as a top priority and significant support is being delivered through the national programme to improve throughput in accident and emergency. Improved use of beds is critical to delivering this priority alongside the priorities on electives.

<i>[holding answer 16 July 2004]:</i> Contracts for the provision of sterile services may arise as a result of an individual outsourcing procurement, as part of a large private finance initiative or public private partnership or where one national health service trust provides such services for others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w34.html_para0">
Decisions on whether to let contracts and to whom are for individual NHS trusts to take, within the rules relating to such procurements and details are not held centrally.

As part of their strategies for modernising sterile services, strategic health authorities are encouraging the setting up of joint ventures, which entails a number of NHS trusts pooling their demand, and advertising jointly for a private sector partner. Information about the joint ventures established so far is set out in the table. The details of these contracts have not yet been agreed.

<p><a name="40719w34.html_wqn1"><b> Clive Efford: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to prevent the advertising and selling of drugs via the internet that are only available in the UK with a general practitioner&#039;s prescription.  [183492]</p>








<p><a name="40719w34.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The responsibility for regulating medicines on the United Kingdom market lies with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the Department. The MHRA takes the view that internet and mail order sale and supply of medicines is acceptable, provided the legislative requirements are met. There are perfectly legitimate internet-based dispensing pharmacies, where patients can sign their prescriptions and post them to the pharmacist to be filled. Medicines are then sent back to the patient by post. The law allows for this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w34.html_para2">
The MHRA is also responsible for the enforcement of these requirements and any website brought to its attention for breaching regulations regarding advertising, sale and supply of medicines will be investigated. Such sites will be contacted, initially in order to seek compliance and although the MHRA has no powers to force closures of websites, it seeks to achieve compliance through internet service providers (ISPs), which are advised on UK law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w34.html_para3">
The MHRA recognises that, in order to deal with the risks posed by the internet, it is impossible to act unilaterally. To this end, the MHRA&#039;s enforcement group works closely with other Government Departments and law enforcement authorities, both in the European Community and elsewhere, in an effort to address possible courses of action.

<p><a name="40719w34.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Many diseases and illnesses which have been routinely treated with surgical intervention are now being successfully managed or cured with less invasive forms of treatment. Last year the Department issued guidelines to the national health service governing the use of new interventional procedures. The guidelines are supported by the work of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).

<p><a name="40719w34.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 July 2004]:</i> Patients with myasthenia gravis are able to access a range of national health service services. Although there is no cure for this condition, there are a number of treatments available to help control it. These include medication, surgery, and palliation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40719w34.html_para5">
We have no specific plans to raise awareness of the condition among the medical profession. However, we are committed to improving services for patients with neurological diseases.

<p><a name="40719w34.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to determine what criteria they use in deciding whether to fund a treatment or therapy which has not been appraised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

<p><a name="40719w34.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Critical care transfers between hospitals occur for non-clinical reasons where critical care beds or other necessary resources are not immediately available. There are 29 critical care networks that work with commissioners and providers to assess the needs of the critically ill, plan services to meet those needs, agree standards and monitor the

 Following consultation on the future of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS), the Department started confidential bilateral negotiations with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry on new arrangements.
