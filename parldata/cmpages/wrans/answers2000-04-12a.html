 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Sixteen Air Assault Brigade formed on 1 September 1999. It already has three infantry battalions and three aviation regiments under command. It is supported by a dedicated artillery regiment although this will not move from Aldershot to Colchester until at least 2003. The Engineer Regiment to support the Brigade will be formed when barrack facilities have been constructed at Woodbridge in 2003.
<P>

<a name="00412w01.html_para0">In the interim 9 Parachute Squadron RE and 51 Air Assault Squadron will continue to support the Brigade from their current locations--Aldershot and Ripon respectively. The logistic units which support the Brigade are currently reorganising to their new structure and this should be complete by 2002. The Brigade is also preparing to exploit the potential of the Westland Apache helicopter, the first squadron of which is due to be operational in late 2002.

 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Two new engineer regiments and three new engineer squadrons are to be formed. 26 (Close Support) Engineer Regiment, has started forming and will be operational by October this year. One of its squadrons cannot, however, be formed before 2003, the date on which its accommodation is planned to become available. The Regiment is initially being formed in Horne Barracks, Larkhill, and early next year it will move into modular accommodation in Ludgershall, thereby allowing Horne Barracks to be refurbished for 19 Field Regiment RA. Its long-term location will be Swinton Barracks, Perham Down, but this is not expected to be complete until 2003 at the earliest.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many houses specifically for junior officers in the Royal Navy are planned to be built, at what cost and in what locations, in <i>(a)</i> 1999-2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [118063]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00412w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 During 1999-2000 25 three bedroomed houses were released in a phased handover at Broadwater Park, Ilchester, Yeovil to meet a Royal Navy requirement for junior officers, i.e. Lieutenants and Sub Lieutenants. The accommodation was made available through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme. The annual charge for this type of property, which includes maintenance to an agreed standard, is commercially sensitive information. I am therefore withholding the information under exemption 7a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

<a name="00412w01.html_para5">During 2000-01 it is planned that a PFI contract for Bristol, Bath, Portsmouth and Shrivenham will be placed. This will provide 70 officers' houses at Seafield Park, Stubbington (including 15 which will be built using Ministry of Defence capital) to meet a joint RN and RAF requirement. The majority are likely to be allocated to RN families. Firm costs are not yet available and are likely to be commercially sensitive. It is expected that construction will be completed during 2001-02.

 None. The Stabilised Weapon and Reconnaissance Mount is a privately funded venture to develop a stabilised weapon and sensor system.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2000]:</i> The tenders were assessed by Ministry of Defence staff from the Nuclear Weapons area of the Defence Procurement Agency, the Director Nuclear Policy and the Assistant Chief Scientific Adviser (Nuclear) as well as external advisers on legal and commercial matters. Officials from the independent regulators, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) and the Environment Agency (EA), were also kept fully informed and consulted as necessary throughout the process. I am withholding the names under Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information on the grounds that, given their involvement in high security work, they are potentially vulnerable to the attentions of terrorists, foreign agencies and anti-nuclear groups.

 MOD no longer owns either docking or berthing facilities in Rosyth. If NATO ships wished to dock in the former Naval Dockyard it would be by arrangement with the relevant commercial company.

The Commission will consider the matter if and when either authority makes proposals for a licensing scheme.

 The United Nations estimate that more than 12 million people face serious food shortages in the Horn of Africa. This is the result of the failure of the rains or very low rainfall in the past three years coupled with ongoing armed conflicts in the region and the presence of large numbers of refugees and displaced persons. The UN launched an appeal for &#163;190 million on 28 January. The UN Secretary General has now appointed Catherine Bertini, Head of the World Food Programme, as his Special Envoy on the drought in the Horn of Africa. She will visit the region 11-19 April.

 We have established a planning figure of about &#163;23.35 million for bilateral expenditure in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan in 2000-01 compared to an expected outturn of &#163;13.35 million for 1999-2000. This increase was programmed earlier this year following advance warning of the deteriorating food security situation in the Horn of Africa. The funds are available to support development programmes and emergency interventions. Actual expenditure for individual countries like all other planning figures are likely to vary depending on needs. In addition, the EU and other multilateral organisations to which we provide substantial support will be providing assistance to the region.

 We have provided &#163;10 million towards the cost of repairing the electricity distribution network. Our aim has been to help the local authorities and where appropriate other donors with the supply of equipment and technical advice on the electrical distribution system throughout Kosovo. We have provided &#163;2 million to the water sector, which has included specific repairs to pumping stations. We have also supplied infrastructure equipment to allow the water companies to carry out essential repairs. In addition we have provided &#163;250,000 for the replacement of 5,000 household water pumps through Action Against Hunger.

<P>
<a name="00412w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Some GPs and hospitals have been uncertain about releasing miners' medical records because they were not clear about the legal basis on which records are being sought and their own obligations. The Department has been in close consultation with the Department of Health and the BMA to enlist the help of medical record holders to ensure prompt release of records. The Department has agreed with both these bodies a statement on the legal basis for disclosure and the operational arrangements for access and copying, including the payment of appropriate fees to the record holders. On this basis, the NHS Executive has issued guidance to NHS Trusts and Health Authorities, and the BMA has also issued guidance to GPs. Both have stressed the vital part that hospitals and GPs play in assisting the compensation process. I understand that the guidance is already helping to speed up the records collection exercise, and I very much welcome the co-operation which the medical profession is showing.

The attached table shows non-seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force (LFS) which is the main source of labour market data on individuals. It gives the average number of men and women in full or part-time employment by age group between winter (December to February) 1998/9 and autumn (September to November) 1999.
<BR>
The estimates for groups over 80 years of age have been combined in the table as those for the individual age groups requested proved to be statistically unreliable.
<BR>
People aged 16 or over are classed as in employment by the LFS if they have done at least one hour of paid work (as an employee or self-employed) in the week prior to their LFS interview of if they have a job that they are temporarily away from. People who do unpaid work in a family business and people on Government- supported training and employment programmes are also included according to the International Labour Organisation convention.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on work carried out by the ONS on a retail price index reflecting goods and services used by pensioners and recipients of income support. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Each quarter the ONS publishes in the Consumer Price Indices Business Monitor (MM23) separate indices for one and two pensioner households, using weights derived from relevant expenditure information from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). These indices exclude a number of items in the Retail Prices Index (RPI), including charges for NHS services, all housing costs and staff restaurant meals. NHS charges are excluded because they are generally not paid by pensioners, and housing costs are excluded because pensioners are mostly cushioned from rises by the receipt of rebates. Pensioners do not have staff restaurant meals. For rail and bus fares, special pensioners rail and bus fare indices are substituted for the normal index household indices to allow for fare concessions available in some areas.
<BR>
Between January 1987, the latest reference period for the RPI, and the fourth quarter of 1999, the RPI increased by 66.8%. In the same period, the one-person pensioner household index increased by 50.1% and the two-person pensioner household index increased by 54.9%.
<BR>
The ONS does not construct a separate index for recipients of income support, but does construct the Rossi index each month. This is used for uprating state income-related benefits once a year. The Rossi index is the all items RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, rent, council tax and owner-occupiers' depreciation costs. This is not published, but is made available on request to the ONS.
<BR>
Between January 1987 and December 1999, the RPI increased by 67.3%. In the same period, the Rossi index increased by 61.8%.

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many people are in receipt of child benefit allowance in the Crosby constituency; and what percentage they constitute of the total population of the constituency.
<BR>
As of 28 February 1999, the number of households receiving child benefit in the Crosby constituency was approximately 9,000. This data is based on a 5 per cent. sample of child benefit records and has been derived from the information available in that sample based on residential postcodes.
<BR>
Due to the insufficient postcode data supplied to Analytical Services Division from the child benefit computer system, it has been difficult to derive accurate statistics by constituency. The Department is however, attempting to resolve this issue by improving the quality and accuracy of the postcode data and will make this information available as soon as this is achieved.
<BR>
Population data for Crosby is also not available in the format requested. The Office of National Statistics have advised that the 1991 census survey is based on Enumeration District information and are unable to match this to constituencies.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking about people in receipt of certain benefits in your constituency.
<BR>
Information is not available for all the relevant benefits in the format requested. Unfortunately, population figures are not available for the Crosby constituency and I cannot, therefore, express any figures as a percentage of the population.
<BR>
Prior to 1998, figures for recipients of Disability Living Allowance were based on a 5% sample and the numbers for the Crosby constituency are too small to be statistically reliable. However, since 1998, the figures are based on a 100% sample and the details for 1998 and 1999 are set out below.

The figures for Severe Disablement Allowance cannot be provided as the sample is too small to be statistically valid and the figures for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be provided as they are not available by Parliamentary constituency.
<BR>

<BR>
The only other benefit paid specifically for carers is the Income Support Carers Premium. Figures by Parliamentary constituency has only been available since 1998 but the numbers in the 5% sample are too small to be statistically valid.
<BR>
For Incapacity Benefit, it is not possible to break down the age bands, as the 5% sample is too small to be statistically valid. I have provided below the total figure for the age band 18-65 for the years 1995-1999.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking about the plans to reduce processing times for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claims.

We have been experiencing delays recently in the processing of DLA claims. We recognise that this situation is not acceptable and that ensuring the efficient and timely processing of claims is a priority. We are taking action to address the problems currently being experienced.

To reduce delays, we have moved staff from other, less critical areas, of our business and we have set up a special team to identify further process improvements. We are also taking action to reduce variations in performance between different processing units.

 Interest-free budgeting loans from the Social Fund, designed to spread the cost of routine lump-sum expenses over a longer period, are available to a wide variety of groups receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. People who take out such loans, including pensioners receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, are choosing to use some of their income to pay them back, by deductions from benefit, in the same way that they organise and manage their income to meet other weekly outgoings. It would not be fair or appropriate to exempt any one group from this straightforward repayment arrangement.

<a name="00412w07.html_para9">Council Conclusions were also agreed in response to the Commission Communication on a review of the fifth Environment Action Programme. These will assist the Commission in preparing a proposal for the sixth Environment Action Programme, due by the end of this year.

Climate change, waste management, resource use, biodiversity, soil degradation, desertification and reducing the environmental and health risks caused by chemicals and GMOs were identified as priorities for the programme. The need for better analysis of environmental issues and the costs and advantages of measures was also noted as was the need to improve implementation and enforcement of Community environmental legislation.

 For the three years 1998-99 to 2000-01 we are providing &#163;1.3 million a year for additional rural bus services in the North East. In 1998-99 that money provided for 105 new or enhanced services. Further, we have provided &#163;2.3 million for seven projects in the North East as part of the Rural Bus Challenge competitions, which aim to stimulate innovation in rural bus services.
<P>

<a name="00412w08.html_para0">The Transport Bill at present before Parliament contains provisions to guarantee that all elderly people will be entitled to at least half-price travel on local buses; we have recently announced that any associated bus pass will be free of charge. These measures will bring benefit to all regions but will be particularly welcome in areas where at present the local authority offer a less generous concessionary fare scheme, or none at all.
<P>

<a name="00412w08.html_para1">In addition, we have commissioned research to identify transport measures that could help to reduce social exclusion. The research, which is due to be completed shortly, looks specifically at the needs of people on low incomes.

 The Passenger Service Requirements in franchise agreements specify the minimum number of services which must call at particular stations. Train operators may provide additional services where they perceive a demand. Where additional calls at particular stations require additional subsidy this may be provided by local authorities, or through our Rail Passenger Partnership scheme.

 The Secretary of State has had no such discussions.

<P>
<P>

<a name="00412w09.html_para0">Hampshire county council together with the unitary authorities will, in the light of advice in Planning Policy Guidance Note PPG3 and the emerging Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG), need to review their structure plan and bring forward alterations they consider necessary.
<P>

<a name="00412w09.html_para1">Meanwhile, the district and unitary authorities are required to consider PPG3 and the emerging RPG in preparing their local plans in conformity with the newly- adopted structure plan. The structure plan only distributes housing to district level, and apart from the four Major Development Areas, is not prescriptive. The districts, therefore, need to consider how to meet their requirements taking account of the advice in PPG3 on such matters as maximising use of land, avoiding inefficient development, encouraging higher densities and a wider variety of dwellings, thus reducing land take. In bringing forward their local plan proposals they should also take account of our advice to recycle existing buildings and to review all non-housing allocations including industrial and commercial allocations.

 The regulations to introduce the new blue parking badge for disabled people came into effect on 1 April.
<P>

<a name="00412w09.html_para7">Distribution of the new blue badges took place during the last week in March to local authorities who had placed orders. The majority of those local authorities received badges ready for business on Monday, 3 April. However, owing to some technical problems at the printer/supplier, some authorities did not receive the badges until Tuesday, 4 April.
<P>

<a name="00412w09.html_para8">My Department were informed by our supplier at the end of March that some local authorities had not placed orders for badges, despite letters prompting them to do so from both the Department and the badge supplier. Officials have since written again to all local authorities on this issue. From the checks we have carried out, and from the information provided by the supplier, we believe almost all local authorities have placed orders and have received a supply of badges. We have, however, taken the precaution of writing to ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) asking them to advise members not to take enforcement action against anyone displaying an orange badge which expires in April which is otherwise being used in accordance with the regulations.
<P>

<a name="00412w09.html_para9">We regret that the transition has not been as smooth as we would have wished, but we hope the action we have taken will avoid any distress or confusion for any disabled motorist who has difficulty getting a blue badge.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what effect the contaminated land regime which came into force for England on 1 April will have on the programme of financial support to English local authorities and to the Environment Agency to meet the costs of dealing with contaminated land.

<P>
<a name="00412w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The new contaminated land regime (under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990--inserted by section 57 of the Environment Act 1995) came into force in England on 1 April 2000. The Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval (SCA) programme will continue to provide support to English local authorities to deal with contamination. The SCA programme will assist these local authorities in dealing with sites, for which they are responsible, that are deemed to be "contaminated land" under Part IIA. &#163;21 million has been made available under this programme for 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para0">The SCA programme has provided valued support to English local authorities in dealing with contaminated land and, in later years, provided additional grand in aid to the Environment Agency. Under the new regime the grant will be available to the Agency in respect of their new duties for contaminated sites that are designated "Special Site" under Part IIA.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para1">Authorities with on-going contractual commitments for projects funded in previous years have already received notification that support will continue to be available this year. I have agreed the programme for new projects to start this year and my Department has written today to the successful authorities and to the Environment Agency notifying them of the financial allocations which are being made.

 We consulted extensively in 1998 on which roads should be the responsibility of the Mayor and we announced the Government's intentions for the GLA road network in February 1999. The GLA road network is based on the current red and primary route networks with some adjustments in central London and docklands. Earlier this year, we consulted further on the detail of the orders needed to create the network we had announced. We received 53 responses. Many of these were technical drafting suggestions, but there were 26 which either

<P><I>12 Apr 2000 : Column: 179W</I><P>
supported or opposed the inclusion of Belgrave Road in Pimlico. I have placed a summary of all the representations in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para4">I have considered carefully all the representations received. In the case of Belgrave Road, the Traffic Director for London has confirmed he is content with Westminster City council's proposals for traffic management in the area and the council has given assurances that they will undertake the necessary works. In the light of this, I have concluded that Belgrave Road should not be designated as a GLA road now. From 8 May, it will be for the Mayor to keep the GLA road network under review. The Mayor may change the GLA road network with the agreement of the local borough, or in the absence of such agreement, with the confirmation of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para5">I have placed maps of the first GLA road network in the Library and shall shortly lay orders to designate the first GLA roads for which Transport for London, the Mayor's new transport executive, will be the highway and traffic authority from 3 July. I shall also be laying 32 GLA Side Roads Orders, one for each borough in which there are GLA roads. These orders will give Transport for London traffic authority powers over small sections of side roads associated with the GLA roads which are currently subject to red route controls.

<P>
<a name="00412w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I am today announcing the issue of a consultation paper seeking comments by 12 July on proposals to introduce new controls on water pollution from oil stores in England. I understand that the National Assembly for Wales is considering introducing similar proposals in due course.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para6">Oil-related water pollution incidents in England accounted for 30 per cent. of all water pollution in 1998, mainly due to leaks from unbunded oil storage tanks. It is my intention to introduce new Regulations later this year to reduce the number of such oil-related incidents in England by about a half by the year 2005. This would be achieved by setting design standards for all above ground oil stores and requiring that secondary containment, such as a "bund" (a surrounding wall) or "drip tray" is in place to prevent oil escaping into controlled waters.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para7">Oil pollution of fresh waters has grown in recent years, causing harm to wildlife, damage to our rivers and disruption to water supplies. These proposed new Regulations would be a cost-effective measure that would help to protect the environment.
<P>

<a name="00412w10.html_para8">Those mainly affected by the proposed new Regulations would include anyone storing oil on industrial, commercial, institutional (residential and non-residential) premises. There would be exceptions in certain circumstances, for example, where other controls exist or where the controls would not be cost-effective. Underground oil storage tanks can be regulated by the Environment Agency under the Groundwater Regulations 1998 and it is not considered necessary to introduce further controls.

 <i>[holding answer 11 April 2000]:</i> We are making nearly &#163;500 million available over three years to help schools improve pupil behaviour. This is backed up with new guidance on "Social Inclusion: Pupil Support" issued last July which offers schools advice on good practice in tackling pupils' behavioural problems. In addition, the Excellence in Cities initiative includes the provision of Learning Mentors and Learning Support Units to help school better manage disruptive pupils.

 <i>[holding answer 11 April 2000]:</i> My Department has not carried out an assessment of the impact of poor behaviour on achievement.

<P>

<a name="00412w11.html_para16">In addition, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of School's latest annual report, published in February, shows the clear link between standards of behaviour and educational achievement. For example, in the majority of secondary schools pupils have positive attitudes to their lessons and to school; however, in a minority, pupils' attitudes to learning are particularly poor in Year 9 because not enough is done to respond to early indicators of pupil disaffection.

 The Government cannot force decommissioning to occur. It has to be a voluntary, inclusive and consensual process. I hope by 22 May we will have the issue addressed. The all-party consultation process that is now under way is designed to re-build confidence on all sides so that progress can be made.

 The report of the Review of the Criminal Justice system in Northern Ireland was published on 30 March 2000. The report puts forward almost 300 recommendations covering all aspects of the criminal justice system, including a number which deal directly with arrangements for young people who offend. The Government are now consulting with the political parties, the Irish Government, members of the public and those

The purpose of this exercise is to determine the number and location of juvenile justice centres needed against a background of a reduced custody population. The consultation period will extend over three months.

 Military strengths are recorded on the first of each month and it is therefore not possible to provide an accurate figure for the dates requested. On 1 October 1999 there were 14,552 soldiers in the province and on l January 2000 there were 14,319 soldiers in the Province. These are the nearest available dates to those requested.

 We continue to work in close co-operation with the Irish Government and in consultation with the political parties in Northern Ireland to try to find a way forward which will permit the restoration of the institutions as soon as possible and the implementation of the remaining aspects of the Agreement. Progress continues to be made on the implementation of the Agreement: on 30 March I announced the publication of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland and I expect to

 The re-introduction of direct rule, while necessary to safeguard the institutions from collapse, is no substitute for local political representatives, accountable to the people of Northern Ireland, taking decisions about local issues. On Ministerial complement I am content for the time being with this, but should direct rule continue indefinitely, then I would expect the Prime Minister to decide to increase it.

 The Northern Ireland Office and Northern Ireland Departments fund a number of self-help groups, organisations and agencies which support victims of violence and their families. Some of theses organisations do not, however, exist solely to help victims, and there are other organisations which assist victims but do not receive public funding. I have set out the available information on groups which have received funding over the last five years.
<P>

<a name="00412w13.html_para5">With the exception of the NIO's grant to Victim Support (NI) (those sums marked *), payments made by NIO represent 25 per cent. fully additional funding towards projects which have received 75 per cent. funding from the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (EUSSPPR), which began in 1995, and grants for small pilot schemes paid by the Victims Liaison Unit (those marked **). A total grant of &#163;225,000 is being administered on behalf of the Victims Liaison Unit by the Community Relations Council for which a break down in amounts paid to each group is not available until the scheme ends in July 2000.
<P>

<a name="00412w13.html_para6">Funding made available by DOE and the Department of Social Development has been provided through Making Belfast Work.

 Our funding for cancer research is provided through a number of routes.
<P>

<a name="00412w16.html_para12">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main agency through which the Government support research on the causes and treatment of disease. The MRC receives most of its income via grant in aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The Department funds research to support policy development in health and social care, and to support effective practice in the National Health Service. The Department also provides NHS support funding for research commissioned by the MRC and charities that takes place in the NHS.

<a name="00412w16.html_para13">The approximate annual Government expenditure (Department of Health/NHS, MRC and other Government Departments--principally devolved health Departments) on breast cancer and prostate cancer are &#163;9.33 million and &#163;1.55 million respectively. These figures underestimate the total Government research expenditure in these areas, as detailed estimates of NHS support funding are not currently collected routinely.
<P>

<a name="00412w16.html_para14">Since 1997 the Government have committed an extra &#163;800,000 to new research projects on prostate cancer, through the Medical Research Council and through the Department of Health. The Department has actively sought to support such work in prostate cancer, and has not rejected any high quality proposals for work in this area.
<P>

<a name="00412w16.html_para15">The Department recently announced &#163;1 million additional new funding for this financial year for urgent research studies into prostate cancer as a mark of its concern over this disease.
<P>

<a name="00412w16.html_para16">Following the seminar last year at No. 10 a "Cancer Research Funders' Forum" has been established to help improve the co-ordination of cancer research in the United Kingdom. It is being run by the MRC and includes departmental representatives and the major cancer research charities. At the Department's request, the Forum considered the issue of prostate cancer at its first meeting on 10 January. They agreed to set up an expert group on prostate cancer, which will identify gaps in current research and suggest ways of filling them. The expert group met for the first time on 25 February, and expects to report within months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what studies his Department has made of the differences in the annual cost of treatment using beta interferon between the UK and other countries; and what factors are responsible for these differences.  [118530]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00412w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department has made no studies of the cost of treatment in different countries. As far as the prices of the beta interferon medicines are concerned, the Department has information both from the manufacturers and from contacts in the health authorities of other countries. Direct comparisons of prices of products of this type are misleading because they are often supplied direct to hospitals, making list prices less significant. Furthermore some countries include distribution costs and some aspects of care within the list price while others account for them separately.

<P>

<a name="00412w17.html_para9">Subject to these qualifications, it can be said that in general the annual cost of beta interferons in the United Kingdom is slightly greater than in other European Union countries, reflecting currency movements since the products were introduced.

<a name="00412w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence Technology Appraisal Committee consists of 24 standing members, appointed for three years which combines patient advocates, National Health Service clinicians and mangers, academic experts, and industry representation. However, the standing committee is supported by technology-specific clinical experts brought in for a particular intervention.

 We have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to conduct an authoritative appraisal of beta interferon as part of its first appraisal programme. NICE is expected to report in the summer.
<P>

<a name="00412w17.html_para10">It would be premature to speculate on the number of multiple sclerosis sufferers who will potentially benefit from beta interferon when NICE has not yet come to a view on clinical and cost effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="00412w17.html_para11">Over the past 12 months the Department's records indicate receipt of approximately 1,000 written representations from hon. Members, patient groups and the public expressing concern about the current arrangements for prescribing and funding of beta interferon.
<P>

<a name="00412w17.html_para12">Guidance issued by the Department in 1995, Executive Letter (95)97, recommends that health authorities should have in place arrangements for hospital specialists to initiate treatment in the light of medical evidence and local priorities.

 Funding for oncology drugs is not identified separately within allocations made to health authorities. Improving cancer services is one of the National Health Services top priorities for action, and health authorities and primary care groups will need to take this into account in allocating resources.
<P>

<a name="00412w18.html_para0">We have made clear in a letter to all health authority chief executives that the extra &#163;600 million allocated to the Health Service for 2000-01 will, in part, be used to meet any additional costs arising from implementation of recommendations by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

<a name="00412w18.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The causes of myalgic encephalomyelitis also known as chronic fatigue syndrome are not known. A large number of different disorders have been put forward or implicated in trying to identify its causes. These range from biochemical and immunological disorders and various viruses including the Epstein Barr virus (glandular fever). It seems possible that the syndrome represents a spectrum of illnesses, some of which will have an unidentified physical cause.
<P>

<a name="00412w18.html_para1">The causes of multiple sclerosis are not known. However, there is some evidence to suggest cause may be linked to environmental factors. A 1993 British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine Working Party Report on MS notes that the prevalence of MS is related to geographical latitudes, being higher in the north of Britain than in the South. The best evidence to date reports a prevalence rising from 99 per 100,000 of the population in Southampton to 178 per 100,000 of the population in North East Scotland.

<a name="00412w18.html_para2">There is an international scientific consensus that infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the cause of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he will announce the conclusions of his assessment of the recommendations of the evaluation study by the University of York Health Economics Consortium of the Powered Wheelchair and Voucher Scheme initiatives.  [118792]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00412w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The report of the evaluation conducted by the York Health Economics Consortium reached two major conclusions. First, additional funds were needed if the electrically powered indoor/outdoor wheelchair (EPIOCs) scheme is to meet its objectives fully. Secondly, 



<P>
<P><I>12 Apr 2000 : Column: 215W</I><P>
the voucher scheme had largely met its broad objectives of improving choice but relatively few wheelchair users had benefited from it when the evaluation was conducted. The report recommended that continuation of the voucher scheme should be a matter for local discretion. However, since then the take-up of vouchers has risen steadily.
<P>

<a name="00412w19.html_para1">We have committed ourselves to ending the variations in health care provision across the country. For that reason, we could not agree that voucher schemes should become discretionary. We want all disabled people to be able to exercise choice. We therefore announced on 29 March that the current funding level of &#163;14 million for powered wheelchairs and voucher schemes will be made recurrent from 1 April. We decided that:
<P>

<a name="00412w19.html_para2">

<BR>
(i) continued allocation of &#163;14 million should be free of distinctions between what should be spent on powered wheelchairs or voucher schemes, and that health authorities and provider services should consult with service users and take a flexible approach to ensuring this money meets local needs and priorities in wheelchair services; and:
<BR>
(ii) that all services should continue to operate a voucher scheme which offers users a choice in having a wheelchair which meets their needs.
<BR>


<P>

<a name="00412w19.html_para3">On 29 March we placed the York Health Economics Consortium's report on the National Health Services internet site to ensure service commissioners and providers have access to it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00412w19.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to continue the provision of ring-fenced funds for the EPIOC scheme and the wheelchair voucher scheme on the same basis as in 1996.  [118797]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00412w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Funds were ring-fenced between 1996-2000 to phase in &#163;50 million for the electrically powered indoor/outdoor chairs (EPIOCs) and voucher schemes. Guidance indicated that funding level in the final year, 1999-2000, would become recurrent in National Health Service baseline budgets.
<P>

<a name="00412w19.html_para4">On 29 March I announced plans to allocate to health authorities &#163;14 million for EPIOCs and the wheelchair voucher scheme in 2000-01. This sum is some &#163;6 million greater than that provided in 1996-97. The money will be added recurrently to health authority baselines rather than on a one year at a time basis as in the past, to secure the long-term future of both schemes. Also, health authorities will now be able to use the money flexibly to meet the needs and preferences of local service users, whether that be for EPIOCs, vouchers, or other wheelchair service priorities.

The NFU intend that the mark should only appear on food which meets the requirements of a qualifying farm assurance scheme. We understand that one requirement on the assurance schemes will be that they should have obtained UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation Service) accreditation or have a plan in place to achieve it. UKAS accreditation can only be obtained if all participants are subject to independent verification. Through verification, participants are subject to regular inspection which will ensure that they meet the high standards of food safety, animal welfare and environmental responsibility as well as other conditions of production that are required by the assurance schemes. The NFU intend to explain to consumers these key values which will underpin the mark.

<a name="00412w20.html_para3">The principal aim of the GCDA, which comprises the Government Car Service (GCS) and the Inter Despatch Service (IDS), is to provide secure, reliable, value for money services to its customers. The evaluation of GCDA's performance over its first three years concluded that it has performed well. It has met 14 of 15 key performance targets (including all of its financial and efficiency and productivity targets) set and completed during the period. The evaluation concluded that it had succeeded in meeting its principal aims and objectives, and made a number of recommendations for structural improvements allowing it greater freedom to pursue its commercial objectives. I have placed copies of the executive summary of the evaluation report in the Libraries of the Houses.

<a name="00412w20.html_para4">The review of the standard options (continued agency status, market testing and contracting out, privatisation, abolition) considered each business separately. It concluded that the high security requirements of customers and the unique nature of the services provided by GCS meant that it was not suitable for private sector involvement. It went on to propose a programme of modernisation aimed at improving the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of its services. The review recommended that the IDS should establish and develop, through a Public Private Partnership, a secure, flexible, value for money, nationwide service to complement its existing London and dedicated networks.
<P>

<a name="00412w20.html_para5">I have considered both reports and I have decided that GCDA should continue as an executive agency for a period of five years. It will implement the programme of reform recommended by this review which will build upon its success over the past three years, and enable the Agency to deliver the high quality, value for money services its customers require. A revision to the Framework Document will now be prepared and published.

 During the period 1 January 1999 to 31 March 2000, the Deputy UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator met General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and his officials, during their visit to the United Kingdom in October 1999. In addition to meetings with General McCaffrey, he also sat in on several bilateral meetings between US and UK officials to discuss a wide range of drugs related issues, including Criminal justices intervention issues and drug treatment programmes.

<P>
<a name="00412w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Professor Burchill, who undertook the inquiry has submitted to me a number of recommendations for improving the working of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities' Fire Brigades. These include proposals which would involve the acceptance by the employees and the union of conciliation and arbitration, in the event of disputes, a clarification of procedures, a streamlining of the negotiation arrangements, and an independent Chair for the National Joint Council.
<P>

<a name="00412w22.html_para1">Implementation of these recommendations would be a matter for the National Joint Council rather than for the Government itself. I am, therefore, consulting the employers and the union, and with other interested parties, to confirm that they are willing to accept the proposals and to give them effect. I expect to announce the outcome of these consultations and to publish Professor Burchill's report early next month.
<P>

<a name="00412w22.html_para2">I am extremely grateful to Professor Burchill for the time and effort he has given to the inquiry, the way he has conducted it and the extent of common understanding and agreement he has already been able to achieve.

 I am very aware of the nuisance caused by the activities of kerb crawlers. The Government agree that a specific power of arrest would assist the police in dealing with this problem.

 The Prison Service has accepted that its policies should conform to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The Prison Service has already put in place policies, practices and procedures to prevent discrimination, and to provide auxiliary aids or services to facilitate disabled prisoners' and visitors' access to services. A Working Group has been set up to consider what needs to be done to conform with the requirement of the Act to remove or alter physical barriers to disabled persons' access to services.

<P>
<a name="00412w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service recognises that telephone booking systems can be an effective tool in managing and allocating the huge number of booked visits which prison establishments have to organise on a daily basis. An increasing number of prisons are developing Information Technology systems for this purpose. The Prison Service has completed a study into the use of telephone booking systems for social and official visits to prisoners, the findings of which have informed the production of a statement of business requirements for the introduction of a computerised visits booking system in all prisons.
<P>

<a name="00412w23.html_para2">The Prison Service is working, in partnership with the private sector, to develop the delivery of improved services through the effective use of Information Technology. One of the aims of this project is the provision of efficient, responsive, customer focused public services, and booked visits are included within the scope of the services to be provided. The Prison Service is in the process of developing the timetable for this work.

<a name="00412w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office does not record centrally the number of animals imported into the United Kingdom for use in scientific procedures. However, Table 2 of the "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals", published annually in separate volumes for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, records the number of scientific procedures carried out, analysed by Schedule 2 listed species and source of animals. Animals listed in Schedule 2 to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 can only be acquired from designated breeding or supplying establishments for use in procedures authorised under the Act unless the Secretary of State has granted a specific exemption.

<P>

<a name="00412w23.html_para5">That participation is voluntary so numbers can vary and are often quite high. In order, therefore, to ensure proper security arrangements are in place and access and movement is satisfactory, prisoners in some prisons are asked to make applications to attend religious services.

<P>
<a name="00412w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The decision whether to release adult murderers on life licence is a matter for the Home Secretary, subject to a recommendation for release from the Parole Board. In the year ended 31 December 1999, the Board considered 590 mandatory life sentence cases, about half of which were tariff expired and, therefore, eligible for release. The Board recommended release in 75 of these cases. Sixty-three of these recommendations were accepted, three were rejected, and nine are still under consideration.
<P>

<a name="00412w24.html_para0">Those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure (having been convicted of a murder committed when under the age of 18) are released on the direction of the Parole Board once their tariffs have expired. The Board considered 41 such cases in 1999 and directed release in 15 of them.

 The additional funding announced in the Budget will allow us to provide for completing the recruitment of the 5,000 officers allocated under the Crime Fighting Fund by March 2002. It will allow for the recruitment of at least 2,000 in 2000-01 and 3,000 (or the remainder) in 2001-02.
