<i> [holding answer 10 March 2008]:</i> Night flights at the three London designated airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) are subject to restriction. With some exemptions, a movements and noise quota limit applies during the night quota period (11.30 pm to 6.00 am). The following table sets out the number of movements of aircraft subject to these controls. While there are restrictions on the type of aircraft that can be operated during the shoulder periods (11.00 pm to 11.30 pm and 6 am to 7 am) there are no limits on movements or quota during these periods.</p>

April 2006, central Government provided an extra &#163;350 million in 2006-07 and &#163;367.5 million in 2007-08 for statutory concessionary fares through the revenue support grant.

5. Prior to 2005-06, ONE did not record complaints received. After 2005-06, the agency only recorded complaints received. The complaints procedure is not designed to result in a complaint being 'upheld' or not. The complaints ONE receives are rarely of a nature that enables them to record information in this way as the procedure is actually a mediation process. For example, a complaint may relate to failure of a complainant to secure funding - the resolution in this case would be to discuss feedback with the complainant and point them in the direction of alternative funding sources.<br>

Up until April 2007 our customers aged 50 plus were not required to participate in the mandatory intensive activity period when on new deal 25 plus and so a stock of two year plus has built up. We now mandate all our customers to take part, and they will take up training allowances during any activity periods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="80313w0011.htm_para1"><a name="08031359001416">A quarter of the group are those who have entered employment zones (EZs). Unlike the mandatory JSA new deals, customers participating in employment zones are not required to participate in full time activity and so need not break the JSA claim. EZ customers remain on JSA throughout the programme either until they leave benefit or they return to the standard JSA regime. It is therefore possible that some of the very hardest to help (despite significant intervention) remain unemployed beyond two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="80313w0011.htm_para2"><a name="08031359001417">A smaller group (about 8,000) are those that have been exempted from taking part in new deal and the mandatory option or intensive activity period (this stage would ordinarily take them from JSA on to a training allowance). Customers are exempted at the discretion of an adviser manager for reasons such as being a potentially violent customer, suffering from a serious drink or drug addiction, have a drink or drug addiction which is improving and progress to work provision is underway or those with mental health issues. The number of exclusions on new deal has increased over recent years. Following the work of a Jobcentre Plus led new deal task and finish group in 2007, the number and reason for exclusions is being more closely monitored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="80313w0011.htm_para3"><a name="08031359001418">In regard to all claimants referred to we expect that a proportion of the cases are due to administrative error or a delay in a jobseeker entering provision promptly (for which sanctions can be applied). Jobcentre Plus is continually looking at ways of how we can reduce such error and has made significant in roads to reduce the number of &#145;overstayers&#146; ie those delaying their progress on new deal, down from 17 per cent. in June 2006, to now less than 5 per cent.</p>

 Leaseholders have a wide range of rights and protections that have been developed over the last 40 years. Significant improvements have been made to these rights through the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. The majority of the rights and protections apply equally to leaseholders with social sector landlords as to those with private sector landlords. However, there are some necessary exceptions and variations.</p>

This is one of the many factors that need to be taken into account when considering how best to frame leaseholder rights so that they can effectively deliver the benefits intended to all concerned. This can mean that it will not always be appropriate or helpful to make identical provisions for social sector and private sector leaseholders in order to provide them with similar rights and protections.</p>

The income threshold for full entitlement to the maintenance grant is being increased to &#163;25,000 (compared with &#163;17,910 in 2007-08). The threshold for entitlement to a partial maintenance grant is increasing from &#163;38,330 in 2007-08 to &#163;60,005 for 2008-09. We estimate that the increased thresholds will mean that one-third of all students in England entering higher education in 2008-09 will receive a full non-repayable grant, while another one-third will receive a partial grant.</p>

At these airports the airport operator is required to meet the costs of the agreed police presence.

 Given the participation of the electricity generating sector in the EU emissions trading scheme, new coal power plants will have no impact on net emissions from industries covered by the scheme. This is because these power plants will have to surrender a carbon emission allowance for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, meaning that those carbon allowances will not be available to enable emissions by other EU ETS participants.

 Inquests into deaths in prison custody are inquisitorial fact-finding processes, heard by a Coroner with a jury.

We remain concerned by the total opium cultivation figures, but welcome the UNODC's findings that it expects cultivation to &#147;decrease slightly in 2008&#148;. Poppy cultivation has increased primarily in the south, where insecurity is greatest. Where security, alternative livelihoods and governance exists, poppy cultivation has fallen: in 2007, the number of poppy free provinces doubled from six to 13. This year we hope to see further progress and support the Government of Afghanistan's target of over half of all provinces going poppy free in 2008. The following data is drawn from the UNODC surveys.</p>

 The death of the Secretary-General of the Karen National Union, Pado Mahn Sha, on 14 February, further underlines the need for a comprehensive and equitable settlement of Burma&#146;s ethnic conflicts. The failure of the regime&#146;s roadmap to meet the aspirations of the ethnic groups, including the Karen, for a greater degree of autonomy, is fuelling internal divisions and violence.</p>

 We remain engaged with a wide range of stakeholders and representatives of the ethnic groups in Burma. We are concerned about the situation in Karen State. Attacks carried out by the Burmese army on civilians in northern and western Karen State have been particularly intense over the past two years These have resulted in a significant increase in the number of internally displaced people and refugees on the Thai/Burmese border We have repeatedly called for a halt to such offensives and have urged both the military regime and the Karen National Union to intensify their efforts to find a peaceful settlement that will bring about a permanent end to the conflict. We continue to support Aung San Suu Kyi&#146;s statement of 8 November 2007 calling for a genuine national dialogue between the government, opposition parties and ethnic groups in Burma. We believe that this statement is all the more relevant in light of the regime&#146;s announcement to hold a referendum on the constitution in May 2008 and elections in 2010. If the process is to lead to national reconciliation and stability, it must allow for the full participation of opposition and ethnic groups.</p>

 Our High Commissioner in Abuja discussed the situation in the Niger Delta with President Yar&#146;Adua in January. Following this, and ongoing discussion with Nigerian Government officials in Abuja and London, we are not aware that dialogue between the Nigerian Government and militant groups in the Niger Delta has come to an end. A meeting on the Gulf of Guinea Energy Security Strategy (to include UK and Nigerian Government representatives) is scheduled for later this month and there are still plans for a Niger Delta summit, which would engage the Nigerian Government and communities in the region in structured dialogue.</p>

 It is important that the Nigerian authorities provide a strong lead in finding a solution to the problems of the Niger Delta. However, the UK remains open to discussing ways in which we can add value. The underlying causes of the crisis in the Delta remain poor governance, instability and underdevelopment All of these must be addressed if a sustainable peace is to be realised. The UK has offered its support in all these areas and continues to encourage the Nigerian government to address the situation in the Niger Delta as a priority. The UK supports a number of projects in the Niger Delta, including on community empowerment and government transparency. We continue to urge all parties to engage in peaceful dialogue towards the resolution of the problems of the Niger Delta.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) received reports that a German national was kidnapped approximately 30 km west of Port Harcourt on 4 March 2008. He was taken into creeks in the Niger Delta but was released 12 hours later into State Security Service custody. Three members of his escort team were killed during the abduction attack. Currently 803 British nationals are registered with our high commission in Abuja as residing in the Niger Delta (Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa states), Most of these residents work in the oil industry. Registration with our high commission is voluntary, though the high commission has an ongoing strategy to encourage UK nationals to register.</p>

The methodology used in the answer on 7 February 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1084W, took the average number of non-infantry sub-units serving in an infantry role per deployment and multiplied this by both the number of deployments and the strength of a typical sub unit; this enabled a rough estimate figure to be provided.
