 Part L of the Building Regulations sets levels for energy performance in ways that offer designers the flexibility to choose solutions that best meet their needs, are cost-effective and practical, and enable innovation.

 The Government&#039;s national policies for planning for renewable energy are set out in Planning Policy Statement 22: Renewable Energy (PPS22). PPS22 states that in National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and other nationally designated sites, planning permission for renewable energy projects should only be granted where it can be demonstrated that the objectives of designation of the area will not be compromised by the development, and any significant adverse effect on the qualities for which the area has been designated are clearly outweighed by the environmental, social and economic benefits. Planning authorities should have regard to this guidance when they prepare their criteria-based local development document policies and take it into account when determining planning applications.

 It is impossible to estimate accurately the number of Zimbabweans who have fled from the political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe to neighbouring countries. Very few apply for refugee status. Most try to formalise their stay with work permits, or are prepared to remain as illegal immigrants.

Expenditure on GDS since 1998&#150;99 has been affected by the progressive movement of services into PDS pilots. Charge income from PDS pilots is not separately identified in national health service accounts up to 2004&#150;05, so it is not possible to provide data for net PDS expenditure based on NHS accounts. Based on estimates obtained from Dental Practice Board payments data, we estimate that PDS expenditure in 2004&#150;05 net of patient charge income was around &#163;240 million.

 The budget announcement on 20 December 2004 made provision for the development of the core part of the Northern Ireland Railways network in line with the funding estimates in the Railway Review Group (RRG) report. It also made provision for an element of capital renewal on the lesser-used lines in accordance with option 2 of the RRG report. The lesser-used lines are those between Whitehead and Larne, and between Ballymena and Londonderry (including a spur to Portrush). The option 2 proposal envisages some &#163;17 million investment on the lesser-used lines over a five-year period and is designed to ensure the maintenance of services at current levels. While this approach effectively secures the delivery of rail services on the lesser-used lines during that five-year period, it makes no provision for any significant improvement to the rail services offered on those lines during that period. It is inevitable that there will be some degree of betterment arising from works to improve parts of the track or to enhance railway stations, but there are no plans to enter into any further funding commitments until it has been possible to review the impact of recent investment in the railways. This cannot be undertaken before 2007.

 The detrunking programme announced in &quot;A New Deal for Transport in England&quot; (1998) (Cm 3950) started in 2001&#150;02. In recognition of the extra costs that would be incurred by local highway authorities taking over responsibility for detrunked routes, the Government gave a commitment to ensuring that detrunking would be accompanied by a fair transfer of resources. It was agreed with the Local Government Association (LGA) that the most effective way of ensuring that authorities were provided with resources for the routine maintenance of detrunked routes would be by means of an annual special grant. This was intended to be a transitional distribution method, and it remains the Government&#039;s policy that detrunked roads will, in due course, be incorporated into the Revenue Support Grant system. Capital support has been through the issue of SCAs (Supplementary Credit Approvals) to 2003&#150;04 and from 2004&#150;05 SCERs (Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue)).

Notes:<br>

1. The figures in the table relate to people registered with local authorities under the National Assistance Act. For the purposes of this Act, disabled people are defined as &quot;persons who are blind, deaf, or dumb, or who suffer from mental disorder of any description, and other persons aged 18 or over who are substantially and permanently handicapped by illness, injury, or congenital deformity&quot;. This definition is separate from that used for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act.<br>

2. The implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 repealed various sections of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, including sections related to the register of disabled persons.<br>
