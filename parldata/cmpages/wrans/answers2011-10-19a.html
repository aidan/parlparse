The Bolivian Government have announced that it will reapply to the convention in January 2012, with a reserve on the articles relating to the prohibition of coca leaf.

<sup>(2)</sup> The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

               <b>Mr Gauke</b>
               <i>[holding answer 12 October 2011]:</i> The cost of calling HMRC is dependent on several factors. Calls are charged to the customer based on the tariff arrangements they have with their service provider, the device they use for the call and the location from which they call.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_314">

               <a name="11101956000533"> However, HMRC recognise that the cost of calling its 0845 numbers can be an issue for some customers—particularly those using pay-as-you-go mobile phones. It has therefore been actively reviewing its numbering strategy to see if it can find ways of reducing the costs involved while striking the right balance between costs to the caller and costs to the public purse.</p>

               <a name="stpa_315">

               <a name="11101956000534"> I can confirm that as part of the process of agreeing its next telephony contract-which is due to take effect by June 2013—HMRC will continue to investigate alternatives to 0845 numbers. As a first and immediate step, HMRC expect that they will, by the end of the year be able to offer an 0345 number for those customers calling its tax credit helpline (which last year accounted for around 40% of the total calls handled by its contact centre network).</p>

To narrow the GCSE attainment gap between boys and girls, we need intervene early to make sure that boys can read well. By ensuring high quality synthetic phonics teaching, we will improve literacy levels for all pupils, helping them to develop a love of reading and giving them a solid base on which to build their future education.</p>

 The Government are currently running two public consultations related to public data, on 'Making Open Data Real: A Public Consultation' and 'Data Policy for a Public Data Corporation', which close on 27 October 2011. As part of the Growth Review the Government are looking at the possible benefits of releasing more data as 'open data' to stimulate growth. One of the aims of a Public Data Corporation is to provide a more consistent approach towards access to and accessibility of public sector information from certain organisations, balancing the desire for more data free at the point of use while ensuring affordability and value for taxpayers. Responses to the consultations will support internal analysis of these issue, which will enable Government to reflect on an appropriate policy framework for a Public Data Corporation.</p>

 In respect of his question on the biodiesel duty differential, I refer the hon. Member to the answers given to the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on 5 July 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1173W. We have recently consulted on proposals to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) to implement the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The RED contains a target for the UK to source 15% of its overall energy, and 10% of energy used in transport from renewable sources by 2020.</p>

We have not made an assessment of how this might affect our longer-term 2020 renewable energy targets, as any impact is likely to be short-term. The consultation document referred to above explains how we have proposed to support biofuels which meet mandatory sustainability criteria via the RTFO.</p>

These included suggestions that the RTFO should distinguish between bioethanol and biodiesel, arguing that if it did, this might provide a mechanism to drive equal demand for both products.

It is now time to move beyond the politics of the peace process and to work towards building a more prosperous Northern Ireland in which everyone has a genuinely shared future.</p>

Where possible, we choose counsel from a set of panels filled by competition by the Attorney-General's Office. These four panels reflect levels of experience and location. Those counsel who undertake to join the panels are paid fees according to set hourly rates appropriate to their panel. The rates are set out in the following table:</p>

The MOD also instructs a panel of external law firms to provide commercial legal services in support of private finance initiatives and major Defence projects. Since January 2010, this panel consists of the following private firms: Denton Wilde Sapte, Shepherd and Wedderburn, Mills and Reeve, Pinsent Masons, Wragge and Co., Simmons and Simmons and Field Fisher Waterhouse. The MOD has in place framework agreements with each of these firms with rates which were agreed during the competitive selection process. Expenditure on the panel for 2010-11 is currently being collated.</p>

From 1 September 2011, Morton Fraser LLP retained this contract following the competitive tender being found to provide best value to the MOD. I am withholding details of current rates charged, as their disclosure would prejudice commercial interests. I am however able to disclose that the fees paid in the last year of the former contract were £799,454, a lower figure than that incurred in each of the preceding two years.</p>

1. All numbers rounded to the nearest 10, numbers ending in five have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias.
2. Full-time and part-time data split are not available for locally engaged civilians and Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel, but they are deemed to be full-time for reporting purposes.
3. Headcount data have been used to ensure there is no statistical bias in presentation of full-time and part-time split in relation to full time equivalent value of part-time personnel.
4. April 2011 locally engaged civilian figures are ‘estimates’ due to non- availability of data.

 The Government recognises the importance that education and skills can play in helping people find work. Jobseekers may undertake up to two weeks of full-time training in any 12-month period, with the agreement of their Jobcentre Plus adviser, without jeopardising their benefit entitlements. Jobseekers who have been on jobseeker's allowance for more than six months are able to access training for up to 30-hours per week for up to eight weeks, subject to the agreement of their adviser, and still remain on jobseeker's allowance. Jobseekers can also undertake part-time education or training at any point in their claim and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance as long as they continue to meet the basic conditions of entitlement.</p>

Nine of the fifteen members of the UNSC voted in favour of this Resolution, but Russia and China regrettably chose to block it.

1. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected Is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 All EU member states are parties to the European convention on human rights and are required under that instrument to provide those charged with a criminal offence the right to a fair trial and to respect the fundamental rights of litigants in civil proceedings. The action that the Ministry of Justice can take bilaterally in respect of the domestic legal systems of other member states is limited; however bilateral meetings are sometimes held to raise particular issues in appropriate circumstances. Consular staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can offer assistance to British nationals who are detained in other EU member states. While they cannot give legal advice, they can give basic information about the local legal system and provide a list of local lawyers. If appropriate they will consider approaching the local authorities if a British national who has been arrested in another country is not being treated in line with internationally-accepted standards of justice.</p>

The UK opted in to the first two measures on the Roadmap, but has not opted in at the initial stage of the negotiations to the latest directive: on access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest. The Government believe that access to a lawyer is an essential right of accused persons at appropriate stages of any process of criminal investigations. However, we are of the view that the Commission's proposal is not proportionate and could have an adverse effect on our ability to investigate and prosecute offences effectively. The Government are participating in the negotiations and if our concerns are satisfactorily addressed, we will consider applying to opt in once the instrument has been adopted.</p>

 Feed in Tariffs (FITs) are funded through consumers' energy bills rather than through general taxation. DECC estimates that FITs will lead to an average annual increase in energy bills for households that do not take up FITs of £8.50 over the 2011-30 period. This estimate is subject to change as a result of the ongoing comprehensive review of feed in tariffs; the review will seek to maximise money and cost-effectiveness in the scheme.</p>

 In “Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer”, published on 12 January 2011, we have committed over £450 million over the next four years to support earlier diagnosis of cancer. This money will be used to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer; fund increased general practitioner (GP) access to diagnostic tests; and pay for more testing and treatment in secondary care. One of the tests we are increasing access to is non-obstetric ultrasound to support the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. We are working on a guide to help GPs with the relevant criteria for requesting non-obstetric ultrasounds.</p>

Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including an ovarian cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis, such as symptom awareness, and to discuss potential solutions. This will inform our future work in this area.</p>

 In his interim report, the right hon. the Lord Hutton of Furness, recommended increasing employee contributions as the cost of public service pensions had increased by a third due to improving longevity and this additional cost had fallen primarily on taxpayers. The Government accepted Lord Hutton's rationale and, at the spending review, announced the intention to implement progressive increases to employee contribution rates in public sector pension schemes, equivalent to 3.2% on average to be phased in from April 2012.</p>

 Information on planning applications within the green belt submitted to district level local authorities is not available centrally. Statistics published by the Department do show, however, that between 2% and 3% of new dwellings were built in the green belt each year between 2001 and 2010. I would add that the last Government's top-down regional strategies sought to remove green belt protection in 30 towns and cities across the country.</p>
