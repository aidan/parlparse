 Under new admissions arrangements which are being introduced from September 1999 as part of our Pre-School Education Expansion Programme, my Department has encouraged schools to continue the traditional practice of allocating nursery places for children with special needs, including disability, in each session within their approved pre-school enrolment number. In addition, children with Statements of Special Educational Needs can be admitted to nursery schools and classes over and above the school's pre-school enrolment number, based on the advice of Education and Library Boards.

<P>
<a name="90423w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Between April 1998 and March 1999, the Government allocated &#163;1.5 million to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for emergency relief in Kosovo and the region. In recent weeks, we have focused on providing practical assistance to UNHCR to strengthen its in-country capacity and facilitate the movement of relief supplies into the region. Since 30 March, we have provided UNHCR with 22 airlifts to Skopje and Tirana for relief goods and personnel, and a convoy of five trucks and drivers has arrived in Tirana to support their relief operations in Albania. At UNHCR's request, we have sent specialist personnel and equipment to Tirana airport to help handle the relief flights, and we are providing a similar package for Skopje. We have also offered to provide public information and security specialists to support UNHCR's operations in the region.

<P>
<a name="90423w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our policy is to support the procurement of local goods and services where this is possible, cost effective, and when it would not harm the local economy or reduce access of the local host population to essential supplies. Detailed information about food purchases by international agencies in Macedonia is not currently available.

<P>
<UL>(2) what is his estimate of the value of salmon angling to the economy of Scotland in each of the last 10 years; and of this how much in each year represents spending by visitors from outside Scotland.  [81221]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Information on the amount spent by visiting anglers is not held centrally. However, a survey published in 1991 by Portsmouth Polytechnic's Centre for Marine Resource Economics estimated that the net economic value of rod fisheries in Scotland lay within the range of &#163;198 million to &#163;300 million, with a best estimate of &#163;225 million. The "Scottish Salmon Strategy Task Force" report, published in 1997, uprated these 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 1999 : Column: 702</I><P>
figures to produce an estimate for 1995 values of a range from &#163;270 million to &#163;430 million, with a best estimate of &#163;350 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is his estimate of the number of <i>(a)</i> salmon and grilse and <i>(b)</i> sea trout eaten per seal in Scottish waters in each of the last 10 years.  [81218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Recent studies in the rivers Dee and Don suggest that common seals may eat several hundred salmonids per annum. However, extrapolation from these observations to calculate consumption per seal over the last 10 years is difficult as consumption rates and composition are likely to have changed.
<P>

<a name="90423w01.htm_para5">Studies on the impact of seals on salmonid stocks are ongoing in the rivers Tay and Conon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is his estimate of the minimum number of <i>(a)</i> grey seals and <i>(b)</i> common seals required to maintain a viable population in Scottish waters.  [81216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The minimum number required to maintain a viable population will vary according to a range of factors. Advice in 1998 from the Natural Environment Council's Special Committee on seals indicated that there is evidence that the rate of increase in pup production in some grey seal colonies has been slowing down, although it is too early to predict equilibrium sizes. Common seal populations have recovered from the viral outbreak in the 80s which reduced numbers dramatically, but are nevertheless more dependent upon changes in local prey abundance than grey seals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The regulatory control of the release and marketing of GMOs is governed throughout the EC by Directive 90/220/EEC. This has been transposed into UK law through Part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, as amended 1995 and 1997. All Member States are required to implement the Directive fully.
<P>

<a name="90423w02.htm_para0">The Committee of Competent Authorities for the Directive meets regularly to exchange information on implementation with a view to securing even application of the Directive throughout the EC. Therefore the regulatory systems in all EU member states should operate to similar standards.
<P>

<a name="90423w02.htm_para1">All consents for GMO releases for the purposes of research, such as field trials, are issued at national level. For any field trial to be carried out in the UK, a consent must be issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="90423w02.htm_para2">The commercial growing and distribution of GM produce require specific consents to be issued at the Community level under Directive 90/220/EEC. All Member States participate and can raise objections in this decision-making process. Once an approval has been issued, it may be used throughout the Community, provided any specific conditions on use or on types of environment and geographical areas for release are complied with.

<P>

<a name="90423w02.htm_para3">To date, only one application to place GMOs on the market has been given approval where the UK authority objected. The case, under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC, concerned a genetically modified maize modified for insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. The UK had no objection to the marketing of this product for seed production but voted against its unrestricted use as proposed by the Commission. Full details are contained in the table referred to in my reply to my hon. Friend given today.

 We are not required to give any notice of such shipments. To date, there have been no shipments by sea from the UK of High Level Waste. However, in the case of shipments by sea of High Level Waste from France to Japan undertaken by BNFL as transport operator, it has been our practice since 1996 routinely to inform coastal states, both on and off route, in advance and on a confidential basis. We intend to continue with this practice in the case of the forthcoming sea shipment of MOX fuel from Sellafield, consistent with our international obligations to protect information about the movement of sensitive nuclear materials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w04.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will change the Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance rules which apply when someone is admitted to hospital.  [82306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90423w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We propose to change the rules for Attendance Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) so that the day of admission to hospital is treated as a day out of hospital, in place of the existing rules which treat such a day as a day in hospital. This will mean that people who spend frequent spells in hospital, 



<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 1999 : Column: 710</I><P>
eg for respite care, can gain an extra day's benefit. It will mean that the rules for AA/DLA will be brought into line with other Social Security benefits.
<P>

<a name="90423w04.htm_para0">Regulations governing the withdrawal and downrating of benefits on admission to hospital have existed since the beginning of the National Insurance scheme in 1948. The reduction in benefit reflects the fact that, in hospital, the National Health Service is providing free care and maintenance. Regulations currently do not define what is a day in, or a day out of hospital. This leads to uncertainty. Social Security Commissioners have taken varying positions over the years. This has resulted in differing rules being developed according to the type of benefit in payment, creating difficulties for both customers and staff.
<P>

<a name="90423w04.htm_para1">A Commissioner's decision made in 1996, which affected only AA and DLA, directed that both days of admission to, and days of discharge from hospital, should be treated as days in hospital. This means that benefit can now be lost on both the days of admission and discharge. For other Social Security benefits the current policy and practice is that the day of admission is treated as a day out of hospital and the day of discharge as a day in hospital.
<P>

<a name="90423w04.htm_para2">We have concluded that the best way forward, to avoid further inconsistencies and confusion, would be to align the AA and DLA rules on hospital admission with the rules for other Social Security benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, we will make it explicit within the legislation that the day of admission is a day out of hospital and the day of discharge a day in hospital. Regulations will be laid at the earliest opportunity.

 The primary aim of the Government is to care for refugees in the region, and to facilitate their return to Kosovo. We are working together with our European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation partners and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
<P>

<a name="90423w04.htm_para4">We have long made it clear that we stand ready to respond to requests from UNHCR to take vulnerable refugees from Kosovo on a temporary basis. We have agreed with UNHCR that any recommendations for evacuation from the region should be co-ordinated through the office of the UNHCR. UNHCR will assess the desirability of temporary protection in the United Kingdom, will give priority to medical cases, other vulnerable persons and in support of family unity and make recommendations to the Home Office for consideration.

<a name="90423w04.htm_para5">I announced on 20 April that arrangements had been agreed for the admission of 120 evacuees, mainly women and children, expected in the next few days.

 On 1 April, the Home Office wrote at official level to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) requesting that ACPO write to each Chief Constable in England and Wales to ask them to set up voluntary, internal registers for their forces. ACPO duly wrote to each Chief Constable on 7 April. It is too early to say how many Chief Constables will set up such registers. However, an earlier ACPO survey of Chief Constables' views indicated that the overwhelming majority of Chief Constables supported in principle their creation.

 As soon as the voluntary internal registers which all Chief Constables in England and Wales have been asked by the Association of Chief Police Officers to put in place have been established, we will be able to make available for statistical purposes such numerical data as these registers reveal, on an ongoing basis.

<a name="90423w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to change the proportion of elected representatives on police authorities. The elected representatives (councillor members appointed by local councils) have a majority of one over the combined total of magistrate members and independent members. I am satisfied that these non-elected members have skills and experience which are of benefit to police authorities. Police authorities have been established in their present form only since 1995, and some of them have had to re-form themselves as a result of local government reorganisation. I do not think it would be helpful to subject them to further change at this time.

<a name="90423w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 To date, we have received 25 letters from parents in Havering not offered their preferred secondary school place for September 1999. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could intervene only in an admissions issue where he is satisfied that a local education authority or governing body has acted unlawfully or "unreasonably", that is, in a way which no sensible authority or governing body would have acted. Our investigation of these complaints found no grounds for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's intervention.

<P>

<a name="90423w05.htm_para0">Section 89 of the 1998 Act and its accompanying regulations place a new requirement on all admission authorities in an area to determine their admission arrangements in consultation with each other, taking account of local circumstances. Where an admission authority disagrees with another's proposed admission arrangements, it can object to the Adjudicator. We believe that school admissions arrangements are best determined at local level. Havering local education authority is responsible for consulting on and determining the arrangements for all county schools. The 1998 Act also requires my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice on admissions. The School Admission Code of Practice, which came into force on 1 April 1999, offers guidance on all aspects of the school admissions process, including consultation.
<P>

<a name="90423w05.htm_para1">Under the 1998 Act and the Code, it is for admission authorities to decide on their admission arrangements--including whether to operate catchment areas and what those areas should be--subject to consultation, and to the results of any complaint to the Adjudicator.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked for details, by case, of the experiments, involving goats that have been carried out in each of the last 12 months. All the work is aimed at reducing the risk of serious decompression illness in man following the evacuation of a sunken submarine. Prior to being used in an experiment, goats are familiarised with the experimental procedures and the vessels in which trials will take place. All experiments involve an exposure to raised pressure where the breathing gas is either air or an atmosphere that simulates a possible atmosphere that could be present on a disabled submarine, such as elevated carbon dioxide.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the end of the exposure to raised pressure the goats are returned to normorbaric pressure, either through decompression to surface, simulating rescue from a distressed submarine (rescue type exposure), or through a simulated submarine escape at the compression and decompression rates to which men have been exposed (escape type exposure). Oxygen breathing is known to decrease the risk of decompression illness and limited oxygen breathing has been used in some initial studies to assess the magnitude of the potential benefit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The goats are closely monitored for several hours after the experiment for signs of decompression illness. Concentration of various blood constituents may be monitored. A small number of animals have had minor surgery to reduce the trauma or stress involved in collecting an arterial blood sample. In addition the animals may be sedated to further reduce their discomfort. Some goats have also been sedated prior to magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in order to detect sub-clinical effects of repeat pressure exposures.</FONT></UL>
