To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the system of drug and alcohol testing in relation to persons in charge of an aeroplane; and if he will make a statement.  [96900]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is at present no statutory system of drug and alcohol testing for flight crew.
<P>

<a name="30211w01.html_para0">It is an offence under the Air Navigation Order 2000 for flight crew to carry out their duties while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As part of the process for obtaining an Air Operator Certificate from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), airlines are required to establish policies on alcohol and drugs to ensure compliance with this provision. The detailed implementation of such policies is a matter for the airlines but may include testing programmes. In addition, the Air Navigation Order requires pilots to hold a valid medical certificate issued by a person approved by the CAA. Pilots undergo regular medical examinations, which will pay attention to any evidence of excess alcohol intake or substance abuse. There is currently no evidence of a widespread drink or drug problem in the aviation sector.
<P>

<a name="30211w01.html_para1">The Railways and Transport Safety Bill currently before Parliament includes provisions setting a blood/alcohol limit for flight crew and other specified aviation personnel and will give the police power to test suspected offenders.

 Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are subject to economic regulation by the Civil Aviation Authority which has sole responsibility for setting their airport price caps. The CAA's decision will determine BAA's ability to cross-subsidise between airports.

 My Department allocates capital funding for integrated transport to the west Yorkshire passenger transport authority (WYPTA) and the five west Yorkshire local authorities in the annual local transport capital expenditure settlement each December, following bids made to central Government through the five-year joint west Yorkshire local transport plan (LTP) the previous July. We also make revenue funding available through the standard spending assessment system. It is then up to WYPTA and the five West Yorkshire local authorities, including Leeds city council, how this funding is distributed and prioritised.
<P>

<a name="30211w01.html_para2">For the 2003&#150;04 financial year, WYPTA and the five local authorities have been awarded &#163;25.8 million for integrated transport. Indicative allocations for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 are &#163;26 million and &#163;27.5 million respectively. The 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 financial years will be covered by the second joint west Yorkshire LTP, which runs from 2006 to 2011, and no indicative allocations are yet available.
<P>

<a name="30211w01.html_para3">In addition, and subject to completion of the statutory processes, &#163;20.9 million has been set aside for improvements to bus services on the A65 Kirkstall road corridor. These improvements include the construction of bus lanes and new bus stops and shelters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 DVLA issued some 36.9 million vehicle excise licence reminders in 2001&#150;02. They are despatched in envelopes bearing a specific message asking for them not to be returned to DVLA if undeliverable. If the addressee has moved, DVLA will normally pick up the new address as soon as the vehicle is relicenced, or a statutory off-road declaration made.

 The Government are committed to encouraging the introduction and wider use of clean, low carbon vehicle technologies as set out in "the Powering Future Vehicles Strategy", published in July last year. Compared to conventional diesel vehicles, natural gas vehicles can offer useful air quality, noise and&#151;in some cases&#151;carbon benefits.
<P>

<a name="30211w01.html_para9">The Government are encouraging the wider use of both compressed and liquefied natural gas vehicles primarily through favourable fuel duty incentives and grants towards the cost of procuring natural gas vehicles and supporting the development of refuelling infrastructure through the Department's PowerShift programme.

 The European Investment Bank is one of many lenders involved in the tube modernisation plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the reason was for the re-branding of TransportAction as TransportEnergy; and what the total cost was to the Energy Savings Trust broken down into <i>(a)</i> consultancy fees, <i>(b)</i> publicity, <i>(c)</i> reprinting of stationery and <i>(d)</i> other material costs.  [96438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In September 2002 the Energy Saving Trust re-branded TransportAction as TransportEnergy as part of a wider exercise to rationalise all of the trust's environmental initiatives, enabling them to deliver their messages with improved effectiveness and cost-efficiency. The term TransportEnergy better reflects the trust's goal of supporting a move to a less energy intensive transport system and is more consistent with the trust's domestic energy efficiency programmes.
<P>

<a name="30211w02.html_para4">No Government funding was used in the re-branding exercise. All re-branding costs were met through the Energy Saving Trust's corporate funds.

<a name="30211w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide a breakdown of staff specifically for Harrow but the DVLA local office at Stanmore covers most of north London including Harrow. 29 staff at that office work on the enforcement of vehicle excise duty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Regulations were amended in April 2002 to reduce the period impounded vehicles have to be kept before they can be disposed of from 35 days to seven or 14 days. The deciding factor is the value of the vehicle. The majority of impounded unlicensed vehicles are now disposed of within 14 days.
<P>

<a name="30211w02.html_para6">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has increased the number of wheelclamping teams operating in London from two to four.

 DVLA plans to extend partnership working with local authorities to clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles following a successful trial scheme in the London Borough of Newham. Teams working for the boroughs of Wandsworth, Croydon and Lewisham, and Hastings and Southend-on-Sea councils have been trained by DVLA and now, together with Newham, clamp and impound untaxed cars in their areas. These teams complement the existing national contract for wheelclamping untaxed cars.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w03.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The number of personnel accommodated at Wellington Barracks who have cars is assessed to be around 300. On this basis the estimated annual cost of the reimbursement of the Congestion Charge and the Registration Fee is approximately &#163;42,000. Since most are basic rate tax payers this figure would attract Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions of some &#163;15,000, paid centrally by the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The figures from 1990&#150;91 to 2001&#150;02 are for outturn expenditure. From 2002&#150;03, outturn expenditure is not yet available. These figures are therefore spending plans for the period. In year additions, such as the net additional cost of operations, are excluded from spending plans. Spending plans are therefore lower than actual outturn expenditure.
<P>

<a name="30211w03.html_para2">Total defence expenditure figures are published annually by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) in UK Defence Statistics, and prior to 1992, were reported in Volume 2 of the Statement on the Defence Estimates. Spending plans for 2003&#150;06 are reported in the Defence Investment Strategy 2002.

Further stocks are held in reserve and more will be ordered. The canisters were originally designed with a 10-year shelf life. Extensive testing (carried out in 1998) enabled us to extend the life to 15 years. Our oldest stocks were manufactured in 1991 and will not therefore expire until 2006. No soldier will commence operations with time-expired canisters.

 Primary health care records for the 53,000 or so veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict are held by their doctors and are not accessible centrally for reasons of patient confidentiality. However, the Ministry of Defence maintains some databases that contain health-related information about Gulf veterans. For example, separate databases exist to support pensions casework; processing potential claims for common law compensation and for recording information about patients who have attended the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme. In addition, data are held on cancer registrations and other cancer information. We have no plans to set up a central

<P>
<a name="30211w04.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no centralised system for monitoring and recording the health status of Service and ex-Service personnel. Given the significance attached by veterans to cancer, at MOD's request researchers at the University of Manchester are carrying out a study of the incidence of cancers in Gulf veterans. The study is using data provided by the Office for National Statistics' NHS Central Register (NHSCR) on cancer registrations in England and Wales. The study is due to complete in spring 2003. It is expected that the results will then be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal.

No cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia were seen. MOD does maintain central records of mortality data for Gulf veterans and a comparison group, known as the Era cohort. The most recent data were published on 27 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 27&#150;29WS. This included four deaths from Motor Neurone Disease among Gulf veterans and three among the Era cohort. We are not aware of any further cases.

 As part of the current licence conditions Cornwall Environmental Services monitor quantitative dust levels (PM10 ) emitting from the United Mines site. This information is audited by the Environment Agency and confirmed through weekly site visits to ensure compliance and placed on the Public Register. In response to concerns from local residents, a limited number of samples were taken by the Environment Agency from stockpiles of naturally occurring subsoil at the landfill and from dried mud deposits along the highway adjacent to the site. Results of analysis of the samples showed arsenic in the 200 to 400 milligrams per kilogram range, which is comparable with levels to be found in mineworking areas.
<P>

<a name="30211w06.html_para0">This information and results of samples from adjacent sites is available on the Public Register (please contact Bodmin Area Customer Services on 01208 78301).

<a name="30211w06.html_para1">In addition, Carrick District Council commissioned short-term ambient air monitoring at a site close to United Mines in May and June 2001. Particulate matter (PM10 ) was sampled over a number of days. Concentrations of PM10 at the monitoring site were influenced by the operations at the United Mines site but did not exceed Air Quality Strategy objective limits during the time of sampling. Arsenic was not analysed in the sampled particulate matter. Copies of the monitoring report are available from Carrick District Council.

 Imports into the United Kingdom of animal products are governed by European Community legislation, which contains provisions to protect both animal and public health. Under these rules only third countries approved by the Commission on the advice of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health may export into the Community, and only from establishments which meet Community hygiene standards. The lists of countries and establishments allowed to export particular products into the Community which includes Brazil is available on the Commission's website at the following address: http://forum.europa.eu.int/irc/sanco/vets/info/data/listes/tableO.html.

<a name="30211w06.html_para5">Recently, unauthorised veterinary medicines namely nitrofurans were found in poultry meat from Brazil. Nitrofurans are not permitted in the EU for use in food producing animals, due to public health concerns. Therefore their residues should not be present in food.

If nitrofuran residues are detected, the consignment is destroyed.

 The EU Air Quality Framework Directive (1996/62/EC) and subsequent daughter directives set limit values for various atmospheric pollutants in ambient air. The First (1999/30/EC) and Second Daughter Directives (2000/69/EC) are transposed into UK law. Limit values for sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, lead and carbon monoxide must be met by 1 January 2005. Limit values for benzene, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen must be met by 1 January 2010. The Third Daughter Directive (2002/3/EC), which sets target values for ozone, will be transposed later this year.
<P>

<a name="30211w06.html_para8">We expect the limit values to be met in a majority of locations within the allotted time scale through existing national measures already in place or planned to come into effect.

 Applications to operate incinerators to dispose of specified risk material are made at local level. The details requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w07.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The flood and coastal defence operating authorities work under permissive powers meaning that they are under no obligation to undertake such works. In default of action being taken by these authorities, riparian owners are therefore responsible for taking what action they consider necessary (subject in certain cases to the consent of the relevant operating authority) to protect their own properties. I am not, however, persuaded that obligations should be placed on riparian owners in these circumstances.

currently operate on the basis of permissive powers, which allows the Environment Agency and other operating authorities to take action where it is considered justifiable against a range of criteria.

Local authorities have been able to use the program to test innovative techniques for improving service delivery and communicating with customers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I wrote to Green Ministers in May 2002 enclosing a model specification clause that will help central departments draft their contracts for procuring timber and timber products. The model specification clause was also included in an Information Note that the Treasury's Office of Government Commerce issued in November to remind Departments of the Government's policy on the procurement of timber. It has provided both buyers and suppliers with some clarification of the Government's requirements for timber.
<P>

<a name="30211w08.html_para0">The current guidance does need improving. The Government intends tightening up the definition of acceptable standards for legal timber and forest management and will do more to determine how suppliers' claims for compliance can be assessed efficiently and effectively. The Government is in the process of tendering to set up a central point of expertise on timber to address these issues and other related matters. I cannot be precise about when the centre of expertise will be ready to issue improved guidance but as an indication I would expect it to be later this year.

<a name="30211w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste will apply from 28 December 2005 to incinerators existing before 28 December 2002. The directive's limits for pollutants cover emissions both to air and to water and will be relatively complex in their application, depending in part on the nature of the incinerator. A UK assessment carried out during the negotiation of the directive indicated that there was already a high level of compliance with the limits. In particular, the 11 municipal waste incinerators in England all now already comply with the directive's limit of 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  for dioxins emissions.

 The FSA tell me that as at 27 January 2003, 76 per cent. of Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs) (whose Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) expired between 1 September and 30 November 2002) have told the FSA that they have obtained cover.
<P>

<a name="30211w09.html_para0">An analysis of the information they provided shows that 88 per cent. of IFAs due to renew their cover in September have done so. The figure for October is 85 per cent. and November 66 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30211w09.html_para1">This does not necessarily mean that the other IFAs have not got cover. The FSA tell me that IFAs are reluctant to confirm that they have cover until they have received a cover note even though they may have agreed terms with their broker.

<a name="30211w09.html_para3">The FSA are monitoring the market and expect that that more capacity will be introduced soon. This should increase competition and drive down the price of cover.

The technical note for this PSA, published on DWP and HMT websites, provides details. Low-income households are defined as those with less than 60 per cent. of contemporary median income. Progress is being measured on both a before housing costs and an after housing costs basis.
<P>

<a name="30211w09.html_para5">Low income is of course central to poverty. But poverty is a complex, multi-dimensional issue, affecting many other aspects of children's lives, including health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. In April 2002 the Government launched a consultation exercise to decide the best way to measure poverty in the long term, to help target policies and enable the Government to be held to account over its long-term targets. Results will be published by spring 2003.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30211w09.html_para6">We believe that the current voluntarist approach for occupational and personal pensions is the right way forward considering the UK's pension system. The UK has a long tradition of voluntary partnership between individuals, employers, financial services industry and the Government. The continued success of this partnership depends on all partners playing their part. Our Green Paper, "Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement" (Cm5677), contained proposals to allow employers to make membership of their scheme a condition of employment for all new employees. The Green Paper also announced the setting up of an independent pensions commission, which will be chaired by Adair Turner, to monitor and assess trends in occupational and private pensions and long-term saving. On the basis of this assessment we will decide whether there is a case for moving beyond the current voluntarist approach.

 The Government's strategy for tackling child poverty-for all children-is set out in the 2001 Pre-Budget Report document "Tackling child poverty: giving every child the best possible start in life". This includes measures to guarantee a decent family income for families with disabled children, and initiatives to ensure these families have access to high-quality public services.

<a name="30211w09.html_para7">In recognition of the fact that families with disabled children need extra help, in April 2002 the disabled child premium was increased by &#163;5 a week on top of the normal uprating, to &#163;35.50. In April 2003, it will rise again by &#163;5 above inflation, to more than &#163;40 a week on top of basic Income Support or tax credits, benefiting around 80,000 children. In addition, the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance was extended to three and four-year-olds in April 2002, providing an extra &#163;39.30 a week to those families.
<P>

<a name="30211w09.html_para8">The Government has also introduced a number of measures to improve the level of public service support available to families with disabled children.

Quality Protects, a five year initiative to improve services and outcomes for children in need, also takes forward projects to support disabled children and their families. And on its introduction by the end of this year the Children's National Service Framework will set general principles and standards for children's services, including services for children with disabilities and special needs.

This is reflected in paragraph 7.51 of the 2002 pre- Budget report. The Government are developing a comprehensive package of policies, in response to those recommended in the recent Cabinet Office Strategy Unit report, to ensure that the targets set by the landfill directive are met. This will include the system of tradable landfill allowances provided for by the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill and the reforms of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme as well as the proposed increases in the landfill tax.

<P>
<a name="30211w10.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The 2002 Pre-Budget forecast of revenue from duty on transactions in shares, and hence the direct yield cost of abolition, is &#163;2.2 billion in 2003&#150;04. This estimate makes no allowance for the effect on other taxes arising from the wider impact abolition may have on the economy.
<P>

<a name="30211w10.html_para2">We have been presented with various estimates of the impact on the economy, but in practice there is no convincing evidence that stamp duty on shares significantly affects either UK companies or the UK markets. As with all taxes, stamp duty on shares has to be understood in the context of the revenue raised, which would have to be found elsewhere if the tax were abolished.

 In November 2000 we secured a commitment by the European Commission that poverty reduction should be the central objective of the EC's programmes in developing countries. We also worked with others to put in place a reform package which is designed to simplify the commission's aid instruments, reduce the number of budget lines and work through country strategies aligned to partner country poverty reduction strategy plans. The commission spent 43 per cent. of its overseas development assistance in 2001 in low income countries. This is a poor allocation of aid in terms of poverty reduction effectiveness. We are working to try to help ensure that aid is spent more effectively, mainly by trying to influence the annual budget setting process, where increasing the proportion of assistance to Asia, and to key international initiatives like the Global Health Fund are priorities.

 The figures below list the total spending on space programmes for the financial years 1990&#150;91 to 2004&#150;05 by the DTI and the Office of Science and Technology, which funds the space activities of the Natural Environment Research Council and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (and funded the latter's predecessor, the Science and Engineering Research Council, until 1993). The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry assumed responsibility for the Office of Science and Technology in 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the financial loss to post offices in <i>(a)</i> Haltemprice and Howden and <i>(b)</i> the East Riding of Yorkshire as a result of the change in the payment of benefits from over-the-counter to direct bank transfer.  [96710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. The migration of benefit payment to ACT begins this year and the Post Office's strategy is to respond to that challenge with a range of banking and other services. How the migration of benefit payments affects the revenue of post offices will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change. The income from the various contracts Post Office Ltd. has with the spending Departments and various financial institutions, and the remuneration of sub-postmasters for banking services, is a commercial matter between the parties.

 Hospital mergers are changes of organisational structures rather than changes to services. Each case has to be considered on its merits, taking local circumstances into account. One study covering 25 trusts in London did consider the effect of mergers. It found that while there were risks in the process, given the diversion of managerial focus, there was also evidence of a number of benefits, including greater sharing of good practice.

 The Government are committed to providing National Health Service dentistry for all who need and seek it. We recognise, however, that there are some areas of the country, including parts of Somerset, where it is difficult to get access to an NHS dentist. For this reason more than &#163;3.5 million additional investment is being made over two years in Somerset (2001/02 and 2002/03) to establish a ental access centre to treat non-registered patients.

 Massage oils are not normally regarded as medicinal products by the Medicines Control Agency, but this depends on their ingredients and the claims made for them. However, medicinal products for external use are excluded from the scope of the Medicines for Human Use (Kava-Kava) Prohibition Order 2002. Accordingly, the Order does not cover massage oils containing kava-kava which are medicinal products.

 Our recent draft guidance published for consultation, "Health clearance for serious communicable diseases: new health care workers", proposes that new health care workers whose jobs or training will involve exposure prone procedures will have to test negative for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C before taking up their posts. Such procedures occur mainly in surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, dentistry and midwifery, where there is a risk that injury to the health care worker could expose a patient to their blood.
<P>

<a name="30211w15.html_para0">The draft guidance does not require HIV and hepatitis tests for all new national health service staff because the clinical procedures carried out by the majority of health care workers carry no risk of transmission of these viruses, provided routine infection control measures are observed. New health care workers who will not carry out exposure prone procedures will be offered testing for HIV and hepatitis C. Testing for hepatitis B will be carried out if necessary in the context of checking response to immunisation.

 The DCMS have used Capita as one of five companies within a framework agreement when a need for their services have arisen.

At some point in the future the services offered by Capita could be chosen over the other companies and they will then be offered work by the Department.

<a name="30211w17.html_para5">Having checked the <i>Official Report</i>, I have noticed that during the exchange that followed my statement, my answer pointing to the compliance rate for self-employed non-resident parents of 34 per cent. should have been non-compliance at 34 per cent. This reflects the fact that at November 2002 34 per cent. paid nothing. The figure for those non-resident parents who are fully and partially compliant for this group is at 66 per cent., but this is still significantly below the figure for all cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the current providers of deferred annuities, as referred to in paragraph 81, page 65 of the Green Paper Simplicity, security and choice; and if he will make a statement on the bad value of deferred annuities.  [95276]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w17.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The current providers of deferred annuities are 'Legal and General' and Prudential. In the Green Paper, "Simplicity, security and choice&#151;Working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677), we state our interest in considering the establishment central fund into which members could choose to pay the funds that they receive on wind-up. The fund could then&#151;acting as a whole&#151;negotiate the purchase of deferred annuities with providers. The Green Paper sets out the market context in which such a central fund would operate. The consultation period on the Green Paper ends on 28 March 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions <i>[pursuant to his answer 18 December 2002, Official Report, column 859]</i>, whether the data on the number of pension schemes that have completed winding-up and the members of those schemes in the financial years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 is likely to be revised.  [91585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 As explained in the answer to the previous parliamentary question, the data used was derived from information collected by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR), which is not designed or intended to provide a comprehensive or continuous statistical record of the number of schemes which wind-up. The PSR registers schemes for tracing purposes and collects the levy from pension schemes, including those in the process of winding-up. New scheme data is being reported to the PSR on a continuous basis. Therefore, the figures aresubject to continuous revision. The figures in the previous parliamentary question showing the number of schemes commencing and in the process of winding up and the number of members of those schemes shown were correct in terms of the information available to the PSR. As new information becomes available on an on-going basis, the figures change. That is because the figures are a snapshot. Since the previous parliamentary question, in the course of itspursuance of unpaid levy liabilities, the PSR has identified further schemeswhich had commenced wind up in previous years and were still in the wind upprocess. These schemes are added to the figures as they are identified. At the same time, the PSR will sometimes identify that 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2003 : Column 686W</I><P>
some schemes had completedwind up in previous years. These schemes are removed from the columnshowing schemes still in the process of winding up and are added to thecolumn showing completed wind ups. Again, this occurs on an on-going basisas the PSR identifies the facts.
<P>

<a name="30211w18.html_para5">However, work to produce the latest available figures has indicated factualerrors in the presentation of the figures for the earlier parliamentary question of 18 December 2002 showing the number of completed wind ups and thenumbers of members of those schemes. These errors relate to technicalaspects of the PSR's database, but the most significant effect was to overstatethe numbers of members in schemes that had completed wind up.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Notes:</i>The reason the figures for completed wind ups in 1997/98 are so much larger than for other years is that from 1997, the rules governing which schemes had a levy liability were changed&#151;all schemes with two or more members became liable whereas previously, only schemes with two or more active members were liable. So, in 1997, the PSR issued levy requests to a large number of schemes, only to discover that a number of them had already wound up. All these schemes were recorded as having completed wind up in 1997/98 even if, in fact, they had wound up earlier. Therefore, we know these figures are inflated, but not by how much. As explained, that is because the figures were not collected for the purpose of recording the numbers of scheme wind ups.</FONT></UL>

<a name="30211w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Deprivation is measured in the new education funding formula through child based measures of poverty: the proportion of children in families on income support or in receipt of working families' tax credit. The other indicators used in the formula for distribution of grant to local authorities are set out in the Local Government finance report 2003&#150;04, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The formula are designed to measure the relative costs of service delivery, and individual service blocks use the most appropriate measures of need, including deprivation: there is no reason why these should be the same for all service blocks.

 In 2001&#150;02 the City of Leeds' Education SSA was &#163;317.01 million; in 2002&#150;03 it is &#163;311.54 million. In 2003&#150;04 its Education Formula Spending Share is &#163;344.63 million.

<a name="30211w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 3 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 783W, on specialist status schools, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of specialist status on technology colleges.  [96767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The October 2001 Ofsted survey of the programme ("Specialist Schools: An evaluation of progress") looked at the Technology specialism alongside the three other specialisms which were part of the programme in 2000. The survey found that four out of five of the well-established specialist schools covered by the survey were in large measure achieving the aims of the programme and making good use of the advantages it brings. The survey said that for these schools specialist status had often been a catalyst for innovation and helped to sustain or accelerate the momentum of school improvement. The Ofsted survey found no problems specific to Technology Colleges.
<P>

<a name="30211w21.html_para1">The question refers to my answer of 28 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 783W, which said that since the programme began, 32 Technology Colleges have lost their specialist status in comparison to one school designated in another specialism. The reason for this disparity is that Technology Colleges have been part of the programme for longer and there are many more of them. Technology was the first specialism and was introduced in 1994. Schools come up for re-designation every four years (until 2000 this was every three years).
<P>

<a name="30211w21.html_para2">There are currently schools operating in eight specialisms in the programme&#151;Technology Colleges represent 45 per cent. of these schools. The first Language Colleges began operating in 1995. The first Sports and Arts Colleges began operating in 1997. The first specialist schools designated in Science, Engineering, Business and Enterprise and Mathematics and Computing began operating in September 2002.

 The scope for reducing the total burden of external assessment in GCSE and A-level examinations will be considered by our 14&#150;19 Working Group and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. They will be examining the principles underpinning effective assessment, including the nature and amount of assessment. We expect the Working Group to make an interim report within a year.

<a name="30211w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Simon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) if he will make a statement on the reforms designed to reduce teacher workload, as outlined in the November 2002 Teachers report, with specific reference to measures which will help teachers to keep up with the pace of change occurring in their profession;  [96289]
<P>
<UL>(2) what actions he is taking to ensure there is adequate PPA time for teachers to prepare lessons for their pupils; and how this will balance against teaching time and the time needed to carry out administrative duties.  [96290]<P></UL>

<a name="30211w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 On 15 January the Government signed an historic national agreement with school workforce unions and most employers. The agreement sets out a series of measures that will extend support staff roles, tackle teacher workload, and free teachers to spend more of their time on teaching and focus on the individual learning needs of all pupils. Contractual changes for teachers will be made, including:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No requirement routinely to undertake administrative and clerical tasks, including the 24 tasks set out in the agreement, by September 2003;
<P>
<BR>
A limit of 38 hours on the time a teacher should cover lessons, by September 2004;
<P>
<BR>
The equivalent of at least 10 per cent. of their timetabled teaching time to be guaranteed for planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) by September 2005. PPA are core duties and need core time devoted to them. Guaranteeing time during the school day for this is critical to driving up pupil standards.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30211w22.html_para0">Schools will be expected to work towards these changes as soon as possible and on later than the dates given above.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps his Department is taking to combat truancy in schools.  [96666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We are committed to the Public Service Agreement target to reduce truancies by 10 per cent. by 2004 compared to 2002, to sustain the new lower level, and improve overall attendance levels thereafter. To achieve this objective, we are investing nearly &#163;470 million over the next three years in a national behaviour and attendance strategy to support schools. This includes behaviour and attendance training and audits available to all secondary schools from September. Through the Behaviour Improvement 



<P>
<P><I>11 Feb 2003 : Column 699W</I><P>
Programme further support is currently being targeted at the 700 schools with the greatest challenges, to be extended to a further 1900 schools by 2005. We have a range of further measures to tackle truancy, including the co-ordination of national truancy sweeps; funding for electronic registration systems; the development of guidance for more effective prosecutions in truancy cases in tandem with a fast-track to prosecution model focusing on multi-agency early intervention to address truancy; and a sustained publicity campaign aimed at parents and pupils. In addition, we are proposing to introduce fixed penalty notices and parenting contracts for parents of persistent truants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the estimated incidence of truancy is in secondary schools broken down by local authority area, in the last year for which figures are available.  [96800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The incidence of truancy is measured by the percentage of half days missed due to unauthorised absence. The latest year for which figures are available is September 2001&#150;May 2002.

<P>
<a name="30211w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government are determined to tackle the problem of air weapon misuse. We intend to increase from 14 years to 17 the age at which a person can own an air weapon, and to tighten up on when they can be used without adult supervision. In addition, we propose to introduce a new offence of having an air weapon in a public place without lawful cause or reasonable excuse. This offence will have a power of arrest attached to it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many asylum seekers from Algeria were <i>(a)</i> granted asylum, <i>(b)</i> rejected for asylum and in subsequent appeal and <i>(c)</i> were removed from the UK in each of the last 10 years;  [96016]

 The available information is provided in the tables. The appeals allowed and dismissed figures, and the figures for removals and voluntary departures, given do not necessarily relate to the refusals in the same year. These could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. The figures exclude subsequent appeals (court of appeal, judicial review and the House of Lords).

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10, or three significant figures.<P>

2. The figures given for passengers given leave to enter the UK are of the numbers of journeys made. A person who makes more than one journey is counted on each occasion.<P>

3. Asylum-related grants of settlement rose sharply in 1999 and 2000 due to <i>(a)</i> a change in the rules reducing the qualifying periods for people granted asylum and exceptional leave to remain, and effectively increasing the number of people eligible for settlement and <i>(b)</i> grants of asylum or exceptional leave to remain under a backlog criteria which contributed significantly to the increase but has now largely been completed.<P>

<a name="30211w24.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has published a Complaints Procedure leaflet, which details the process customers should take if they are not completely satisfied with the service. All complaints regarding maladministration are rigorously investigated and if appropriate, financial redress is made. While there is no specific mention made of ex-gratia payments in the CRB's publicity material, a customer is invited as part of the complaints process to make a claim if he or she feels that an aspect of the service has been mishandled and that this has resulted in loss. Customers are given appropriate advice about redress when they contact the bureau. The complaints procedure is also available in the information pack that is issued to all registered bodies and on the disclosure website, www.disclosure.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="30211w24.html_para3">The CRB's main concern is to resolve any issues affecting the process of an application. In the first instance, a customer is encouraged to contact the CRB help line service or put their complaint in writing to the CRB customer service manager. The applicant's details will then be directed to the appropriate department for investigation and they will endeavour to resolve the issues raised.
<P>

<a name="30211w24.html_para4">If the customer is not completely satisfied with the way their complaint has been handled, they would be advised to write to the CRB operations director. Should the applicant remain dissatisfied with the operations director's reply they are able to refer their complaint in writing to the chief executive. Alternatively, people may contact their MP who will then raise the matter with the Minister or CRB chief executive. The CRB has appointed a complaint mediator to resolve those complaints where the customer remains dissatisfied with the chief executive's reply. The complaint mediator will make recommendations to the CRB for resolving any outstanding issues.

<P>
<a name="30211w25.html_wqn0"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the report commissioned by him and prepared by Steven Pudney of the University of Leicester on possible links between soft and hard drug use; and if he will make a statement.  [95110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Professor Pudney's report, "The Road to Ruin", studied the links between a group of drugs (LSD, amphetamine and cannabis) and subsequent use of heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and crack. It identifies a small but significant link between this group of drugs and cocaine and ecstasy. However the report indicates that there is little relationship between the use of this group and the later involvement with heroin and crack. It does not differentiate between cannabis, amphetamine and LSD (which is a Class A drug) so does not prove the case either way of cannabis as a gateway drug.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para0">The findings of the report show that social, economic and family circumstances seem to be the dominant influences on young people's risk of becoming involved in crime and the most harmful drugs. We know that some young people are at particular risk of developing problems with substance misuse. That is why the Government is committed to helping those who are most at risk of developing drug problems through an improved range of early intervention and prevention programmes, which includes education and diversionary activities aimed at young people in high crime areas.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para1">The other key influence on drug use identified in the report is the impact on individuals of the growing social acceptance of drug use and availability of supply. The Government is committed to tackling the social acceptance of drug use through ensuring that all young people and their parents understand the risks and dangers of drugs and know where to go for advice or help. A major new campaign will be launched this spring to drive home the risks of drugs, based on credible information on the dangers of all drugs and encourage young people and their parents to seek further information and advice where necessary. It is important that the message that all illegal drugs are harmful is clear, consistent and widely heard. The updated national drug strategy gives a stronger focus on education and prevention for young people. This means we must also make illegal drugs harder to obtain and tackle the supply at all levels. We will heavily penalise those caught dealing in any drugs, increase the recovery of drug-related criminal assets and strengthen

enforcement at a local level. Class A drugs damage the lives of individuals, families and communities. That is why the updated national drug strategy has a tougher focus on Class A drugs.

<a name="30211w25.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown </B> 
: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many empty homes his Department <i>(a)</i> had five years ago and <i>(b)</i> has now, by region; if he will establish an empty homes strategy within his Department; and if he will set a target for reduction in empty homes.  [92934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w25.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As at 1 April 1998 the Prison Service had 161 empty homes out of a total of 1,625. The number in each region is not known. There was an additional vacant property at the Emergency Planning College, which is now the responsibility of the Cabinet Office.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para2">As at 24 January 2003 the Prison Service had three empty homes out of a total of 599. These are located in Leeds, Hertfordshire and London and have been vacant for less than six months.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para3">All homes, whether empty or occupied, are under constant review. Generally homes which become vacant are not re-let but are sold on the open market. Consideration is being given to the reintroduction and extension of a scheme under which eligible occupiers are able to buy their homes. However, due to recruitment and retention problems in London and the south-east accommodation in these areas is being retained and in some cases converted for multiple occupation. These properties are re-let on a short-term basis, which will not normally exceed multiples of six months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w25.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Generally, the Commission can only examine the cases of those who apply to it.Whilst there are exceptions to this, such as the Commission approaching the convicted co-defendants of an applicant whose case merits a referral, this would not extend to examining whole categories of cases such as mothers convicted of murdering their infant children. The Commission publicises its work and the need for applications. Its information pack and audio and videotapes are circulated to Prisons and the Commission has attended prison information days at Her Majesty's Prison Holloway.

<a name="30211w25.html_para4">Factors such as the age and ill health of applicants and witnesses, and the possibility of the deterioration of evidence are taken into account in assigning priority to applications to the Commission. Priority is also assigned to cases that the Commission believes to be of particular significance to the criminal justice system. Otherwise applications are generally reviewed in date order of receipt, with in-custody cases generally being assigned one year of priority over at-liberty cases.The application of Sally Clark was given priority under this system.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many individuals claimed their new passports were lost in the post in 2002; in how many of those cases the Passport Agency issued a replacement passport; and what discussions the Passport Agency has had with the Post Office to ensure new passports are not mislaid in the post.  [96187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30211w25.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service's records indicate that 2,982 passports were reported as having been lost in the post in the calendar year January to December 2002. Replacement passports would have been issued in response to almost all of these reports.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para5">The UK Passport Service has on-going and regular discussions with the Royal Mail about the loss of passports in the post and about options for delivery which might reduce the number of losses. They work together on investigations into the disappearance of passports in the postal system.
<P>

<a name="30211w25.html_para6">The UK Passport Service issues around 5.5 million passports annually and the vast majority arrive safely at their destination using first class mail. Also, the digital passport contains advanced security features which makes it extremely difficult to manipulate and is of limited value in the hands of somebody other than the rightful holder. Nevertheless losses in the post remain a concern to the UK Passport Service and it is actively investigating alternative, more secure and convenient methods of delivering passports to its customers. It hopes to reach a business decision on this shortly.

 The UK is co-ordinating international support for Afghanistan's drug control efforts and has produced, in consultation with the Afghan government, other donors and international agencies, a strategy for building up Afghan drug law enforcement capacity and providing alternative livelihoods to opium poppy farmers. Experience in Thailand and Pakistan shows that a concerted and co-ordinated effort to eliminate opium poppy cultivation can be successful in the long-term.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary visited the Balkans in November 2002 and held useful talks with the political leaders in Belgrade, Pristina and Sarajevo. I also visited the region several times last year. I would expect further such visits to go ahead this year. My right hon. Friend and I were encouraged by progress made so far, especially in maintaining peace and security in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Foreign Secretary and I have also held talks with Lord Ashdown and Michael Steiner, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Kosovo, in respect of their work in Bosnia and Kosovo. The new arrangements redefining the relationship between Serbia and Montenegro are a good example of how differences can be resolved in the Balkans through peaceful negotiation. We will continue to engage closely with all governments in the region to integrate them more fully with the EU and international community. This includes improved co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the use made by the Palestinian Authority of funding supplied to it by the European Union; and what steps are taken to ensure that such aid is used for the purposes for which it is intended.  [96397]<P>

<P>
<a name="30211w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear on 21 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i> column 149, it is our assessment that EU assistance to the Palestinian Authority provides essential support, without which it is likely that it would not be able to continue operating. At the London meeting on Palestinian reform on 14 January, there was widespread recognition that the Palestinian Authority had achieved great progress in reforming the way that their financial systems operate.
<P>

<a name="30211w28.html_para0">We attach great importance to the highest standards of financial management being adhered to in the disbursement of all EU funding and take seriously any allegations of misuse. The European Commission has in place a number of stringent monitoring and control measures in the implementation of EU financial assistance programmes and disbursements of EU monies to the Palestinian Authority. To date, the Commission has found no evidence that EU monies have been misused by the Palestinian Authority in order to finance terrorism or for anything other than their agreed purpose.
<P>

<a name="30211w28.html_para1">The European Commission has committed itself to continuing to help the Ministry of Finance ensure proper oversight of all Palestinian Authority finances. This is a core objective of several conditions attached to EU budgetary support. A letter of 21 January 2003 from External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten to the European Parliament setting out in detail the Commission's oversight of funding to the Palestinian Authority is available on its Europa website <i>www.europa.eu.int</i>.

<a name="30211w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 On 4 February I congratulated the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro on adopting their new Constitutional Charter, which redefined future relations between the two republics and replaced the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In doing so they have clearly shown to the region a readiness to resolve their differences through peaceful negotiation. Under the new arrangements Serbia and Montenegro will share control of foreign affairs, defence, foreign economic relations, internal economic relations and human and minority rights. But they have also retained the option of reconsidering, after three years and via a referendum, the status of Serbia and Montenegro.

<i>[holding answer 7 February 2003]:</i> A modern air traffic control system is needed for the large number of commercial and humanitarian flights that fly over and within Sudan and is crucial for the safety of United Nations and Non-Governmental Organisations staff involved in the delivery of vital humanitarian aid in Sudan, the majority of which is currently transported by air. Officials have discussed with aid agencies their concerns about the system.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2003]:</i> The French mentioned, in the margins of the Copenhagen summit in December, that they were considering inviting Mugabe to Paris for the France-Africa summit scheduled two days after sanctions are due to expire. The French made a formal written request to all EU partners on 23 January; this included requests for visa waivers for Robert Mugabe, Mrs. Mugabe and Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge to attend the France-Africa summit on 20 and 21 February. Apart from this request and responses by a number of member states, which are EU internal documents, there was no correspondence on this matter. Discussion on this issue continues in Brussels. We have made clear throughout our support for the sanctions regime including the travel ban.
