 The Church Commissioners have received no such representations. The Archbishops&#039; Council is, with representatives of other Christian bodies and faith communities, actively engaged in discussions with the DTI on this issue. The Church of England&#039;s review group, under the chairmanship of Professor David McClean, will bring its second report to the Archbishops&#039; Council later this year and to the General Synod in February 2005. If Synod approves the group&#039;s proposals, the Church will begin to prepare the legislation necessary to implement them.

<a name="41026w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>REACH Proposal</h3>


<p><a name="41026w01.html_wqn1"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answers to questions 189034 and 189035, what proportion of the total direct costs across the EU for implementing the REACH proposal will fall on <i>(a)</i> industry and <i>(b)</i> the public purse.  [190689]</p>




<p><a name="41026w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government have worked with industry and others to ensure that the benefits of the REACH proposals to human health and the environment are well focussed on achieving maximum practical benefit with a minimum of direct impact on industrial competitiveness. In particular our own proposals for &quot;one substance, one registration&quot; are intended to lower costs to industry as well as creating a level playing field across Europe and keeping animal testing to a minimum. We have presented proposals jointly with the Hungarian Government and received positive responses from other Governments to our proposals which will now be considered and discussed further within the EU. Estimates have to be based on proposals as they stand at any given stage and our suggestions are not yet part of the official proposals. Based on the Commission&#039;s proposals, the results from the UK partial Regulatory Impact Assessment referred to in the answers to questions 189034 and 189035 (i.e. an estimated direct cost of &#163;515 million over the 11 year phase in period which is equivalent to total direct costs across the EU of approximately &#163;2.4 billion) are estimates of the costs to be incurred by industry. This is in line with European Commission estimates published in October 2003 of a maximum overall cost of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Oct 2004 : Column 1092W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
revised proposal to be &#8364;7.5 billion. We are currently carrying out further impact assessment work to assess the indirect costs passed down the supply chain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para0">
The European Commission estimates published in October 2003 indicate that, in addition to testing and registration costs, the chemicals industry is estimated to pay some &#8364;0.3 billion in fees to the new European chemicals agency. The costs of establishing and running the European chemicals agency under the REACH system were estimated at some &#8364;0.4 billion as a one-off cost over 11 years. This cost will be met from the fees paid by industry (&#8364;0.3 billion) and the remainder from the Community budget.

In the UK, the appointment of a Competent Authority or Authorities is a practical issue relating to the introduction of REACH and will be subject to a consultation exercise in the future.

<i>[holding answer 18 October 2004]</i>: Working with the grain of nature&#151;a biodiversity strategy for England (Defra 2002) sets out the Government&#039;s vision for biodiversity in urban areas. The strategy recognises that a flourishing biodiversity makes a real contribution to the quality of life of urban residents and visitors alike. It aims to ensure that biodiversity conservation is integral to sustainable urban communities by enhancing biodiversity in green spaces and among developments in urban areas so that they are used by wildlife and valued by people. It aims to ensure that construction, planning, development and regeneration have minimal impacts on biodiversity and enhance it where possible. A workstream group has been established to develop and take forward a work programme to implement the goals.

<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para2">
The Department has been working closely with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the preparation of a draft planning policy statement which was published for consultation last month. The draft PPS9 sets out the Government&#039;s policy objectives on biodiversity and geological conservation in England. These policies are firmly rooted in working with the grain of nature, including the objectives for urban areas.

<p><a name="41026w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There are no central records of the incidence of mastitis or lameness in dairy cattle. However, I am well aware of the seriousness of these welfare problems and their impact on the dairy industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para3">
That is why we continue to fund research in these areas. We are currently funding two research projects into the causes and control of cattle lameness at a cost of more than &#163;800,000. Defra also has a contract with the Agricultural Development Advisory Service to run an advisory programme for farmers to encourage good welfare. A significant part of the contract is used for providing free advice to individual farmers, which often includes giving advice on ways they could help to alleviate mastitis and lameness levels in their herds. The most substantial part of the contract is used to fund awareness campaigns on topics of welfare concern. The campaigns aim to promote good practice, highlight the latest research and to discuss practical experiences. This year (and not for the first time) we are funding a series of meetings for farmers advising them on how to reduce the incidence of mastitis and promoting Defra&#039;s Mastitis Management Action Plan, which was developed in 1999. Lameness in dairy cattle has also been a major topic over the last few years. Last year, for example, we held a series of meetings on reducing injuries to dairy cows and produced an interactive CD-ROM aimed at helping farmers identify potential causes of injury to dairy cattle and provide guidance on minimising such risks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para4">
The Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Cattle (which was revised last year) and its associated publications also provide advice on how to treat and prevent mastitis and lameness in dairy cows.

[193094]</p>




<p><a name="41026w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department continues to take a sensitive and constructive approach at Pershore. The landscape on the leased area has been improved and plantings are maturing. The addition of a water course has benefited drainage. The site and its impact on the environment is subject to close professional supervision and scrutiny by the Environment Agency, the local authority and Defra. Both ground water and surface water quality are closely monitored and remain normal. In addition, surface water drains into a reed bed designed to purify the water before it discharges to the brook on the south side of the site. Close monitoring of the whole site will continue.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what plans 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Oct 2004 : Column 1094W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
she has for the future of rural transport partnerships after funding support transfers from the Countryside Agency to regional development agencies;  [191098]

<p>(6) if she will make a statement on the withdrawal of the communities services grant from the Countryside Agency&#039;s Vital Villages programme; and what alternative sources of funding are available.  [192683]</p>




<p><a name="41026w01.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Countryside Agency funds Rural Transport Partnerships through their Vital Villages programme. The Agency will continue to fund existing projects and commitments until the Vital Villages programme closes on 31 March 2006. From 1 April 2005 Defra will devolve decision making on the delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the regional development agencies. The regional development agencies are charged with contributing to the delivery of DEFRA&#039;s Public Service Agreement target to improve the accessibility of services for people in rural England. In recognition of their larger role in the delivery of DEFRA&#039;s policies, we have given the regional development agencies an additional &#163;21.3 million per annum for the years 2005&#150;06, 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para6">
These new arrangements will mean considerable changes for how DEFRA achieves its rural objectives. regional development agencies, working with their partners, will be responsible for deciding how to spend their resources and grants may not be available for the types of projects that have been supported through the Countryside Agency&#039;s Vital Villages programme hitherto. But I am confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the regional development agencies and increasing their resources, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w01.html_para7">
From now until the closure of the Vital Villages programme the Countryside Agency is working to mainstream the work of the Rural Transport Partnerships and share good practice.

 I refer the hon. Member to paragraphs 366&#150;387 of the report of the Butler Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction (HC898) which describe the role of intelligence in assessing the legality of the use of force against Iraq. This section of the report sets out the legal process, including when advice was given by the Attorney-General.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w05.html_para0">
The Butler Report also makes it clear that the advice concerned the legal interpretation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and not WMD-related intelligence. In paragraph 1 of UNSCR 1441, the Security Council itself decided that Iraq was, and remained, in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions. In paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, the Security Council also decided that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to the resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution would constitute a further material breach of Iraq&#039;s obligations. It is a question of fact whether there were any such false statements or omissions in Iraq&#039;s declarations and whether Iraq did comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution. As appears from paragraph 383 of the Butler Report, it was not for the Law Officers themselves to ascertain what those facts were. As stated in paragraph 385, the Prime Minister formed the view, based on information from a wide range of sources, including UNMOVIC reports, that there were false statements and omissions in the Iraqi declarations and also that Iraq had failed to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441.

These attributes include three measures of accessibility; first, whether the dwelling meets one of the recognised standards (Lifetime Homes, Housing Corporation Design Standards or Building Regulations&#151;Part M); secondly, counts of the number of steps outside and within the dwelling or block; and finally a record of adaptations which have been carried out.

 The Government Office has made a small number of objections to draft development plans prepared under provisions in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 in relation to policies for Gypsy sites. The objections related to issues of compliance with current guidance contained in the Department&#039;s Circular 1/94, &quot;Gypsy Sites and Planning&quot;. It asks local planning authorities to assess the need for Gypsy accommodation in their areas and, wherever possible, to identify in their plans locations suitable for Gypsy sites, whether local authority or private sites. Where this is not possible authorities are asked to set out clear, realistic criteria for suitable locations as a basis for site provision policies. No objections have been made to policies for Gypsy sites in draft local plans prepared by Wychavon district council in the hon. Member&#039;s constituency.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of how many surveyors will be required as a result of the seller&#039;s packs provisions included in the Housing Bill; how many are available at the present time; and what estimate he has made of how long it will take to train sufficient surveyors. [193781R]</p>




<p><a name="41026w06.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The industry estimates that around 7,500 home inspectors (some working full time some working part time) will be needed to compile home condition reports for home information packs in England and Wales. As this new qualification is dependent on the passage of the Housing Bill, there are no qualified home inspectors yet. However, independent research by Asset Skills, the relevant sector skills council, shows that between 10,000 and 18,000 people working in property services or related industries are expected to convert to work as home inspectors. This indicates that there will be sufficient qualified inspectors available to provide the required number of home condition reports when the reforms are implemented in January 2007. All home inspectors will have to belong to a certification scheme and will have to obtain the required home inspection qualification before they can become members. The length of training will depend on the candidate&#039;s level of existing knowledge and experience. This could range between a matter of months for a RICS surveyor already doing similar work, to the equivalent of a full time two year course followed by a period of &quot;on the job&quot; training for someone with no previous experience.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister anticipates that the home information pack reforms will be implemented in January 2007.

This continues to be the subject of extensive research and discussion and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has established programme management arrangements involving consumer representatives and key industry stakeholders to provide help and guidance on this. Assisted by the Association of British Insurers and our industry working group, discussions with commercial insurers are taking place aimed at identifying options based on a commercial approach. The possible basis for an insurance regime will be published when this work is complete. Discussions with leading commercial insurers indicate that they are broadly comfortable with the proposals and that there is an appetite to insure home inspectors.

 There will not be a national database of the information contained in home information packs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is proposing to make provision in the Housing Bill for a register of home condition reports. Our intention is that the register will comprise an electronic databank of all home condition reports prepared by registered home inspectors. In order to respect privacy, and data-protection legislation, access to information obtained from the register would be strictly controlled. Home information packs may be in an electronic format but potential buyers will be entitled to ask for a paper copy of the pack (or part of the pack) if they prefer.

<p><a name="41026w07.html_spnew2"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Government strongly believe that the issues of social inclusion, neighbourhood renewal, and local and regional prosperity are tightly interlinked. A partnership approach&#151;not only across Government Departments but also more widely with local and regional service providers and policy makers&#151;are essential to tackle the difficult issues underlying deprivation and social exclusion. Both the Social Exclusion Unit and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit work closely with all Government Departments, and this work has already produced tangible results:

 The Single European Sky (SES) Regulations, which came into force on the 20 April 2004, require the development of a transparent common charging scheme for the recovery of the costs of air navigation services provided by the member states. One of the underlying principles of the charging scheme is that air navigation service costs should be recovered according to the &#039;user pays&#039; principle, that is airspace users should pay for the services they use.
</p>

The current draft of the European Commission&#039;s Implementing Rules on charging provides for member states to exempt certain categories of airspace users from the charges scheme.

<p><a name="41026w12.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 An evaluation of the National Reassurance Policing Programme has been commissioned. This study will assess the impact of police activity on public feelings of safety and security, community engagement, confidence in, and satisfaction with, the police in 16 pilot sites around the country. Two of the sites, Bexley and Enfield, are also part of the Safer Neighbourhoods Programme in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) area. The evaluation is based upon a repeat survey of residents in pilot and control areas during Winter 2003&#150;04 and Winter 2004&#150;05. The respondents were randomly sampled to render the findings more robust. The results should be available in autumn 2005.

The MPS are conducting their own internal assessment of the Safer Neighbourhoods Programme for operational purposes. They are rolling out a public attitudes survey across the 96 wards involved in the programme. Residents in the first six wards were interviewed in April using a quota sample. A second quota sample of residents in the same six wards was taken in August.

The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis reports that the introduction of Safer Neighbourhoods Teams is making a discernible impact across London. The feedback is extremely favourable: the public, the business sector and police partners are supportive of the programme. It is placing an increased uniform presence on the streets, increasing accessibility to policing services, galvanising community cohesion, impacting on crime, providing benefits to the wider community and providing the necessary familiarity to increase public confidence in the police service.

 The British Embassy in Luanda, in partnership with British Petroleum (BP), co-funded a pilot project to give the village of Paranhos communal lighting, power supply to the school and clinic, potable water and some domestic lighting. Paranhos was selected in part because it houses roughly equal numbers of families from both sides of Angola&#039;s civil war. The project, as well as demonstrating the viability of renewable energy, is also an important part of the process of national reintegration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w14.html_para0">
This small pilot project and BP&#039;s interest in setting it up are welcome. I hope that BP and the Government of Angola are able to follow this up to ensure that the equipment continues to operate properly, providing a useful service to the selected village. No doubt, there are valuable lessons that can be learnt from this project, not least how best it might be replicated on a larger scale to provide permanent, reliable services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w14.html_para1">
In general, while solar energy can deliver useful benefits, it does have limitations, notably its inability to provide heat for cooking, the main energy requirement for most households in Africa. Other issues, such as the need to periodically replace expensive batteries, were taken into account in the design of the Paranhos project. This experience and the lessons learnt from this pilot need to be properly understood before there is any consideration of expanding it to other communities.

DFID is not providing support for renewable energy sources in Angola. However, more generally, DFID has funded some 75 energy projects since 1992 through our Knowledge and Research Programme (47 of which were started since May 1997) with a total value of &#163;10 million, of which &#163;3.6 million was spent on the development and promotion of renewable energy, especially for rural communities in developing countries.

<p><a name="41026w16.html_wqn1"><b> Paul Flynn: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his assessment is of the effects of the Common Agricultural Policy sugar regime on local sugar production in developing nations in <i>(a)</i> Africa and <i>(b)</i> Asia; and if he will make a statement.  [192869]</p>




<p><a name="41026w16.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The EU&#039;s CAP regime for sugar is a heavily regulated, highly protected and discriminatory one. It is also extremely costly to the consumer and taxpayer. By maintaining high guaranteed prices for production which are well above world market prices, high tariffs on most imports, and heavily subsidising exports, the regime encourages over-production in the EU and dumps millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar onto world markets each year. It has the effect of depressing world prices, and it crowds developing countries out of local markets which they would otherwise be able to supply. Some traditional suppliers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions (ACP), do have preferential access to the EU market under an arrangement called the Sugar Protocol. Most of the countries in Africa and Asia who are sugar producers or potential sugar producers are currently denied preferential access to the EU market. For these and other reasons, reform of the regime is both necessary and desirable, and long overdue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w16.html_para0">
The European Commission presented a Communication to the Agriculture Council on 19 July that set out their preferred approach to reform. The Communication proposes to substantially reduce sugar exports and export refunds, abolish intervention, restructure EU production at a lower level, reduce the internal sugar price and grant a de-coupled payment to sugar beet farmers. The reform process would start in July 2005. This should make the regime more market oriented and reduce the quantity of EU sugar exported to third markets. If the option were to be agreed, the Commission estimate that the combined, aggregate effect of the proposals on support price and quota reduction would be a significant reduction in the level of EU production under quota, from 17.3 million to 14.5 million tonnes per year. In turn, as a consequence of the substantial reduction in the overall level of EU production, EU subsidised sugar exports&#151;dumping&#151;are projected to fall by around 2 million tonnes. The Commission Communication will be the subject of discussion between the EU member states over the coming months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w16.html_para1">
However, there will be winners and losers from this reform, just as there are winners and losers from the current regime. Those preferential suppliers to the EU who receive prices very similar to EU producers will see these prices fall. DFID has always stressed the need to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Oct 2004 : Column 1147W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
take account of the impact that reform of the EU sugar regime will have on our developing country preferential suppliers. We are conscious that substantial reform will give rise to transitional problems for the ACP counties, and for Least Developed Countries (LDC) seeking to develop an export trade to Europe under the Everything But Arms initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w16.html_para2">
In order to help inform the debate and ensure the impact on developing countries is taken sufficiently into consideration, DFID commissioned a study last year with LMC International and Oxford Policy Management, &#039;Addressing the Impact of Preference Erosion in Sugar on Developing Countries&#039;. The study is divided into two sections. The first part assesses the economic and social impact on the ACP Sugar Protocol countries of the various reform scenarios suggested by the European Commission. The latter part of the study assesses alternative options for addressing the impact of preference erosion in sugar. The purpose of this analysis was to identify various options for debate by the ACP and the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w16.html_para3">
DFID has recently commissioned two further pieces of work on this issue. The first report has been commissioned with LMC International, &#039;EU Sugar Reform: the Implications for the Development of LDCs&#039; and should be finalised very soon. The second report has been commissioned from the Overseas Development Institute, &#039;Forthcoming changes in EU sugar/banana markets: a menu of options for an effective EU transitional assistance package&#039; and should also be finalised very soon. This report should help those countries affected by reform determine their priorities for a transitional package. This report will include some analysis of alternative uses for sugar.

<p><a name="41026w18.html_spnew1"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The cross Government strategy on social enterprise, published in July 2002 recognises the role social enterprise can play in offering work and training for those seeking employment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w18.html_para0">
Through New Deal, Job Centre Plus enables individuals to seek meaningful employment through social enterprise as a transitional phase before entering the open labour market or as an ongoing sustainable option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w18.html_para1">
Social enterprises can also offer employment opportunities for disabled people. The Department for Work and Pension&#039;s WORKSTEP programme offers help for those who require more long term support and aims to provide disabled people with a better range of opportunities in employment, by tailoring support to individual needs in supported environments, including social enterprise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w18.html_para2">
In DTI&#039;s Small Business Service, social enterprises are at the forefront of our forthcoming support to help people with mental health issues explore ways into employment or self-employment. Many social enterprises will act as partners in supporting mental health clients through the process, and it is envisaged that a number of new social enterprises will be created across the country as a direct result of this initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w18.html_para3">
DTI in partnership with DfES and the Home Office has piloted a Support for Enterprising Communities Project focussed on investigating approaches to supporting social enterprises to be more sustainable. The project resulted in a range of benefits including developing the skills of local people, a more diverse local social enterprise sector and creation of new employment opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w18.html_para4">
We also think social enterprise can play a role in the delivery of ODPM&#039;s recent report on Jobs and Enterprise in Deprived Areas which contains measures to improve the delivery of support to those considering self-employment, such as through better joint work between the various relevant agencies, better availability of information and work to improve access to small-scale finance.

<p><a name="41026w21.html_spnew9"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The national rate of non-completion for those full-time students starting first degree courses in 2001&#150;02 is 14. per cent. compared with 15 per cent. for the cohort starting in 2000&#150;01. This represents one of the highest completion rates amongst OECD countries and we are determined to maintain this level of performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w21.html_para9">
We have asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to bear down on non-completion and their national co-ordination team, Action on Access, is working with institutions to improve retention rates and to spread good practice from those institutions with low drop-out rates and good access figures. In addition, the &#163;273 million which HEFCE has allocated to institutions in 2004&#150;05 for widening access and improving retention recognises some of the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and those who are less well prepared for higher education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w21.html_para10">
Research indicates that the reasons for non-completion are many and varied, but one factor is incompatibility between the student and their course or institution. It is vital that potential higher education (HE) students have the right information on which tobase sound decisions. This is why we have worked with the National Union of Students to develop a new guide to HE, linked to the new Aimhigher portal, which will help students search for information about any aspect of HE. We are working with HEFCE to develop a range of published information about the quality and standards of institutions&#039; programmes and a National Student Survey. Both will give students better information to help them make informed choices about where and what to study.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41026w21.html_para11">
Another factor which has been associated with non-completion is financial hardship. In addition to statutory student support, discretionary support through the Access to Learning Fund is also available as a safety net for vulnerable students. The Access to Learning Fund is administered by Higher Education Institutions and provides additional non-repayable grant support to help students access and remain in higher education.
</p>

We also intend to raise the levels of maintenance loan to meet the basic living costs of the mid-range student, in response to the recent Student Income and Expenditure Survey.

[191505]</p>




<p><a name="41026w21.html_spnew10"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 Full details of the changes to the methodology for non-completion are available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) website at www.hesa.ac.uk/pi in the documents &quot;Changes to PIs 2002/03&quot; and &quot;Annex C: Projected Outcomes&quot;. In summary, non-completion is one of the categories of the projected outcomes. These outcomes are derived by linking students from one year to the next to create a matrix of possible outcomes which is then used to calculate the projected outcomes. For the most recent projected outcomes, which cover students starting first degree courses in 2001&#150;02, changes were made to <i>(a)</i> the method of linking students and <i>(b)</i> the categories used in the matrix. The effect of the changes to the linking on the national figures is quite small. Some institutions show changes that appear relatively large, but these are mainly the small institutions where relatively large fluctuations are common. Similarly, the effect of the changes to the matrix at national level is small, and for most institutions there is no discernible effect.

The Department for International Development has also received requests to support trade unions in Iraq from UNISON and from the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions and is in discussion with them over possible assistance.

To this end, the Government strongly supports the proposals by the European Commission for a new system to gather hazard information, assess risks, classify, label, and restrict the marketing and use of individual chemicals and mixtures.

In the REACH negotiations, led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Government supports the aim of the authorisation process to ensure that the risks from substances of high concern are properly controlled and that these substances are eventually replaced by suitable substances or technologies, with the aim of reducing risks to human health and the environment. The Government also supports the inclusion in REACH, of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, very persistent and very bioaccumulative chemicals and substances of equivalent concern, such as endocrine, also known as hormone disrupters, when scientifically validated test methods have been developed and criteria established.

 The Department&#039;s policy with regard to local choice about information technology (IT) provision remains as stated in the guidance agreed jointly with the British Medical Association.

Notes:<br>

1. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

2. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

3. Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

However, the detail on numbers and locations of jobs is a matter for the companies.
