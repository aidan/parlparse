 The formal military conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and LTTE has now ended. The entire humanitarian caseload of 280,000 IDPs are now in camps under the control of the GoSL. The humanitarian response is moving from an emergency to a maintenance phase and basic living conditions are slowly improving. However, the lack of activity permitted such as freedom of movement remains of concern. Early return of the IDPs to their homes is vital.</p>

Department&#146;s performance in the previous spending review period is always taken into consideration in any new spending review. The Prime Minister&#146;s delivery unit was established in 2001, and while delivery of PSAs is ultimately the responsibility of individual Departments PMDU and HM Treasury work closely to support Departments to ensure delivery against these challenging commitments.

 The Department for Transport has received some 130 letters about the carriage of oxygen. European Regulation 1107/2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air does not impose specific obligations on airlines to carry or provide oxygen in the cabin. Where air carriers do supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, it is possible to make a charge for this service. However, many airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet and Flybe allow passengers to use their own oxygen and their own Portable Oxygen Concentrator free of charge. It is important that passengers know airlines' charging policies before choosing which carrier to fly with.</p>

 Aerodromes are expected to consider the environmental impact of their operations and apply measures designed to minimise the noise impact on the local population. To assist aerodromes in this task, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has published best practice guidance on noise considerations at general aviation aerodromes which is available on their website. This guidance also serves to provide members of the public with an explanation of the constraints and factors that must be considered by aerodrome operators when deciding on the noise mitigation measures that could be adopted.</p>

The certification requirements place a maximum decibel limit on the noise level that an aircraft may produce, and are specific to the aircraft type concerned. The requirements do not specify how those noise limits should be met, e.g. through the use of silencers.</p>

While it is possible to fit silencers to some light aircraft, this can have an effect on engine power and consequently aircraft performance. The CAA must take these factors into account on a case by case basis when considering whether the installation of silencers on different types of light aircraft.</p>

 The Community Legal Advice telephone service was launched on 14 July 2004. The total cost of expenditure on the Community Legal Advice telephone service in each year since 2004 is shown in the following table. All figures are inclusive of VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="90624w0008.htm_para8"><a name="090624125001497">Since 2006 all calls are routed through an initial triage service. The triage service diagnoses problems, assesses eligibility for legal aid and refers people onto alternative sources of help. This service costs approximately &#163;6 per call. Only those eligible for legal aid are then passed through to specialist advisors. These providers won competitive tenders to carry out telephone work and their average hourly rate is approximately &#163;46.</p>

 Figures in relation to the number of people eligible to vote in the <i> (a)</i> 2009 elections to the European Parliament and <i> (b)</i> 2005 general election are not available. This is because the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not hold data for the population eligible to vote in parliamentary elections, which includes British citizens resident overseas and excludes foreign citizens (from outside the British Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland) resident within England and Wales. Indeed, there is no central database that holds this information.</p>

This figure refers to the number of people who were registered in the UK to vote in the European election on 1 December 2008 and is based on a qualifying date of 15 October 2008. That was the most recent date for which data on the electorate are collated. The cut off date for registration, as enacted by the Electoral Administration Act 2006 is 11 days before the poll, so the actual number of people registered to vote in the 2009 European election may be different from this figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="90624w0010.htm_para1"><a name="090624125001827">ONS figures show that the number of people who were registered to vote in the UK parliamentary elections for Westminster on 1 December 2004 was 44,180,464. This figure is based on a qualifying date of 15 October 2004 and is the closest available approximation to the number of people who were registered to vote in the 2005 general election when registration closed some six to eight weeks before the poll.</p>

 In early 2008, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) commissioned site search agents to identify potential sites for &#147;Titan&#148; prisons in various parts of the country, including the North West.</p>

This site was identified on 13 May 2008 by our site search agents but was considered unsuitable by them, an assessment that was subsequently endorsed by NOMS on 16 May 2008. The reason for this was that a golf course in a rural location did not meet the specific requirement for a site close to an urban conurbation with good transport links.</p>

 The combined rate of all types of absence is not collected however the rate of absence resulting from ill-health (i.e. sickness absence) for South Yorkshire Probation Service staff in 2008-09 was 14.3 days per person. The total cost of sickness absence for South Yorkshire Probation Service, including on costs, for 2008-09 was &#163;1,026,760. In order to address this South Yorkshire Probation Service have launched a sickness absence action plan which has made a significant impact on the incidence of sickness absence.

 The Government believe that young people should only be sent to custody as a last resort. Young people aged 12-16 may be remanded to the care of a local authority with a requirement that they be accommodated in secure conditions. Boys aged 15 and 16 may be remanded to (prison) custody (in practice, a young offender institution) in certain circumstances. Young people aged 17 are treated, in legal terms, as adults, and may not be remanded to local authority care. (Again, they would be placed in an under-18 young offender institution.) Between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2009, the average length of a remand in custody episode was 40 days and the average length of a remand to the care of a local authority with a security requirement was 47 days.</p>

 The information in the following tables covers the period 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2009. It has been supplied by the Youth Justice Board from administrative systems. Section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 empowers a court to remand a young person aged 12 to 16 to the care of a local authority, with a requirement that he or she is kept in secure accommodation. In certain circumstances, 15 and 16-year-old boys may be remanded to prison custody. In legal terms, 17-year-olds are treated as adults for remand purposes, but would be accommodated in an under-18 young offender institution. 18-year-olds are accommodated in the young adult estate: the Youth Justice Board does not collect data in respect of them.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. These figures were taken from data available through DEFRA's Science Information DEFRA was formed in 2001 through the merging of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) with part of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). Consequently, comparable figures are only available from 2002 onwards.<br>
2. From 2008, responsibility for work on mitigating climate change was transferred to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Figures from 2008-9 onwards reflect this change.<br>
3. These figures relate to Research and Development directly managed by DEFRA. Other Government Departments and publicly funded bodies, such as the Research Councils, also fund research which has policy relevance to DEFRA. For instance DEFRA is a leading participant in the Living With Environmental Change programme which aims to fund &#163;1 billion of research between 2007-12 to provide the UK's decision makers with the best information to manage and protect vital ecosystem services in the most effective and practical ways.<br>

The Environment Agency has a duty to take action to reduce any negative impacts that are a direct result of a permitted activity.

 The question of whether any particular waste has been fully recovered and has ceased to be waste must be determined on the facts of the case and taking into account relevant case law on the definition of waste. The environment agency is responsible for the implementation of waste management controls in England and Wales. Schedule 1, part 2, section 1.1 of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 applies to fuel manufactured from waste regardless of whether the waste from which it has been manufactured has been fully recovered and has ceased to be waste. DEFRA has not issued guidance specifically advising on the question of whether fuel manufactured from used cooking oil requires a permit under this provision.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 June 2009]:</i> Tourism is the United Kingdom&#146;s fifth largest industry. It contributes over &#163;86 billion a year to the national economy and supports, both directly and indirectly, over 2.7 million jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="90624w0019.htm_para6"><a name="090624125004998">However, the number of overseas visitors to these shores has fallen this year compared with previous ones. But outbound visits by UK residents have also fallen, and these were 6 per cent. lower in January to February 2009 than they were in the same period last year. This offers a potentially good prospect for domestic tourism at a time when current projections show employment in the tourism and hospitality industry will grow by almost 10 per cent. by 2017, creating over 200,000 additional jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="90624w0019.htm_para7"><a name="090624125004999">Other opportunities the industry is well placed to exploit include: favourable currency exchange rates; the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games; the unprecedented number of high level sports events in the UK in the decade between 2009 and 2019; the Cultural Olympiad and, potentially, the UK City of Culture Competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"><a name="90624w0019.htm_para8"><a name="090624125005000">These opportunities, combined with the UK&#146;s enviable heritage and attractions, mean that the contribution that the tourism industry would make to the UK&#146;s economic recovery could be considerable.</p>

 The aim of Homeowners Mortgage Support is to prevent repossessions, where households suffer a temporary income shock.

 The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is the foundation for future peace and stability across Sudan. With only two years before the end of the interim period, we remain concerned at the number of outstanding CPA issues, including preparations for elections and referenda. We welcome the CPA conference in Washington on 23 June 2009 which will bring together both North and South and the international community to tackle these issues.</p>

There are major challenges which must be addressed, including ensuring necessary legislation, such as the security and press acts, is appropriate. The UK will be providing significant assistance and we are working with the Sudanese and the international community to ensure peaceful and credible elections are held.</p>

The referendum bill is currently being discussed in the Sudanese parliament. We urge both sides to reach agreement quickly on the bill to allow preparations for the referenda to begin.</p>

 The Government of Uganda and the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army (LRA) agreed a peace settlement, the Final Peace Agreement (FPA), in April 2008 after almost two years of negotiations mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan.

<i> [holding answer 17 June 2009]:</i> As set out by the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) acting chief executive, Geoff Russell, in his letter of 2 June, many more colleges have put forward a case for their projects to be considered as "shovel ready" than expected, and so unfortunately the LSC were not in a position to ask its June Council to approve individual projects.</p>

extra training in England for young people who have been unemployed for 12 months. As part of DCSF-funded activity, there will be &#163;655 million to support over 54,000 more young people to take up a guaranteed place at school or college. As part of Budget 2009, the Government committed to delivering an additional &#163;5 billion of efficiency savings in 2010-11. The then Secretary of State for DIUS wrote to the LSC on 7 May setting out expectations on the contribution to those efficiencies from post-19 further education provision. Taking into account these changes, the LSC will see an estimated overall increase in resources for frontline teaching, learning and learner support services for post-19 learners of around &#163;140 million between 2009-10 and 2010-11. We expect learners in North Yorkshire to benefit from these changes. Funding allocations for 2009-10 post-19 provision are currently being finalised and will be completed later this month.</p>

 Due a significant fall in demand, steel prices have dropped sharply from the peaks seen in the summer of 2008. Changes in prices are the natural consequence of market forces and as such it would not be right for the Government to interfere in the market in any way. However, if there was firm evidence that anti-competitive or unfair trade practices were the cause then we would press the European Commission to take action.</p>

 Students in Essex and elsewhere have already benefited from the increase in investment for further education of 53 per cent. in real terms since 1997. Recent changes which will affect LSC budgets were announced in Budget 2009. The Budget made available an additional &#163;300 million of further education capital spending and &#163;122 million to support extra training in England for young people who have been unemployed for 12 months. As part of DCSF-funded activity, there will be &#163;655 million to support over 54,000 more young people to take up a guaranteed place at school or college.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (1) pursuant to the answer of 12 June 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1067W, how many of the children who have gone missing from care have not been found; [281167]</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_10"><a name="09062510000252">(2) what steps the Government is taking to reduce the number of children who go missing from care homes. [281163]</p>

<p><a name="st_339"><a name="09062510000253"><a name="90624w0026.htm_spnew1"><a name="09062510000797"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 Following a consultation, the Government plan to publish revised statutory guidance about children missing from home or care shortly. This will set out the steps that must be followed whenever any child in care goes missing. This includes the local authority working with partner agencies such as the police, so that there is a systematic response whenever a child in care goes missing from their care placement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_603"><a name="90624w0026.htm_para1"><a name="09062510000254">The National Minimum Standards for Children&#146;s Homes and Fostering Services require that all homes and fostering services should have explicit procedures to follow when children in their care may be missing or absent. We will be strengthening these Standards later this year and will include more specific guidance on action which should be taken when a child goes missing from a residential or foster home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_604"><a name="90624w0026.htm_para2"><a name="09062510000255">The Government have also launched the Young Runaways Action Plan. This brings together cross Government action on children who run away from home or care and places particular emphasis on vulnerable children such as those who have been trafficked. More generally, a national indicator on young runaways, introduced in April this year, now requires LAs to have in place protocols for the inter-agency response to run-aways and missing children, including preventative measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_605"><a name="90624w0026.htm_para3"><a name="09062510000256">The requested information on the number of children who have gone missing from care who have not been found is not held centrally by the Department. It is not possible to derive the number of children missing from care who have never been found, because we can only account for the situation at the end of the last completed data collection year. Children missing at the end of the data year may subsequently return into care. Information on looked after children can be found in &#147;Statistical First Release Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2008&#148;, which is available on the Department&#146;s website via the following link:</p>

Furthermore, checks indicated that the completeness and quality of the data was not good enough for accurate analysis.</p>

In such circumstances, modern, high-quality temporary buildings provide a good environment for teaching and learning. Where they are new or relocated, they are required to meet building environmental standards similar to those which apply to permanent buildings.</p>

 The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) allows the holder to access treatment that becomes necessary during a visit to another European Economic Area member state, not in the home state itself. Therefore the sums paid by the United Kingdom to another member state in respect of the EHIC, relate to treatment provided in that member state, rather than by the national health service.</p>

<i> 1. Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> 2. Primary and secondary diagnoses</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> 3. Codes used to denote measles, mumps or rubella</i><br>
Measles B05.&#151;Measles<br>
Mumps B26.&#151;Mumps<br>
Rubella B06.&#151;Rubella [German measles], P35.0 Congenital rubella syndrome.<br>
If the patient has been admitted for treatment of measles, mumps or rubella, then the code for measles, mumps or rubella would be found in a primary position, except in the following cases:<br>
a. Measles, mumps or rubella complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium; in this case, one of the following codes would precede the code for measles, mumps or rubella:<br>
O35.3 Maternal care for (suspected) damage to fetus from viral disease in mother; and<br>
O98.5 Other viral diseases complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium.<br>
b. In the case where a baby is admitted due to measles, mumps or rubella acquired after birth but within 28 days of birth (perinatal period), a code from the following categories would precede the code for measles, mumps or rubella, which would be in a secondary position:<br>
P35-P39 Infections specific to the perinatal period.<br>
<i> 4. Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> 5. Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in national health service practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> 6. Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>

 The purpose of an NHS health check is to identify an individual's risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease, for this risk to be communicated in a way that the individual understands, and for that risk to be managed by appropriate follow-up. These diseases are all linked by a common set of modifiable risk factors. Obesity, physical inactivity, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels all raise the risk of vascular disease. While the NHS health check focuses on reducing these risk factors in order to reduce the risk of vascular disease, health professionals carrying out the checks will of course have the opportunity to identify people who are seriously underweight and will be able to exercise their clinical judgment in referring them for appropriate treatment or intervention.</p>

 The Government are committed to giving everyone the support they need to find employment as quickly as possible, whatever their age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para0"><a name="09062555001144">A major factor in the employment of older people is employer behaviour. In addition to providing generic good practice guidance to employers, the UK&#146;s Age Positive initiative is working in partnership with business leaders to develop sector-based models of flexible retirement to support the increased employment and retention of older workers and the removal of fixed retirement ages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_692"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para1"><a name="09062555001145">Our plans for the future include providing guidance to older workers on their options for working longer, encouraging employers to increase flexible work and phased retirement opportunities, and monitoring the impact of the economic downturn to identify which groups are being most affected and targeting further help where it is most needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para2"><a name="09062555001146">On the 6 April 2009, as part of the Government&#146;s response to the economic downturn, the Department for Work and Pensions put in place extra support for newly unemployed customers, including information and advice about the latest job search techniques and coaching on how to make the most of transferable skills. Extra help for those who have been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for six months was also introduced, including opportunities to volunteer, support to become self-employed, recruitment subsidies and work-focused training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_694"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para3"><a name="09062555001147">Since last autumn, the Department has also quadrupled the available funding for the rapid response service, which provides advice and support to customers facing redundancy. It has extended local employment partnerships, the adviser discretion fund and access to work so they are available to customers from the first day of their claim, alongside the support they receive from their Jobcentre Plus personal adviser.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_695"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para4"><a name="09062555001148">The introduction of the flexible new deal across phase 1 areas from October 2010 will give providers the freedom to offer personalised, tailored support to everyone who has been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for 12 months, helping them overcome their individual barriers to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_696"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para5"><a name="09062555001149">This will be available to jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers of all ages to ensure that everyone has the best possible chance of finding work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_697"><a name="90624w0036.htm_para6"><a name="09062555001150">In addition, the budget announced the future jobs fund and young persons guarantee.

 I welcome the progress is being made on the development of the internal energy market, especially the recent agreement of texts for the third liberalisation package. This legislation will come into force early in 2011 and will benefit consumers through the development of more competition, especially between member states, and by enhancing security of supply. In order to improve the operation of the market, the UK is encouraging member states to implement early and on a voluntary basis those elements of the package related to transparency and co-operation between national regulators and system operators.</p>
