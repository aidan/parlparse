Period life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average number of
years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the
area&#146;s age-specific mortality rates for that time period
throughout his or her
life.</p><p><a name="0611133000002">The figure
reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period,
rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not
therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time
period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of
the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those
born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their
lives.</p><p><a name="0611133000003"><sup>(2)</sup>
Using boundaries as of 2005 and population estimates based on the 2001
Census for all the years
shown.</p><sup>(3)</sup> Five year
averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and experimental
ward population estimates based on the 2001
Census.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an
estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure.
Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to
random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval
around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot
say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between
the two
figures.<br><sup>(5)</sup>
The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as
nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life
expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation
of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the male
population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such
establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and
Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six
groups which are numbered from 0 to
5.<br>&#145;0&#146;
means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care
communal
establishments.<br>&#145;1&#146;
means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such
establishments was in the lowest fifth of all
wards.<br>&#145;5&#146;
means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such
establishments was in the highest fifth of all
wards.<br></td></tr></table><br>

Period life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average number of
years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the
area&#146;s age-specific mortality rates for that time period
throughout his or her life. The figure reflects mortality among those
living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among
those born in each area.<br>
It is not therefore the number of years
a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to
live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in
the future and because many of those born in the area will live
elsewhere for at least some part of their
lives.<br><sup>(2)</sup>
Using boundaries as of 2005 and population estimates based on the 2001
Census for all the years
shown.<br><sup>(3)</sup> Five
year averages, based on deaths registered in each year, and
experimental ward population estimates based on the 2001
Census.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an
estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure.
Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to
random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval
around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot
say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between
the two
figures.<br><sup>(5)</sup>
The presence of medical and care communal establishments, such as
nursing homes and hospices, can artificially depress the average life
expectancy of the ward in which they are located. To aid interpretation
of the figures, this indicator shows the proportion of the female
population of each ward, aged 65 and over, who were resident in such
establishments in 2001. For this purpose, all wards in England and
Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six
groups which are numbered from 0 to
5.<br>&#145;0&#146;
means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care
communal
establishments.<br>&#145;1&#146;
means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such
establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards
...<br>&#145;5&#146;
means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such
establishments was in the highest fifth of all
wards.<br></td></tr></table><br><a name="subhd_88"><a name="61108w0008.htm_sbhd0"><a name="0611132000012"><h3 align="center">National

earlier version of the RG-31. In response to an operational requirement
for a vehicle protected against blast and explosively formed projectile
attack from below and small arms, fragmentation and some blast from the
side 14 second hand Mamba vehicles were bought in three batches through
the Urgent Operational Requirements process between 1996-99. Six were
bought in 1996 for the NATO Implementation Force mission in Bosnia;
three were procured in 1999 for operations in Macedonia; and a further
five were bought later in 1999 for operations in Kosovo. The approval
cost of the first six was around &#163;1.2 million and the second and
third batches cost &#163;l million and &#163;2.3 million
respectively. They were used by specialist teams for explosive ordnance
disposal tasks such as reconnaissance, rescue and recovery and route
proving and were deployed in the Balkans until
2003.</p><p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="61108w0009.htm_para4"><a name="0611131001375">The Mamba vehicle
was delivered to the Ministry of Defence following modification of the
base vehicle by the contractor, Alvis with the addition of
appliqu&#233; belly armour to withstand attack by shaped-charge
mines. This modification was included in the purchase cost. The extra
weight of the appliqu&#233; armour was found to overload the Mambas
and caused reliability and safety problems. The high level of
maintenance required to keep the vehicles operational was exacerbated
by a lack of commonality between the individual vehicles and poor
availability of spares. In May 2001, due to road safety issues, their
use was restricted to operational situations where there was a
significant threat of minestrikes. Since the current version of the
RG-31 is not in service with the UK armed forces we cannot comment on
its ease of maintenance or
reliability.</p><p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="61108w0009.htm_para5"><a name="0611131001376">The MOD
considered modifying and refurbishing the vehicles but replacement with
a new vehicle was identified as the better option. As a result the
vehicles were disposed of in 2004 for a total of &#163;448k. Nine
were sold to Estonia, four to a US company and one to a company based
in Singapore.</p>

readily available and could be produced only at a disproportionate
cost. While fishing vessel licences themselves carry unique identifying
numbers, the individual owners recorded on the system against each
licence are not themselves uniquely identified. The information on
owners is recorded in a single field which can be a mix of names of
companies and individuals, of Christian names and surnames, and of
initials and full names. There are also frequently several owners
associated with each licence. Fishermen also often register vessels and
licences against different members of their family. All of these
differences can be seen and the applications themselves can be
perfectly valid, with each application being checked in its own right
before a fishing vessel licence is issued. However, these factors
together make it very difficult to work out the full extent of the
licences held by any given individual at any one time (and thus make it
difficult to accurately identify new individuals entering fishing).

their willingness to consider the idea of their making a goodwill

came into the view that there were serious practical difficulties in
the way of their organizing a workable and timely form of assistance.

three-year Corporate Plan on an annual basis to inform the Mayor of
London&#146;s consolidated budget setting process for the Greater
London Authority. The higher cost of producing the LDA&#146;s plan is
due to a number of factors. These include the cost of outsourcing to a
production company rather than in-house production, higher costs of
production in London, improving its accessibility to those with
disabilities, accommodating extra input from the Mayor&#146;s office,
and producing hard copies rather than website versions

problem of spam. We introduced statutory controls on spam through the
Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003,
which were implemented on 11 December 2003. The regulations provide a
first line of defence against spam where the recipient has no knowledge
of the advertiser or the products being marketed. The regulations
require that unsolicited spam must not be sent to an individual
subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is
a previous relationship between the parties. The regulations can be
enforced against an offending company or individual anywhere in the

(EU).</p><p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="61108w0021.htm_para5"><a name="0611131002523">The Government
recognise the source of the problem is often outside UK and EU borders
and has therefore promoted international co-operation initiatives such
as the London Action Plan on international spam enforcement
co-operation. Additionally on 2 July 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding
was agreed between the United Kingdom, United States and Australia,
which aims to reduce further the problem by committing enforcement
authorities, which for the UK is the Information Commissioner's Office
and the Office of Fair Trading, to work together to investigate those
sending spam.</p><p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="61108w0021.htm_para6"><a name="0611131002524">The

taking action to prevent being a target for those sending spam, as well
as action to filter spam. Information has been made available to the
public and to business by my Department, the Information Commissioner's
Office, the Office of Fair Trading as well as a number of sites
provided by service and software providers. These messages have been
reinforced by the Get Safe Online initiative that started in 2005 and
held a successful internet security awareness week from 9 October this

The expanded coverage of notifiable offences in 1998-99 means that
detection rates are not comparable with earlier years, with this change
thought to have had an effect in increasing detection rates overall,
but reducing detection rates for
violence.<br>2. Changes in
guidance on counting detections were also introduced in April 1999,
which is believed to have had an effect in reducing detection rates
again making rates not comparable with previous
years.<br>3. The National
Crime Recording Standard in 2002-03 increased levels of recording of
crime and it is thought to have reduced detection
levels.<br>4. Rates quoted
here relate to all detections, including non-judicial
&#145;non-sanction&#146; detections. Numbers of non-sanction
detections have been found to vary widely between forces with some
forces now recording very few non-sanction detections, reflecting an
increasing emphasis by forces on securing sanction

the hon. Gentleman to my answer of 24 October 2006, <i> Official
Report</i>, column 1813. Subject to the usual pattern of staff
turnover, all prisons will employ a chaplain who undertakes the
co-ordinating role. The position is broadly similar in contracted out
prisons although titles, pay scales and roles may differ slightly.
There is no central record of when each co-ordinating chaplain was
appointed to the role. Of those currently in the role in the public
sector prisons, 101 are in chaplain pay band one, three in chaplain pay
band two, and 12 remain in the former grade of chaplain. A small number
of Co-ordinating chaplain roles will be vacant, or filled on a
temporary basis, and some operating with multiple sites. Whilst this
information is derived from the payroll and personnel databases it is
liable to the usual inaccuracies expected in any large scale reporting
system.</p><a name="qn_605"><a name="61108w0041.htm_wqn2"><p><a name="0611134002074"><b><a name="61108w0041.htm_spnew4"><a name="0611134013732">Mr.

public protection (IPP). Offenders serving an EPP can be considered for

under the provisions of the previous legislation (Criminal Justice Act
1991). Those sentenced to a determinate prison sentence of four years
or more are eligible for parole at the half way point of their sentence
and will be released only if the Parole Board considers that safe. If
not released at this point, they must be released at the two thirds
point of their sentence and remain on licence until the three quarter
point. They remain at risk of recall if they commit a further
imprisonable offence during the remainder of the
sentence.</p><p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="61108w0042.htm_para2"><a name="0611134002186">Under the

risk of harm to others after release from a determinate sentence
undergo a more comprehensive risk assessment and more robust risk
management planning and implementation. MAPPA allow relevant offenders
to be identified, information to be shared and risk assessments and
action plans to be agreed. Work within MAPPA may result in, for
example, increased police monitoring, special provision for victim
protection, the provision of information to employers, providers of
children's services, close supervision and appropriate accommodation.
All sex and other violent offenders are liable to be monitored and the
level of supervision will depend upon the assessed level of risk posed
by the offender, following the principle that resources follow

were ineligible for EMA unless they were resident in a former EMA pilot

it shows that a small number of 16 and 17 year old learners in
non-pilot areas claimed EMA during the first year of national roll out,
this is because the learner would have originally been resident in a

eligibility for EMA with them until the end of that EMA

Learning and Skills Council (LSC) agrees plans with most further
education (FE) colleges which they guarantee to fund. The guarantee
that college plans will be fully funded has been widely welcomed by the
sector as ensuring stability and providing confidence for colleges to
make commitments for the year based on assured levels of funding. The
guarantee means that colleges recruiting above agreed plans cannot
expect to receive additional funding above the level agreed with the
LSC. However, there is an expectation that where colleges have
delivered higher volumes in priority areas then this should be
reflected in their planning for the following year.</p><p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="61108w0045.htm_para2"><a name="0611134004353">It is only possible to determine
the amount of learning delivered above agreed planned levels following
detailed analysis of the actual level of delivery in the academic year
compared to the agreed planned levels. For 2005/06 the LSC estimate
that colleges delivered 12,494 full-time equivalent (FTE) 16 to 19
learners above the planned levels agreed with local LSCs. Mark Haysom
the LSC's chief executive, will write to you with the further details
you require for each local LSC area and college.</p><p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="61108w0045.htm_para3"><a name="0611134004354">As part of its Agenda for Change

this year by my Department and Ofsted. It will provide a wide range of

phased basis. Schools can currently access analyses of their 2005 data.
Analyses of 2006 results are planned to be available in early December
for primary schools, late December for GCSE results and January for key
stage 3 results. The complexity of the system led to some delays in

The new NHS dental contract arrangements were introduced on 1 April
2006. Work force numbers under the new contractual arrangements are not
comparable with numbers under the old contract as the numbers of
dentists are now counted differently based on a contract between the
provider and the
PCT.<br><i> Notes</i>:<br>1.Under
the new contract, the numbers of dentists provided are performers and
are defined as a dentist who has been set up on the dental practice
division (DPD) payments online (POL) system by the PCT to work under an
open contract as at 30 June 2006. The number provided is a count of
individuals listed as performers on open
contracts.<br>2. Under the
new contract arrangements PCTs agree with providers a specified annual
level of NHS dental treatment (UDAs). The provider is committed under
the contract to providing this level of service&#151;he or she may do
this personally or through other dentists he or she employs (they must
however be listed within the PCT contract as potential performers of
NHS services).<br>3. Most
NHS dentists do some private work. Figures provided do not take into
account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by
dentists.<br>4. A dentist
may have an open contract with more than one PCT, in which case they
will appear in figures for each PCT with which they hold an open
contract.<br>5. Figures for
the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the
date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS BSA may be
notified of joiners or leavers to or from the general dental services
or personal dental services up to several months, or more, after the
move has taken place. Information is up to date as at 16 October
2006.<br>6. Hospital and
community dental services or services provided privately have been
excluded from the
numbers.<br>7. Further
information is available in reports published by The Information Centre
for health and social
care:<br>Information on the
new contract (quarter 1, June 2006) is available at
www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/dentalstatsq2o6.<br>Historical

The postcode of the dental practice was used to allocate dentists to
specific geographic areas. PCT and SHA areas have been defined using
the Office for National Statistics All Fields Postcode
Directory.<br>2. Dentists consist of
principals, assistant and trainees. Information on NHS dentistry in the
community dental service, in hospitals and in prisons are
excluded.<br>3. The data in this report
are based on NHS dentists on PCT lists. These details were passed on to
the BSA who paid dentists based on activity undertaken. A dentist can
provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has
agreed with the PCT. In some cases an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT
list but not perform any NHS work in that period. Most NHS dentists do
some private work. The data do not take into account the proportion of
NHS work undertaken by dentists.<br>4.
Population estimates are not available at PCT and SHA level prior to
2001.<br>5. PDS schemes had varying
registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS
data, PDS registrations are estimated using &#147;proxy
registrations&#148;, namely the number of patients seen by PDS
practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations were not
estimated for periods before September 2003&#151;actual registrations
were used before this date.<br>6. Data for
2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any
registrations (eg dental access centres), and is therefore not directly
comparable with later data.<br>7. 2005 and
2006 data have been estimated using Office for National Statistics 2004
mid-year population estimates based on the 2001 census as these are the
latest available.<br>8. The boundaries
used are as at 31 March
2006.<br><i> Sources:</i><br>1.

below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous
state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example,
adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled
patients and staff. Failure to comply with the Disability
Discrimination Act requirements is a common reason for PCTs judging
buildings as not meeting minimum
requirements.</p><p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="61108w0059.htm_para8"><a name="0611141000891">This is
not because of a lack of intent by GPs&#146; practices and their PCTs

city PCTs that predate this Government that arose from investment in

guidelines, including National Service Frameworks (NSFs) and guidance
from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).
NICE have estimated that full implementation of the guideline on
incontinence will save about &#163;3 million a year nationally, or
about &#163;46,000 a year for a primary care trust serving a

continence services, which will form part of a high-level report to the
Secretary of State in 2007 on developing services for older people with

Older People&#146;s Specialist Forum comprising national leaders from

under the national programme by 2010. Clearly systems will need to be
upgraded in the light of new technology and new National Health Service
requirements beyond that date. The approach, in line with best
practice, is to implement new services incrementally, avoiding big-bang
approach, and providing increasingly richer functionality over time.

programme amounts to 6.2 billion over 10 years, and this has not
increased.<br></td></tr></table><br>

Flint:</b> We are not aware of any trust having opted out of
the national programme for information technology (NPfIT). Directions
issued to national health service chief executives in September 2003
made strategic health authorities responsible for ensuring that all
individual NHS organisations meet the reasonable expectations required
of them under the programme&#146;s centrally-negotiated contracts.
This requirement to participate in NPfIT and to achieve technical and
functional compliance with the hardware and software provided under the
programme was reinforced by guidance issued to NHS foundation trusts by
Monitor in April 2006. Systems deployed under the national programme
are already in place in every acute trust, and in some 98 per cent. of
general practices.</p><p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="61108w0064.htm_para16"><a name="0611141001682">In
January 2005 Wirral NHS Trust was in the position of needing to replace
its hospital patient administration system (PAS) before an equivalent
system was available from the local clusters LSP. Having initially
identified a potential alternative commercial provider, the trust
subsequently took the decision to opt for a solution developed by the
Cerner Corporation for the southern cluster in order to deliver its
specific functionality requirements from
2007.</p><p><a name="stpa_524"><a name="61108w0064.htm_para17"><a name="0611141001683">Similarly,
earlier this year, open invitations to tender were placed for a new PAS
by Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS trust, and for a PAS and a number of
other clinical systems by Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS trust.
Bradford&#146;s need was to ensure that a contingency option was
available to replace a current contract, due to expire in March 2007,
should the NPfIT PAS not be deployed before that date. In the event the
local service provider (LSP) is working closely with the trust to
ensure a programme-delivered solution is available before the end of
March 2007. In Newcastle, discussion is ongoing between the LSP and the
trust about how the suite of products available under the programme can
best fit the trust&#146;s business needs, and on issues of timing.
However, the intention of the trust to participate fully in the
National Programme is not in

in September 2003, the University College London Hospitals NHS trust
placed a contract for, and subsequently took delivery of, a PAS before
the contract for the local service provider for the London cluster had
been signed. The contract was placed against a very pressing timescale
informed by the commissioning of the new University College hospital,
and included other necessary IT infrastructure. Again, the intention of
the trust to participate fully in the National Programme is not in

Flint:</b> The main purpose of notification is to enable a
local authority to consider whether there is a need for it to use its
control powers to prevent further spread of the disease. However, it is
not necessary for a disease to be notifiable in order for the authority
to have control powers relating to it. (For example, the powers in
section 31 of the Act for a local authority to disinfect premises are
available in relation to any infectious disease). Notification
contributes to the gathering of information about disease incidence and
prevalence (disease &#147;surveillance&#148;), but there are also
other ways of achieving
this.</p><p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="61108w0067.htm_para1"><a name="0611141001999">Currently,
section 10 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 provides
that cholera, plague, relapsing fever, smallpox and typhus are
notifiable diseases. Section 11 of the Act provides that if a
registered medical practitioner becomes aware, or suspects, that a
patient whom he is attending is suffering from a notifiable disease or
from food poisoning he shall send to the proper officer of the relevant
local authority a certificate giving details of the patient and the
disease. The Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988 apply
the notification requirement in section 11 of the Act to certain other
infectious diseases (namely acute encephalitis, acute poliomyelitis,
anthrax, diphtheria, dysentery (amoebic or bacillary), leprosy,
leptospirosis, malaria, measles, meningitis, meningococcal septicaemia
(without meningitis), mumps, ophthalmia neonatorum, paratyphoid fever,
rabies, rubella, scarlet fever, tetanus, tuberculosis (where the
opinion of the registered medical practitioner that the person is
suffering from tuberculosis is formed from evidence not solely derived

encourages the voluntary initiatives some businesses have undertaken to
remove or eliminate the use of hydrogenated vegetable oils (which
contain trans fats) in their food products. However, any product
reformulation to reduce or remove hydrogenated vegetable oils should
not result in a rise in saturated fats. Although dietary intakes of
trans fats are well within maximum recommended intakes, saturated fat
intakes currently exceed public health recommendations, consequently
saturated fat reduction remains the FSA's
