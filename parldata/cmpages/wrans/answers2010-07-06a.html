 Carnegie UK Trust was awarded funding through the Empowerment Fund in 2009 to support community engagement in planning matters. Their bid focused on their work facilitating Community Land Trusts (CLTs). As part of their work, the trust has established the National Community Land Trust Network, which will be hosted by the National Housing Federation (NHF) with a grant of £100,000 over two years. The NHF will complement this funding with financial and in-kind support. One member of staff will be employed by the Network, which will provide high quality legal, financial and development advice to CLTs. Key to its work will be to ensure experience and good practice is shared to assist communities to deliver more affordable housing, workspaces and community facilities using this model.</p>

<i> [holding answer 1 July 2010]:</i> All woodland is protected in accordance with the felling regulations under the Forestry Act 1967 (as amended). Any felling carried out without a licence is an offence, unless it is covered by one of the exemptions specified in the legislation. Under the Forestry Act, the Forestry Commission usually attaches conditions to a felling licence in order to secure replanting of any area felled.</p>

The Forestry Commission has responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber and is empowered to make orders to prevent the introduction and spread of tree pests and diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="100706w0001.htm_para15"><a name="10070644000146">Other measures to protect woodland, such as tree preservation orders, are available to local authorities in the west midlands and throughout England.</p>

An initial assessment of the potential effectiveness of the boiler scrappage scheme indicated that the efficiency improvement from replacement of "G-rated" gas boilers with "A-rated" boilers was over 20%. Replacing a "G-rated" boiler with an "A-rated" boiler is calculated to save at least one tonne of CO2 per boiler per annum in an average home.

 The Climate Change Act 2008 sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 (both from the 1990 baseline). The first three carbon budgets, running from 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022, are set in line with the 34% target. This is based on an EU-wide emissions reduction of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. We are pushing to secure early EU agreement to move to a more ambitious emissions reduction target of 30% below 1990 levels by 2020. When this has been agreed, and the methodology for sharing the effort between EU member states has been decided, the UK will move to a more ambitious 2020 target, following advice from the Committee on Climate Change and taking into account the views of the Devolved Administrations.</p>

 The UK operates strict controls to protect the natural environment, and any planning application for a wind farm which is likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of factors such as size, nature or location is subject to environmental impact assessment. Statutory nature conservation bodies are consulted upon the scope and outcomes of the environmental impact assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="100706w0001.htm_para33"><a name="10070652000076">Local and national planning authorities can and do refuse planning permission for proposed wind farms where there are likely to be significant impacts on local wildlife populations which cannot be acceptably mitigated. Where appropriate, conditions can be placed on a wind farm to ensure that any impacts on local wildlife populations are minimised, avoided or compensated. This may include post development monitoring of wildlife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="100706w0001.htm_para34"><a name="10070652000077">The wildlife impacts of offshore windfarms are also looked at strategically as part of DECC's offshore energy strategic environmental assessment process. The most recent 2009 report concluded that up to 33GW of offshore wind could be installed without unacceptable environmental consequences, providing that suitable mitigation measures are incorporated on a site by site basis.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 June 2010]:</i> The operational allowance, currently estimated to be a total of £114 million in 2010-11, is drawn equally from the Government Reserve and the core defence budget. This reflects the priority that this Government places on both supporting our armed forces on operations and putting the military covenant on a proper footing. The contribution made from the defence budget also acknowledges that, although total Defence expenditure has been protected in 2010-11, it is vital that all departments prioritise resources to the front line, and assist in the key task of reducing the debt inherited by the new Government.</p>

 The allocation of an additional £67 million to support the campaign to counter the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threat in Afghanistan will result in a significant increase in the number of Counter-IED teams in theatre. The additional capabilities they will be provided with, including protected vehicles and remote control vehicles, will increase the protection available to our armed forces, and will enhance their ability to defeat these devices. In this way, the additional capabilities will contribute significantly to the safety not only of our armed forces and our allies but also members of the Afghanistan National Security Forces and the local population, who are also victims of the indiscriminate use of IEDs.</p>

 While the proposed closure of Tower Bridge magistrates court forms part of the current consultation exercise, it has been under consideration for several years as part of HMCS London Region's aspiration to improve magistrates court facilities and services across central and south London. The strategy that has been developed envisages the replacement of a number of old, inefficient courthouses with three larger, more modern and operationally efficient courthouses. The first of these, the new Westminster magistrates court in Marylebone, is due to open next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="100706w0002.htm_para13"><a name="10070657000313">Within this overall strategy, the plan for Camberwell Green is to redevelop the site to construct five additional courtrooms. This plan has not been designed solely to facilitate the closure of Tower Bridge magistrates court, although expansion would allow closure and disposal of the freehold courthouse. The key driver is to enable HMCS to improve and modernise the facilities available to court users and generate greater listing flexibility. The operationally-preferred option also creates further capacity for international jurisdiction work in response to significant workload growth in this area of business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"><a name="100706w0002.htm_para14"><a name="10070657000314">Indicative costings only exist at present; depending on the expansion option chosen, total works costs range between £9.3 million-£11.5 million. Inevitably the scheme and any consequential closure would only progress once funding becomes available. This will be determined as part of Spending Review deliberations later this year.</p>

 The prison and probation services operate within the framework of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Agency. For historical reasons the two services have different employment structures. Prison service staff are civil servants and are directly employed by the NOMS Agency. Probation service staff are not civil servants and are employed by a probation trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="100706w0002.htm_para15"><a name="10070657000317">Information on the career histories of senior managers within NOMS does not include National Probation Service experience. It is therefore not possible, without individually contacting all senior managers, to determine how many have worked in the Probation Service. Probation Service experience is provided by staff on secondment from probation trusts although the number of such staff across NOMS is not recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="100706w0002.htm_para16"><a name="10070657000318">Previous experience within Prison Service establishments is recorded. Of the 898 senior managers working in NOMS who are civil servants, 281 (31%) are currently based in prisons, 216 (24%) are currently based in headquarters but have previously served in prison establishments and 401 (45%) have no record of prison experience.

The NHS Information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. The A&amp;E HES publications address some of the key data quality and coverage issues.

This arrangement has been in place and meeting the requirements of the organisations concerned since 2004. There have been no discussions with Interpol regarding the sharing of information on lost and stolen passports with private businesses. However, since 2006 IPS has provided a Passport Validation Service (PVS) to a number of United Kingdom based accredited financial and legal services. The service allows these accredited financial and legal services to check the validity of UK passports presented to them by customers directly against IPS records. The accredited private sector organisations using the PVS service do so via a call centre, providing the PVS with details of the passport in their possession and PVS will confirm the validity of the passport or otherwise. If the passport presented is shown on IPS records as lost or stolen the organisation is informed that the passport is invalid.

 Work is the best and most sustainable route out of poverty. The aim of the new work programme is to support individuals to maximise employment opportunities. For those unable to work, the benefit system currently targets extra resources on those who are in greatest disadvantage. The system will continue to provide additional support for those in need, but in future the Government will work to ensure the benefit system also helps to tackle the root causes of poverty, reducing welfare dependency and promoting social justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="100706w0003.htm_para64"><a name="10070668000120">The main elements of the employment and support allowance (ESA) are the personal allowances, the work-related activity or support components and flat rate premiums for groups recognised as having other special needs e.g. carers, severely disabled people and people aged over 60. This structure enables the Government to focus help most effectively on those groups who have the greatest needs. In particular, people who are placed in the support group qualify for the enhanced disability premium automatically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_555"><a name="100706w0003.htm_para65"><a name="10070668000121">The benefit rates do not directly reflect, nor are they made up of, specific items of household and other expenditure. Instead the rates are intended to cover overall household expenditure and normal day to day living expenses taken as a whole. Benefit rates are reviewed annually and a number of factors are taken into account during the review, the most important of which is the level of inflation. We have decided that in future ESA will be increased using the Consumer Price Index which we believe is the most suitable measure of inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_556"><a name="100706w0003.htm_para66"><a name="10070668000122">In many cases the basic rate of ESA is just one element of the total package of support that a person or household receives.

 UK seafarers who work on British vessels pay class 1 national insurance on their earnings. Class 1 national insurance is also payable when UK seafarers work on board certain foreign vessels. Therefore, UK seafarers working in international waters have the same pension provision as other employees in the UK if they are liable to pay class 1 national insurance contributions. Any UK seafarer who works on a foreign vessel in circumstances where class 1 national insurance is not due, is usually able to pay voluntary class 2 or 3 national insurance contributions to provide cover for basic state pension.</p>

 The Work Capability Assessment was developed in consultation with medical and other experts alongside specialist disability groups such as Mind. The scoring system is much fairer and simpler, removing a potential bias in the Personal Capability Assessment against people with mental health conditions, as opposed to limitation of physical function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="100706w0004.htm_para20"><a name="10070668000297">The Department undertook an internal review of the Work Capability Assessment which was published on 29 March 2010. The review found that generally the assessment accurately identifies individuals for benefit. The review made a number of recommendations for improving the Work Capability Assessment. We announced on 29 June that we will be implementing those recommendations. Additionally, the Government also have a statutory commitment to arrange an independent review of the main elements of the Work Capability Assessment every year for the first five years of operation. This review will look at the Work Capability Assessment in operation and is distinct from the department-led review which focussed on the technical accuracy of the assessment and whether it could better account for how individuals adapt to their condition. The review, announced on the 29 June, will be conducted by Professor Malcolm Harrington, acting as lead reviewer.</p>

People in the Support Group of Employment and Support Allowance are not required to under take work focused activity and also receive a higher rate of benefit.</p>

 Business support funded by the public sector is designed to address gaps in private provision, which lead to many businesses making sub-optimal use of external advice and guidance. The 2007 economic impact evaluation of Business Link regional services found that within a year of assisting businesses the additional growth generated amounted to £2.26 of additional value for every £1 spent on the service. The web and advisor service have also been identified as creating significant benefits to businesses through hours saved and reduced cost of regulation compliance.</p>

 The Trade and Sustainable Development chapter of the agreement incorporates a clause committing each party to establish a Council on Trade and Sustainable Development. The Council shall consist of representatives responsible for labour, environmental and trade matters who will meet within the first year following the entry into force of the agreement and thereafter as necessary. The Council will have a duty to identify actions for achievement of the objectives of the agreement and to identify recommendations for good implementation. Once a year the Council will meet with civil society organisations and the public to carry out discussions related to the implementation of this chapter.</p>

 The European Commission has undertaken extensive analysis of the EU-Andean (Peru and Colombia) Free Trade Agreement, which is in the public domain. The latest report, dating from July 2009 prior to conclusion of negotiations, states that increased market access for processed timber products can be expected to add to existing deforestation trends, and illegal logging is a significant contributor to this problem. The Sustainable Development chapter of the agreement contains provisions to counter this, aiming to improve forest law enforcement and governance, and promote trade in legal and sustainable forest products.</p>
