 The Road Safety Act 2006 increased the penalty for using a hand-held mobile phone while driving to three penalty points and discretionary disqualification on top of the existing fine of up to &#163;1,000 (&#163;2,500 in the case of the driver of a goods vehicle or a bus/coach). If a fixed penalty is accepted the penalty is three points and a &#163;60 fine. The new penalty came into effect on 27 February 2007. If the police see poor driving and find a driver distracted  by a call on a hands-free mobile phone, then they can prosecute the offence of not being in a position to have proper control of a vehicle. The same penalties apply. The police have stepped up their enforcement of  these offences.</p>

Official aid (OA) has the same concessional and qualitative features as ODA but covers aid to countries on Part 2 of the DAC list of recipients.

 The World Bank's fiscal year runs from 1 July to 30 June each year. For fiscal year 2004 (starting 1 July 2003) the Bank lent $1.05 billion for energy projects. This amount increased to $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2005 and $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2006. Figures are not yet available for Fiscal Year 2007.</p>

Annual payments from the UK and other bank shareholders are just one source of finance drawn upon by the bank to provide loans and credits to developing countries. Therefore, it is not possible to say precisely what proportion of the UK's contribution was spent on energy programmes, but it is highly likely that some of it was allocated to the energy sector.</p>

While the Act does not formally apply on the parliamentary estate, the Commission, on the advice of the Administration Committee, has decided that the House should comply with the principles of the legislation, as it is not desirable that those who work on or visit the parliamentary estate should be treated differently in this respect than in other workplaces and public places. The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting. It is therefore desirable to make reasonable provision for those who wish to smoke to do so, provided that the health and safety of other users of the estate is not adversely affected.</p>

From that date smoking will, however, be permitted in four designated external areas: the Terrace, Commons Court (North West corner), North Terrace (between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South), and in a designated area on the west side of Canon Row courtyard. Cigarette receptacles will be provided in these areas. &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs will be displayed at entrances to the buildings.

The Government recognise Channel 4 is likely to face financial pressures in the future that may have implications for its ability to deliver fully its public service remit.

 On 8 November 2005, Ofcom published research by the Generics Group which examined the cost and power consumption implications of digital switchover for UK households. The report estimates that for those households that incur a cost as a result of switchover, the actual cost will depend on the equipment requiring conversion and the level of voluntary conversion carried out before switchover. Typical non-voluntary costs for TV and recorders in households containing an average collection of reception equipment are therefore estimated to range from &#163;26 to &#163;153.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 4 June 2007]:</i><i> </i>The compensation threshold for &#147;hearing loss due to service&#148; applies only to bilateral noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss. It does not apply to other forms of hearing loss or injury, such as that caused by blast. The 50 dB threshold was introduced into the war pensions scheme in 1993 as part of a package of changes which focused benefits on the more severely disabled and is also common to the related Civilian Industrial Injuries Disablement Scheme. The same threshold is used for compensating for this condition in the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, which also focuses on the more severely injured.   <br>

This approach is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts. There are no plans to review the threshold, although we remain open to consider new evidence that may arise.</p>

 The Inspection Team put 46 soldiers (11 per cent.) through their annual personal weapons test over the two days of the inspection, without prior notice and without the individual soldiers having a chance to practise. The team had no exact UK figures as comparators but used its collective military judgment and experience as the basis of their comment: &#147;Although low, this pass rate is consistent with other part time organizations in the UK&#148;. The team had some experience of serving with the TA and with the Home Service Part-Time element of the Royal Irish Regiment (and Ulster Defence Regiment before) as well as considerable experience with regular soldiers. It felt that a 70 per cent. &#147;first time&#148; pass rate was probably comparable to (but not quite as good as) that likely to be achieved by part-time British soldiers faced with an equivalent unrehearsed, no-notice test.

 The main mechanism for reducing the cost of microgeneration equipment for households is through the Low Carbon Buildings Phase 1 capital grant programme. The 2007 Budget announced a further &#163;6 million to be added to the householder stream of this programme, bringing the total available to approximately &#163;18.7 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70611w0010.htm_para8"><a name="07061182000668">We have also introduced legislation to make it easier for microgenerators to gain access to the monetary benefits of Renewable Obligation Certificates. And we are continuing to work with larger energy suppliers to ensure transparency of prices offered for exported electricity from microgenerators and to make technical changes that would help suppliers to cut administration costs and make it more cost-effective to offer  export tariffs.</p>

schools and local authorities about 47 open academies; 25 academy projects in their implementation phase; and 68 projects where the Secretary of State has agreed a formal expression of interest with a sponsor for an academy project.</p>

 The general policy is for academies to be post-16 providers in their own right to address low participation rates by adding to the diversity and quality of local provision. Where an academy proposal does not include post-16 provision, the Government would need to be assured that arrangements for post-16 students leaving the academy are comparable to those which could be provided by the academy itself. If, during the course of the consultation process that all academy projects are subject to, convincing arguments were put forward as to why the community would benefit more from an 11 to 16 than an 11 to 18 academy, this would of course be taken into account on a case by case basis.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 June 2007]:</i> 49.4 per cent. of pupils in academies achieved five or more A*-C passes at GCSE or equivalent in 2005/06. This percentage is based on number of pupils on roll at the end of Key Stage 4 in the 2005/06 academic year and includes attempts and achievements by these pupils in previous academic years.

 Sponsors come from a wide range of backgrounds, including universities, educational foundations, businesses, individuals and faith communities.

 The Department for Education and Skills currently funds, through the Training and Development Agency for Schools, the Student Associates Scheme. The scheme's twin aims are to encourage undergraduates into teacher training and to use the undergraduates as role models for school pupils with a view to increasing participation into higher education. Undergraduates spend up to 15 days in a school working with individual pupils, groups and whole classes. The majority of placements are in secondary priority shortage subjects. In the academic year 2006/07, we expect that, of a total of 7,955 potential allocated places, approximately 1,390 will be mathematics placements. Provisional allocations for the academic year 2007/08 suggest that the mathematics figure will arise to around 1,415.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 June]:</i> The Department has not produced any estimate of the number of further education institutions that are likely to be granted foundation degree-awarding powers under proposals in the Further Education and Training Bill. However, it is likely that only a small number, mostly from the mixed economy group of colleges which currently provide 14 per cent. of all foundation degree provision, will be able to satisfy the criteria necessary to be awarded foundation degree-awarding powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="70611w0015.htm_para5"><a name="07061182001541">Guidance issued to applicants will specify that an institution will be expected to have at least four years' experience, immediately prior to the year of application, of delivering higher education programmes at a level equivalent to the foundation degree. An applicant institution will also undergo a rigorous process of assessment by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. The required standards will be high, and it is to be expected that only top-performing further education institutions with a strong track record of delivering foundation degree courses will be recommended to the Privy Council for the powers to award foundation degrees.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 June 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Department does not collect data about the number of applications for headships. However, according to research undertaken by Howson<sup>(1)</sup>, while there has been a decline in the number of applications for headships in primary schools between 2004-05 and 2005-06, there has been an increase in the number of applications in secondary schools. In addition, the Department&#146;s official statistics show that since 1997, head teacher vacancies have remained low and fairly stable. Provisional figures for 2007 show a fall in the head teacher vacancy rate from 0.8 per cent. in January 2006 to 0.6 per cent. in January 2007. However, we know that some types of schools such as church schools, schools in London and some small schools in rural areas find it harder to recruit senior staff than others and also that more heads are reaching retirement age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="70611w0016.htm_para4"><a name="07061182001646">Our focus is therefore on ensuring that we have sufficient numbers of high quality school leaders now and coming through the system for the future. The Secretary of State asked the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) for advice on succession planning and on the back of this announce an additional &#163;10 million to support their work in this area. In preparing the advice, the NCSL have consulted widely with schools, school leaders, local authorities, dioceses, professional associations, and governor bodies. This included nine regional succession planning conferences, attended by over 500 school leaders and an ongoing Succession Planning Advisory Group with senior education representatives which meets regularly. The Department also commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct an independent study into school leadership, which reported in January.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 June 2007]:</i> The Further Education and Training Bill makes provision to streamline the non-executive structure of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) by removing the requirement to have local learning and skills councils (of which there are 47) and replacing them with new regional committees (to be known as regional councils, of which we intend there to be nine). It also removes the requirement to have an adult and young people's learning committee and reduces the minimum size of the LSC's national council. Overall the number of non-executives will reduce from around 750 to around 150.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70611w0016.htm_para7"><a name="07061182001657">The LSC has also been undergoing a restructuring exercise which will result in some 1,100 fewer staff posts across the whole of the organisation. This exercise is expected to be completed later this summer, and is important preparation for the LSC's role in implementing the reforms set out in the Further Education White Paper &#147;Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&#148;, and for taking forward the skills challenges identified in the Leitch Report.</p>

 Before publishing proposals to close a school a local authority must consult all interested parties on its proposals, including the school's staff, governors and parents, and other schools and local authorities likely to be affected. The authority must provide sufficient information and allow adequate time for those being consulted to form a view and make their views known, and it must take those views into account in deciding whether to go ahead and publish its proposals.</p>

The statutory guidance also includes a presumption against closing rural primary schools. Although this does not mean that no rural primary school will ever close, the case for closure needs to be strong.</p>

DEFRA recently commissioned a study to look at the economic drivers and potential for developing alternative markets to the export of veal calves. The report confirmed that the domestic market for home-produced veal is resistant to growth. It did, however, conclude that there are commercially attractive opportunities for rearing dairy calves for the growing domestic market for manufacturing beef. This is promising and DEFRA will continue to play its part in encouraging such alternative uses.</p>

In December 2004, the UK banned pelagic pair trawling for bass by UK vessels within 12 miles off the south-west coast of England. The Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) regularly reports the results of its research on by-catch monitoring which covers all relevant UK fishery sectors, including the bass pair trawl fishery to the Department and has recently presented us with their 2006 findings. This report will be submitted to the European Commission and published on DEFRA&#146;s website in due course. The Commission evaluate all contributing member states&#146; schemes.</p>

 We monitor the situation in Chechnya and the wider north Caucasus regularly. Recent years have seen a gradual improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, resulting in the UN downgrading its security classification for Chechnya from Phase 5 to Phase 4 in August 2006. But the security situation in neighbouring Ingushetia and Dagestan is increasingly concerning.</p>

There are reports of forced disappearances, torture and extra-judicial killing in the republic. We believe that security measures which do not respect international human rights law are counter-productive and that a long-term solution to the region's problems is only possible once an end has been put to human rights violations. It is important that President Kadyrov ensures that all government agencies operate within the law and that all security measures are combined with a full respect for human rights.</p>

 After many years of hiding its nuclear programme from the world, Iran needs to satisfy the international community, and not just the UK, that its programme is for purely peaceful reasons. The generous and far-reaching proposals presented to Iran on behalf of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) by Dr. Javier Solana in June 2006 would give Iran everything it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power programme. These remain on the table and we stand ready to negotiate with Iran on the basis of these. But Iran first needs to suspend its enrichment-related activities, as repeatedly required by the UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, to gain the confidence of the international community.</p>

In particular, as the Director-General of the IAEA has stated many times, unless Iran addresses the long outstanding verification issues, and implements the Additional Protocol which it has agreed with the agency, as well as essential transparency measures, the IAEA will not be able to fully reconstruct the history of Iran&#146;s nuclear programme and provide the international community with assurances about the exclusively peaceful nature of that programme. The Director-General has also stated that these required transparency measures would need to go further than the measures prescribed in the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol, given the 20 years of undeclared nuclear activities in Iran. In the Director-General&#146;s most recent report on Iran on 23 May, he noted that the agency&#146;s level of knowledge of certain aspects of Iran&#146;s nuclear related activities had deteriorated over the past year.</p>

 The increase in US forces in Baghdad and the surrounding provinces, as part of the Multinational Force in Iraq, is intended to support the Iraqi-led Baghdad Security Plan, which also involves the deployment of additional Iraq security force personnel as well as a range of political and economic activities.

 High levels of violence have undermined progress on the Iraqi Government&#146;s national reconciliation plan published last year, but reconciliation and power-sharing between Iraq&#146;s different communities remains central to the country&#146;s future.

 The UK is determined that those responsible for the assassination of Rafik Hariri should be brought to justice. In November 2006, with the UK&#146;s support, the then UN Secretary-General wrote to Prime Minister Siniora inviting the Lebanese Government to approve statutes for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. In the context of the political impasse in Lebanon this was not possible, and Prime Minister Siniora and the Lebanese parliamentary majority wrote to the UN Secretary-General asking him to explore alternative ways forward. We have since worked with Security Council partners to assist Lebanon in setting up the Tribunal.

Internal security in the border provinces remains volatile, where there has been a series of recent attacks and suicide bombings targeted against both the authorities and the public. Since March, following the Government of Pakistan&#146;s decision to suspend the Chief Justice, there have also been frequent, sometimes violent, protests in major cities throughout the country.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 June 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Home Office has focused on raising public awareness of the new role of police community support officers (PCSOs) and neighbourhood policing teams, which are now being implemented across England and Wales. A successful national PCSO recruitment campaign in 2006 was designed not only to encourage applications but also to help explain the role of a PCSO. This campaign included television and radio adverts, poster campaigns and national and local press advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="70611w0036.htm_para1"><a name="07061215000787">In addition, a six-part documentary series followed the work of PCSOs in Lancashire and the Thames Valley. The series ran between October and December 2006 on ITV (England) and achieved an average audience of 2.3 million rising to 3 million. All of this activity has raised the profile of PCSOs and the neighbourhood policing teams in which they serve. It has also supported the police service in their drive to increase PCSO numbers to 16,000 across England  and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="70611w0036.htm_para2"><a name="07061215000788">Neighbourhood policing teams will consist of police sergeants, constables and PCSOs, and may also comprise special constables, wardens, neighbourhood managers, housing managers, youth workers and other community partners, depending on the needs and priorities of the community that the team serves. In promoting neighbourhood policing teams the Home Office and the police service has celebrated the diverse and complementary nature of the various ranks and roles within these teams which join together to provide a visible and accessible service to the communities they serve.</p>

 The information requested about the average size of a pension lump sum is not held centrally. Under the Police Pension Scheme 1987 a lump sum is not paid out automatically but only where the officer chooses to convert (commute) part of his or her pension into a lump sum. The size of a lump sum depends on the officer&#146;s pensionable pay, his or her length of pensionable service, the proportion of pension that the officer chooses to commute, and the commutation factor to be applied to the surrendered portion of pension in order to convert it into a lump sum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70611w0036.htm_para3"><a name="07061215000796">The Police Pensions Regulations 1987 require that the lump sum be determined as the actuarial equivalent of the surrendered portion of the pension at the date of retirement, calculated from tables prepared by the Government Actuary. The commutation factors used for the 1987 Scheme are graduated according to the age and gender of the officer concerned in order to reflect the fact that, on average, women live longer than men and younger people have a longer remaining life expectancy than older people. Pension scheme actuarial factors are exempted from the legal requirements for sex and age equality.</p>
