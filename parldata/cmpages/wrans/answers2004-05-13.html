<a name="40513w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Fraudulent Compensation Claims</h3>





<p><a name="40513w01.html_wqn0"><b> Sir Teddy Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what procedures exist to prosecute fraudulent farmers who make claims for compensation from the European Union for sheep destroyed during the foot and mouth crisis.  [172488]</p>








<p><a name="40513w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> Ordinarily the Investigation Branch of DEFRA would investigate such an allegation and pass the evidence gathered to the Criminal Advisory and Prosecution Division of DEFRA. Prosecution lawyers in that Division would review the evidence and if there were a realistic prospect of conviction and it were also in the public interest to prosecute DEFRA would commence criminal proceedings in the criminal courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w01.html_para0">
In the event of a conviction the prosecution would seek a compensation and/or confiscation order to compensate the loser for the financial loss and deprive the convicted person of the benefit from the offences proved.

<a name="40513w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Hazardous Waste</h3>





<p><a name="40513w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what studies she has undertaken to evaluate the risk of additional transportation of hazardous waste as a result of the closure of hazardous waste treatment centres.  [168373]</p>








<p><a name="40513w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government recognise that with the expected reduction in the number of landfill sites taking hazardous waste from July 2004, hazardous waste could travel further in the short term. Nevertheless, it is recognised that even under the present system significant amounts of special waste travel across the country. In 2002, 42&nbsp;per cent. of hazardous waste crossed a regional boundary. Government have not commissioned any specific studies to evaluate the forthcoming changes on this specific issue. Clearly in the longer term, the implementation of the Landfill Directive requirements will see an increase in treatment costs, which in turn will provide a greater incentive for hazardous waste minimisation and the use of more sustainable treatment technologies.

environment. In addition, through the UK Veterinary Surveillance Strategy launched last year, we will develop a better overview and understanding of the health of the health of Britain&#039;s wildlife in relation to its impact on public health and other animals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w01.html_para1">
Government, through its developing Animal Health and Welfare Strategy, recognises that there are a number of diseases of livestock where wildlife may act as a reservoir or a source of infection. Government has a role in science, research, intervention in some specific cases, and ensuring advice is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w01.html_para2">
The Veterinary Surveillance Strategy provides a framework for ensuring the potential risks posed by wildlife to public health (through zoonotic disease) or to farmed livestock (for example from migrating birds) are effectively identified and managed. The Strategy will also cover the impact of disease control policies for farmed livestock on wildlife and certain welfare issues involving the protection from cruelty.

The Environment Agency has previously (June 2003) provided companies with draft breakdowns of the indicative housing numbers by sub-region and company area, to assist in draft Water Resource Plans work.

The discussions demonstrated that there were differences of view regarding past usage of the site so I agreed to DEFRA&#039;s commissioning an independent mediator to facilitate a further discussion between the Woodcraft Folk and the two councils on 3 and 4&nbsp;February 2004. In the light of the mediator&#039;s report, I agreed to issue a camping exemption certificate to the Woodcraft Folk for one year, subject to further discussion between the parties to resolve outstanding issues.

 The UK has the largest insurance industry in Europe. Implementing the IMD is a key step in completing the single market in financial services, and will enhance consumer protection in an important sector of financial business. The UK market for selling insurance is competitive with many players giving customers wide choice, and this will continue in the new regime. Already thousands of firms have applied to the FSA for authorisation for the new regime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w03.html_para3">
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 requires the FSA to publish a cost-benefit analysis of its proposed rules and guidance. The FSA has published cost benefit analysis in each of its consultation papers, which includes analysis of the market impact on firms. These state that regulation might result in some reduction in the number of firms selling insurance. In particular they stated that some businesses for whom selling insurance was a marginal activity may withdraw from the market once subject to statutory regulation. However there will be thousands of firms in the market providing consumers with a wide choice. The FSA have estimated that around 20,000 new firms will come into regulation as a result of mortgage and general insurance regulation and the vast majority of these will be involved in general insurance business.

The activities to be regulated are: introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance; assisting in the administration 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 May 2004 : Column 479W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and concluding contracts of insurance. In drawing up its rules for insurance mediation, the FSA has carried out extensive public consultation on its rules. Further information is available from the FSA&#039;s website, www.fsa.gov.uk.

FSA regulation of insurance brokers will commence from 14&nbsp;January 2005. This date is two years from the publication of the directive in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities. All member states have to implement the directive by this date.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w03.html_para6">
In implementing the directive the Government and the FSA have worked closely with the industry to design a regulatory regime that takes account of market practice, and does not load the industry and ultimately the consumer with unnecessary costs. Both the Government and the FSA have been concerned to minimise the impact on smaller firms and sole traders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w03.html_para7">
The fees charged are a matter for the FSA. Application fees for insurance intermediaries have been set following consultation with the industry and are based on the volume of business undertaken. Up to 50&nbsp;per cent. discount is offered for an early application together with further discount if the application is made&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronically. Smaller intermediaries seeking authorisation could pay a fee of only &#163;500. If a firm is already authorised by the FSA for other regulated activities, the application fee it would pay for IMD activities is halved. The periodic annual fee which will be charged by the FSA for on-going supervision of authorised intermediaries following the commencement of regulation has not yet been set and will be the subject of a forthcoming consultation this summer.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what he estimates the cost would be to the Exchequer under its proposed reform of pension taxation of imposing no annual limit on pension savings in the year 2006&#150;07 and each of the subsequent three years.  [172126]</p>








<p><a name="40513w04.html_spnew2"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The annual allowance protects against large payments being made into a tax privileged pension scheme that might then be removed from the scheme without the imposition of tax. So there would therefore 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 May 2004 : Column 481W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
be a cost attached to having no annual allowance under the proposed simplified pension regime&#151;even if the lifetime allowance were retained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w04.html_para1">
The size of this cost depends upon behavioural effects and any estimate of cost would inevitably be very broad-brush. However, given the potential additional pension savings from those in the top 1&nbsp;per cent. of the earnings distribution, plus the possibility of the additional scope for tax avoidance or evasion, the cost to the Exchequer could be up to several hundred million pounds over this period.

Qualifying grants are targeted at people aged 60 or over and those receiving specified benefits, so the related reduced rate is similarly well targeted at those who need help most.

Over the last three years the percentage increase in the cost of the most expensive 1,000 criminal cases in each year has been 14&nbsp;per cent. The new contracting scheme, which now applies to all these cases, introduces greater control and works on the basis of fixed rates for both barristers and solicitors. Cases are paid for as each stage is completed. That is an advantage from the lawyer&#039;s point of view over the former system where cases are on average paid two years after their start.

We and other donors will nevertheless continue to work with the UN and other agencies to monitor the humanitarian position in Zimbabwe.

 The Government Office for London have pursued the issue of whether Barnet council has complied with the terms of their funding in 2003&#150;04. It is the understanding of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that they have done so. We have been advised however that since August 2003, Barnet has not been supporting the eight street wardens and four neighbourhood wardens for annual leave, sickness and training under the scheme. Also because of where the base station has been located, wardens were spending 30&nbsp;minutes of their duty at the beginning and end of the day travelling to and from Grahame Park. Funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for wardens schemes in Barnet began in December 2000 and ceased on 31&nbsp;March 2004. Future funding is a matter for local agencies. Over 80&nbsp;per cent. of the first round of warden schemes have already secured ongoing funding.

 The answers referred to gave the full extent of information currently available. Land Use Change Statistics are derived from Ordnance Survey&#039;s map revision process. In urban areas Ordnance Survey records mostly change within six months of the development taking place but in rural areas there can be up to five years between a change taking place and its recording by Ordnance Survey. Early estimates of percentages of dwellings that are on previously developed land and of dwellings per hectare on new developments have been found to be robust and are published early. Totals of land or dwellings, however,

 Where local authorities need additional funds over and above the substantial increases this government has made to funding for council housing, they have three options, establishing an Arms Length Management Organisation, using the Private Finance Initiative or transfers or their stock to a registered social landlord. If tenants reject all of these options then we will respect their decision. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no proposals for providing additional resources above the three options.

 We are encouraged by the State Peace and Development Council&#039;s plans to reconvene the National Convention on 17&nbsp;May to draft a new constitution, the first step of the road map outlined by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt on 30&nbsp;August 2003. But it is essential that the National Convention is an inclusive, transparent process with a clear time frame. All political parties and ethnic groups should be invited to join the Convention, and to select their representatives freely. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all other National League for Democracy (NLD) members should be released immediately to allow them to prepare their approach to the National Convention.
</p>


<p>

Without the participation of the NLD, the Convention will lack all credibility. There must be full freedom of debate and speech in the Convention and freedom of activity and association for political parties and ethnic groups. This includes ensuring that the 104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles of the previous National Convention (1993&#150;1996) are open for debate.

The increase in the number of pupils benefiting from EiC from 2001 onwards is due to the schools in the Education Action Zones in the area coming under the control of the Sefton EiC Partnership.

The large increase in the rate of EiC funding in 2002&#150;03 is due to the extra funding provided through the Behaviour Improvement Programme and the increase in 2003&#150;04 is due to the introduction of the Leadership Incentive Grant.

From the information available to the LSC it has not been feasible to obtain estimates at constituency level or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate figures by subject without incurring disproportionate cost.

 The main means by which teacher workload is monitored is through the regular diary surveys undertaken for the Office for Manpower Economics. Last year&#039;s survey was conducted in March 2003. The most recent one was conducted in March 2004, with results available in the autumn. The March 2003 survey showed some reductions in hours, but this was obviously too early to draw any conclusions. The &quot;Making a Difference&#151;Red Tape and Bureaucracy in Schools Second Report&quot; was published in March 2003.

Their first annual report was published on 30&nbsp;April 2004, which provides an assessment of the progress that has been made, including the introduction of a system within the DfES to assess the impact of new initiatives before they are introduced.

<p><a name="40513w21.html_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 A moratorium on new applications for Degree Awarding Powers (DAP) and University Title (UT) was put in place for institutions in England and Wales last year as we consulted on revised criteria for DAP and UT. In a written ministerial statement on 16&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 16WS, I announced that we would be holding further discussions on renewable DAP and a paper will be issued on 14&nbsp;May 2004. A copy of this paper will be placed in the House Libraries and will also be available on the Department for Education and Skills website. We hope to finalise new criteria for DAP and UT in England and Wales by this summer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what progress has been made in reducing the number of adults without a NVQ level 2 or equivalent qualification by 2010; and if he will make a statement.  [172976]</p>








<p><a name="40513w21.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Good progress is being made to reach our 2010 target of reducing by 40&nbsp;per cent. those without a level 2 qualification (NVQ level 2 or equivalent). According to the Labour Force Survey, the reduction realised as of autumn 2003 was 5.4&nbsp;per cent. from the autumn 2001 baseline. The interim milestone for 2006 is that there should be 1&nbsp;million more adults in the workforce with full level 2 or better than in 2002. Autumn 2003 figures show an increase of 187,000 adults with at least a level 2 compared to the autumn 2002 baseline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para0">
These figures are broadly in line with the planned trajectories for meeting the PSA targets for both 2006 and 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para1">
The Skills Strategy White Paper (published July 2003) includes a wide range of interlinked measures to remove barriers to learning, support participation for individuals and increase the amount of training undertaken with employers. It set out our intention to introduce a new entitlement for any adult in the labour force to have access to free tuition for their first full level 2 qualification. We are working with the LSC on phasing in the level 2 entitlement, with phase one in 2004&#150;05 and full rollout beginning the following year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para2">
In September 2003, we started piloting the new Adult Learning Grant in ten local LSC areas, which offers up to &#163;30 per week to adults on low incomes studying full-time for a first full level 2 qualification. Over 3,000 ALG applications have been received and over 2,000 awards have been made to learners. From September, we are doubling the size of the current pilot by extending the ALG throughout the SE and NE regions, as part of linked trials of key initiatives announced in the Skills Strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para3">
There are currently 12 Employer Training Pilots (ETPs) which are testing new financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to attain basic and level 2 skills. By mid April over 49,000 learners and nearly 9,000 employers were engaged. The expansion of ETPs was announced in the Budget and ETPs will now be available in 20 LSC areas in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para4">
We believe that these and other related measures in the Skills Strategy will enable us to accelerate the trajectory towards meeting these targets.

<p><a name="40513w21.html_spnew4"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The gross cost of exempting all pensioners over 65 in receipt of carers&#039; allowance from&nbsp;the overlapping benefits rule would be around &#163;200&nbsp;million. After adjusting for offsets in income-related benefits the cost would be around &#163;130&nbsp;million <sup>1</sup> . Exempting women only, aged 60 and over, would cost &#163;155&nbsp;million (&#163;100&nbsp;million after adjustments), although our commitment to the European directive on equal treatment would of course prevent us from introducing such a measure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para5">
These costs do not take account of the introduction of pension credit where carers&#039; allowance is taken fully into account but an additional amount may be awarded in respect of the caring.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w21.html_para6">
Neither do the figures take account of the behavioural effect of carers who have not claimed a carer&#039;s allowance but who would be induced to do so if the overlapping benefits rules were amended as suggested.

1.&nbsp;Figures taken from a 5&nbsp;per cent. sample at 31&nbsp;August 2003 for AA and DLA and at 30&nbsp;September 2003 for IIDB.<br>

2.&nbsp;Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3.&nbsp;From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

4.&nbsp;Population Figures used to produce the percentages are mid 2002 for population of all ages. Source: Office for National Statistics.<br>





5.&nbsp;DLA is payable to all ages, if claimed before 65. IIDB is payable to working age claimants. AA is only payable on new claims to those aged 65 plus. There remain a number of AA claims in payment from before 6&nbsp;April 1992, which were not converted to DLA with the introduction of the new scheme, which explains why some people still receive a combination of DLA mobility component and AA for their care costs.<br>

6.&nbsp;The total for AA does not match published individual benefit statistics as published AA statistics use rating factors to take account of late terminations.<br>

<p><a name="40513w25.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 A review of the structure, organisation and training of both the Warfare and Engineering Branches of the Royal Navy is currently taking place. It is probable that the term Engineering Technician will be adopted for all members of the Engineering Branch below the rank of Commissioned Officer, replacing the Artificer and Mechanic titles currently in use. The title Artificer no longer adequately describes the professional role that those personnel undertake in the modern Navy. Replacing them with Engineering Technicians will align the Navy with the standards of competence published by the Engineering Council United Kingdom, and refresh the image of this key role against increasingly competitive recruitment market forces.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40513w25.html_para0">
The fleet continues to require highly trained and experienced personnel to provide the necessary technical support to ensure that the Royal Navy delivers its full range of operational capability. An expected outcome from the current review is that training will be better targeted through a career, and that naval Engineering Technicians who complete the training satisfactorily will be awarded a Foundation Degree, reflecting the comprehensive set of skills that they will possess.

Notes:<br>

In-year admissions<br>

An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the datayear. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the datayear (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>





Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Data Quality<br>

PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. Data quality of PCT of GP practice for 1998&#150;99 is poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the potential health risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from exposure to low-level <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;ionising and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;non-ionising radiation; and if he will make a statement.  [170822]</p>








<p><a name="40513w33.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Government is advised on the potential health risks from ionising and non-ionising radiation by a variety of bodies. The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) provides statutory advice to Government (www.nrpb.org). The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) provides advice on health effects of radiation at the levels encountered in the general environment. Low-level internal radiation emitters are the remit of the Committee Evaluating Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters and it is due to report to COMARE in the autumn of 2004. The risks from exposure to low-level internal emitters are also regularly reviewed by international organisations, such as the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation.

In addition, the Department runs its own radiological protection research programme in the area of low-level radiation exposure (both ionising and non-ionising), that provides information on the quantification of the risk to public health and the implementation of appropriate preventative measures. Research specifically aimed at investigating the potential health effects of mobile phone technology was set up in 2001 under the mobile telecommunications and health research programme.

For non-ionising radiation, the NRPB has recently reviewed the scientific evidence relating to possible adverse health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields in the frequency range 0&#150;300GHz (Documents of the NRPB: Vol 15, No 3, 2004). This document provides

the basis of NRPB advice on quantitative restrictions on exposure and other measures to avoid adverse effects. It is available on the NRPB web site.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV; and what assessment he has made of its impact on the sexual health of young people in the UK.  [172575]</p>








<p><a name="40513w34.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The national strategy for sexual health and HIV, which is closely linked to the Government&#039;s teenage pregnancy strategy, identifies young people as a priority group for action to improve sexual health. The Government&#039;s &#039;Sex Lottery&#039; and teenage pregnancy media campaigns are raising awareness among young people of sexually transmitted

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on ensuring that there is an adequate provision of serum for children whose parents opt for individual inoculations rather than the combined MMR.  [171743]</p>








<p><a name="40513w34.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Department does not supply single vaccines. It provides the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine because it provides the most effective protection against three potentially serious diseases. The availability of single vaccines is an issue for the private clinics who offer them.
