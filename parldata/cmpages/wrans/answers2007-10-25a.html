 To ask the hon. Member for North Devon, representing the House of Commons Commission what the Commission has decided on the implementation of the Tebbit review of management and services of the House. [161237]</p>

 In July the Commission agreed to fast track several areas of the Tebbit Review as detailed in my answer on 24 July 2007 (HC Deb 925W). Following the debate in Westminster Hall on 18 October and comments from the Finance and Services, Administration and Audit Committees, the Commission approved the following changes on 22 October.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="71025w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07102563000094">A new Management Board replaced the existing Board of Management with immediate effect. The Management Board consists of the Clerk, as Chief Executive and Chairman, four director generals with functional responsibilities, and up to two external advisors. The six House Departments other than PICT will be merged into four new Departments broadly aligned with the Director Generals&#146; responsibilities. These will be:</p>
<a name="71025w0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07102563001606"><ul><p class="tabletext">Department of Chamber and Committee Services&#151;incorporating Clerk&#146;s Department, <i> Hansard</i> and core elements of the Serjeant&#146;s Department;</p>
</ul><a name="71025w0001.htm_brev1"><a name="07102563001607"><ul><p class="tabletext">Department of Information Services&#151;incorporating the Library and allied information services;</p>

</ul><a name="71025w0001.htm_brev3"><a name="07102563001609"><ul><p class="tabletext">Department of Facilities&#151;incorporating Estates and Works, Accommodation Services and Refreshment Department.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="71025w0001.htm_para1"><a name="07102563000095">These new Departments will come into effect on 1 January 2008. A recruitment exercise to fill the new post of Director General of Facilities will be put in place. Pending an appointment, the Commission has agreed that the Director of Catering Services will lead the work to create the new Department of Facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="71025w0001.htm_para2"><a name="07102563000096">PICT will be formally vested as joint Department of the two Houses early in 2008. Pending a review in 2009 of the working of the Parliament (Joint Departments) Act 2007, the Director of PICT will attend the Management Board as one of its external members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="71025w0001.htm_para3"><a name="07102563000097">The aim is to create a fully unified House Service that will provide Members and others with the highest standards of service. The changes are consistent with the approach recommended in the Tebbit report, but also address a number of issues on which the report did not reach a firm conclusion. The intention is that the changes will be cost neutral and there are no planned redundancies. I understand that consultation has begun with both staff and trade unions on how best to create the new Departments.</p>

 We have asked HEFCE to phase out the support it gives to institutions for students doing a second degree at an equivalent or lower level in order to redistribute around &#163;100 million a year by 2010/11 towards our priorities. While there may be some benefit to individuals and their employers, in them retraining for a second qualification at the same level, it is generally fairer to both students and the taxpayer to give priority to those either entering higher education for the first time, or progressing to higher qualifications. All of the &#163;100 million will be redistributed to support our priorities, including the challenges posed by Sandy Leitch around the proportion of the work force with graduate level skills from under 30 per cent. to over 40 per cent. by 2020. At the same time, we also published details of these changes and the rationale for them so that prospective students both with and without existing Higher Education qualifications can plan ahead in the knowledge of our priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="71025w0005.htm_para11"><a name="07102563001190">A great deal of work is being taken forward across Government to build on this success. Reducing re-offending is a key element of the new Home Office Crime Strategy &#147;Cutting Crime: A New Partnership 2008-11&#148;. The new &#147;Make Communities Safer&#148; Public Service Agreement sets a target to both reduce adult and youth re-offending, and to reduce the level of serious re-offences. NOMS and DIUS will be producing an overarching Strategic Plan in spring 2008 to set out how the Government intend to meet this challenge and a consultation paper will be published shortly. Alongside this consultation, we will also be consulting on an Offender Health and Social Care Strategy and a NOMS Third Sector Action Plan. While these will focus on specific elements of work to reduce re-offending, they will support the overarching Strategic Plan, and underscore the Government&#146;s commitment to tackling re-offending holistically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="71025w0005.htm_para12"><a name="07102563001191">The Youth Justice Boards (YJB) is working to reduce youth re-offending. The YJB has a scaled approach to youth justice interventions to ensure that youth offending services focus on those children and young people most likely to re-offend. The YJB has developed the assessment tool &#147;Asset&#148; which is used by all Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) to identify the risk factors driving offending behaviour and the protective factors that will support desistance. Asset is used to design a &#147;multi modal&#148; package of interventions to reduce risk factors and build up the protective factors. The Wiring-Up Youth Justice Programme is providing YOTs with the latest technology to improve the speed and quality of information transfer between YOTs, secure establishments and other key service providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="71025w0005.htm_para13"><a name="07102563001192">The new local government performance framework which contains six specific youth justice indicators (out of total of 197) provides YOTs with an excellent lever to encourage local authority chief executives to prioritise young offenders&#146; access to services.</p>

Depending on deep-sea development assumed elsewhere, the study estimated that it would reduce additional feeder-service quay length required elsewhere by 2030 by between 14 per cent. and 35 per cent. as well as abstracting deep-sea traffic from other ports.</p>

It would be premature to predict at this stage how many properties will be at a particular standard in 2017. The upgrading of properties is, however, proceeding and at present some 95 per cent. of SFA is at the top two standards for condition.

<i> [holding answer 22 October 2007]:</i> The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force have done a great deal in recent years to promote racial equality and continue to work hard to develop an organisational culture that welcomes racial diversity and places the highest priority on tackling racism.

Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which was &#163;60,000 at the start of 2006. Similarly, businesses that de-register may not have closed. Only 1.9 million out of 4.5 million UK enterprises (41 per cent.) were registered for VAT at the start of 2006.</p>

However a study commissioned for the London Development Agency in 2005<sup>(l)</sup> showed that out of the 790,000 jobs lost through SMEs closing down in London between 2001 and 2003, 88 per cent. found immediate employment elsewhere, 8 per cent. went in self-employment and 1 per cent. into training. Only 3 per cent. went into unemployment.</p>

This was largely due to the need to ensure the contractor's basis for project implementation was robust, and had the support of the Fire and Rescue Service. Sign off of Milestones 2-4, which relate to the installation of the network infrastructure is currently being withheld to ensure that the contractor&#146;s proposed schedule for implementation is realistic.

 No such estimate has been made. The cross-year swap was undertaken to ensure that the Channel plaice fishery would be kept open to 10 metre and under vessels throughout 2006. Some 90 tonnes of plaice in total was acquired for this purpose including the 40 tonnes gained via this cross-year swap. Given the pressure on a number of inshore fisheries in the south and west last year, the value of the transfer was in ensuring that local fishing communities across the south coast were able to continue to land quota species until the end of the year.</p>

 Most cross-year swaps between the UK and other member states are not agreed until the end of the current year or the start of the following one. They are usually completed to settle small overfishes by the UK or other member states. These swaps can allow extra fishing opportunities to be found for UK fishermen including the inshore sector. Additional quota for several valuable species was obtained by this means for 2007, and we will look to do the same in 2007-08. At the moment, only one cross-year swap has been finalised which has gained Channel cod in 2007 for the inshore sector by which, as part of a package, eight tonnes of VII anglerfish in 2008 has been given up.</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the energy industry, and the voluntary sector to tackle fuel poverty in the UK. Warm Front grants, benefit entitlement checks and the reduction of VAT on fuel has helped many customers not only have an increase in benefit, but also more energy efficient homes which result in lower fuel bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="71025w0020.htm_para0"><a name="07102572000894">The Department is responsible for the winter fuel payment which pays most households &#163;200 where someone is over 60, and &#163;300 if the household includes someone aged 80 or over. In addition, Pension credit is playing a major roll in delivering substantial increases in income to pensioners with only modest savings or occupational pensions. The Pension Service Local Service carry out a benefit check as part of their interviews and refer customers to Warm Front if appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="71025w0020.htm_para1"><a name="07102572000895">The Department is also assisting in the reduction in fuel poverty through its work in tackling child poverty.

Jobcentre Plus has made significant efforts to improve its understanding of how to manage JOT and has taken a number of steps to address the shortfall in performance both at national and district levels.

These KMIs were subsequently reviewed and, for 2007-08, developed into a new Interventions Delivery Target (IDT) to give an even sharper focus to the timely delivery of work-focused support. In addition, an adviser achievement tool was developed to help ensure interventions were the right quality and properly targeted, with appropriate job submissions.</p>

In particular, JOT was seen as supporting the trend of encouraging the use of self help channels among customers who were closer to the labour market, and therefore enabling resources to be concentrated more intensively on providing assistance to 'harder to help' groups. JOT was also viewed as influencing more efficient working practices (for example through more effective use of the Adviser Discretionary Fund), an increased willingness of staff to refer customers to provision and improved team working. This research did not specifically look at performance against JOT profiles.</p>

 Funding of most primary medical care practices is largely dependent on the number and characteristics of the patients registered with that provider. In addition, quality and enhanced service payments are also usually based on delivery of care to the patients registered with that practice. Therefore, any system of dual or multiple registrations would fund more than one provider to deliver care and services to the same patient&#151;doubling the costs, while at the same time complicating the care management and co-ordination of care to such patients. This would have consequences for the continuity of patient care and ensuring a single comprehensive and up to date patient record. There would also be complicating factors in determining allocation of resources for the provision of hospital and community health services to primary care trusts should patients be registered with different practices in different primary care trusts.</p>

1. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
2. Count of finished consultant episodes (FCEs) where the primary diagnosis was Mesothelioma** for selected Acute Trusts in Merseyside.<br>
** The ICD-10 codes used in this analysis were as follows:<br>
C45 Mesothelioma<br>
D19 Benign neoplasm of mesothelial tissue<br>
3. Data on FCEs is currently not available from 2001-02 to 2003-04 for Clatterbridge Centre of Oncology.<br>
4. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
5. Low numbers<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with * (an asterisk).<br>
6. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected within the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
7. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
8. Ungrossed data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 As part of the annual accounts process, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities (SHA) now show total resource expenditure on both primary and secondary care services in each of 23 clinical areas. The following table shows the programme budget data on one of those categories, eye/vision problems. This should include expenditure on primary care services provided through the general ophthalmic services, which provide sight tests and optical vouchers to those patient groups entitled to these national health service services, as well as the cost of secondary and additional primary care services directly attributable to problems relating to the eye and vision. The cost of any general practitioners consultations involving eye or vision problems is not separately quantified and is therefore not included in this data.</p>

 Patient Safety Direct is an opportunity to make it easier for front-line staff to report patient safety incidents. Currently the main line of reporting incidents is though the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) reporting and learning system. Patient Safety Direct will strengthen this reporting line by adding a new and more accessible portal for national health service staff and ultimately patients to use. The NPSA is scoping the work with all the various organisations which need to be involved. Plans will be developed in phase two of Lord Darzi&#146;s NHS Next Stage Review and, following piloting, we expect to move to implementation by the end of 2008.</p>

The UK applies these restrictions, which are identical to those applicable to travellers from non-EU countries, and has publicised this fact widely by amendments to the aforementioned guidance and publicity materials. Additionally, posters were placed in major airports of the accession countries concerned, and adverts were placed in a number of in-flight magazines.</p>

 Within the United Nations General Assembly First Committee the UK traditionally makes common statements with our EU partners. Accordingly, the EU delivered a statement in the nuclear weapons debate on 17 October this year. The EU reiterated its support for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and stressed the need for an overall reduction of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, in particular by those countries which possess the largest arsenals. The EU also called on all states concerned to take appropriate practical measures in order to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war. There are a number of resolutions that will be voted upon during the First Committee that relate to the issues raised. The possibility of the UK delivering a national explanation of vote on some of these resolutions is currently being considered.</p>

 The UK regards the status of Western Sahara as undetermined, pending UN efforts to find a solution. To this end, the UK fully supports the efforts of the UN Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy to the Western Sahara, Peter van Walsum, to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="71025w0034.htm_para0"><a name="07102613000117">The UN Security Council adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1754 on 30 April 2007, which extended the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. There are no plans for a referendum to be held in the near future. However, the resolution also called for both sides to enter into negotiations without preconditions. The UK welcomed two rounds of negotiations between the parties, hosted by the UN in Manhasset, New York, on 18-19 June and 10-11 August. A further round of negotiations is due to take place later in the year.</p>
