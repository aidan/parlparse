<P>
<a name="00718w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what mechanisms are in place to monitor the <i>(a)</i> service provided by defence projects delivered under the private finance initiative and <i>(b)</i> performance of PFI contracts for projects already operating;  [128590]
<P>
<UL>(2) what monitoring is undertaken by his Department of Private Finance Initiative contracts; and if he will make a statement;  [129202]
<P>
(3) what the average period of time is between the completion of a full business case and signing of the final contract for PFI contracts in his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [129204]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 MOD signs PFI deals when appropriate contractual arrangements have been negotiated in order to secure best value for money. The time taken to complete such deals varies from contract to contract. Detailed records covering this particular aspect are not held centrally. Each PFI contract contains performance measures against which service provision is reviewed. MOD also seeks to apply lessons learned from its own PFI deals and from elsewhere in Government, drawing on guidance from the National Audit Office and other relevant bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent assessment he has made of the nuclear weapons capability of <i>(a)</i> Iraq and <i>(b)</i> Israel.  [130679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We remain concerned about the potential for Iraq to resume its covert programme to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Hence the importance we attach to re-establishing weapons inspections in Iraq under the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
<P>

<a name="00718w01.html_para0">Israel is a non-party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). We consistently call on Israel to join the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state, to place all its nuclear facilities under international Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, to ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and to engage in negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of the respective stockpiles of reprocessed uranium from <i>(a)</i> magnox fuel, <i>(b)</i> AOR fuel, <i>(c)</i> SGHWR fuel and <i>(d)</i> fast reactor fuel have been re-cycled in new fuel to date; and if he will list the quantities and current locations of the reprocessed uranium stored to date.  [129967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Proportion <i>(a)</i> is approximately 50 per cent. Proportion <i>(b)</i> is 0 per cent. Proportions <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> cannot be calculated without incurring disproportionate cost, because UKAEA does not separately distinguish the source of the uranium which it uses for fuel manufacture.
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para1">My Department published the figure of holdings of civil depleted, natural and low enriched uranium at 31 December 1999 on 13 June. This material is stored at licensed civil nuclear sites in the UK.

 The agreements announced on 11 July on resolving the problem of the MOX fuel at Takahama in Japan followed discussions between BNFL and its Japanese customer, Kansai Electric Power Company, and between the UK and Japanese Governments.
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para2">The Government's support for BNFL's decision followed full consultation across Departments. The cost of the return shipment and the subsequent handling of the fuel at Sellafield is a commercial matter for BNFL.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how often in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998 and <i>(c)</i> 1999 an export required a licence under the weapons of mass destruction end use controls; in which states these end-users were located; and in how many cases the licence was refused.  [130800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> Details of all export licensing decisions taken between 2 May 1997 and 31 December 1998 were set out in the Government's 1997 and 1998 annual reports on strategic export controls, published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; copies are in the Library of the House. These reports list by country of destination the numbers of export licences issued and refused in each entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled, which is known as their rating.
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para5">The end use control applies to goods, not otherwise subject to control, where the exporter has been told or knows or suspects that the goods would or might be used in activities connected with weapons of mass destruction or missiles for their delivery. Goods controlled for these reasons are given the rating "End Use".
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para6">Information on export licensing decisions taken in 1999 will be set out in the 1999 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, which will be published soon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Enterprise Fund's venture capital elements, the UK High Technology Fund and the Regional Venture Capital Funds, are being established to stimulate the availability of equity finance for smaller businesses which offer significant growth potential.
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para7">A range of agriculture-related projects will be eligible to receive equity funding through the Enterprise Fund venture capital schemes. However, all investment decisions under these programmes will be made by professional Fund Managers in pursuit of the best possible commercial returns for their funds. It is therefore not possible to pre-determine the sectors in which investments will be made.

<a name="00718w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2000]:</i> I consider that tying-in of mortgages with insurance often means that consumers pay uncompetitive premiums for their insurance cover. I believe that consumers should be free to shop around for the best deal.
<P>

<a name="00718w02.html_para8">DTI is therefore now consulting on a proposal to ban compulsory tie-ins of mortgages with insurance products. Once I have considered fully all the responses to the consultation, I will then look at how this proposal can be taken forward.

 I expect the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to come into force in about one year's time. This will complete the process of the modernisation of financial services regulation announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in May 1997. The timescale provides a framework within which proper preparations can be made for the new regulatory system.
<P>

<a name="00718w03.html_para0">The Government believe that both the financial services industry and consumers will benefit from a single regulator with clear statutory objectives providing a light touch where possible, protection where necessary.

 Section 1(4) of the Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979 directs that the level of disablement in vaccine damage cases be assessed as for the purposes of section 103 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.

 We know that many people get support from telephone contact with friends and advisers.

 Stakeholder pensions will be open to people at all income levels but are primarily intended for moderate earners--those earning between around &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000 a year--as well as higher earners. It will be for individuals to decide whether or not to use a stakeholder pension to contract out of the state scheme, but National Insurance rebates for people who do contract out are set at a level which reflects the cost of providing the state benefits forgone. The state second pension is structured to provide extra help in the state scheme above that available from SERPS for people on earnings up to around &#163;20,000. The new contracting-out arrangements have been designed so that members of contracted-out

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development for each low-income country, what proportion of total bilateral aid it received in <i>(a)</i> 1996-97 and <i>(b)</i> 1999-2000; and what total amount of bilateral aid it received in 1996-97.  [130862]<P>

<a name="00718w06.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Data for 1999-2000 are not yet available. The tables show both Department for International Development bilateral expenditure and UK Gross Public Expenditure on Aid (GPEX) for 1996-97 and 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available. Low-income countries are defined as those with a 1995 GNP per capita of less than $766. The total figures include bilateral expenditure which cannot be attributed to individual countries, including for instance block grants and regional allocations.

 The definition of low-income countries, used in the Public Service Agreement, is those with a GNP per capita in 1995 of less than US$766. There are 64 such countries and they are listed on pages 164-166 of the latest (1999) edition of "Statistics On International Development" (a copy of which is in the House Library). The definition was developed by the World bank.

[130962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w06.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The level of each of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) indicators for the baseline year and for 1999-2000 are set out in Box g (items 1 to 3) of the Department for International Development's 2000 Departmental Report. Copies of the Departmental Report and the latest public drafts of the Target Strategy Papers which set out the action necessary to achieve the International Development Targets have been deposited in the House Library. The final Target Strategy Papers will be published over the next few months. A revised PSA for DFID, covering the years 2001-04 will be published shortly as Command Paper 4808.

[131174]<P>

<P>
<a name="00718w06.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The only body which meets these criteria is CDC Group plc. It is not a company limited by guarantee, nor is it a charity. CDC Group plc has a formal legal basis and was formerly a statutory corporation. On 8 December 1999 CDC was registered as a plc in accordance with, and by virtue of, the CDC Act 1999. CDC is presently wholly owned by Government. The Secretary of State for International Development holds the shares, less one which is held by the Treasury Solicitor. It is to these two members that CDC Group plc is responsible.

 The objectives of the UK's development programme to Nepal are set out in the Country Strategy Paper, published in November 1998 (a copy of which I am placing in the House of Commons Library). More recently we have been working with other Donors to help the Government implement its Reform Programme which was announced at the Development Forum meeting at Paris in April. This focuses on key areas such as macro- economic stability and fiscal administration, creating an enabling environment for private sector development, financial sector reform, and better governance (including decentralisation, anti-corruption measures, and civil service reform).

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the UK's progress towards meeting the G7 commitment on debt relief.  [131188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w07.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 So far, eight countries have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, which is fewer than we had hoped. Some countries who could benefit from HIPC debt relief are involved in conflict, or have failed to demonstrate their commitment to tackling poverty. At the Spring Meetings of the World bank and IMF in April, the Government's proposal to establish a joint World bank/IMF committee to oversee the implementation process was agreed. The committee has begun its work and should provide a focus for efforts to meet the target set by the G7 at the Cologne meeting, that three quarters of eligible countries start to receive debt relief before the end of 2000.
<P>

<a name="00718w07.html_para0">We have committed over $315 million to the Trust Fund established under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt Initiative to help the multilateral financial institutions fund their shares of HIPC costs. This is the largest contribution from any country. The figure includes our share of the substantial EC contribution for which we pressed; our contribution to the costs of the IMF delivering its HIPC debt relief is additional. We expect the whole of our commitment to be disbursed over the next three years.

<a name="00718w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 On 14 December 1999, during the Second Reading of the Terrorism Bill in the House of Commons, the Home Secretary announced that in parallel with the passage of the Bill the Government would conduct a review of the Diplock court arrangements. The Review Group has now completed its work and presented its report to the Secretary of State. The report was placed in the libraries at Westminster on 4 July and I enclose a copy for information.
<P>

<a name="00718w07.html_para1">While the Government's overall objective remains a return to jury trial for all offences in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State agrees with the Review Group's recommendation that the time is not yet right for such a move. The Review Group's report also addresses a number of detailed points in relation to the operation of the Diplock court and will be considered further by the Secretary of State.

 Further to the statement of the Home Secretary on 10 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 133W, that he would not order the extradition of Roisin McAliskey to Germany, the Crown Prosecution Service, in accordance with this country's obligations under Article 7 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, has considered whether to prosecute Roisin McAliskey in this country for the offences allegedly committed in Germany in relation to the Osnabruk bombing of 28 June 1996.
<P>

<a name="00718w07.html_para2">The test applied by the Crown Prosecution Service is the test set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors that applies to all prosecution will be commenced or proceeded with only if there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and that prosecution is in the public interest.

<a name="00718w07.html_para3">The Crown Prosecution Service, having taken the advice of Senior Treasury Counsel, has concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of convicting Miss McAliskey for any offence arising out of the Osnabruk bombing. It has reached that conclusion having taken into account the available evidence and the likely result of any argument that may be put forward by Miss McAliskey that to prosecute her now would be an abuse of process.
<P>

In this instance, the Home Secretary, in a written reply, 20 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 742W, said that this matter would be considered for prosecution in the United Kingdom. It is right that the House should be informed of the outcome of those considerations.

Education authorities are also under a duty to monitor home education to ensure that the education a child receives is suitable to their age, ability, aptitude and any special educational need they may have.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what initiatives have been taken by the Council of Ministers, or Commission of the European Community, concerning the desirability and practicality of requiring registration, under commonly agreed conditions, of road haulage firms within the Community licensed to carry goods on surface or sub-surface routes across the sea between the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Community, other than the Republic of Ireland.  [128851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A system of registration already exists. Since the entry into force of Council Regulation (EEC) 881-92 on 1 January 1993, hauliers seeking to operate internationally within the Community must be in possession of a Community Authorisation certificate as issued by the licensing authorities in the country in which they are established. This applies to heavy goods vehicle traffic to and from the Irish Republic as well as to haulage operations on mainland Europe.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the HOMES scheme and similar mobility schemes for social housing tenants; and if he will make a statement.  [130233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The activities of HOMES are monitored on an ongoing basis by the DETR. In particular through a requirement on HOMES to agree annual objectives with the Department; to report on their achievement of objectives; and to submit a three year business plan. The level of grant funding DETR provides to HOMES is subject to effective implementation of the plan. The Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all" sets out the Government's proposals to promote lettings and transfers policies that offer more choice for existing and prospective tenants of social housing. The role and effectiveness of mobility schemes will be an important consideration. The Government will consider responses to the Green Paper and would wish to discuss any proposals with key interested parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Statutory guidance issued by the Housing Corporation requires registered social landlords (RSLs) to make available at least of 50 per cent. of their lettings to local authority nominees from the housing register, in order to comply with the duty of co-operation placed on RSLs under section 170 of the Housing Act 1996. Under current arrangements, RSLs with more than 250 units of accommodation or 250 bed spaces are required to provide comprehensive data about households and properties in respect of all their lettings. The Housing Green Paper states that the Government will be reviewing--with a view to strengthening--the current obligation on RSLs to co-operate with local authorities in offering accommodation to people on authorities' housing registers. The Government will consider responses to the Green Paper before deciding how to take this forward, and would wish to discuss

<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government consider that stock transfer is an important way of improving the quality and availability of affordable social housing. The proposed selection criteria do not explicitly address the issue of homelessness because, following the transfer of their housing stock, local housing authorities retain their obligations towards homeless households under Part VII of the Housing Act 1996. They must also continue to keep a register of applicants who qualify for the allocation of accommodation. To ensure they have access to accommodation to enable them to discharge their housing functions, authorities generally negotiate nomination rights with the transfer landlord of between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of the transferred stock.

 Estimates for 1998 of the amount of previously developed land that is unused or may be available for redevelopment, including how much may be suitable for housing, are published on the National Land Use Database website (www.nlud.org.uk).

<P>
<a name="00718w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Secretary of State expects Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council to contribute towards the regional target of 61 per cent. contained in Regional Planning Guidance for the West Midlands (RPG 11: April 1998). Local authorities are required to set their own land recycling targets in development plans which will contribute to attaining the regional target. It is understood that in its review of the local plan the borough council proposes to exceed the regional target. The Government's Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (March 2000) confirms the national target of 60 per cent. of additional housing on previously developed land and requires local authorities to give priority to the re-use of such land within urban areas in allocating sites for housing in development plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many representations have been received to the consultations initiated by GOSE on PPG3 and RP69; how many of these were <i>(a)</i> on the official response form and <i>(b)</i> in other forms; and what weight was given to each such type of response.  [131320]<P>

<P>
<a name="00718w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My Department consulted on PPG3 last year and received 620 responses, of which the majority were supportive. Final PPG3 was published in March of this year. The Government Office for the South East led the consultation on draft RPG9 this year and have received 922 responses, all of which are being considered very carefully irrespective of the form in which they were made.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many new motor cars were registered at the DVLA in each month from January 1999 to May 2000 using <i>(a)</i> the DVLA form V55/1 and <i>(b)</i> the DVLA form V55/5.  [131323]<P>

 Figures for the first registration of new motor cars categorised by the type of application form used are not readily available. Vehicles registered on form V55/1 include all types of new vehicles. Vehicles first registered on form V55/5 include vehicles that are not new. Many new vehicles are registered by motor dealers using an electronic system, known as AFRL (automated first registration and licensing). These cases do not use a paper form, but would have used the V55/1 form if they had not been processed through the AFRL system. The table

 I take every opportunity to discuss, with our counterparts, the UK's international activities to combat the trade in illicit drugs. We take the lead in co-ordinating and prioritising such activities across Government in close co-operation with the UK anti-drugs co-ordinator Keith Hellawell. The UK plays an active role in international forums dealing with the threat posed by illicit drugs, including in the UN G8 and EU. Last year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office spent over &#163;6.5 million on international counter-drugs activities.

The surveys identify trends and changes in customer requirements as well as providing information on delivery of service.

 There are two public records concerning the Royal Family dating from before the First World War which have not been opened. These are both Treasury records. The first concerns the taxation and property rating of members of the Royal Family for the period 1899-1904 and is due for release in 2005; the second concerns Queen Alexandra's annuity and income tax in the period 1910-1914 and is due to be opened in 2015. (They are closed in accordance with Lord Chancellor's Instruments 5 and 6 respectively.) The guidance under which these records were closed for 100 years is currently being re-examined by the Cabinet Office and Public Record Office.

They are closed in accordance with Lord Chancellor's Instrument 12. There are approximately 65 items originating from the predecessors of the Crown Estate dating from 1900-1914 which are still closed. These concern leases or other property assignments which are still current. There are three records dating from 1876-1914 concerning activities of the Secret Service in Ireland and Irish terrorist organisations which are currently retained. The sensitivity of these records is currently being reassessed.

 The Northern Regional Legal Services Committee of the then Legal Aid Board carried out an assessment of the need for legal services in Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, Hartlepool and Stockton during the course of 1998.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what was the total amount <i>(a)</i> paid and <i>(b)</i> received in respect of legal aid, broken down by (i) costs recouped under orders for costs, (ii) value-added tax, (iii) savings on national insurance payments and (iv) other income in the last year for which figures are available.  [130414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board (which was replaced by the Legal Services Commission on 1 April 2000) recovered costs totalling &#163;318,366,000, overwhelmingly from matters dealt with in the civil courts. The Board paid costs to the opponents of funded clients totalling &#163;2,229,000. It is not possible to separate out the proportion of either the receipts or payments that were paid under the orders for costs.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para0">The Legal Aid Board was not required to account separately for VAT and some payment systems that it operated do not recognise VAT as a separate item. Since not all disbursements attract VAT, and not all solicitors and counsel are registered for VAT, it is not possible to calculate the amount of VAT that was paid out of, or into the legal aid Fund.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para1">There are no national insurance savings that the Commission is aware of that had an effect on the Fund.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para2">Other income to the legal aid Fund during 1999-2000 totalled &#163;159,820,000. This includes such items as contributions paid by funded clients, moneys recovered through statutory charges placed on property gained or kept by funded clients with the benefit of legal aid, and interest on these charges.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w18.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department for what reason the Legal Aid Board was renamed; and what estimate he has made of the costs arising from this change.  [130415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board has not been renamed. It was replaced on 1 April 2000 by a new executive non-departmental public body--the Legal Services Commission--established under Part I of the Access to Justice Act 1999. The Commission is charged with establishing, maintaining and developing two new services for the provision of publicly funded legal services--the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service. The Commission has also taken over the functions of the Legal Aid Board in relation to any cases being conducted under the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1988. The appointments of the Chair and members of the Commission were announced on 17 December 1999 and 9 March 2000 respectively. However, costs directly

 The Northern Ireland Court Service does not hold any records concerning the activities of the RIC or the murder of Owen McMahon in 1922. There is a Ministry of Home Affairs file on the case which is held by the Public Records (Northern Ireland) Office and which is open to the public. All records listed and indexed by the Public Records (Northern Ireland) Office for review have been completed up to 1970.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when his review of section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 will be completed.  [130533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 prevents the disclosure of information about the use of animals in scientific procedures that has been provided in confidence. Under the proposals for the Freedom of Information Bill, all statutory bars are being reviewed, including section 24.

<P>
<a name="00718w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Dogs are primarily used in medicinal drug research and development and in pharmaceutical safety and efficacy evaluations. They are also used, when no other species is suitable, in the evaluation of cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory problems in humans. Such work contributes to advances in human healthcare. Dogs are also used in the development of veterinary medicines and techniques.
<P>

Member on 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 380W and on 12 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 595W, I stated that members of the public often find it particularly difficult to accept that species that are kept as domestic pets or companion animals, such as dogs, are also used in research to find cures for illnesses. Such animals must be purpose bred and supplied by designated establishments and can be used only if there is no viable alternative for that particular procedure.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para5">Dogs are used in regulated procedures where their use is justified under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. There are no current plans to change the legislation. All applications to use protected animals in research are subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para6">We are continuing to work to ensure that animals are only used where it is fully justified and where there are no alternatives which replace the use of animals, reduce the numbers of animals used, or refine the procedures in which they are used.
<P>

<a name="00718w18.html_para7">Figures in recent years reflect a downward trend in the use of dogs in research. I should emphasise that dogs are used only in about a quarter of one per cent. of all procedures.

That study indicates

that 18 trafficking cases were identified by the police during 1998, involving 71 women. The majority of those women claimed to come from Europe and the remainder from Brazil and Thailand. The study indicates that these figures do not reveal the full extent of this phenomenon and makes a number of recommendations about tackling it. These are currently being considered by the Government.

 The Government are aware of concerns about the operation of the disclosure provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. Since the beginning of this year, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has received three letters from Members of Parliament and one from a member of the public on this issue. Action is well underway to address these concerns.
<P>

<a name="00718w19.html_para0">The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has made disclosure a business priority for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and has initiated a programme of work focusing on the basic principles of disclosure, with a special emphasis on the prosecutor's duty to ensure a fair trial. He has asked Chief Crown Prosecutors to take up with Chief Constables any concerns that they may have with police disclosure practice in their area. Last year, the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate undertook a thematic review of disclosure and its report was published in March. The recommendations in that report are being considered and taken forward in the form of an action plan as part of the DPP's programme of work. The Association of Chief Police Officers has also established a working party to look into the working of the disclosure provisions in relation to the police.

 Information on the age of persons detained under Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 powers is not held centrally. Nor is a central record kept of cases where age is disputed, whether or not the person is detained. The information requested is, therefore, available only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00718w19.html_para4">Our policy, however, is that where we are satisfied a person is under 18 he or she should be detained only in very limited circumstances. The detention of minors using immigration powers is always regrettable. Unaccompanied children should never be detained other than in the most exceptional circumstances and then only overnight with appropriate care if they, for example, arrive alone at an airport. Where he or she cannot be cared for by responsible family or friends in the United Kingdom, an unaccompanied child should be placed in the care of the local authority while the circumstances of the case are determined.

In addition to existing facilities for detaining families, extra family accommodation has recently been made available at Oakington Reception Centre, where families may be held together for around seven days if it appears that their applications can be decided quickly. Occasionally, the detention of families is necessary to effect the removal of those who have no authority to remain in this country but who refuse to leave voluntarily. In such circumstances, detention should be planned to be effected as close to removal as possible so that families are not normally detained for more than a few days.

 As I indicated in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) on 22 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 370W, the Immigration Services Commissioner took up post on that date. The Commissioner is in the process of consulting widely within the advice sector in order to formulate the rules and standards which will govern the regulatory scheme. The Commissioner expects to have published the documents required by Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and to be ready to consider exemptions and applications for registration from 30 October 2000. We expect the full regulatory scheme to come into force in April 2001.

<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the compatibility of the disqualification of priests of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church from membership of the House with the United Kingdom's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  [130664]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00718w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The disqualification of priests from standing or acting as Members of Parliament was the subject of a Private Member's Bill in June 1999. Since this measure was lost, we have been sounding out opinion of the relevant churches in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, there is no immediate prospect of legislation being brought forward by the Government.
<P>

<a name="00718w20.html_para1">The question of compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights would be a matter for those bringing forward a relevant Bill.

 We are not aware of any difficulties for those using 1951 Convention travel documents (blue) when travelling to France and have not, therefore, had cause to discuss this with the French authorities. However, we are aware that a number of European Union partners will no longer accept the Certificate of Identity (CID) issued by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. This is a brown travel document issued to

certain foreign nationals, other than refugees, who are resident in the United Kingdom and cannot obtain a national passport on which to travel. This type of document is not issued under international convention but has been widely accepted for travel in the past. It is for the authorities of each country to decide whether they will accept the CID as a valid form of travel document. However, my officials are in discussion with colleagues in the various European Union countries in order to identify their particular concerns and if possible provide any reassurance which might encourage them to accept the CID for travel.
