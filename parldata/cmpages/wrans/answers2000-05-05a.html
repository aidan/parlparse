<P>
<a name="00505w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the <i>(a)</i> estimated (i) capital and (ii) revenue cost of establishing and <i>(b)</i> projected staffing establishment of each local arm of the Learning and Skills Council in England for each of the next three years.  [119254]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00505w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Estimates of the capital and revenue costs of establishing each local Council are not available as these will depend on the outcome of individual negotiations in each area to secure premises and to establish teams of staff. We estimate the total transitional costs of moving to the new arrangements to be some &#163;60 million to &#163;65 million over the next two years (2000-02). Overall, we estimate that the new arrangements will from 2001-02 produce savings in administration of at least &#163;50 million per year compared with the current position.
<P>

<a name="00505w01.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> Projections of the staff numbers in each local Council for each of the next three years are not available since these matters will be determined by the Learning and Skills Council itself when it comes into being. However, for planning purposes we estimate that local Councils will on average have 80-90 staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to improve the pay and conditions of part-time lecturers in further and higher education.  [121069]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00505w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Pay and conditions for FE and HE staff are an important issue, although the detailed arrangements are for employers to determine. We have increased the funding for higher education by over &#163;1 billion over the four years to 2001-02. And we have made the biggest ever investment in FE, increasing funds from &#163;3.1 billion in 1998-99 to &#163;3.9 billion in 2001-02. We are encouraging employers and unions to work together on a sensible way forward under the improved circumstances we have created.

<P>
<a name="00505w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when the remaining provisions of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will be implemented; and if he will make a statement.  [121312]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00505w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 We have decided that the final stage of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act should come into force on 1 October 2004. From that date, in addition to their current duties, service providers will have to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or provide a reasonable means of avoiding physical features which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service.
<P>

<a name="00505w01.html_para5">I asked the National Disability Council to review the existing Code of Practice to take account of this final stage of the duties on service providers. A revised version of the Code and a Practical Guide for service providers were handed over to the Disability Rights Commission when it began operating on 25 April. Public consultation on the revised Code of Practice and Guide, and 



<P>
<P><I>5 May 2000 : Column: 221W</I><P>
the Government's proposals for a small number of Regulations under the Act, starts on 8 May and will last for three months.
<P>

<a name="00505w01.html_para6">The Commission will consider the views expressed in the consultation before preparing final versions of the Code and Guide.

Clearance for low level operation will follow when trials work is complete.

 Under section 13 of the Public Order Act 1986, a chief officer of police may apply to the district council for an order prohibiting marches or processions which he reasonably believes may result in serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community. Such an order requires my consent. In London, the Commissioners of Police may 



<P>
<P><I>5 May 2000 : Column: 224W</I><P>
apply direct to me as Home Secretary for such consent. The chief officer may also attach conditions to such marches and to public assemblies. There is no power to prohibit peaceful public assemblies.
<P>

<a name="00505w02.html_para0">Section 14A of the 1986 Act similarly enables a chief officer to apply for and order prohibiting trespassory assemblies within a specified area, if he reasonably believes that such an assembly may result in serious disruption to the life of the community or in significant damage to land or buildings of historical, architectural, archaeological or scientific importance.

 The Instructions and Guidance the Deputy Prime Minister gave the Franchising Director in September last year set out six criteria for him to take into consideration when assessing bids for new franchises. They are: the commitment of existing franchise operators to performance, customer services, innovation, investment and efficiency; the extent to which extra or earlier investment can be obtained; the extent to which better performance can be secured; the extent to which integrated transport measures can be achieved; the extent to which passengers will be given a greater voice in the level and standard of services and; affordability and value for money to the tax payer. The Franchising Director announced on 14 March the shortlisted bidders for the East Coast Main Line franchise. I understand that he is having separate discussions about improved services to Hull.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2000]:</i> During the transitional period of the Groundwater Regulations 1998, from 1 January to 31 March 1999, the Environment Agency received over 12,000 applications from farmers in England and Wales for groundwater authorisations representing a total of around &#163;1 million. From 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 the Agency received a further 131 applications amounting to total charges of around &#163;12,000. Around &#163;870,000 has been paid by farmers to the Agency as annual "maintenance" charges in respect of authorisations. This will be reimbursed following the announcement, in March, of the Government's Agriculture Strategy. The total charges payable for the current and subsequent years will depend on the number of applications made by farmers for authorisations, though the Agency's current estimates would indicate total charges to farmers for new applications of up to &#163;300,000 for 2000-01. The administration of the Regulations in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive.

<a name="00505w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Ministerial approval of plans for the refurbishment of the Treasury building under the private finance initiative was announced by the former Chief Secretary on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 400-01. Under the terms of the project agreement signed last year, the Treasury's private sector partner, Exchequer Partnership plc (EP), is responsible for a number of risks, including obtaining town planning and listed building consents and securing the funding to finance the works. Both conditions have now been satisfied and the deal has therefore reached financial close. Work is planned to start on site on 17 July (the date of granting vacant possession of the Park end of the building) with completion in August 2002.
<P>

<a name="00505w04.html_para3">The contract, which is for 37 years and one month from vacant possession, provides for the Treasury to pay an annual payment (the Unitary Payment) to EP in return for fully serviced accommodation to performance standards specified in advance. The Unitary Payment has been fixed in real terms at &#163;14.037 million in March 1999 prices and will be uprated annually in line with the retail prices index.

<a name="00505w06.html_para0">Our White Paper, "Conclusions of The Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee", Cm 4071, stated that it was not possible to quantify the impact of the new energy framework on emissions. This is because the aim of the policy is not to achieve any particular outcome in terms of fuel mix in generation, but to create a level playing field so that all forms of generation can compete equally and as a temporary precautionary measure to ensure the artificial encouragement for new gas plant that has arisen from distortions to the electricity market does not artificially undermine security and diversity of supply.
<P>

<a name="00505w06.html_para1">I announced on Monday 17 April that I would be lifting the stricter consents policy in October 2000 as soon as the new electricity trading arrangements were in place. The Government are determined to meet the UK commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2008-12. The stricter consents policy and the timetable for its lifting are entirely consistent with meeting that target, and with moving towards our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. on 1990 levels.

Our view is that consumers should be allowed the greatest possible amount of choice consistent with adequate health protection, but there is limited support for this position from other member states. Most believe that controls on supplements should be based on the premise that the dose supplied should be restricted to a level close to that needed to ensure an adequate intake of nutrients.

 As part of the Government's Action Plan for Farming it was confirmed that, subject to agreement with the industry on a system of general binding rules, the Environment Agency's interim and longer-term charge for an IPPC permit in England and Wales should be less than half the &#163;12,000-&#163;18,000 originally proposed. IPPC charges in Scotland are devolved and are therefore a matter for Scottish Ministers. Arrangements for Northern Ireland are still being considered. Our inquiries indicate

that many other member states will be passing on costs for IPPC to intensive livestock installations, although some have yet to decide how to implement IPPC and what charges will be made. The Environment Agency is currently undertaking a fuller study of the position which will inform the development of a longer-term charging scheme in England and Wales.

 The Government have sought to design the climate change levy in a way that maximises its environmental effectiveness while taking account of the competitiveness of UK firms. The impact of the climate change levy on individual sectors of the agricultural industry will depend, among other things, on each sector's future energy use, employment trends and take-up of the various incentives offered under the levy to improve energy efficiency. Further, reductions in the rate of levy are available to the energy-intensive sectors of pigs and poultry in return for reaching agreed energy targets and, subject to approval under state aid rules, a 50 per cent. reduction to horticulture.

<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para2">

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
At present, three members of Agency staff in the Lancashire and Merseyside regions carry out inspectoral duties, which include investigating the earnings of the self-employed and company directors and conducting interviews under caution. However the Wales and North West Business Unit plan to train an additional 25 officers to undertake inspectoral visits, of whom seven will operate in the Lancashire and Merseyside regions.
<BR>
Under current legislation child support inspectors are appointed on a case by case basis which means that they must be given a time-limited certificate of appointment for each individual case. As a result, CSA Inspectors have not, to date, been used to their best effect. This rigid and cumbersome method of appointment has prevented the Agency from building up a team of dedicated and experienced inspectors.
<BR>
However, the Agency has increased the number of locally based face to face officers to 600, a process that was completed at the end of March this year. The Agency is currently considering whether some, or all, of the face to face officers should also perform the role of child support inspectors or whether separate dedicated teams of inspectors would be more effective. Under the child support reforms it is planned to appoint permanent inspectors.

<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para4">

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
No specific IT Procurement contracts have been awarded to EDS since 1/5/97. However, the Department's private sector partner Affinity (prime contractor EDS) was awarded an early contract in March 1999, to provide products key to the future development of modernised IT for the Department.
<BR>
In addition, to maintain progress against legislative timescales for Child Support Reforms, an interim contract for early IT pre- development and preparation work was let to Affinity 23/12/99, to deliver products which pave the way for new IT for the CSA. In both cases, neither the contracts nor their products were intended to deliver an operational IT system.
<BR>
The Department does not hold an existing contract with EDS, awarded in 1995, for the provision of some mainframe-based IT and associated services.
<BR>
A number of consultancy contracts are also held with EDS to help determine the Department's business and financial requirements relevant to the delivery of the full IT systems, under the main contracts.
<BR>
The award of all contracts has been subject to the Department's formal procurement controls to ensure fair and open competition.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what arrangements exist to provide income maintenance for persons who are forced to suspend a course of postgraduate education because of illness.  [118911]

<P>
<a name="00505w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para7">Responsibility for postgraduate awards is shared with the Arts and Humanities Research Board or one of the six Research Councils, depending on the field of study. Each Research Council is an independent body, free, within the terms of its Charter and the resources available to it, to make its own decisions about expenditure on postgraduate support.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para8">Support for postgraduate teacher training is generally provided by my Department under the Student Support Regulations. Maintenance support is in the form of a student loan. Support is payable for absence from a course due to illness for up to 60 days, and for longer periods at the discretion of the relevant local education authority, which will take into account financial hardship.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para9">The Department provides support to 50 postgraduate students at three European Institutions, the Bologna Center, the College of Europe and the European University Institute and provides continuing support for the first 60 days of illness. Thereafter each case is considered by my Department on its own merits.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para10">In relation to Research Council students, where a student becomes sick during their studies, arrangements vary depending on the awarding body and the nature of the course. The Economic and Social Research Council, for example, allows a student's grant to continue unaffected for the first eight weeks of sickness. The Medical Research Council continue to pay the grant at the full rate for the first 21 days of sickness and at half rate for the next 28 days and would then suspend payment.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para11">Separate, broadly similar arrangements apply in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the system of support for postgraduates largely follows that for undergraduates and, in the main, continues to be paid during periods of illness.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para12">Additional assistance for postgraduate students studying in the UK who are absent from their course due to illness may be available through the Access Funds. These allow universities and colleges to provide extra discretionary support for students in particular need; and a total of &#163;76.4 million has been made available in England for the 1999-2000 academic year.
<P>

<a name="00505w11.html_para13">Full-time students who interrupt their studies because of illness and have been incapable of work for 28 weeks may be eligible for income support. Details of benefits are a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security.
