 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his suggested alternatives are for income generation for poppy growers in <i> (a)</i> Helmand province and <i> (b)</i> other Afghan provinces. [85758]</p>

 After decades of conflict, the lack of investment in basic infrastructure, poor governance and drought, much of Afghanistan's productivity has been lost or re-directed towards poppy cultivation and drug trafficking. As 70 per cent. of the population are rural, agriculture provides the best opportunity for alternative income generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="60718w0001.htm_para0"><a name="060718120000043">Helmand province was once one of the most agriculturally advanced and productive areas in Afghanistan. It might have the potential to be so again. For examples, the DFID-funded research into alternative livelihoods programme (RALF) is looking at the export potential of grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms egg plants and okra in Helmand and has made contacts with raisin importers, which involves organic and fair trade. The programme is also evaluating at least 10 different small scale agri-processing industries such as tomato paste production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="60718w0001.htm_para1"><a name="060718120000044">Growth in small and medium enterprises and construction has the potential to bring new employment opportunities in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. DFID supports the micro finance investment support facility programme, which provides much needed credit for investment in agriculture, manufacturing, retail and service industries. To date, the programme has brought financial services for some 161,000 people in and around half of the provinces of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="60718w0001.htm_para2"><a name="060718120000045">The development of Afghanistan's natural resources could also provide alternative jobs. Afghanistan possesses energy and mineral resources, many of which are underdeveloped, such as coal, gas, oil, precious metals and semi-precious stones. DFID is funding the British Geological Survey to strengthen the Afghan Geological Survey to develop and promote the mining sector.</p>

Most of this work is taking place in areas where humanitarian operations are ongoing in order to allow UN Agencies such as the World Food Programme to access populations in need, and to do so safely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="60718w0001.htm_para4"><a name="060718120000049">DFID's aid programme in Angola is focused on providing support to meet urgent humanitarian needs. Funding for transport infrastructure has been made in the context of support provided for humanitarian programming. DFID provided &#163;1.15 million to the WFP last year to support the construction of bridges to enable quicker humanitarian access to populations in need. This support has also reduced costs because aid can now travel by road instead of only by air transport.</p>

 The United Nations-African Union technical assessment mission recently returned from Darfur. Their report has yet to be released, though it is expected before the end of July. We expect that it will make recommendations on how the UN can support the African Union, and ultimately take over in Darfur. We do not know yet what form the report will take. It may be an oral briefing, a letter from Kofi Annan or a formal written report. Assuming any written report is made public, I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

 The advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) is that we should not vaccinate poultry in advance of an avian influenza outbreak, or as an immediate disease control response. Although currently available vaccines are able to reduce mortality, it is possible that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of transmitting the disease if they become infected, but might not display symptoms of disease. This would increase the time taken to detect and eradicate the virus. High standards of surveillance and biosecurity, early reporting of suspect cases and culling remain the most effective ways of preventing avian influenza and tackling an outbreak.</p>

captive birds. This is not a change in policy. The CVO has recommended this step as part of sensible contingency planning in the light of uncertainties about the future spread and nature of the virus, and the possibility of as yet unforeseen circumstances. The vaccine would only be used if a risk assessment and scientific evidence indicated it would help to prevent disease spread.</p>

 Responsibility for tackling fuel poverty in England is shared between the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Following the Energy Review, we will be taking forward work with energy suppliers and other key players to examine how the continuing challenge of fuel poverty can be best addressed.

 According to data published by Eurostat in 2004 the United Kingdom ranked 17<sup>(th)</sup> of the 25 member states of the EU in terms of the share of electricity from renewable energy to gross electricity consumption. In 1995 the UK ranked 19<sup>(th)</sup> and if all countries meet their 2010 targets the UK will move up to 15<sup>(th)</sup>. It should be noted that the countries that rank highest (Austria, Latvia and Sweden) have significant and well developed hydro resources and plentiful supplies of biomass (mainly wood).</p>

 The UK's gas import dependence is set to rise to 80-90 per cent. by 2020, of which a significant proportion is expected to be imported from the European mainland through existing and planned interconnection capacity. The International Energy Agency forecast that the EU will import 25 per cent. of its gas needs from Russia by 2030. It is, therefore, possible that some Russian gas will be imported into the UK, albeit indirectly and commingled with gas from other sources (such as Norway, the Netherlands and LNG from outside Europe) as part of the European gas system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="60718w0009.htm_para14"><a name="06071921001066">The contractual origin of imports into the UK is a decision for companies operating in the UK's liberalised gas market, taking into account elements such as cost, reliability, availability and the need for a diverse range of sources to provide security of supply. Given that there is no direct physical interconnection capacity with Russia and contractual flows do not necessarily follow physical flows, estimates of the type requested are not made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="60718w0009.htm_para15"><a name="06071921001067">Given that the UK does not import directly from Russia, any impact on the UK from Russia's legislation or compliance with international agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty will be felt most directly through its effect on European markets. As such, the UK will continue to press for open, competitive and liberalised European energy markets.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 July 2006]:</i> Meetings between officials from the then ODPM and Swindon borough council during 2004 and 2005 were intended to encourage a sustained focus by the Council on overall improvement of its performance. By December 2005, Swindon had improved from a Comprehensive Performance Assessment rating of &#147;poor&#148; to achieve a rating of two stars and &#147;improving well&#148;. In the light of this improved performance, ODPM&#146;s close engagement with Swindon borough council ceased in early 2006 as it was considered to have achieved its objectives. Swindon continues to receive support, where necessary, from the Government Office for the South West.</p>

 There are many opportunities in the school curriculum for raising awareness of physical, medical and mental disabilities. Through the non-statutory Personal, Social and Health Education framework and statutory National Curriculum Citizenship Education, pupils are taught that differences and similarities between people arise from a number of factors, including disability, and about the need for mutual respect and understanding. Pupils are encouraged to reflect on spiritual, moral, social, and cultural issues, using imagination to understand other people&#146;s experiences. They are taught about the causes, symptoms and treatments for stress and depression, and to identify strategies for prevention and management and how to seek professional advice confidently and find information about health. National Curriculum Science also examines how human health is affected by a range of environmental and inherited factors.</p>

 We have a number of concerns about the human rights situation in Haiti, many of which are linked to the political instability and violence that the country has experienced in recent years. Several of the allegations of abuse relate to actions by the police and the judicial system. These include excessive use of force, involvement in kidnappings, detainment without trial, existence of political prisoners and violence against women. Supporting the reform of the police, prisons and judicial system is therefore a major priority for the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. The determination expressed by the recently elected President Pr&#233;val to tackle human rights problems in Haiti has been encouraging.</p>

frequent contact is maintained between officials from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Communities and Local Government regarding veterans housing matters. Our main focus is on improving access to housing for Service personnel while they are still serving or are at the point of leaving the Service. This applies to both single Service personnel and those with families, and is intended to facilitate a smooth transition to civilian life. Measures already in place to assist all personnel leaving the Services include the provision of comprehensive information and advice on housing options and the MOD Nominations Scheme, which facilitates access for Service leavers to housing with 43 registered social landlords and councils across the UK. In recognition of their specific needs, the Single Persons Accommodation Centre for the Ex-Services provides an advice and placement service for single Service leavers.</p>

so that they can now inquire into a wide range of possible contributory factors (although sentencing policy will rarely, if ever, be a directly contributory factor to a death in an individual case). In addition, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman conducts his own independent inquiry into any death of a young person in a young offender institution or a secure training centre; and the Local Safeguarding Children&#146;s Board is likely to commission a serious case review under Part 8 of the joint Department for Education and Skills/Home Office/Department of Health guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999). Many of the young people who become involved in serious or persistent offending are at risk of self-harm, whether or not they are in custody. It is not possible to quantify how many young people&#146;s health, including mental health, has been positively assisted by care received while in custody.

 No assessment has been made of this specific risk. However, since 11 April 2005 all door supervisors working on licensed premises have been required to be licensed by the Security Industry Authority. This requires them to undertake training and a criminality check from the Criminal Records Bureau. If an applicant is found guilty of identity theft it is highly likely that he will be refused a licence. If a licensed door supervisor is subsequently found guilty of identity theft then it is also highly likely that his licence will be revoked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="60718w0034.htm_para4"><a name="06071921004606">In their 2004-05 business plan the Security Industry Authority (SIA) estimated that the total licensable population was just over 221,000. The SIA has continued to update its estimates in the light of operational experience and the current estimate is that about 183,000 individuals require a licence. The majority of this change is due to the revision of the estimated size of the door supervisor sector. A breakdown of these figures by each type of licence is in the following table.</p>

 It is not possible to calculate the numbers of licensed or unlicensed security guards and door supervisors on a regional basis. The national figures for England and Wales are as follows.

<i> [holding answer 21 June 2006]:</i> The Security Industry Authority (SIA) do not calculate the average processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_638"><a name="60718w0035.htm_para1"><a name="06071921004910">Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between four and six weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 12 weeks to process most applications.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 July 2006]:</i> The Security Industry Authority (SIA) do not calculate the average processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued.</p>
