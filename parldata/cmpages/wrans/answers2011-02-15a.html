Contributions to the EU Budget vary over time, mainly driven by the member states' share in national income. For this reason, it is not possible to state exactly the UK liability in the event of a default by a member state. As an illustrative example, based on contributions to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 14% of the default amount.</p>

These multipliers are set out in Table C8 of the interim OBR's June Budget document A figure of 0.6, for example, means that a measure which has a direct effect of raising revenue by 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to reduce aggregate demand in the economy by 0.6 per cent in the short run. A multiplier of 1 was judged to be appropriate for changes in capital expenditure, while a multiplier of 0.6 was applied to changes in VAT.</p>

These immediate effects are reduced over time through a number of processes as the economy adjusts, including a monetary policy response and real wage adjustments.</p>

 The forward-looking fiscal mandate addresses a key failing of the framework of fiscal rules that was in place from 1997 to 2008; the formulation of the golden rule adopted during this period required the Government to balance the current budget over the economic cycle. This resulted in an approach that was too backward-looking, especially at the end of the economic cycle, allowing persistent fiscal deficits when growth was strong, on the basis of past surpluses.</p>

 The UK has been trialling a catch quota management system verified by on-board remote electronic monitoring. Under this system, all fish caught, including juveniles, count against quota and fishermen have to stop fishing once the quota is reached. Total mortality is fixed under this system, unlike a landings based quota which simply limits the amount of fish that can be landed. The results of the North sea cod trial run in 2010 were very promising and indicate that this system can significantly reduce discards. We are running a further trial this year with more vessels and different stocks, and the evidence collected is being used to influence the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>

 The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) provides scientific advice on fish stocks in European waters.

Based on the most recent ICES advice, this information is available for 23 stocks of UK interest, 12 of which are considered to be overexploited either due to the number of fish being below the precautionary level or fishing pressure being too high.

 Under European legislation, pesticide active substances are first evaluated at Community level. A key part of this process is an assessment of the risks to wildlife, including bees. If an active substance meets the EU safety requirements then products containing that active substance can be authorised at member state level, taking into account that country's individual agronomic, climatic and dietary requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="110215w0003.htm_para9"><a name="11021589000537">In the UK, pesticide products can only be sold or used after they have been authorised. As part of this process, the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD) of the Health and Safety Executive (the Government body responsible for regulating pesticides) undertakes an assessment of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment (in particular honey bees) may be exposed. The purpose being to ensure that the use of the product poses no unacceptable risks.</p>

Users are also legally obliged to take all reasonable precautions to protect the health of human beings, creatures and plants. Advice on how this can be done is set out in a statutory "Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products" which, among other things, contains guidance on minimising the exposure of bees to pesticides.</p>

 To prevent new pests and diseases arriving in trade, all imports of trees from third countries are subject to inspection for known pests and diseases under the EU Plant Health regime; import controls are updated on the basis of risks identified through pest risk analysis. Consignments of some tree species moved within the European Union are covered by plant passports issued by the grower to attest to the health status of the trees. Given concerns about the efficacy of these measures, the entire EU Plant Health regime is currently undergoing a major review and we will be working to ensure that the level of security under the new arrangements is fit for purpose. In the context of the review the UK is pushing for faster decision making so that risks are tackled when first identified, as well as improved controls which take into account the risks inherent in trade in plants and plant products.</p>

2. The figures have been taken from the NHS Pension Scheme Resource Accounts and have not been adjusted for inflation. From 1999 to 2010 the number of active members increased from 959,000 to 1,368,000 and pensioners from 290,000 to 639,000. These figures have been rounded.<br>

1. Expenditure pre 1999-2000 is on a cash basis.<br>
2. Expenditure figures from 1999-00 to 2002-03 are on a Stage 1 resource budgeting basis.<br>
3. Expenditure figures from 2003-04 to 2009-10 are on a Stage 2 resource budgeting basis.<br>
4. Expenditure figures from 2009-10 to 2010-11 are on an aligned basis.<br>
5. Expenditure figures are not consistent over the period (1990-91 to 2010-11) and this should be noted when making comparisons between years.<br>
6. Figures from 2003-04 include a technical adjustment for trust depreciation.<br>
7. Movement in NHS baseline in 2010-11 is due to reversal of capital other Government Department transfers by HM Treasury (£225 million), transfer of social care funding (£148 million capital and £68 million revenue) and reduction in non-trust depreciation (£-18 million).<br>
8. Expenditure excludes NHS annually managed expenditure.<br>
9. Gross domestic product deflator 29 September 2010.<br>
10. Total expenditure is calculated as the sum of revenue and capital expenditure net of non-trust depreciation and impairments. This is in line with HM Treasury Guidance.<br>
<i> Notes (b):</i><br>
11. The data are taken from the audited summarisation schedules, from which the NHS (England) Summarised Accounts are prepared.<br>
12. In common with many other public and private sector organisations the Department of Health only holds accounting data at organisation level for seven years, and therefore we have provided data for 2003-04 to 2009-10.<br>

There will almost certainly remain a need for a residual level of subsidy in the future to maintain those branches which could never be profitable, such as those in remote rural areas which provide a valuable social purpose.

In addition, it was found that a £1,000 per annum increase in grants increases participation by 2.1 percentage points while a £1,000 per annum increase in loans is associated with a 3.2 percentage point increase in participation.</p>

This pattern of shifting participation was most clearly evident for individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds, and for those with the highest key stage 5   <br>

 The Philippines is an emerging economy and one of the largest markets in South East Asia. There is a dedicated UK Trade and investment (UKTI) resource in-country to sell the UK's expertise, secure commercial opportunities and improve market access for British business. The Philippines is also a key component of the outreach programme delivered by UKTI, on behalf of the Asia Task Force, to alert UK business to the potential of Asian markets, Since May 2010, when the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), took over co-chairmanship, seven ATF events have been held around the UK, attracting around 1,000 companies to participate.

Both visits were used to lobby on specific commercial interests, to promote the UK's expertise and to push for progress on market access issues, which will help open the doors for British business. UKTI will continue to work closely with the Government of the Philippines on public-private partnership initiatives to identify commercial opportunities, sell the UK's capabilities and ensure UK business maximise their interests in the Philippines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="110215w0004.htm_para39"><a name="11021589001775">Cardiff Tribunals Service have been dealing with an unprecedented and unforecast increase in the levels of appeals, receiving 73.2% more appeals from 1 April 2010 to 30 September 2010 than during the same period two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="110215w0004.htm_para40"><a name="11021589001776">In response, there has been a significant increase in staffing levels at our Cardiff processing centre, together with a number of initiatives to improve capacity and throughput. The result has been that, between 1 April 2010 and 30 September 2010, the Cardiff Tribunals Service Centre ran over 75% more hearing sessions in the hearing venues it supports than during the same period two years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="110215w0004.htm_para41"><a name="11021589001777">This is also reflected at the Haverfordwest hearing venue where, between 1 April 2010 and 30 September 2010, the number of appeals submitted to the Tribunals Service from that area increased by almost 130% compared with the same period two years ago. In response the number of hearing sessions have been increased by over 162%. Haverfordwest is a hearing venue and no processing staff are permanently based there. There has, however, been a suitable increase in the numbers of staff who are available to clerk hearings at Haverfordwest in order to support this increase in hearing sessions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_572"><a name="110215w0004.htm_para42"><a name="11021589001778">In order to continue to increase hearing capacity in Cardiff, and Haverfordwest in particular, new medically qualified panel members have been recruited in that area and new legal members are currently being recruited. Combined with the additional processing capacity at Cardiff Tribunals Service, these measures are designed to ensure that the waiting times in Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire will begin to reduce in the coming year.</p>
