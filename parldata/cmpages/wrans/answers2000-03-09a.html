 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> Evaporative losses occurring between loading petrol from a storage terminal and delivering it to a retail site have been minimised by the use of vapour recovery systems. Under EC Directive 94/63/EC all storage and distribution terminals delivering more than 50,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of petrol already operate vapour recovery equipment, and all other terminals will have to comply by 2001 or

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on progress in developing a domestic emissions trading scheme.  [113054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government, in their new Draft Climate Change Programme, recognise that carbon emissions trading is a key part of the longer-term solution to greenhouse gas emissions. It will complement other measures in the business sector by offering cost-effective and flexible options for achieving emissions reductions. And an early start to emissions trading in the UK should bring valuable experience and expertise to UK business and to the City of London. This will be particularly important in advance of the international emissions trading scheme envisaged by the Kyoto Protocol, and the European trading scheme put forward in the recent European Commission Green Paper.
<P>

<a name="00309w01.html_para2">The design of a domestic greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme has been taken forward by the business-led UK Emissions Trading Group (ETG), with Government officials working closely alongside. The ETG has made speedy progress in addressing the key issues involved in the design of a domestic emissions trading scheme. Outline proposals for a UK trading scheme were presented to Government in October 1999, and the ETG has recently reported to Government on follow-up work in a number of areas. The group's conclusions have moved the UK significantly along the road to the launch of a domestic trading scheme. But much work on the detail of the scheme remains to be done, and the Government will expect to take this work forward with the Emissions Trading Group.
<P>

<a name="00309w01.html_para3">The Government have also said that firms within climate change levy agreements, who have agreed a target to increase their energy efficiency or reduce their carbon emissions, will be able to use carbon trading as one way of helping them meet their targets. And the Government 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2000 : Column: 778W</I><P>
are currently discussing with members of the Emissions Trading Group and climate change levy agreement sectors the most suitable way for these firms to participate in this trading, and in trading with the wider domestic scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each of the last five years for which figures are available <i>(a)</i> the total allocation to Shrewsbury and Atcham from the Rural Bus Fund and <i>(b)</i> the number of (i) additional and (ii) improved bus services supported by these grants; and if he will make a statement.  [113484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The rural bus subsidy grant is allocated at county council level and it is for each county to decide which services to support. In the first year of the grant, 1998-99, Shropshire county council was allocated &#163;630,354. The same amount has also been allocated to the council for 1999-2000 and 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00309w01.html_para4">In 1998-99 Shropshire county council used its allocation to fund 46 services, of which 16 served Shrewsbury. Of the total of 46 services, 16 were entirely new and 30 improvements to existing services. We shall be obtaining information on any changes to those figures at the end of the current financial year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to which specific classes of freight currently predominately transported by road, his policy on moving freight transport from road to rail applies.  [113485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The policy of encouraging more freight on rail extends to all classes of freight. Freight grant applications are assessed purely on the basis of environmental benefit of lorry miles saved. The process does not take into account the type of goods proposed to be transported by rail.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement about rate relief for businesses in rural areas. [112248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Mandatory rate relief of 50 per cent. is available to the sole village shop or post office in a qualifying settlement (one which is in a designated rural area and has a population of fewer than 3,000), provided the property has a rateable value less than &#163;5,000. Local authorities have the discretion to provide additional relief up to 100 per cent. of the rates bill.




<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2000 : Column: 779W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00309w02.html_para0">Local authorities also have the discretion to provide rate relief of up to 100 per cent. to any other business in a qualifying settlement, which they consider to be of benefit to the community, provided the property concerned has a rateable value less than &#163;10,000.
<P>

<a name="00309w02.html_para1">These rateable value thresholds will be increased to &#163;6,000 and &#163;12,000 respectively on 1 April 2000, when Revaluation takes effect, giving all non-domestic properties in England new rateable values. The thresholds are being increased broadly in line with the overall effects of the revaluation on properties of the size affected, to ensure that no one loses eligibility for rate relief as a result of the general movement in property values.
<P>

<a name="00309w02.html_para2">Rate relief is one of a number of issues affecting rural businesses which will be considered in preparing the forthcoming Rural White Paper.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have received no reports regarding commercial cultivation of Novartis genetically modified Bt maize in Germany.
<P>

<a name="00309w02.html_para3">Novartis Bt maize is not and never has been grown in the United Kingdom and Novartis, through the industry body SCIMAC, have given an assurance that there are no plans to do so in the next few years. Therefore any decisions on cultivation in Germany have no implications for the UK.

[114329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Pending parliamentary approval of powers in the Representation of the People Bill, urgent expenditure on the preparation and delivery of the booklet, estimated at some &#163;0.4 million in 1999-2000, will be met by repayable advances from the Contingencies Fund. The cost of repaying the advances will be met from within the Department's existing provision.

 The NESTA (National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts) programme, created under the National Lottery Act 1998, with &#163;200 million of National Lottery money to invest, exclusively focuses on British creativity and innovation. NESTA's main aims are to nurture talented people to pursue potential and produce services, and to bring the appreciation of science, technology and the arts to the public domain.
<P>

<a name="00309w02.html_para5">While NESTA does not offer support to sporting activities, Sport England's Lottery Fund has created an opportunity to help young people develop their sporting skills and talent, with several million pounds being invested in education based projects. The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) is intended to promote after-school-hours activity with &#163;180 million earmarked across the UK for revenue funding to support after school clubs. NOF has a target of funding 50 per cent. of secondary schools and 25 per cent. of primary schools by 2001 with after-school sports being a major beneficiary. Sport England is now able to solicit applications where it can identify significant need to ensure that young people develop their sporting skills and talent.

 The only UK military aircraft capable of transporting helicopters is the RAF Hercules C130 of which there are currently 54 in service. A C130 can transport one Puma, two Lynx or two Gazelle per flight. The estimated flying time for a Hercules to fly from the

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> We do not account for squadron operating costs in this way. Budgets are broken down to station level only. A station's operating budget would include the costs of personnel, fuel, maintenance and works services, infrastructure, utilities and other overheads, all of which contribute to the proper and effective functioning of squadrons based there. The costs for aircraft maintenance and spares would not be included, as these costs are managed separately on a fleet-wide basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> Current research, funded by the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister, will assess the demand for, and attitude towards, the use of Irish in the provision of services, including bilingual signage. Consideration is being given to commissioning similar research on Ulster-Scots. Otherwise, there has been no separate assessment made of the community relations impact of the erection of bilingual street signs.
<P>

<a name="00309w03.html_para0">As the erection of street nameplates is a function of district councils in Northern Ireland, information on the number of bilingual signs erected and on whether any have subsequently been removed, is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00309w03.html_para1">Currently, information recorded by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on the motivation of a crime can only be obtained manually. It is intended to introduce, during 2001, an Integrated Crime Information System which will permit the central recording of crime motivation, where this can be determined. The system is presently being designed to record the motive of any crime, be it racial, sectarian, domestic or other designated motive, in line with the Association of Chief Police Officers' guidelines.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> In experiments involving strains of prion that have been adapted to laboratory animals, such as mice, it has been shown that intracerebral inoculation is more likely to cause infection than intravenous injection which, in turn, is more likely to cause infection than intra-peritoneal or sub-cutaneous inoculation. Parenteral exposure is, in turn, more likely to cause infection than oral exposure.

The remaining 13 will follow shortly. In November 1999 we launched the second wave of Sure Start by inviting a further 69 areas to develop local programmes, and these are now drawing up their outline plans. This brings the number of Sure Start programmes so far announced to 129, more than half-way towards the target of 250 by March 2002.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced in September last year the revised National Curriculum which will apply from September 2000. The revisions were the outcome of a wide-ranging review and consultation which considered, among other matters, how pupils are taught about food, nutrition and textiles in the curriculum.
<P>

<a name="00309w06.html_para3">Within the revised National Curriculum, food technology (including cooking) and textiles remain within the Design and Technology programmes of study; and nutrition and health eating are covered in Science and Personal, Social and Health Education. Home economics also can play a complementary role, and many schools include it within their curriculum. It is also available as a GCSE option.
<P>

<a name="00309w06.html_para4">We are continuing to look at food and cooking in the curriculum with the aim of ensuring a more coherent approach. We will, of course, take into account the role of home economics in this context.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reasons in the proposed draft Seeds (National Lists of Variations) Regulations 2000 consultation he proposes to abolish statutory measures relating to <i>(a)</i> oral representations at a public hearing, <i>(b)</i> the definition of persons affected, <i>(c)</i> rules of conduct for public hearings and <i>(d)</i> the requirement of fees in respect of such hearing; and replace them with ministerial discretion.  [111649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2000]:</i> The proposed regulations do not abolish statutory rights to make oral representations about proposed decisions on National Listing. The proposal is to transfer the detail of how such rights are exercised from Regulations to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette. It is now more usual to set out such administrative detail separately, rather than include it in legislation. The proposals also provide for all fees associated with National Listing to be set administratively, rather than by regulation, subject to such fees being reasonable. The draft regulatory impact assessment which accompanied the proposals explained that we do not expect them to result in extra costs to industry, citizens or the environment.

 Prior to February 2000, varieties added to a member state's National List could be included on the Agricultural Common Catalogue provided no member state indicated they intended to seek a derogation prohibiting marketing of the variety in their territory. No Genetically Modified varieties of wheat or maize were added to the Agricultural Common Catalogue under these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00309w07.html_para13">Under new arrangements which came into effect in February 2000, varieties may progress automatically from member states National Lists to the Common Catalogue. For genetically modified plant varieties, this progression requires a marketing consent under Directive 90/220/EEC on the Deliberate Release into the Environment of Genetically Modified Varieties and, where appropriate, an authorisation under the Novel Foods Regulation No. 97/258/EEC. No genetically modified wheat varieties have either been considered or added to the Common Catalogue under these new arrangements. There are currently three genetically modified maize varieties included in member states' National Lists which the EU Commission is considering for inclusion in the Common Catalogue. These are CHARDON LL, included in the Dutch National List, and COMPA CB and JORDI CB, included in the Spanish National List. The decision on whether to add these varieties to the Common Catalogue is for the Commission to determine on the basis of whether the necessary regulatory requirements have been met.

 I am pleased to announce that the rate of the Compensation Levy will remain unchanged at a maximum of 23 pence per member for the third year in a row and that it will not be necessary to raise a Compensation Levy in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para3">Regulations are being laid today for the General Levy that will increase rates for most pension schemes from 1 April 2000 with the exception of occupational schemes with 6,604 or more members. Rates for these schemes have been frozen at their present levels for the coming year. The rates for 2000-01 are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para4">The General Levy covers the costs of the bodies that safeguard the rights of pension scheme members or provide them with help, advice and information. These bodies are the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra), the Pensions Ombudsman, the Pensions Advisory Service and the Pension Schemes Registry.

<a name="00309w08.html_para5">The increase in the General Levy rates for most, but not all, occupational pension schemes reflects that the biggest schemes generate little work for Opra, and have not contributed to the steady increase in the number of cases referred to them or to the complexity of the issues with which they deal.

<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para7">An important part of our pension reforms is that people should have greater confidence in private pensions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We are laying regulations today which, together with regulations made in November (The Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1999), give effect to the changes to the All Work Test which were introduced by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para8">The All Work Test provides an assessment of the effect of a person's medical condition on their functional abilities, to determine whether they reach the threshold at which it is appropriate to pay incapacity benefits rather than to treat them as unemployed. It is a negative test in that it currently looks only at people's incapacities and 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2000 : Column: 803W</I><P>
not at why they are able to do despite their illness or disability. The very name gives the wrong impression that people who reach the benefit threshold are unfit to do any work. But many sick and disabled people already work, and many more want to and may be able to, given the right encouragement and support.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para9">From 3 April 2000 the All Work Test will be replaced by the Personal Capability Assessment. The threshold for entitlement to incapacity benefits, and the way that incapacity is assessed will not change in any way. But the doctor who advises the decision maker will also be able to prepare a Capability Report, with positive and constructive advice on what the person can do despite their incapacity and on measures such as workplace adaptations which might help them to work. This report will not be seen by the benefit decision maker but will go to Personal Advisers, to help them and their clients plan a return to employment.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para10">As part of the ONE pilots, our doctors are already providing Capability Reports in appropriate cases. The process was trialled successfully last summer. We aim to extend the use of Capability Reports as we gain experience through the pilots and as Personal Adviser services are expanded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 From 3 April, the All Work Test for incapacity benefits will be replaced by the Personal Capability Assessment. This will continue to determine benefit entitlement in exactly the same way as now but will also allow the doctor who assesses a person's incapacity to prepare a separate Capability Report with positive information on what they can do despite their medical condition and on measures such as workplace adaptations that might enable them to return to employment.
<P>

<a name="00309w08.html_para11">Capability Reports will not be seen by benefit decision-makers. They are intended to assist Personal Advisers in providing advice and support to people who want to plan a return to work. Some initial trialling of the Capability Report was undertaken for a short period last summer in Bolton, and in Bristol, East and Bath, two of the areas in which Personal Adviser services are being piloted as part of the New Deal for Disabled People. Since last November, the new procedure has been included in the 12 ONE service pilots. The ONE pilot areas were selected on the basis of a number of criteria including the need to cover a range of geographical and labour market conditions so as to minimise bias and enable results to be extrapolated nationally.

 As part of our determination to drive up the standards of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit administration, we have asked the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate to inspect the 30 local authorities which spend most on these benefits.

<P>
<a name="00309w09.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The margin of error expressed as a percentage of estimated losses depends to a degree on the amount of fraud and error found in the review: the less found the wider the margin.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. 1998-99 are the latest figures available.<P>

2. The "average cost" has been calculated as the cost per case using the authority's total expenditure on administration costs and the total Housing Benefit caseload.<P>

3. The total expenditure on administration costs used in the calculations are those reported by the authorities to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the RO4 forms. The caseload figures used are the Housing Benefit caseloads supplied by the local authorities on the Management Information Statistics Stats forms 121 and 122. The caseload figures for financial year 1998-99 were calculated by taking an average of the data for the four quarters May 1998 to February 1999.<P>

4. As can be seen from the table, the average cost per case varies considerably between authorities. Different local authorities use different basis to calculate the administration costs they report. The reasons for the differences include the different mix of caseload the authorities have and their relative complexities to administer, and also the different components included in the total administration costs expenditure, for example, the treatment of overheads.<P>

 The Programme Protection Fund consists of money whose main purpose is to safeguard Social Security against fraud and error.

<P>

<a name="00309w10.html_para18">One of the fund's main goals is to ensure the achievement of the Public Service Agreement target, to reduce fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance by 30 per cent. by March 2007, with at least a 10 per cent. reduction by March 2002. We do not yet have figures for this, the first, year in which the fund has been in operation. However, our initial expectations are that we shall achieve a reduction in the rate of

While higher employment improves the public finances by raising revenue and reducing social security payments, it is difficult to identify the precise effect of changes in the rate of employment on the public finances, as this depends on a large number of factors. None the less, a higher rate of sustainable employment has been an important contributory factor to the substantial improvement seen in the public finances since May 1997.

These records show two asylum applications to have been made by people who came into the United Kingdom from Kosovo under the United Nations Humanitarian Evacuation Plan, one of which has subsequently been withdrawn, and that none have been made by people who came into the United Kingdom from Kosovo through organised medical evacuations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 2 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 376W, for what reasons he has assumed that 25 per cent. of defendants who would have elected Crown Court trial and whom the magistrates decided to try would appeal against the magistrates' decision; what research he has undertaken into the likelihood of a defendant appealing against the magistrate's decision; and if he will make a statement.  [113805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 It is not possible to make a precise estimate of the number of defendants who would appeal against the magistrates' decision on mode of trial; we have merely made the cautious assumption that a quarter of defendants would do so. By way of comparison, the percentage of defendants availing themselves of the unfettered right to appeal against summary conviction after a contested trial is about 14 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 2 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 377W, on which judges will hear appeals from magistrates on mode of trial, if he will list, for each Crown Court centre in England and Wales, the estimated number of appeals to be heard by each resident judge; what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> resident judges and <i>(b)</i> senior presiding judges regarding the requirement for resident judges to hear such appeals, and what representations have been made to him; how the requirement for resident judges to hear such appeals relates to his estimate of a hearing within 48 hours; and if he will make a statement.  [113809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Assuming that 25 per cent. of defendants appeal against the magistrates' decision on mode of trial, it is estimated that there will be 3,500 appeals a year, which is on average less than one appeal per week for each of the 78 Crown Court centres. The proposal that these appeals should be heard by the resident judge has already been discussed with the Lord Chief Justice, who further proposed that a deputy should be nominated by the senior presiding judge of the Circuit to provide cover. This will ensure that appeals will be heard within 48 hours.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Assuming that eight per cent. would be committed for sentence, the number of formerly-electing defendants who under the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill would be convicted in the magistrates' courts and committed for sentence would be 1,050, 160 more than under the original Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The estimate that 12,000 formerly-electing defendants would have been tried in the magistrates' courts under the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill was based on the generous assumption that a quarter of such defendants might, through representations, have been able to persuade the magistrates to direct their case to the Crown Court. Since the criteria in the No. 2 Bill are more restrictive, it has been assumed--again generously--that this proportion would be halved.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 2 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 385W, for what reasons the statistics given on the number of press officers in his Department differed from the statistics given to the Select Committee on Public Administration and published in its report, The Government Information and Communication Service (HC770) in July 1998; and if he will publish statistics comparable to those provided to the Select Committee for the dates requested by the right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 One difference between the two sets of statistics is that the figures provided to the Select Committee included senior managers, press officers and staff on temporary attachments; whereas the question asked by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) specifically requested only the number of press officers employed in the Department on certain dates.
<P>

<a name="00309w13.html_para0">The other difference lies in the fact that the figures provided to the Select Committee represented averages of Press Office staff over 12 month periods as opposed to the figures requested by the right hon. Member for a specific series of dates.
<P>

<a name="00309w13.html_para1">In addition, some secondments and attachments are very short term and individuals are not always on the Home Office payroll.

[113808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00309w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As stated in my reply of 3 March, to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), press officers will be largely recruited at Information Officer grade for which the pay band salary is up to &#163;27,709. Press officers working on the news team will be operating on a rota system for which there is an 



<P>
<P><I>9 Mar 2000 : Column: 822W</I><P>
additional shift disturbance allowance amounting to 12.5 per cent. of salary. All press officers, including those on the news team, are expected to join an out of hours duty rota, nights and weekends, for which overtime is paid. There is also a non-pensionable recruitment and retention allowance which can be varied at management's discretion.
<P>

<a name="00309w13.html_para3">For those candidates recruited at the top end of the Information Officer pay scale, which would be dependent on factors such as experience and current salary, annual earnings could therefore be up to and beyond &#163;30,000 as stated in the recruitment document.
<P>

<a name="00309w13.html_para4">Due to the varying hours press officers will work, their individual circumstances on taking up post and the unpredictable amount of overtime which might be payable, it is not possible to give an exact figure for the maximum earnings of a press officer.
