 To ask the Solicitor-General on what date the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) first decided not to endorse the proposed prosecution of Abu Hamza; whether the CPS consulted the <i>(a)</i> Director of Public Prosecutions and <i>(b)</i> Attorney-General in relation to the case; and if he will make a statement.  [51555]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60214w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 In November 1999 the CPS having consulted Treasury Counsel decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for offences of kidnap and murder relating to an incident in the Yemen. In 2003 following a submission of further material from the police the CPS again decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for those offences. The CPS did not consult the Attorney-General about this matter.

<a name="stpa_0">In January 2003 police seized tapes connected with Abu Hamza, in April 2003 further tapes were seized. In November 2003 the police submitted a report concerning the tapes to the CPS. CPS advised that further police enquires should be made. In March 2004 the police submitted a further report to the CPS. In May 2004 the police seized further tapes and submitted them to the CPS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In October 2004 the CPS decided, having taken advice from Treasury Counsel, that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for soliciting to murder, incitement to racial hatred and possessing a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. The evidence came from the tapes seized in May 2004 and one tape from those seized in January 2003. On this occasion the Attorney-General was consulted, agreed with the decision to prosecute and gave his consent to the prosecution of the incitement to racial hatred offence in October 2004.

 To ask the Solicitor-General what changes were made under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to the Crown Prosecution Service&#039;s power to instigate prosecutions.  [51303]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60214w01.html_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The changes made by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 empower a crown prosecutor, acting under guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to determine whether, and if so what, criminal charges should be preferred against alleged offenders who have been arrested or reported for an offence by the police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Act considerably enhances the ability of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to influence the efficient progress of casework by ensuring that the right offender is charged with the most appropriate offence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Previously, the CPS&#039;s powers were limited to reviewing and amending police determined charges or in limited circumstances instigating proceedings where the importance or difficulty of the case made it appropriate to do so.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60214w01.html_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), in partnership with the police, has established 165 witness care units across England and Wales. The units provide a single point of contact for victims and witnesses from point of charge until the conclusion of the case. Dedicated witness care officers ensure that the needs of individual victims and witnesses are identified and met so that they have all the support and information they need to enable them to attend court and to give their best evidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">As far as vulnerable and intimidated witnesses are concerned, there is the possibility of the witness meeting the prosecution team to discuss what special measures in court may be appropriate for them at trial. Research has shown that there has not been a high take-up of these meetings and the CPS will use this to encourage areas to hold them where appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">In addition the CPS is currently piloting pre-trial interviews with witnesses in four CPS areas. The purpose of the interview is to assess the reliability of the witness&#039;s evidence, assist the prosecutor in understanding complex evidence, and to explain the criminal process and procedures to witnesses.

Once the mandatory transfer from CAP subsidies to rural development agreed as part of the 2003 reform are taken into account, (also known as compulsory modulation), EU spending on rural development will be higher&#151;during the 2007&#150;13 period than it is currently.

 Under the Single Payment Scheme, the number of set-aside entitlements allocated in each member state in the first year of application of the scheme is determined, in the main, by the average number of hectares under compulsory set-aside under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) during the 2000&#150;02 reference period. Subject to the exemptions that applied at the time, notably for small producers, that equates to 10 per cent. of the total area claimed under AAPS in each member state in the reference period. Total figures for those member states operating the scheme in 2005 are not yet available, but the amount of payment attached to set-aside entitlements in each member state will vary according to whether the &#039;historical&#039; or &#039;flat-rate/hybrid&#039; model of the scheme has been adopted. For those member states still operating AAPS in 2005, set-aside payment figures are again unavailable at this point, but will be determined by the number of applicants applying under the scheme, how much land they put into set-aside and the 63 euros/tonne payment rate.

The European Commission and member states began consultations in 2005 with four of these&#151;Cameroon, Ghana, Indonesia and Malaysia, with a view to beginning formal negotiations once a mandate had been given by the European Council. That mandate was given in late 2005 and formal negotiations can begin when these partner countries and the EU agree that the preparatory work has been completed. Consultations will begin with other potential partner countries in 2006 drawing on the experience already gained. The time taken to complete negotiations will vary from partner country to partner country. It is anticipated that the first partnership agreement will be signed in 2007.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she intends to delay the application of the Waste Incineration Directive to tallow until the Directorate-General Environment has completed its review of the directive&#039;s impact on the combustion of tallow.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60214w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Waste Incineration Directive has been transposed into national law and we currently have no grounds on which to change that. I am advised that, as the law currently stands, the burning of waste tallow as fuel remains subject to the requirements of that directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_66">In June 2005, the Government wrote to the European Commission expressing its view that the existing requirements of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (75/442/EEC as amended) and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (96/61/EC) are sufficient to ensure that the burning of waste tallow as fuel is carried out in ways which protect the environment and public and animal health. The Government called for the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) and the WID to be amended accordingly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_67">In response, the Commission stated that there did not appear to be sufficient justification at present for it to propose an exclusion of the burning of waste tallow from the WID. However, the Commission also confirmed that the WID is not intended to discourage uses of waste as competitive and efficient alternative energy sources, agreed that it is desirable that it does not have such an effect and has initiated further analysis of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1826W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the issue in the form of a study. This study should help to clarify the wider environmental and economic impacts of the current legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w08.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_68">I recognise that recent announcements by the European Commission have raised the possibility that this legal position might change in the future. My understanding is that the Commission&#039;s study of the environmental impacts of burning tallow has now commenced and will report in the second half of 2006. If the outcome of this study were favourable to the burning of waste tallow as fuel without having to meet the requirements of the WID, then this could lead to a change in the relevant legislation although it is suggested that this is unlikely to occur before 2009. I must also stress that such an outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion.

 The Environment Agency has a statutory duty to manage water resources in England and Wales.

<a name="stpa_69">The Environment Agency is expected to take action against abstraction licences where the abstraction is adversely impacting on conservation sites, and in particular those designated under European legislation. Where it needs to revoke or modify an abstraction licence then compensation is generally payable.

The representations have been made to draw the Department&#039;s attention to the concerns of the Consumer Council for Water, the North East Chamber of Commerce and Northumbrian Water about a national approach.

 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is responsible for registering credit unions under the Credit Unions Act 1979. It monitors and supervises the manner in which credit unions comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements and rules, taking whatever action it considers appropriate in the event of non-compliance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_87">One area of supervision is to ensure that the activities of a credit union are consistent with the objects laid down in their statute. However it is not a function of the FSA to investigate whether or not a credit union achieves its aims or whether it is effective in addressing the needs it was set up to meet. That is for the credit union and its members to assess.

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60214w10.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Des Browne: </b> 
 The growth in the Public Sector Average Earnings Index (AEI) was 4.2 per cent. in the year to November 2005 (single month figure, for Great Britain, seasonally adjusted and excluding bonuses, Source: Office for National Statistics), compared to 3.7 per cent. in the Private Sector and 3.8 per cent. in the Whole Economy.

<a name="60214w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_88">In the short-term the public and private sector AEI growth can diverge and they usually do, but in the long-term they tend to be very similar. The average annual growth between March 1997 (the earliest available data) and November 2005 was 4.0 per cent. in the public sector and 4.2 per cent. in the private sector (and 4.1 per cent. in the whole economy).

<a name="60214w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_89">Government policy on public sector pay is devolved to individual Departments, while the Treasury maintains a monitoring and co-ordinating role. Government policy on public sector pay remains one of ensuring pay awards are justified, affordable and deliver value for money. Given that it accounts for around a quarter of all public spending, controlling pay is essential to delivering value for money and keeping inflationary pressures in check.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w10.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_90">With this in mind, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has written to the public sector Pay Review Bodies emphasising the importance of basing its pay settlements on the achievement of the inflation target of 2 per cent. Furthermore, to achieve a more co-ordinated approach to pay across the public sector, the Government have now established a new single gateway to scrutinise all significant public sector pay proposals (as announced in the last pre-Budget report). Reporting to myself, the objective of the gateway (Public Sector Pay Committee) is to establish a common set of objectives for pay across government, extending and strengthening existing arrangements. Its aim is to ensure that all new pay structures are evidence-based, represent value for money and are financially sustainable over the long run, including taking account of the pensions implications of new pay decisions.

The latest available data, on the local/European electorate and the Parliamentary electorate, for local authorities in Essex can be found in the Table 2. These data are for 1 December 2004. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;.

This information for eight financial years could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The estimated cost of enhanced early retirement schemes in 2005&#150;06 including flexible and compulsory early retirements and approved early retirement schemes (including the Insolvency Service) is &#163;8.1 million. It is expected that the reduction of DTI staff by 1,010 civil servants will lead to cumulative

 Yes. In April 2005, England&#039;s Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) took over responsibility from the Countryside Agency for delivery of rural economic and social regeneration policies, including responsibility for the regeneration of market towns. The RDAs work with local communities and businesses to deliver long term strategic investment plans that will sustain market towns as important rural service centres, geared to the particular needs and characteristics of each region.

<a name="stpa_149">As announced in Rural Strategy 2004, from 1 April 2005, Defra has devolved decision-making on delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the Regional Development Agencies. This includes areas of activity such as those formerly covered by the Countryside Agency&#039;s Vital Villages and Market Towns programmes. The transfer of Countryside Agency funding aims to create an integrated rural funding programme and allow RDAs the flexibility to manage their own resources to meet their regional and Defra priorities. Additional resources from the Countryside Agency will also increase the RDAs expertise in innovation, countryside issues, research and rural development.

<a name="stpa_150">This move to devolve funding to the regions through RDAs is part of Central Government&#039;s devolving decision-making agenda. RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to spend their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. However, Defra is confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the RDAs and increasing their resources, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="60214w25.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Over 53,000 United Kingdom Servicemen and women deployed to the Gulf in 1990&#150;91. We do not know how many UK Gulf veterans are ill or what illnesses they have reported because there is no single database, not least with respect to those who have left the armed forces whose current records the Department does not hold. However, at the end of September 2005, some 2,960 Gulf veterans were in receipt of a war disablement pension and 2,445 veterans had received a gratuity for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Feb 2006 : Column 1891W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
disablements assessed at under 20 per cent. There will be some overlap between those figures, as some individuals will have received first a gratuity and then, if this disablement has become more severe, a pension. The awards will not necessarily relate to the individual&#039;s service in the Gulf and we would expect a substantial proportion to relate to non-Gulf service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w25.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_200">In some cases veterans&#039; illnesses are due to disorders which are unrelated to service. The majority will be musculo-skeletal conditions relating most commonly to injuries sustained in training, operations or fitness activities. Others are recognised medical conditions such as PTSD, where service links may again be accepted. A third group relates to multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms and illnesses which epidemiological evidence shows are not specific to, but are more common among those who served in 1990&#150;91.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w25.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_201">The pattern of ill health is not unique to UK Gulf veterans, and is repeated among 1990&#150;91 Gulf veterans from the other coalition countries. Evidence so far suggests that this is unaffected by the specific experiences and exposures of the personnel concerned. Similar symptoms and illness are also reported among personnel who did not deploy. There is no consensus either in the US or the UK as to the causes of the non-specific conditions commonly covered by the umbrella term &quot;Gulf War Syndrome&quot;.

<sup>(18)</sup> For the purpose of this question, senior officers are considered to be those equivalent to NATO rank OF-7 and above. This is consistent with the coverage of the Senior Salaries Review Body.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> Average strength is calculated as a 13 month centred average of the strength in the individual months.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for UK regular forces (including both trained and untrained personnel) and therefore exclude Gurkhas, Full Time Reserve Service personnel, the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment, Mobilised Reservists and Naval Activated Reservists.<br>

2. Figures less than 100 have been left unrounded so as not to obscure the data.<br>

3. Percentages are calculated from unrounded figures.<br>

4. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in 5 have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

5. The table shows the number of promotions in a given financial year.<br>

* In producing this analysis, individual records were attributed to parliamentary constituencies (PC&#039;s) on the basis of their postcode. Not all records can be correctly allocated to a PC using this method, and some cannot be allocated at all. Past investigation has demonstrated that mis-allocations and non-allocations do not necessarily occur randomly between areas, and at ward level the proportion of records mis-allocated or unallocated can be substantial. At present, it seems likely that a higher than average proportion of the records that cannot be attributed to a ward are in the following areas: Fermanagh district council, Deny district council and parts of Belfast city council.<br>

The 31 January statement makes clear that the outcome of the final status should be acceptable to the people of Kosovo.

The legacy of the Milosevic era in Kosovo&#151;violence, ethnic cleansing and the conflict in 1999&#151;had led to the present UN mandate, and the future status process would need to reflect this background. It was incumbent on the Kosovo Albanians to create the conditions under which their aspirations could be met. That meant arrangements in Kosovo that guaranteed minority rights, protected Serb historic and cultural monuments and allowed those displaced from Kosovo to return.

 The UN world summit in September 2005 supported and encouraged the development of rapid deployment arrangements in support of UN peacekeeping. In particular, it welcomed efforts by regional organisations such as the European Union and African Union to develop relevant capabilities.

<a name="stpa_218">The UN Department of peacekeeping operations is currently considering three options to provide timely additional support to UN missions at times of crisis: provision of a rapid deployment capability by regional organisations; provision of a short-term capability by

one or more individual countries; and providing co-operation arrangements between UN missions in the same region. The report recommends that all these options be considered in parallel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_219">Progress has already been made on two of these recommendations. In the area of regional rapid reaction, the EU and UN are discussing how the EU battle groups could be used in appropriate circumstances in support of UN missions. The EU is currently considering a request from the UN to provide additional support to the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo during elections later this year. The African Union is also taking steps towards establishment of an African stand-by force, supported by the UK and other international partners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_220">Progress is also being made on arrangements between UN missions. The Security Council has recently authorised the deployment of a force from the UN mission in Liberia (UNMIL) to support UN forces in Cote d&#039; Ivoire in view of recent events there. Similarly UNMIL is providing a contingency force to support the UN forces providing security for the Sierra Leone special court, should the need arise.

<p><a name="st_294"><a name="60214w31.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The United Nations stand-by arrangements system (UNSAS) has been introduced by the UN to increase the availability of forces for peacekeeping operations, and to reduce the time taken for their deployment. The system is based on conditional commitments made by UN member states to make available specified military and other resources within agreed response times. The system has taken some time to bed down, but is now proving increasingly useful for the generation of force units and the provision of individuals, including military observers and staff officers, to peacekeeping operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60214w31.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">The UN Secretary-General recently reported that force generation for complex peacekeeping missions in Liberia, Cote d&#039;Ivoire, Burundi and Haiti have shown that resources pledged are now more adequate to mission needs and that the declarations made by member states under the UNSAS arrangements are more realistic and up to date. However, getting member states to commit forces to rapid deployment as part of the UNSAS process has shown limited success. The UN&#039;s Department of peacekeeping operations is examining ways of making it more attractive for member states to commit to rapid deployments as part of UNSAS.

 The establishment of the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade in 1996 (SHIRBRIG) followed a recommendation from the UN

Secretary General that UN member states should consider establishing a rapid deployment force to support UN peacekeeping operations. SHIRBRIG was established by Austria, Canada, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Fifteen countries now participate in the brigade, with a number of others taking part as observers.

<a name="stpa_223">SHIRBRIG is available to take part in Security Council-mandated operations for a period of up to six months.

<a name="stpa_224">SHIRBRIG is made up of three elements: a Steering Committee which makes policy and oversees force generation and deployment; a Planning Element which serves as the nucleus for the force headquarters and plans for individual deployments; and a Brigade Pool of Forces consisting of the troops made available to SHIRBRIG by the participating countries. The Brigade aims to be able to deploy 4,000&#150;5,000 troops.

 The nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) affirms the right of all parties, including non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS), to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Pursuit of peaceful nuclear technology by these states, including the more sensitive aspects of the fuel cycle such as enrichment of uranium, may be undertaken provided the state does so in conformity with articles I, II and III of the treaty. Article III of the treaty requires all NNWS states party to have International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on such facilities in order to verify the fulfilment of the state&#039;s obligations under the NPT. The safeguards required under article III are to be applied to all nuclear material under the state&#039;s control.

 Al-Jawf and Marib are regions of Yemen where members of al-Qaeda and related groups are known to have been present. It is possible that tribes living in these areas have offered funding and/or logistical assistance to members of such groups; this support may have been with or without tribal knowledge of the al-Qaeda background of the individuals concerned.
