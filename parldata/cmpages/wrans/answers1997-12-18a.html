To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assistance he has made available to the British Museum in 1997-98 and 1998-99 to enable it to avoid introducing admission charges in terms of <i>(a)</i> grant and <i>(b)</i> tax treatment; and if such arrangements are to be extended to other museums. [21114]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I am holding in reserve within my Department's budget for 1998-99 &#163;1 million for the British Museum. The purpose of this provision is to help the Trustees of the British Museum to avoid irrevocable decisions on the introduction of admission charges pending the outcome of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. Before this reserve can be accessed the British Museum will have to demonstrate their need for special provision, having looked at other sources of income. Payment of any advance grant would be subject to the following conditions:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) that the Museum prepares an action plan, subject to approval by my Department, for generating more income to supplement its grant-in-aid; for achieving significant efficiency savings; and for improvements to the management of the Museum's finances;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) that the Museum succeeds in eliminating the balance of its projected deficit for the financial year 1998-99; and 
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) that the Trustees of the British Museum maintain free entry throughout 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71218w01.html_para3">I am also holding in reserve &#163;300,000 for 1998-99 for the Tate Gallery to help them to maintain free entry pending the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review. Before this reserve can be accessed the Tate Gallery will have to demonstrate the need for this extra grant, having explored other sources of income.
<P>

<a name="71218w01.html_para4">No special tax measures or tax treatment are being offered to either the British Museum or the Tate Gallery.
<P>

<a name="71218w01.html_para5">In addition, I was able to announce to the House on 8 December the establishment by the Heritage Lottery Fund of an Access Fund, initially of &#163;5 million per year, to enable all museums and galleries to bid for resources to help improve access to their collections in a variety of different ways.

 I have received responses from nearly 500 organisations and over 90 individuals. The vast majority of these welcomed the Government's proposals for reforming the National Lottery.

The National Lottery Bill, which was published on 4 December, gives effect to these proposals. The White Paper also committed &#163;1 billion from the Lottery to the new good cause and NESTA by 2001.

<P>

<a name="71218w02.html_para1">I have generally chosen to maintain settlements at the level planned last year. Some adjustments have however had to be made to reflect the costs to the UK of increases in related European Community budget programmes and to reflect transfers of responsibility to and from my Department. My objective throughout has been to ensure that the bodies I fund can continue to deliver their existing services within the total provision for expenditure that was announced last year.
<P>

<a name="71218w02.html_para2">These allocations do not necessarily reflect my longer term priorities. These will be set in the Departmental Spending Review and will provide the foundation for a different approach to resource allocation in the future. I look forward to working with our funded bodies to make this a reality.

 In the light of the other substantial priorities facing the Department, including the very heavy workload connected with legal aid and civil justice reforms, my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has decided not to proceed with further work on a possible Commission but to concentrate on making those changes he regards as most urgent in the existing system. He has decided to act directly to improve the openness. flexibility and effectiveness of the judicial appointments process. New measures include the presentation of an annual report to Parliament on the operation of the judicial appointments system (the first report will cover the period 1998-99).

<a name="71218w03.html_para4">Detainees are normally held either together in a separate block of living accommodation or with unconvicted prisoners. They are treated in the same way as unconvicted prisoners for purposes of prison management, and as such have the special rights and privileges under Prison rules and instructions which flow from unconvicted status.

<a name="71218w03.html_para5">Translation services are available under a contract administered by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate; every establishment has access to Language Line, a 24-hour telephone interpreting service, which is subsidised centrally; a list of accredited interpreters is available from the National Register of Public Service Interpreters, which is administered by the Institute of Linguists; establishments have been advised to maintain a list of members of staff and prisoners who can speak foreign languages and of any community services available locally. A number of foreign language documents, issued centrally by the Prison Service, are made available to non-English speaking prisoners and detainees explaining prison rules and procedures.

 It is for individual chief police officers to ensure that their computer controlled systems are Year 2000 compliant.

The Government believe that the introduction of specific racial offences will send out a strong message that racial violence and harassment are unacceptable, and will act as a forceful deterrent. Specific offences will also encourage the victims of crimes to report them to the police, and ensure that a higher priority is given to the identification of the racial element, both in the gathering of evidence and in the prosecution of the case.

 The company first discussed the idea of breeding dogs with the Home Office in late 1996. The proposed accommodation had not been built, equipped or staffed specifically for the breeding of laboratory dogs. In some minor ways it did not, at that stage, meet all the requirements of the code of practice for the housing and care of animals in designated breeding and supplying establishments. The Inspectorate asked that some changes be made to the facilities in which the dogs were to be housed to meet the requirements of the code of practice. These changes were completed before the formal application for an amendment to the Certificate of Designation to allow breeding was submitted.
<P>

<a name="71218w05.html_para5">The Certificate holder submitted the formal application in May. By this time, the conditions met the requirements of the code of practice.

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) earlier today announced that Mr. Whittam Smith will be appointed as their President from 1 January 1998, and I propose to designate him, in that capacity, to replace the Earl of Harewood and Lord Birkett of Ulverston. The designation itself will come into force in accordance with the procedures laid down in section 5 of the Act. This requires that the particulars of the proposal should lie before both Houses of Parliament for 40 days before the designation can be made, provided that neither House resolves during that period that the designation should not be made.

Given that the ammunition is needed to support peace-keeping activities in Bosnia and that it is important that UN forces in Bosnia, which include British troops, are able to protect themselves, we were glad to be able to approve this export as an exception to our interpretation of the EU arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. This decision does not affect our continued support of the EU common position on arms exports to the former Yugoslavia.

 The Government is currently undertaking a comprehensive spending review of asylum policy, including a review of the policy for providing support to asylum seekers.

<P>

<a name="71218w08.html_para1">Consequently, in response to a request from the Association of London Government, the Government proposes to make an Order under section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 which will allow local housing authorities in England and Wales to grant non-secure tenancies and licences in their own housing stock to asylum seekers to whom they owe a statutory duty to provide accommodation.

Between 1987 and 1993, a total of eight horses were used as blood donors for the supply of normal blood used in the preparation of media for microbiology. The horses were bled in rotation and only small volumes, relative to the size of the animals, were taken. The removal of a small volume of blood every few weeks caused no ill effects in the animals and no animals died as a result of these procedures.<P>

As you can see from the figures above, the relationship between the numbers of procedures, animals used and deaths is not necessarily a simple extrapolation. Further, there have been changes in the reporting requirements of the Home Office. For example, when the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 was first introduced, it was agreed with the Home Office Inspectorate that multiple blood samples taken from a single horse would constitute one procedure. This changed in 1990, when a procedure was recorded each time a blood sample was taken.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has been a continuing interest in the use of animals in defence research and the retrieval of information to answer this question has highlighted potential anomalies in the presentation and interpretation of statistics regarding animal experimentation.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Specifically, in each case we presented the figures on animal experimentation as <i>returned annually to the Home Office</i>. However, there are differences in reporting requirements between the two Acts which have governed animal experimentation (the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986), and a subsequent revision in 1990 to the 1986 Act has required that the figures recorded are the numbers of procedures conducted rather than the numbers of animals involved.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As a result, there are some inconsistencies in the statistics over the period of time in which these changes took place.

Nevertheless, the gross statistics which have been provided are substantially correct and represent the <i>maximum</i> experimentation figures.

 MOD is undertaking a fundamental and rigorous review of its procurement policies, procedures and practices. I have instituted wide consultation within MOD, well beyond the boundaries of the Procurement Executive, and also with Industry. Much work has already been done and I expect that formal recommendations will emerge early in the New Year. It will then be possible to outline the measures to be implemented.

 The responsibility for finding alternative accommodation and contacting Local Authorities rests with the individual concerned. However, MOD are sensitive to the needs of the individuals and, where necessary, provide advice and assistance in liaison with Local Authorities and completion of the necessary paperwork. In addition, the Joint Service Housing Advice Office (JSHAO), a tri-Service organisation, provides housing advice on all aspects of housing needs including renting through the council to personnel from any of the three services and their dependants, and also separated partners who are occupying Service families accommodation.

<a name="71218w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 It is vital that public awareness of meningococcal meningitis is maintained. Although relatively uncommon in Scotland, the infection can have potentially serious consequences. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment can be lifesaving. Young children are the group most likely to be affected, but recently there has been an increase in the number of cases in young adults. The Health Education Board for Scotland publication "Birth to Five", which is issued to all new mothers in Scotland, includes information and advice about meningitis. Relevant information, produced by the Meningitis Research Foundation and the National Meningitis Trust, is issued routinely to students. The Scottish Office Department of Health is keeping the situation under review, in consultation with Health Board Consultants in Public Health Medicine.

 The Authority's Working Group on Openness and Accountability met on six occasions between 24 April 1996 and its final meeting on 28 November 1996. The Working Group's recommendations were considered by the Authority during its meeting in December 1996 and, on 8 April 1997, two codes of practice were published and a press conference was held.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will make a statement on the support her Department will make available to students who chose medicine or dentistry as a second degree. [20777]

 A student who has already been on a course for which he has received support from public funds is precluded under the provisions of the Students' Regulations (Northern Ireland) from receiving an award to undertake a second first degree course in medicine, dentistry or any other subject. Such a student is eligible, however, to apply for a student loan towards his living costs. These rules will continue to apply to new students in 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when the perceived religious affiliations of non-teaching employees of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools were last monitored by the FEC. [21266]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In common with all other specified Public Authorities the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) is required to monitor the religious composition of its workforce on an annual basis. The CCMS last monitored the perceived community background of its non-teaching employees on 1 January 1997. This information will be publishing in March 1998.

<a name="71218w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The latest published monitoring information is contained in the FEC's Seventh Annual Monitoring Report (March 1997).

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in relation to the draft Museums and Galleries (NI) Order 1997, what representations were received from the Museums and Galleries Commission on the subject of powers to override trusts or conditions which prohibit or restrict the disposal of objects donated to museums and galleries. [21132]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Worthington </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> The Museums and Galleries Commission (MGC) expressed concern that the powers of disposal contained within the first draft Order which was published in March 1997 were too wide-ranging and suggested wording similar to that used in Scottish legislation.
<P>

<a name="71218w14.html_para0">These views were taken into account in framing the revised draft which was laid on 25 November 1997 and which restricted the circumstances in which disposal could be considered.
<P>

<a name="71218w14.html_para1">On the day the draft Order was considered by Parliament, the Government received a letter from MGC expressing the view that although the revised draft represented overall a considerable improvement, they considered that the revised wording allowed scope for disposal beyond what they considered appropriate.

<a name="71218w14.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Worthington </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> As the policy document "Treasures in Trust" was essentially an English document relating to English museums, it was not taken into account in detail by the previous Government when it proposed the draft Order. However, account was taken of many of the general principles expressed, where appropriate.

 Animals showing clinical signs of BSE would not be slaughtered for human consumption in the European Union.

<a name="71218w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government are concerned about the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements. In view of these concerns, the Minister for Public Health and I have agreed that an ad hoc Expert Group should be established to consider the general principles on which maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in supplements sold under food law could be set. 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 1997 : Column: 301</I><P>
The Expert Group will review the available science, and recommend maximum levels for a range of nutrients if appropriate. The Expert Group may also wish to provide advice on the addition of vitamins and minerals to foods. It will report to the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) which will consider the Group's findings and make recommendations to Ministers. The Committee on Safety in Medicines (CSM) will also wish to consider the Report as it may have implications for the way that medicinal products containing vitamins and minerals are licensed. The conclusions of the review will also be used to inform any discussions in Brussels on the possible harmonisation of controls on food supplements and on fortified foods.
<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para1">The Expert Group will comprise of a number of experts from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA); the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT); CSM and FAC.

<a name="71218w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the European Union Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on 15 and 16 December. I was accompanied by my noble friend, the Lord Donoughue, Parliamentary Secretary responsible for farming and the food industry.
<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para4">I informed my Ministerial colleagues of developments in relation to BSE, in particular my decision to ban from 1 January 1998 the import into the United Kingdom of meat from which the specified risk material had not been removed. This decision had been taken in the light of the postponement for three months of an EU-wide ban on such material. I also informed the Council of the prohibition which I had announced on 3 December in relation to the marketing of bone-in beef in the light of the scientific evidence which I had received from SEAC.
<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para5">The Council considered and reached agreement on two animal welfare measures: one attaching welfare conditions to the payment of export refunds, which was adopted unanimously, the other laying down standards for vehicles used for the transport of animals.

<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para6">The Council discussed at some length a Commission report on the impact of third country trade agreements on the EU's Mediterranean producers. I insisted that, in drawing conclusions on this matter, the Council should have available to it an assessment of the trade benefits of such agreements to the EU as well as the impact on EU producers. The Council also considered a report from the Commission on progress in the negotiations on a veterinary equivalence agreement with the US. It noted that, although the conditions were not yet right for concluding that agreement, the Commission should continue its negotiations with a view to reaching a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible in the new year.
<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para7">Amongst other matters discussed and agreed at the Council were measures on the granting of national aid to sugar beet producers in Portugal (Italy voting against); and extension of the temporary derogations for imports of wine from the US (Portugal voting against); rules governing veterinary checks on products entering the EU from third countries (by unanimity); and a proposal consolidating the drinking milk regulation (Greece and Denmark voting against).
<P>

<a name="71218w15.html_para8">The Irish Minister raised in the Council his Government's concerns over the recent interruptions to trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland as a result of UK farmers' protests at ports; but he emphasised the close co-operation which exists between the two Governments in seeking to resolve this matter. I stressed the absolute commitment of the Government to maintaining the rule of law, and our intention to do everything necessary to allow the unimpeded movement of goods within the EU single market.

 Problems encountered when preparing for the millennium include those of a general nature, such as clearly defining the scope of the Department's (including Agency) millennium programme/project(s), as well as resourcing and prioritisation issues. Lower-level problems have been encountered in obtaining required assurances from suppliers of systems/products, identifying risks and required contingency actions (including identifying replacement suppliers/products where necessary). With regard to IT application systems, though the millennium is still two years away, some problems have already appeared--for example problems have been identified (and addressed) on a computer system which is concerned with processing five-year forward-looking agreements, where the termination date falls in the new millennium. Non-Departmental Public Bodies sponsored by the Department do not fall directly within the scope of the Department's millennium programme, but all relevant bodies have been asked to progress essential preparations.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade by what procedures her Department ensures that the grants which they award to small toy producers to exhibit at trade fairs are spent completely in the interests of the recipient by the British Toy and Hobby Association. [21264]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Grants are paid to the British Toy and Hobby Association, and to other intermediaries, on receipt of a signed claim listing the names of the eligible firms in their group and the amounts owing. We seek confirmation from intermediaries' auditors once a year that all their claims are in order and that moneys have been passed on to eligible firms. We also audit a random sample of events to check that intermediaries like the BTHA have discharged all their obligations to the Department.

<P>
<a name="71218w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> From readily available records, I can state that my Department received one complaint concerning telephone fraud in 1995, five complaints in 1996 and two complaints in 1997.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B>

<P>
<a name="71218w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> Oftel has over the past year carried out detailed investigations with BT into complaints of organised network fraud on telephone services. Oftel is continuing its investigations but has no evidence of organised network fraud. I am confident that Oftel take network security issues very seriously. My Department therefore has no plans at present to establish a public inquiry into domestic telephone fraud.

 The Government will continue to assess any application for launch aid on its individual merits. As I said when I announced the Government's investment in Rolls-Royce's Trent engine programme, consideration of future applications for this kind of support for the civil aviation industry will be informed by our commitment to public/private sector partnerships.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para1">The Government currently receive receipts from the aerospace industry from past launch aid of more than &#163;100 million a year. The investment in Rolls-Royce Trent engine programme should, if successful as I fully expect, yield a commercial rate of return to the country.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the outcome of the Energy Council meeting on 8 December [22083]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Council considered several issues and received reports on matters of interest. I represented the UK.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para2">Council reached political agreement on a draft common position on the gas liberalisation directive. The main elements of the agreement include a requirement for a minimum initial market opening of 20 per cent., increasing to 28 per cent., after five years from entry into force and 33 per cent. after ten years. All gas-fired power generators will, from the beginning, be able to obtain competitive supplies. Initial thresholds for eligible industrial customers were set at 25 million cubic metres (mcm), dropping to 15 mcm after five years and 5 mcm by year ten. Member States were given the option to introduce separate arrangements for the inclusion of industrial combined heat and power producers.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para3">The agreement also includes provision for eligible customers and third party suppliers to have access to gas transportation networks and requires Member States to put in place an independent authority to settle disputes about access. Network companies will be required not to abuse information received from third parties and to publish the main commercial conditions for use of their network. The agreement also contains provisions to provide access to upstream pipelines in a manner which takes account satisfactorily of the particular nature of upstream activity.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para4">The draft common position recognises that market opening could lead to transitional problems for major gas companies and allows Member States, subject to clearance by the Commission, to agree to the possibility of their companies refusing network access where competition leads to serious financial difficulties in respect of long term take or pay contracts. Transitional arrangements will also be available to countries or areas of countries without a developed gas supply infrastructure (the latter subject to Commission authorisation) where the immediate implementation of the directive would create difficulties concerning the promotion of investment in gas networks.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para5">The Government welcome the agreement reached as a first step in opening the EU market for natural gas. Liberalisation will boost EU competitiveness and bring the UK new opportunities for trade, investment and employment. The draft common position is compatible 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 1997 : Column: 316</I><P>
with the existing competitive arrangements in the UK market. The proposal will be submitted to the European Parliament for consideration during the UK Presidency once a formal common position has been adopted.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para6">The Council received a presentation from the Commission on a White Paper and Action Plan on a strategy for the future of renewable sources of energy and a reached common position on a Council decision concerning a multinational programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community--ALTENER II. A two year programme with a budget of 22 mecu was agreed. I gave my full support to the ALTENER II programme which I regard as an important element in the Commission's proposals to increase the use of renewable energy sources.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para7">Council approved a resolution on combined heat and power. The resolution welcomed the publication of a Community strategy to promote CHP recognising its positive contribution to environmental policies particularly towards the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and invited the Commission to continue its work.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para8">Council approved a proposal to extend the SYNERGY programme aimed at the promotion of international cooperation in the energy field. A one year extension with a budget of 5 mecu was agreed subject to formal receipt of the European Parliaments opinion.
<P>

<a name="71218w19.html_para9">In addition, the Council received presentations from the Commission on its proposal for a Council decision for a multiannual energy framework programme for actions in the energy sector, and a progress report on the Energy Charter Treaty.

To ask the Minister without Portfolio (1) if he will list those companies invited to tender for licensing rights for the Millennium Exhibition indicating which companies submitted tenders; and which companies submitted tenders uninvited; [20695]
<P>
<UL>(2) when he expects to announce the appointment of a company to market the licensing rights of the Millennium Exhibition; [20694]

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71218w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 On 17 July 1997 the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) advertised in the Official Journal of European Communities (OJEC) for expressions of interest from companies to manage the licensing of merchandise for the Millennium Experience. The NMEC contacted ten companies drawing their attention to the 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 1997 : Column: 317</I><P>
OJEC advertisement. Those wishing to be considered for invitations to tender were required to submit standard corporate documentation by 29 July. Four expressions of interest were received--two from companies whom NMEC had contacted and two from companies not contacted directly by NMEC. In 12 August NMEC invited all four to tender, seeking written submissions by 26 August. Two companies submitted full bids.
<P>

<a name="71218w20.html_para0">Subsequently the NMEC has reviewed the option of conducting licensing through in house resources. The NMEC expects to take a final decision shortly on the preferred approach. In the meantime, I have placed in the libraries of the House copies of the OJEC advertisement and copies of the NMEC's Invitation to Tender.
<P>

<a name="71218w20.html_para1">It is not normal business practice to reveal the names of companies who bid for, but who are not awarded, contracts. To do so runs the risk of damaging their competitive position in their particular markets. It is also the case that European Union regulations stipulate only that the name of the winner of contracts be announced. Nevertheless, for the future, I can confirm that at the initial stages of competitive tendering exercises, the NMEC will ask companies to indicate whether or not they are content for their names to be revealed.

 All such information held by the public authorities concerned would be within the scope of the proposed Freedom of Information Act set out in the White Paper "Your Right to Know".

 The Department has been aware of the potential impact of the Year 2000 for some considerable time and an analysis of our major systems was carried out in 1996. This analysis confirmed that DSS' major systems, for example the Income Support and Retirement Pension computer systems, would only require minor attention. This is because these systems store dates in a way that is unaffected by the year 2000. Prior to completion of the analysis, some systems using forward dates experienced minor problems which were rectified at the time.

Following procedures set out in the National Health Service Capital Investment Manual for all NHS capital projects, these will have ranged from do minimum to extensive rebuilding.
