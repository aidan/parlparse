 The 2000 report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior civil service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, together with the annual uprating of Parliamentary salaries, is being published today. Copies are available from the Vote Office. I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for their work.
<P>

<a name="00215w01.html_para5">The main recommendations of the Review Body are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an increase from 1 April 2000 of 2.9 per cent. in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay bands for the senior civil service. Within the bands, departments and agencies will determine individual awards on the basis of performance. A further 0.4 per cent. of the total senior civil service paybill should be made available to fund additional performance awards for the most senior staff, whose pay has fallen well behind comparable remuneration elsewhere. Promotion to and within the senior civil service should be recognised by a move to a higher pay band and an increase of not less than 10 per cent.;
<P>
<BR>
an increase from 1 April 2000 of 3.3 per cent. in judicial salaries, with additional increases for seven senior members of the judiciary as a result of changes in the salary structure at those levels in recognition of their increasing responsibility for judicial leadership and the supervision of the judicial system;

<P>

an increase from 1 April 2000 of 3.3 per cent. in the maxima of the pay ranges within which individual salaries are set for senior military personnel.
<P>

<a name="00215w01.html_para6">The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing Departmental Expenditure Limits.
<P>

<a name="00215w01.html_para7">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior civil service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase from 1 April 2000 by 2.9 per cent.

<P>
<a name="00215w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Over the lifetime of this Parliament, we are providing nearly &#163;5 billion of extra resources for investment in housing in England. Most of these resources are being directed through local authorities who are key to the delivery of our housing policies. &#163;2.1 billion has been allocated to local authorities in 2000-01, through the Housing Investment Programme--48 per cent. more than was available in the current year.
<P>

<a name="00215w02.html_para5">We believe that local authorities are best placed to decide on the needs and priorities of their areas and their investment decisions for these additional resources should be based on robust local assessments of the housing needs of all groups within the community, including addressing the needs of the elderly.
<P>

<a name="00215w02.html_para6">In particular, grants are available through local authorities, to help elderly and disabled people to carry out adaptions and improvements that enable them to remain in comfort and safety in their own homes. Provision for disabled facilities grants is due to increase by a quarter over the current expenditure period, and this is expected to pay for over 10,000 additional adaptations.

 The UK has a legally binding target under the Kyoto Protocol of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Our emissions of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol fell by almost 9 per cent. between 1990 and 1997 and is on target to meet our commitment. The Government will shortly be publishing a draft UK climate change programme for consultation. The draft programme will show how the UK plans to meet its legally binding Kyoto target and move towards the domestic goal of a 20 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2010.

 There is no distinct element of the Revenue Support Grant to recompense authorities for council tax discounts they are required to give. However, the definition of the tax base used in the calculation of Revenue Support Grant normally has the effect of increasing an authority's grant by an amount broadly similar to the discounts. It will not be exactly the same as the discounts because the taxbase is based on information available before the year in which the discounts are given, the tax base is based on 100 per cent. collection, and the grant calculation uses a national tax rate rather than the actual tax rate.

By involving locally based partnerships in delivery we are ensuring that the programme design is relevant to local needs and will continue to offer unemployed people the best route into employment.

 Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 has never applied to schools, but it is clear that it has had a significant effect on teachers' perceptions.
<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para1">In research carried out in over 300 secondary schools by the Health and Education Research Unit at the Institute of Education, University of London (Playing it Safe, November 1997) some 44 per cent. of the teachers responding said that section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 had made it more difficult for them to address the needs of gay, lesbian and bisexual pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in respect of the inclusion in the National Curriculum of citizenship studies in schools, what consultation took place, and with whom, prior to the adoption of such studies; to whom and when draft proposals were sent for comment; what specific requirement is made in respect of information and instruction concerning the European Union and consequential citizenship obligations; what material for use of (i) teachers and (ii) pupils in respect of the European Union is made available through departmental channels; and if it includes a package entitled, Euroquest.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority consulted widely on proposals for a framework for Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education between 13 May and 23 July 1999 as part of broader proposals for the review of the National Curriculum.
<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para3">The proposals were sent to all schools. In addition, 4,000 copies were sent to other major organisations including central educational organisations, subject organisations, professional associations, Local Education Authorities and faith groups. In all, nearly 80,000 copies of the proposals for Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education and over 50,000 copies of the full consultation materials were distributed. In addition to the paper consultation, MORI held discussions with a number of focus groups of teachers, parents and governors.
<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para4">Questionnaires were returned by nearly 2,500 people and organisations--including over 600 schools, nearly 1,000 teachers, almost 200 parents, nearly 100 school governors, 90 Local Education Authorities, and over 20 employers. Details of the questionnaire responses and the responses of the focus groups were published in September. They showed a high degree of support for the proposals.
<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para5">The Citizenship programme for secondary schools--to take effect, subject to Parliamentary approval, at the start of the school year 2002--provides for pupils to be taught about: the world as a global community, and the political, economic, environmental and social implications of this, and the role of the European Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations at Key Stage 3 and the United Kingdom's relations in Europe, including the European Union, and the relations with the Commonwealth and the United Nations at Key Stage 4.
<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para6">During the UK Presidency of the European Community from January to June 1998, an information and resource pack for schools, Partners in Europe, was produced and distributed by the four education departments in the UK, in response to requests from teachers to update materials that were already in use in the classroom. The pack offers case studies of how schools have incorporated the European dimension into work which meets the requirements of the National Curriculum. It was produced in conjunction with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the

<P>

<a name="00215w04.html_para7">I understand that the Euroquest booklet was funded entirely by the Representation of the European Commission in the UK, and that the content of the booklet was produced in collaboration with a number of UK educationalists and the Central Bureau for International Education and Training.

 We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying in whatever form--be it racial, or as a result of a child's appearance, behaviour or special educational needs, or related to sexual orientation. We want all schools to treat bullying seriously and deal with it promptly and firmly whenever and wherever it occurs. Since September 1999, schools have been required by law to have an anti-bullying policy. Ofsted's Framework for Inspection requires inspecting teams to evaluate the measures taken by the school to prevent and eliminate bullying.
<P>

<a name="00215w05.html_para1">We will be launching a further anti-bullying initiative shortly. This will comprise a public information film to raise awareness of the problem; a video for schools on tackling bullying aimed at young people, on the theme 'Don't Suffer in Silence'; and a revised and updated anti-bullying pack for schools on the same theme setting out, among other things, strategies for combating bullying including racist bullying.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the reasons for delay to the in service date of the BOWMAN communication system. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
As part of our normal process, we assess the reasons for any programme slippage. Accumulated slippage from BOWMAN's original in service date of December 1995 can be attributed to a combination of technical difficulties, MOD budgetary constraints, the need to reconsider the BOWMAN procurement strategy following changes in industry, a redefinition of the in service date to reflect the completion of field trials and a further redefinition of the programme in order to reduce cost growth and risk.
<BR>
On 21 December 1999, the then US of S, in a Parliamentary answer to Linda Gilroy MP, provided a progress report, which noted the difficulties being experienced by ARCHER Communications Systems Ltd. Subject to continued good progress by ARCHER on their improvement programme, our aim would be to seek approval to proceed later this year following which we would expect to place an implementation (manufacture) contract by the end of the year. Prior to this we cannot set a revised in service date but would expect it to be in late 2003 or early 2004.

 The 2000 Report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for the work they have put into them.
<P>

<a name="00215w06.html_para3">In the Comprehensive Spending Review the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair and affordable and support budgeted public service improvements. In making their recommendations the AFPRB have taken into account a number of considerations, including the recruitment, retention and motivation of the armed forces and have recommended an increase in basic military salary of 3.3 per cent. for all ranks, with the exception of Privates, Lance Corporals, Captains and Lieutenants who should receive 3.8 per cent. An increase of 1 per cent. in X Factor is also recommended. The X Factor which has not been reviewed for five years, is paid as an addition to basic pay and reflects the differences between conditions of service experienced by members of the armed forces over a full career and conditions in civilian life, which cannot be taken directly into account in assessing pay comparability. The graduate starting salary is set at &#163;18,126 p.a. There are also some increases in Additional Pay (e.g. Flying Pay, Submarine Pay and Hydrographic Pay) and in Longer Separated Service Allowance/Bonus.
<P>

<a name="00215w06.html_para4">These recommendations will fully support the armed forces strategic personnel policies, in particular in relation to recruitment and retention. The additional cost to the Defence Budget will be &#163;260 million. This will be met within existing Departmental Expenditure Limits.
<P>

<a name="00215w06.html_para5">The AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from 1 April 2000.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the timetable for a decision on Sonar 2087. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
Two companies, Thomson Marconi Sonar Ltd and Babcock Defence Systems Ltd, are currently competing for the Full Development, Production and Support contract for Sonar 2087. We expect to make a decision around the turn of the year and to place a contract in spring 2001.

<a name="00215w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following a comprehensive review, the Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service (QARNNS) will be incorporated into the Royal Navy (RN) from 1 April 2000 as the Service's specialised nursing branch. QARNNS is currently a separate Service within the Naval Service.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para1">This will bring the status of QARNNS into line with that of the Army and RAF. It will also mean that QARNNS personnel commissioned or engaged into the RN from 1 April 2000 will be available for reserve service once they leave the RN. QARNNS ratings currently have no liability for reserve service.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para2">The terms and conditions of service of existing QARNNS personnel will be unaffected by this change.

<P>
<a name="00215w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> Violence erupted last week in Mitrovica, following an attack on a UNHCR bus in which two ethnic Serbs died. Reprisals led to deaths and injuries among Serbs and Albanians in the local population and injuries to troops in the NATO-led Kosovo force (KFOR). Following action by KFOR and the leaders of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), including the imposition of a curfew, the situation appears to have been brought under control.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para5">Mitrovica is a particularly acute example of the continuing tensions between the communities in Kosovo. It underlines the importance of international efforts to

<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Vaz </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> The political and security situation in Serbia clearly is desperate. The ruling coalition continues to intensify its repression of the independent media and of the democratic political parties through administrative and judicial harassment. The recent murders of Zeljko Raznatovic ("Arkan") and Federal Defence Minister Pavle Bulatovic--just the latest in a string of assassinations of high-ranking politicians, officials and businesspeople--show that violence has become endemic in public life.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para6">Vojvodina, as part of Serbia, is suffering from the same degradation of democratic freedoms and public security.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para7">In Montenegro, the government of President Djukanovic has made real efforts to introduce democratic reforms and promote the ethnic and social cohesion of Montenegro. However, Milosevic is undermining the economy and therefore the stability of Montenegro by blocking trade and financial transactions between Montenegro and Serbia. He and his supporters are also attempting to intimidate the legitimate government of Montenegro through the formation and deployment of special military units loyal to Belgrade.
<P>

<a name="00215w08.html_para8">In Kosovo, the security situation has improved since the arrival of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in June 1999. The number of crimes is decreasing. However, the recent upsurge in ethnic violence in the divided city of Mitrovica underlines the fragility of the security situation. KFOR and the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) are taking measures to tackle extremist behaviour by Kosovo Albanians and Serbs and to maintain peace and security in Mitrovica.

This puts into proper perspective its comments on the consequences of NATO action. NATO intervened, when all other options had been exhausted, to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. The great lengths to which NATO went to minimise civilian casualties are in stark contrast to the carefully planned and brutally executed terror perpetrated by FRY and Serbian forces in Kosovo.

However, provided governments of the region push ahead with key economic reforms, the medium-term prospects are bright.

<P>
<a name="00215w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> During the course of our investigations into the allegations in <i>The Independent</i> newspaper on 16 November that UK-made leg-irons were on sale in the US, we received assistance from US authorities. They did not, however, provide us with any written report.
<P>

<a name="00215w10.html_para0">I stated in a letter to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee on 2 February that we had completed thorough investigations into the allegations but had found no evidence that there had been a breach of the ban on the export of leg-irons. As far as we have been able to establish, it appears likely that the leg-irons in question were old stock dating back to the early 1980s prior to the statement made on 28 March 1984 by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 175-76.
<P>

<a name="00215w10.html_para1">We are also satisfied that the leg-irons mentioned in <i>The Independent</i> articles were not manufactured using oversized individual cuffs exported without a licence from the UK. Although we have no evidence to suggest that such single cuffs have ever been exported, there is a hypothetical loophole and amending legislation to extend controls to cover large individual cuffs is in preparation.

 We estimate that around 10,000 Kosovo Albanians, many of them civilians, were killed by Yugoslav and Serb forces, between June 1998 and June 1999. This estimate is based on a variety of sources, including debriefing of refugees, eyewitness accounts, reports from NGOs, as well as information derived from more sensitive sources.

<a name="00215w11.html_para0">We are concerned over the civilian casualties in Chechnya. We have repeatedly made representations to the Russian government about the disproportionate use of force, most recently on 11 January. We have stressed to the Russians that the human cost of their military offensive in Chechnya is unacceptable and that they must pursue a political settlement. We are working with both the OSCE and Council of Europe to urge Russia to begin such a process at the earliest opportunity.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will ensure that asylum seekers are not kept on a voucher system beyond the six-month target for processing claims.  [109569]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No. In the White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer", the Government set a target of delivering, by April 2001, most initial asylum decisions within two months and most appeals in a further four months. In respect of families with children, this target was brought forward to April 2000. For those people who remain on the support arrangements for more than six months through no fault of their own, additional payments of &#163;50 per person will be made every six months to assist with the cost of any replacement items they may need.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 According to information on police expenditure published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's Police Statistics for 1998-99, police officer pay and allowances represented 54.5 per cent. of gross expenditure; support services' and other staff salaries 14.9 per cent.; pensions represented 12.1 per cent., and other staff related costs 1.0 per cent.

<a name="00215w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Over the next three years the police service will receive an additional &#163;1.24 billion in central Government funding, which is a significant increase for the police at a time when the Government need to maintain firm control over public expenditure. It is a matter for each Police Authority to set its budget and for the Chief Constable to determine how to use the resources that are available. The Government have also relaxed the rules on the use of capital receipts from the sales of assets. Police Authorities now have the freedom to use all proceeds from the sales for capital investment.
<P>

<a name="00215w11.html_para2">Approximately 80 per cent. of the service charges for the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP) is attributable to the cost of the core service which, in England and Wales, is to be funded centrally by means of deduction from the total police grant provision. These charges will be reduced by the &#163;50 million subsidy I have obtained from the Capital Modernisation Fund.
<P>

<a name="00215w11.html_para3">The cost of services additional to the core, the so-called 'menu services', which all forces may purchase according to their own requirements accounts for the remaining 20 per cent. Separately from the PSRCP Service charge, forces will need to purchase radio terminals, control room equipment and integration service.
<P>

<a name="00215w11.html_para4">Police expenditure in the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 will be subject to the outcome of the 2000 Spending Review.

<a name="00215w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent discussions he has had with the Association of Chief Police Officers on its advice to police forces not to prosecute motorists exceeding the 30 mph speed limit until their speed reaches 35 mph; and if he will make a statement.  [109548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The enforcement of speed limits is an operational matter for chief officers of police. The Association of Chief Police Officers informed the Home Office of the guidelines on its speed enforcement policy before they were published but there were no detailed discussions about the appropriate thresholds for enforcement action. The thresholds provide guidance to police forces. The decision in any particular case will be taken by the police in the light of the individual circumstances of the offence.

[109393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2000]:</i> Since 19 July 1999, the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transsexual People has received representations from nine organisations and 83 members of the public. A number of hon. Members have also written to me about the work of the Group. In addition, the Working Group had a useful meeting last month with representatives of five organisations representing the transsexual community (the Gender and Sexuality Alliance, the Gender Trust,

<a name="00215w13.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Tony Wright: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the public consultation exercises on policy matters carried out by his Department and its agencies in each of the last five years; who was 



<P>
<P><I>15 Feb 2000 : Column: 502W</I><P>
consulted and by what means; how responses were analysed; how and in what form the results were transmitted to those responsible for the consultation; how the results of the consultation were published; and what analysis has been carried out of the extent and nature of policy changes resulting from the consultation.  [106296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department and its agencies are continually and routinely engaged in consulting the public and external stakeholders on a wide range of policy and other matters, both nationally and locally, and through formal written exercises, as well as more informally.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para0">A list of the main national public consultation exercises on policy matters carried out by the DSS since May 1997 has been placed in the Library. Details of consultation exercises prior to May 1997 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para1">We are very grateful to the many individuals and organisations which have taken the time to let us have their views during public consultation exercises.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para2">All responses to public consultation exercises are categorised and carefully examined by the relevant policy areas.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para3">The consultation exercises listed cover specific, detailed policy proposals as well as broader aspects of social security policy and the responses served to inform the development of detailed policy.

<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 An announcement on the arrangements will be made soon. We will be able to identify some of those newly eligible for a payment through the benefits systems; however the majority will have to make a claim.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what resources he has made available to the Benefits Agency to expedite the processing of applications by men aged 60 and over for winter fuel allowance; and when application forms will be available to enable claims to be paid in Stoke-on-Trent.  [109986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 An announcement on the arrangements will be made soon. To ensure that payments are made accurately and securely to those who are newly eligible, a project team has been set up to deal specifically with winter fuel payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will obtain a copy of the report on the research undertaken by the Financial Services Authority into the effect of decision-tree approaches to pension choices; and if he will place it in the Library.  [109842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We see a key role for decision trees, as part of a package of information, in enabling many of those considering a stakeholder pension scheme to make an informed choice about whether it will be a suitable option for them. We have been working closely with the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is carrying out 



<P>
<P><I>15 Feb 2000 : Column: 503W</I><P>
a three-stage programme of consumer research aimed at developing an effective decision tree. The final stage is currently under way and is due for completion in April. The FSA will be publishing a report of its completed research in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the number of employees who fall within the target group for stakeholder pensions and who will not be entitled to workplace access to a stakeholder pension because they currently work for a firm with fewer than five employees.  [109838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We estimate that the exemption for employers with fewer than five employees will mean that around 750,000 employees, from a target group of over five million, will not have an automatic right of access through the workplace. We expect, however, that some employers will voluntarily offer access. Furthermore, those who cannot join a stakeholder pension scheme through the workplace will be able to join a scheme on an individual basis.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what restrictions he proposes on the investment strategies which may be adopted by the managers of stakeholder pension funds.  [109840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The position for trustees of stakeholder pension schemes is set out in legislation and mirrors the current requirements on trustees of occupational pension schemes. For example, the trustees will have a duty to consider the need for diversification and the suitability of proposed investments, and to take appropriate advice when making investments. They will also have to prepare a statement of investment principles.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para4">Details of the rules applying to schemes run by an authorised scheme manager, as an alternative to a trustee board, including any rules relating to investments, will be announced shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate for each of the 10 financial years after the introduction of the State Second Pension the number of people receiving the State Second Pension; and of these, how many will also be receiving Income Support.  [109839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is in the table.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para5">It is not possible to provide precise estimates of the numbers of individuals who will receive the State Second Pension for specific years following its introduction. The table shows very broad brush estimates of the numbers who will benefit from the State Second Pension. These are subject to uncertainty and possible subsequent revision.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para6">Income Support is means-tested and is paid on a benefit unit basis. Therefore, in order to estimate the overlap between those receiving the State Second Pension and Income Support we would need information on the incomes, assets and family circumstances of the State Second Pension recipients for up to 12 years in the future. No sufficiently reliable estimates of all these factors are available to answer this question.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The numbers given are the estimated numbers of individuals who will benefit from the State Second Pension at the end of each financial year. For example, with the first year of awards being 2003-04, the entry in the table headed 2003-04 shows the number of beneficiaries after the first full year of awards.<P>

2. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.<P>

3. Figures include people who would receive the State Second Pension payments as well as those receiving contracted-out pensions where they have benefited from higher contracted-out rebates than would have applied under SERPS.<P>

4. The figures exclude those higher earning individuals who are contracted-out and whose rebates would be the same under the State Second Pension as under SERPS, since such individuals would not benefit from awards of the State Second Pension, nor would they gain from any increase in contracted-out rebates. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list the initiatives launched by his Department since May 1997 under which specific grants are allocated, indicating in each case and for each financial year the funding provided by central Government.  [109315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 2000]:</i> No formal grants have been awarded by the Department in respect of new initiatives since May 1997 although the Department does make a small number of grants and grants in aid to voluntary organisations and other outside bodies based on specific legislation established before that date.
<P>

<a name="00215w13.html_para7">We are reforming the welfare system to encourage work for those who can and to improve security for those who cannot. In delivering this, the Department is already working locally with a number of outside bodies and is looking to extend the involvement of the voluntary sector as its resources and statutory powers permit, including the establishment of a Children's Fund to help voluntary organisations to do more to eliminate child poverty. For existing local schemes, payment is generally on the basis of remuneration for services provided rather than by direct grant, and information on these arrangements is not available centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="00215w14.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There is a range of Social Security benefits available to help meet a variety of needs. Entitlement to these benefits depends upon the individual circumstances of each case.
<P>

<a name="00215w14.html_para0">Men in this age group may claim either Jobseeker's Allowance or Income Support, subject to the normal conditions of entitlement, to help meet day-to-day living costs. National Insurance credits may also be awarded to men aged 60-64 if they are not liable to pay contributions or do not receive credits by another route. The credits awarded will count towards Retirement Pension.

 Our package of reforms to provision for sick and disabled people is intended to modernise the welfare system and to encourage those who are able to work to do so. Severely disabled people will benefit in particular from the provisions in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which will allow those incapacitated under the age of 20, or 25 in certain circumstances, to qualify for Incapacity Benefit without having to meet the normal National Insurance contribution conditions.

<a name="00215w14.html_para3">In addition, the introduction of the new Disability Income Guarantee and the extension of the higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance to three and four year old children will provide additional help for many severely disabled people who have the greatest needs.

<a name="00215w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government believe that incineration with energy recovery has an important role to play as one of the options in an integrated waste strategy. It can be the best practicable environmental option where the opportunity for recycling newsprint does not exist. For example, at least one leading paper mill utilises energy from waste.

 While environmental policies can have positive or negative effects on employment in individual sectors there is no presumption that they lead to net (overall) employment gains or losses.

 The Government are grateful to the Low Pay Commission (LPC) for its report. Its findings confirm that the introduction of the national minimum wage (NMW) has been successful in helping take some 1.5 million people out of the trap of poverty wages, with no significant impact on jobs or the economy. The report presents evidence that the minimum wage has had a positive impact on business, in terms of improving performance and productivity, and helping to alleviate

It also repeats its view, expressed in the first report, that the main rate should be increased to &#163;3.70 this year.

<a name="00215w16.html_para4">The Government have decided, in the light of the positive findings in the report and our own analysis, to accept this suggestion and increase the main rate from &#163;3.60 to &#163;3.70 an hour in October this year. By introducing it in October we will provide time for business to prepare for such an increase. The LPC stressed the importance of a reasonable time for implementation. The Government also accept all 16 of the LPC's operational recommendations and suggestions, subject to the usual detailed consideration of practicality and resources. In addition, the Government confirm that the development rate for young people will rise from its current level of &#163;3.00 an hour to &#163;3.20 an hour from June 2000.

<a name="00215w16.html_para5">The LPC report comes just nine months after the introduction of the NMW. Assessing the full impact of the NMW will take a little longer. A more thorough analysis will be possible when more data become available on earnings, compliance and the interaction of the NMW with the Working Families Tax Credit. The Government will therefore ask the LPC to monitor the NMW and produce a further report, including on whether there is a case for an increase and if so to what level, by July next year.
<P>

<a name="00215w16.html_para6">In its next report the LPC will be asked to take into account movements in earnings and other factors, as well as impacts on the economy, including competitiveness, jobs and on training with particular attention to the youth labour market and the impact on low paying sectors and small firms, as well as the effect of the minimum wage on particular groups of workers. The Government will take decisions on the basis of this report so that any further increase can take place by October 2001.

<a name="00215w16.html_para7">The Government have decided not to implement the LPC recommendations that 21-year-old workers should be treated as adults rather than young workers for the purposes of national minimum wage. The Government are not shelving this matter--they will consider in detail the LPC's case for changing the treatment of 21-year-olds when they report on the general case for an increase next year. Copies of the LPC's second report will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w17.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Section 16 of the Children Act 1989 enables a court to issue a family assistance order requiring a probation officer or local authority officer to advise, assist and (where appropriate) befriend a child, any parent or guardian of a child, or any person with whom the child is living or who has an order for contact with the child. Family assistance orders last for a maximum of six months. They require the consent of any person named in the order other than the child himself or herself, and may not be made unless the circumstances of the case are exceptional. Consequently, the number of such orders made is small (in 1999 there were 43 in the High Court and 701 in county courts). The decision whether or not a case is exceptional, and whether a family assistance order

would be in the best interests of the child, if those concerned agree, is necessarily one for the courts to take in the light of the facts of each case. Standardisation would therefore not be appropriate.

Report</i>, column 215W, on VAT, what study he has made of the recent alterations to Annex J of the Sixth VAT Directive regarding the potential it offers for permitting the lowering of rates charged to a private citizen installing energy-saving measures via a contractor; and if he will make a statement.  [110201]<P>

<P>
<a name="00215w18.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This Government have already introduced a reduced rate of 5 per cent. for the grant- funded installation of energy saving materials. Annex K of the Sixth VAT Directive allows member states to adopt optional experimental reduced rates for the renovation and repair of private dwellings, which would cover the related installation of energy saving materials.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00215w18.html_para1">The important issue for energy saving materials, however, is do-it-yourself installation, where EC law does not permit a reduced rate.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make it his policy to take action to reduce lamb slaughter charges to the EU average level; and if he will make a statement.  [101147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w19.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> Since these charges relate to the cost of operating the abattoir and providing a slaughtering service, their level is a commercial matter between slaughter house operators and suppliers of lambs. The Government have, however, frozen MHS hourly inspection charges for 1999-2000 at 1998-99 levels--charges which affect the cost of slaughtering all species, including lamb.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will permit the new pet passport documentation to act as <i>(a)</i> an export certificate, <i>(b)</i> an import permit and <i>(c)</i> a rabies vaccination certificate; and if he will make a statement.  [108176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w19.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2000]:</i> Export certificates for pets are not a requirement of the UK Government, but may be required by countries to which animals are travelling. Such countries are entitled, as is the UK, to set their own requirements for import documentation. There is no requirement for import permits for pet animals entering England under the Pet Travel Scheme. Each such pet will need to be accompanied by a valid Pet Travel Scheme rabies re-entry certificate. Other certification relates to treatment against ticks and tapeworms and no limitation of the pet's travel outside the UK to permitted countries.
<P>

<a name="00215w19.html_para1">The aim of the Pet Travel Scheme is to permit pet owners to bring their animals back to this country without having to undergo quarantine, while maintaining the protection of public health. The scheme which will commence on 28 February is a pilot: the experience gained from it will be used in framing the full scheme which we are committed to implementing by April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w19.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 MAFF guidance for parents on Healthy Diets for Infants and Young Children recommends that parents choose products which are low in salt and sugar, and use nutrition labelling information to identify these foods.

<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will clarify the guidance in respect of the Food Labelling Regulations for processed foods targeted at babies and small children.  [108583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w19.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 lay down rules for the labelling of foods generally, and this includes foods for babies and young children. MAFF has issued Guidance Notes on the Regulations for use by industry and enforcers and kept them under regular review. Responsibility for this guidance will pass to the Foods Standards Agency.

<a name="00215w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The matter concerns the supply of generic drugs to the National Health Service. The whole basis of the current arrangements for generic supply is competition in the market place. In the light of disruption to the market last year, we were concerned to establish whether any suppliers of generics were misusing their market power; whether exploitation of the reimbursement system was taking place; and whether there was any implicit or explicit collusion to bring about price rises or shortages. The Office of Fair Trading is carrying out an investigation to see if there has been any contravention of United Kingdom competition law.

<a name="00215w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The average patient list size for general practitioners at 1 October 1998 was 1,787 for rural areas and 1,890 for urban areas.
<P>

<a name="00215w20.html_para0">Figures for average waiting times for an appointment with a GP are not collected centrally although there is information available from the 1998 Patients' Survey for General Practice. This shows that over 56 per cent. of respondents were given an appointment on the day they wanted, while 30 per cent. waited one day or more days. 13 per cent. of respondents reported that they had not minded what day they were given an appointment. There were no significant differences in waiting times between rural and urban areas.

<a name="00215w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if, in reviewing cleft lip and palate services, he will have regard to <i>(a)</i> the desirability of maintaining different clinical approaches, <i>(b)</i> travelling times to centres of excellence for parents and their children and <i>(c)</i> the practicability of providing adequate specialist nursing support services close to the parents' home.  [110010]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2000]:</i> Under the new arrangements all centres will be required to participate in national, inter-centre audit. This will, for the first time, collect clinical data on an equivalent basis and allow comparisons to be made of the effectiveness of centres and different techniques. It will be a vital tool in supporting practice and the continuing training needs of clinicians. Arrangements for the appointment of surgeons in designated cleft lip and palate centres, including the selection criteria, will be a matter for employing National Health Service trusts. Those applying for posts will be required to demonstrate evidence of their skills and expertise regardless of surgical technique.




<P>
<P><I>15 Feb 2000 : Column: 536W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00215w20.html_para2">The new services will work on a hub and spoke basis. Surgery and other specialised elements of care will be provided at the main centres, but many aspects of care will continue to be provided locally, in close liaison with the main centre. We accept that some patients and their carers will need to travel further for some aspects of their care because it is not possible for the highest standards of care to be provided at every hospital which has previously carried out cleft lip and/or palate surgery.
<P>

<a name="00215w20.html_para3">It will be for each cleft centre to ensure that patients have access to specialist nursing services. This might be provided on an outreach basis from the main centre or by nurses with specialist skills in spokes working in accordance with agreed protocols.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the National Screening Committee's advice regarding antenatal screening for cystic fibrosis.  [110249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00215w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The United Kingdom National Screening Committee does not currently recommend the introduction of routine antenatal screening for cystic fibrosis. This is based on the advice of its specialist Antenatal Screening Sub-Group. The aim of any antenatal screening programme would be informed choice and as yet there are too many mutations of cystic fibrosis and too little information on their clinical severity to enable counsellors to facilitate informed choice. The UK National Screening Committee will review this approach in the light of any new evidence.
