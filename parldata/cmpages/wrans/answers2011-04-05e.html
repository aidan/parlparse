 Ministers have received representations from a number of interested parties about recent difficulties in resolving funding arrangements for some services to problem gamblers. This is a matter for the independent charities concerned, and for their respective Boards of Trustees where relevant. I understand that the immediate issues have now been resolved. I hope that the parties involved will continue to demonstrate their commitment to tackling problem gambling by working together constructively to agree a longer term solution. The current funding structure was established by the industry, in preference to a statutory levy, to try to ensure that industry donations are used to the best effect to reduce problem gambling levels. It does not involve public money, nor any publicly imposed administrative burdens.</p>

 Section 331(4) of the Gambling Act 2005 enables the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport to add jurisdictions to the ‘white list’ so that operators regulated in those countries can advertise gambling services in the UK. In 2009, the Department announced that new applications for the white list would not be considered while the regulation of remote gambling in Britain was being reviewed. That remains the position. I understand that some jurisdictions have expressed interest in being added to the white list, but no applications have been made. I hope to make an announcement on how the Government intend to proceed in due course.</p>

 Where a customer is in hardship due either to the time taken to process their benefit claim or to the fact that an emergency has arisen before their next payment is due, they may be able to get an interim payment or a Social Fund crisis loan. An interim payment is always considered in the first instance. Where either there is a doubt about entitlement or no benefit is due, for example at the beginning of a claim, a Social Fund crisis loan is appropriate. An interim payment is not appropriate for a delayed crisis loan because interim payments are made in recognition of the fact that benefit will ultimately be payable for the period in question.</p>

This training provides an awareness of the interim payment process and includes the priorities for an interim payment and a crisis loan, the action to take on entitlement, and the action to take when the customer does not qualify for an interim payment. The training for these types of payments across the three benefits also includes the detailed processes and actions to take within prescribed time limits to ensure the accuracy of an interim payment.</p>

 Work is being carried out to correct errors in the calculation of additional state pension identified as part of the Cabinet Office investigation into the incorrect indexation of guaranteed minimum pensions in Public Sector Pension schemes. Our conclusion is that the errors which affect payments in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have arisen due to a wide variety of reasons and there is no single causal factor.</p>

 The effect of these changes is complex and will vary significantly from person to person. Moreover, because of the revision in life expectancy projections, these women will, on average, be getting their state pension for about the same length of time (24 years), and will be receiving around the same amount of state pension over their lifetime, as the previous life expectancy projections implied under a lower state pension age.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. Case load figures are rounded to the nearest 10 and totals may not sum due to rounding.
2. Statistical Group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will only appear in the top-most one for which they are eligible. For example, a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseeker’s allowance would appear in “jobseeker”, not in “disabled”.
3. Out-of-work benefits are:
JSA—claimants of jobseeker’s allowance.
ESA and incapacity benefits—claimants of incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance/employment and support allowance.
IS/PC—claimants of income support (and males age 60 to 64 claiming pension credit) that are not also claiming IB/SDA.
4. Durations shown are the longest claim duration of the benefits of interest.

A person who fits into more than one category will only appear in the top-most one for which they are eligible.
For example, a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseeker’s allowance would appear in “Job Seeker”, not in “Disabled”.
3. Out of work benefits are:
JSA—claimants of jobseeker’s allowance.
ESA and incapacity benefits—claimants of Incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance/employment and support allowance.
IS/PC—claimants of income support (and males age 60-64 claiming pension credit) that are not also claiming IB/SDA.
4. Durations shown are the longest claim duration of the benefits of interest.

1. Expenditure on winter fuel payments is rounded to the nearest £100,000. Age breakdowns may not sum to totals due to rounding.
2. Expenditure on the “79 and under” age group includes payments to people over women’s state pension age, which is increasing from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2018. People under women’s state pension age (both men and women) are not eligible for winter fuel payments.
3. Projections of winter fuel payments on a constituency and local authority level use the latest administrative data to apportion total Great Britain (GB) expenditure over the requested geography. Therefore they do not allow for potentially different trends between these geographical units and Great Britain overall.
4. GB forecasts of winter fuel payments are consistent with Budget 2011 forecasts.

 Winter fuel payments are one part of the overall Government programme to support vulnerable groups in winter. For winter 2011-12, most people who have reached women’s state pension age will receive a winter fuel payment of either £200 or £300 depending on their household circumstances. The winter fuel payment remains a significant contribution to an older person’s winter fuel costs.</p>

               <a name="11040583000654"> Targeted help for vulnerable groups is provided through cold weather payments, which the coalition Government have permanently increased from £8.50 a week to £25 a week. Cold weather payments provide real help to those most vulnerable to the cold i.e. disabled adults and children, the elderly and families with children under five who are in receipt of an income-related benefit. They are paid when the average temperature where a customer lives is 0° C or below for seven consecutive days. This winter, over 17 million cold weather payments have been paid in Great Britain, worth an estimated £430 million.</p>

               <a name="11040583000655"> In addition, subject to parliamentary approval, from winter 2011-12 some of the poorest pensioners would get direct assistance with their energy costs through a rebate off their electricity bills under the warm home discount scheme. Rebates would be at least £120.</p>

               <a name="11040583000656"> The programme of support for vulnerable groups also includes the annual seasonal influenza vaccination programme, which offers free flu jabs to people most at risk from potentially life-threatening complications of flu. The Government ran a new website service, Winter Watch, as well as its annual Keep Warm Keep Well campaign for 2010/11, to provide advice on staying warm over the winter and staying in touch with people who may be vulnerable during cold weather, including the elderly, in order to reduce illness and deaths.</p>

 The Government are strongly committed to investment in apprenticeships for 16 to 18-year-olds, which is why we have an ambitious planning assumption of 131,000 apprenticeships for 2010/11 which allows for significant growth.

The remainder of the 16-19 Bursary Fund—some £165 million a year—will go into discretionary funds that schools and colleges can use in ways that best fit the circumstances and needs of their students, for example, to provide help with books, meals, transport or other course-related costs.</p>

 The Department for Education collects data on the number of Sure Start Children's Centres in each local authority area in England but does not routinely collect data on the number of places provided in each centre. In the Brighton and Hove city council area, 15 children's centres are recorded on the Department for Education's database, providing access to services for around 15,000 children under five and their families. Figures are not available for the Brighton Pavilion constituency. As at 31 March 2010, there were 3,614 children's centres in England and at 22 March 2011 data shows there were 3,621.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">Education maintenance allowance (EMA) is a weekly allowance of up to £30 paid to young people from low income backgrounds between the ages of 16 and 19 if they stay in full time education. The Government have said they will abolish the EMA as part of their measures to cut the deficit and Instead replace it with more targeted help for the poorest students. Critics say this will deter young people from staying in education.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 Local authorities have a strong strategic role to fulfil as commissioners of schools and school places and a statutory duty to plan and secure the provision of schools. Free schools are designed to respond to local parental demand for change and as such we would expect local authorities to work with groups who come forward with an idea for a school. The changes in the Education Bill also provide for LAs to invite, as a first choice, solutions from an academy or a free school group where they have identified a need for additional school places.</p>

 The Department is committed to the Government's ambition to reform public bodies, improve transparency and accountability, streamline services and reduce costs.

The Principal Agreement contains a comprehensive dispute resolution process which would be used if a dispute arose between the parties after it had been signed.

               <i>[holding answer 4 April 2011]:</i> Decisions on pay and conditions are taken at local level, by the employer of the staff in question. All employers are obliged to ensure that their reward structure delivers equality of pay across their work force. This is the purpose of the Single Status review that has been carried out in Cumbria. The Government believe it is right for this matter to be dealt with locally. In doing so, however, there is an expectation that the staffing structures in place in schools will be those that provide for the greatest impact on pupil outcomes.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

As at December 2010, the total number of mobile communication devices supplied to officials in Ministry of Justice headquarters (HQ), Her Majesty’s Prison Service (HMPS) and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) was 10,649. This comprises 7,956 mobile phones, 2,190 BlackBerrys and Smartphones, and 503 other devices (e.g. data cards).

The number and cost for BlackBerrys supplied to the national probation service (NPS) are included in these figures, however, data on mobile phones for the NPS are not included, as records for these are not held centrally and the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

It is therefore impossible to pull out the specific costs for agency fees as these are not separated from daily rates, expenses etc.
<sup>(2 )</sup>This figure has come from the published resource accounts category “Training and Other Staff Costs”. The MoJ and its executive agencies use a wide variety of training methods and it is not possible to capture all of these from the internal accounting system. As well as providing online learning opportunities through the Justice Academy, many staff are job skills trainers, who provide training and support to colleagues in specific skills e.g. bespoke IT packages or local processes. Staff can also access books and other resources from the Learning Library and go through these at their own pace. If the MoJ is not able to offer a suitable course for a staff member, then external training providers may be used.

 As I said on 1 March 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 162-63, in response to a question from the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell), figures held by the Archbishops’ Council show that in the past five years 14 former Roman Catholic priests have sought to be received into ordained ministry within the Church of England. As there is also discretion at diocesan level for acceptance into the ministry, not all candidates are centrally recorded, so the national figure is likely to be higher.

 Maintaining a complete and accurate electoral register is the responsibility of electoral registration officers (EROs). It is clear that more can be done to support completeness and accuracy. So we have announced plans to speed up the implementation of individual electoral registration in 2014, which will ensure that only those entitled to vote will get on the register. And we are also trialling data matching this year to help identify people missing from the register. If successful, we will consider rolling this out across the country.</p>

 UK cereal prices largely reflect the supply and demand situation on the world market. The increase in farmgate prices for feed wheat over the last 12 months is a reaction to the lower wheat production in Russia and other Black Sea countries, and the subsequent implementation of grain export restrictions by Russia and Ukraine. An additional factor is higher energy prices, which have pushed up farm input costs such as fuel and fertiliser.</p>

 I consider that the existing law already protects horses and other equidae against long-term tethering.

 The Health and Social Care Bill 2011 will provide for general practitioner (GP) consortia to be established from April 2012, prior to taking on full statutory responsibilities from April 2013. The Department has established a rolling programme of GP consortia pathfinders to test the different elements involved in GP-led commissioning and enable emerging GP consortia to get more rapidly involved in current commissioning decisions.</p>

 The Government's policy is that national health service services should be commissioned from the best providers able to meet patients’ needs and deliver value for taxpayers' money. Guidance on the procurement of health services in the NHS has been published since May 2008. This guidance has consistently made it clear that procurement processes, including any evaluation of bids for contracts, must be transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory with equality of treatment for all providers.</p>

A key principle of our proposed approach is that ‘any qualified provider’ should be able to offer services where the provider meets quality standards and accepts the NHS standard contract tariff. Prices would be fixed in advance with money following patients' choices and competition on quality. We will publish our response to the consultation shortly.</p>

 The Health and Social Care Bill proposes clear statutory duties on commissioners in relation to procurement and in relation to anti-competitive behaviours. A clear set of underpinning rules and guidance will be developed to apply to general practitioner (GP) consortia, so that they have the necessary support to make decisions that are fair and transparent and avoid any perceived conflicts of interest. In addition, the Bill also includes a requirement that each consortium's constitution sets out arrangements for decision-making and managing potential conflicts of interest. The economic regulator will also have powers to intervene if there are concerns that a consortium has not met its duties in relation to fairness and choice or has engaged in anti-competitive behaviour.</p>

 The Department is very aware of the role innovative medical technology can play in the delivery of the reforms to the national health service. This is why the Department is keen for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to continue its role in assessing medical technologies through the recently established Evaluation Pathway programme. This is designed to provide guidance to the NHS and to help it adopt efficient and cost-effective medical devices and diagnostics more rapidly and consistently.</p>

Furthermore, the Department is keen to build on the Innovative Technology Adoption Procurement Programme—known as iTAPP—which is seeking to speed up the adoption of a number of key medical technologies into the NHS through the National Technology Adoption Centre.</p>

 The principle that ‘any qualified provider’ (previously any willing provider) should be able to offer national health service services subject to patient choice—where the provider meets quality standards and accepts the NHS standard contract and tariff—would not affect the application of competition law. This policy is consistent with the principles of competition law, however, because it seeks to ensure commissioning processes are transparent, non-discriminatory and to avoid restricting choice or competition against patients' interests.</p>

 On average a semi-detached home built to 2010 Building Regulation standards will emit 2.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum from all energy use in the home. Of this, 1.3 tonnes will be from emissions subject to the Building Regulations (i.e. emissions from heating, hot water, lighting and any other fixed building services but not emissions from the use of appliances). The new definition of zero carbon homes requires house builders to mitigate these emissions to ensure that, in net terms, they are reduced to zero. This is the equivalent to the energy standard in level 5 of the Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>

               <a name="11040613001070"> On top of this, to meet the energy standard in level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes, emissions from appliances, such as televisions and hairdryers, have to be reduced, in net terms, to zero. However, emissions from appliances are also subject to a suite of other policies including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and policies to increase the energy efficiency of appliances and the operation of these policies, cumulatively and in combination with the new definition, should have the result that the carbon footprint of new homes does not add to overall carbon reduction burdens.</p>

Additionally, we are investing nearly £4.5 billion over the next four years to deliver up to 150.000 new affordable homes. Key to this is the introduction of an “Affordable Rent” product which will give housing associations greater financial capacity to develop new affordable homes.</p>

 The proposed abolition of the subsidy system does not end the requirement for local authorities to maintain a statutory, ring-fenced housing revenue account. They will still be required to account to their tenants for income and expenditure on council housing separately from other functions and services. This ensures that council taxpayers do not subsidise services specifically for the benefit of tenants and that rent is not used to subsidise functions which are for the benefit of the wider local community.</p>

 I have taken every opportunity to publicise this Government's commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) from 2013, and to explain the results that British taxpayers should expect to see from this investment. The commitment was published in the coalition programme for government and the comprehensive spending review. I have reaffirmed this commitment is several speeches, both in the UK and overseas. Last month saw the publication of ‘UK Aid: Changing Lives, Delivering Results’, which set out clearly the pressing needs in developing countries, and how meeting the 0.7% target will transform lives.</p>

 We continue to underline the need for all Haitian parties to continue to demonstrate their commitment to a free, fair and transparent electoral process. We understand that the delay in announcing the preliminary results is due to the Haitian Provisional Election Council (CEP) making additional checks of the vote tabulations. 14 May 2011 is the date set for the inauguration of the new President. It is vital that this date does not slip, as any political vacuum or loss of momentum would threaten the continuity of the reconstruction efforts so essential to Haiti’s rehabilitation. The Organisation of America States Caribbean Community Election Observation Mission will give its considered opinion of the conduct of the Second Round in the coming weeks. We, along with others in the International Community and in Haiti, will draw important conclusions from that assessment about the state of Haitian democracy. It is vital that the next President works in the interests of all the Haitian people to continue the important task of reconstruction.</p>

 No UK aid flights have landed in Libya since the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1973; however the UK is providing assistance and protection to the people of Benghazi through our funding of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The UK is providing £2 million to ICRC, enabling it to provide medical teams to treat and provide medical supplies to 3,000 people in Libya affected by the ongoing fighting. The ICRC will also provide food and supplies to 100,000 of those most in need.</p>

However, to date humanitarian agencies have reported no widespread, urgent humanitarian needs in Benghazi. In eastern Libya more generally, people have access to food, water and electricity, although there remain pockets of specific needs. Disruption to regular supply chains also risks causing shortages of basic items. Medical supplies are reaching eastern Libya and hospitals are functioning but stretched, with some staff shortages. Throughout Libya we have serious concerns for the protection of civilians.</p>

 There is no fixed list of national policies which are material considerations whenever airport expansion is proposed. The circumstances and the potential impacts of the development will not always be the same. It is for the decision-makers in any planning case to decide which factors are relevant to the case, and how much weight to attach to each. Individual policies in a planning policy statement or planning policy guidance note might be a material consideration in one case, but have no bearing in another.</p>

 There is a requirement under the interoperability directive 2008/57 for railway subsystems to comply with technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs). The current TSI for control-command and signalling applies to high speed or conventional lines on the trans-European rail system and requires the installation of a global system for mobile communication (GSM-R) based secure radio system for new or upgraded lines. The TSI does not require a GSM-R system for lines outside of the scope of the TSI.</p>

These rights are set out in part 17 of schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order 1995 (the GPDO). The GPDO is administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Network Rail advises that its PDRs apply in areas of outstanding natural beauty and we understand the company followed guidance from DCLG about informing local authorities and residents in advance of the development.</p>

Dr Weightman has complete independence to determine the scope of his reports and the arrangements for conducting his inquiries for them. However, the Secretary of State’s responsibilities only relate to civil nuclear facilities. I understand that Dr Weightman's focus for his interim report will be on any early lessons for existing and prospective UK nuclear power stations. His final report may have lessons that are relevant for nuclear safety at defence-related sites.</p>

DECC is working proactively with local authorities and the Local Government Group (LG Group) to enable local authorities to benefit from this new opportunity supported by the renewables incentives framework. For example, a recent DECC-LG Group Memorandum of Understanding<sup>(1)</sup> acknowledges the pivotal role that local councils have in tackling climate change.

 The reduction of child care support to 70% from 80% is part of a range of reforms to the tax credits system announced at the spending review. However, to ensure support is better targeted at low-income families with children, some of the savings from measures announced at the spending review have been recycled into significant above-indexation increases to the child tax credit in 2011-12 and 2012-13. Treasury analysis shows that modelled tax and benefit reforms announced since Budget 2010 have a small reduction in child poverty in 2011-12 and 2012-13; however given the uncertainty around these types of estimates, this change may not be statistically significant.</p>

 Apprenticeships are a demand-led programme for young people and adults. Government fund apprenticeship training, in full for 16 to 19-year-olds and in part for adults, but relies on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities, in the context of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system. Therefore, Government do not plan apprenticeship places but provide funding and forecast the number of places that may be afforded as a result.</p>

 My officials in the Insolvency Service have analysed the likely effect of an increase to the bankruptcy level and undertook some targeted consultation with interested parties last year. About 80% of bankruptcies are as a result of the bankrupt’s own petition where no limit applies. If the limit was increased to £1,750 (which would have been approximately in line with inflationary increases since the limit was last set), there would be expected to be about 3% fewer bankruptcy orders made on a creditor’s petition. Views were invited on the whole personal insolvency regime in our consultation “Managing Borrowing and Dealing with Debt”. Officials are carefully analysing the responses and will be reporting to me in due course.</p>

It is for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities. The apprenticeship places announced in the Budget are in addition to the minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery set out in the Skills Funding Agency's final funding allocations issued to providers on 31 March 2011. I have asked the Skills Funding Agency to propose how the additional funding can best be allocated to colleges and training providers to support delivery of these additional places.</p>

Final decision over the precise nature of services to be offered in Post Office Locals will be made by Post Office Ltd, informed by the results of these pilots.

Member for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden) on 17 February 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 984W, in many cases local authorities, and local enterprise partnerships will be given first refusal as they were the proposed recipient in the relevant asset and liability plan. The disposals will be made in a way that seeks to secure best value for the taxpayer and minimises cost. It is for RDAs to decide when and how to release the plans as they know which aspects of the plans are commercially sensitive. We support them in being as transparent as possible.</p>

 There are no plans for a specific review of the role of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) in further education. The role of SSCs is changing and will increasingly focus on raising employer ambition and investment in skills. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK CES) works with the SSCs to produce and utilise high quality sectoral labour market intelligence to reduce skill gaps, and to raise skill levels. This information helps to ensure that the further education sector provides accurate advice and guidance, as well as delivering qualifications relevant to the changing skill needs of the work force. In addition, SSCs have a central role in developing apprenticeship frameworks, and in enhancing the quality and accessibility of apprenticeships. The majority of SSCs also work closely with national skills academies to promote excellence in vocational training. </p>

 No university wishing to charge over £6,000 yet knows for certain how much it will charge. This is because no university has yet signed an access agreement with the director of fair access. The guidance to the director of fair access makes clear that we expect universities to meet stringent conditions before they can charge above £6,000. However, the director is not a price regulator. What he will do is ensure that the levels of ambition of an institution’s access agreement is proportionate to how much more than the basic level the institution intends to charge.</p>

 UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) is seeking to emulate the best of the private sector professional services organisations. It has developed a range of corporate training programmes to underpin new business methods, such as relationship building with the most significant inward investors and exporters. UKTI's aim is to develop innovative approaches to working with the private sector in order to raise the quality of its services, build successful relationships with trade and investment clients and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.</p>

Trade and investment delivery services in England, apart from London, are outsourced to private sector organisations.</p>
