 At January 2007, there were 789,720 children in primary and secondary schools with English as an additional language (EAL): that is 120,240 or some 18 per cent. higher than in 2004. EAL children comprise 12 per cent. of the whole population, up from 9 per cent. in 2004. Schools need to help such children acquire fluency in English as early as possible so that they can access the full curriculum.</p>

The first is an element within the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for primary schools which was some &#163;256 million in 2004-05, rising to &#163;299 million in 2007-08, with a further rise to over &#163;330 million in 2010-11&#151;an 11 per cent. real terms increase on the 2004-05 level. The second is a substantial provision for EAL through the ring fenced Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG), which has risen from &#163;162 million in 2004-05 to &#163;179 million in 2007-08 and will rise to &#163;206 million by 2010-11&#151;a 9 per cent. increase on the 2004-05 level. In addition an Exceptional Circumstances Grant (ECG) has been introduced to reflect changes in local authorities&#146; pupil numbers which occur after the three year indicative allocations of DSG have been announced. It has three elements covering: an increase of more than 2.5 per cent. in overall pupil numbers; an increase of more than 2.5 per cent. in the proportion of children with EAL; and a one-off payment to authorities with EAL proportions below 10 per cent. which experience an increase in their EAL proportion of more than 2.5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="71206w0002.htm_para2"><a name="07120712000375">These increases in funding form part of the substantial overall increase in school funding: over the past 10 years since 1997, overall per pupil revenue funding for schools has increased by 67 per cent. in real terms. We expect local authorities to be able to manage new pressures from within these very substantial increases.</p>

 It is the responsibility of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) to regulate the public examinations system, and review standards.

An awarding committee comprises the most senior examiners for a qualification. They are required to use professional judgment, supported by technical and statistical data, to ensure that standards are carried forward from year to year. In other words, the committee must ensure that the same level of performance will achieve the same grade across different years.

<a name="71206w0003.htm_brev0"><a name="07120712005937"><ul><p class="tabletext">The awarding bodies that offer GCSE and A levels are AQA, Edexcel and OCR in England, WJEC in Wales and CCEA in Northern Ireland: Between them, each of these awarding bodies offers up to 50 different subjects at GCSE and 40 different subjects at A level. Some awarding bodies offer more than one qualification in each subject per qualification type. In addition there are now opportunities to sit GCSE examinations in March, November and June and A level examinations in January and June.</p>
</ul><a name="71206w0003.htm_brev1"><a name="07120712005938"><ul><p class="tabletext">Therefore, answering your question would require the collection of an extremely large amount of data in the form of a list of each grade A and grade C boundary mark for each of the hundreds of GCSE and A level specifications in each of the examination series in each of the 10 years since 1997. The only inference that could realistically be taken from such data would be that mark boundaries have varied and, indeed must vary, in order to maintain standards. Furthermore, raw mark grade boundary data could also be misleading as they would not necessarily indicate where there have been changes in the total number of marks available in a particular examination component.</p>
</ul><a name="71206w0003.htm_brev2"><a name="07120712005939"><ul><p class="tabletext">On previous occasions, QCA has investigated the issue of changes in grade boundaries to look at whether a change in grade boundary marks indicated a change in standards. We looked at a number of grade boundaries in English, English Literature and Mathematics over a number of years. In addition, QCA collected data from a wide range of GCSE and A level examinations in a single year. We concluded that changes in grade boundaries did not indicate a change in standards and that it would not be necessary for us to expand our investigation or collect data from a wider sample. I attach a copy of the report on this work.</p>
</ul><a name="71206w0003.htm_brev3"><a name="07120712005940"><ul><p class="tabletext">However, all of this is in relation to raw mark grade boundaries only. A levels and modular GCSEs allow candidates to sit component parts of the same qualification in different examination series and because papers in different years will be of slightly differing demand a method of scaling is required to ensure that the same level of achievement would receive the same grade across examination series. This scale is the Uniform Mark Scale (UMS) and it enables units for which different amounts of marks are available to be aggregated across or within an examination series to give an overall grade. The percentage of UMS marks required to achieve a given grade does not vary. At GCSE the following percentage of the maximum uniform marks available for a component is required to achieve a particular grade: A* - 90% of the available uniform marks; A - 80%; B - 70%; C - 60%; D - 50%; E - 40%; F - 30%; G - 20%. At A level to following percentage of maximum uniform marks are required to achieve a particular grade: A - 80%; B - 70; C - 60%; D - 50%; E - 40%.</p>

As an alternative for schools that instead wish to use a commercial phonics programme, we have published guidance on a set of criteria which define the key features of an effective phonics teaching programme and which build directly on the Review's recommendations.</p>

The Communication, Language and Literacy Development (CLLD) programme, specifically developed to implement the Review's recommendations, builds greater quality and capacity in the teaching of early literacy through developing work on speaking and listening; strengthening leadership and management of early literacy; and supporting all schools with phonics and early reading. The CLLD programme has provided training in early reading for every local authority and has funded additional consultants to lead this work in 50 targeted authorities.</p>

 The results of National Curriculum Key Stage 2 tests are included in the head teacher's annual report which forms part of the common transfer file of information which must be transferred between schools when pupils change schools. The Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2005 require that when a pupil changes schools, this file is sent to the receiving school no later than 15 school days after the day on which the pupil ceases to be registered at the old school. For most pupils entering secondary school, this will mean that the results will be transferred in September.</p>

1. Price Base: Real terms at 2006-07 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 26.09.07.<br>
2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of standard spending assessment/education formula spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>
3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged three to 19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-7 to 2008-9, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA). The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three-year-old maintained pupils and estimated three to four-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>
4. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
5. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>
6. 1997-98 figures for authorities subject to local government reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="71206w0007.htm_para0"><a name="07120712001785">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the following table are taken from the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="71206w0007.htm_para1"><a name="07120712001786">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS, which comprises a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="71206w0007.htm_para2"><a name="07120712001787">The per pupil revenue funding figures for years 2006-07 to 2007-08 for England and for each local authority in Greater London are provided in the following table.

1. The revenue funding per pupil figures only run to 2005-06 because we cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 1998-99 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br>
2. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.<br>
3. Price Base: Real terms at 2006-07 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 26 September 2007.<br>
4. This covers funding through the dedicated schools grant, school standards grant, school standards grant (personalisation) and standards fund; it excludes grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>
5. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3-19 and exclude Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-07 to 2008-09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

 There are no plans to specify different timescales for the statementing of children with different levels or types of special educational needs (SEN). A significant part of the statementing process is a thorough assessment of the child's needs, in order to determine the appropriate provision to meet those needs. The Government's response to the July 2006 Education and Skills Select Committee report on SEN announced that Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools will review progress in the current system in 2009-10. We will then consider, in the light of HMCI's advice, whether changes are needed to the current framework.</p>

The estimated cost of the Eurofighter Typhoon programme is commercially sensitive information which is protected in order to maintain our negotiating position for future acquisitions on the Typhoon programme.

 The out of service dates of the Swiftsure and Trafalgar class submarines were adjusted during the Department's 2004 planning round to reflect the planned in-service dates of the Astute class submarines and the decision, announced in the July 2004 White Paper Delivering Security in a Changing World-Future Capabilities (Cmd 6269), to reduce the size of the submarine fleet. As a consequence, some submarines had their service lives extended, and others had theirs reduced. No estimate has been made of whether any associated costs are specifically attributable to adjustments to the out of service date of the existing fleet to meet the in-service dates of the Astute class.</p>

immediately to those that may require 365 days or more notice to deploy. I am withholding information about the readiness states of most Royal Navy vessels as its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of our armed forces.

 In 2002 DEFRA funded a five year research project on rat control strategies costing &#163;400,000. This included some work on use of a new rodenticide. The final report is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

 A Government funded survey was carried out in the 1990s which looked at resistance to anti-coagulant rodenticides and concluded that rodenticide resistance was becoming a significant problem in many areas.</p>

Last year, following agreement by the chairman of the Advisory Committee on pesticides, the HSE gave emergency approval for outdoor use of brodifacoum at one site in Winchester on the basis of an assessment that rats there appeared to be resistant to other treatments. Risks to wildlife (the reason outdoor use is not normally permitted) could be managed since it is a relatively enclosed site.</p>

 The opening quota for the 10 m and under fleet is boosted by Fisheries Administrations acquiring additional quota in-year for their use. Information on the 10 m and under fleet&#146;s share of quota at 31 December 2006 is set out in the table. However, focusing on such an analysis can be misleading, as some of the quota stocks included are of little interest to inshore vessels. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to the constraints on their activity that may be seen when targeting quota  <br>

However, where the situation is of serious concern and where the Government in question refuses to co-operate or to make use of the support offered to them by the UN human rights mechanisms, it is entirely appropriate for the UNGA or the UN Human Rights Council to express concern over the situation through a resolution, if necessary without the support of the country concerned.

The EU presidency, with strong UK support, has raised concerns about juvenile execution cases with the Iranian authorities on at least thirteen occasions this year. We also make representations in bilateral meetings with the Iranians. Most recently, senior officials raised two juvenile execution cases (Soghra Nafj-Pour and Makwan Moloudzadeh) with the Iranian ambassador on 26 October&#151;we have since heard that their cases are being reviewed&#151;and, in a meeting with the Iranian embassy on 23 November, protested the recent execution of Mohammad Reza Tork.</p>

<i> FCE</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="71206w0020.htm_para7"><a name="07120712003939">NERC council has undertaken an independent mid-term evaluation of the QUEST programme, which will be published shortly. This evaluation concluded that the programme has made good links with stakeholders including central government, and that it is satisfactorily mobilising its preliminary science outputs to inform policy, and increasing the UK&#146;s capability to generate policy-relevant science.</p>

 The 2007 Humanitarian Action Plan (HAP) for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is costed at US$687 million which includes both emergency and early recovery activities. Donors have contributed US$437 million to the HAP so far. Around US$100 million of these contributions have been made through the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund, which provides the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator complete flexibility in targeting funds to meet the most critical humanitarian needs.</p>

 In regions where all countries are not able to sign an economic partnership agreement (EPA), the European Commission will consider agreeing a sub-regional EPA with the countries that are ready and would like to sign. With the deadline only a few weeks away and with some countries wanting to sign an EPA even though the full region is not ready, this is a pragmatic way forward to ensure as many countries as possible can benefit from duty free quota free access into the European Union markets from 1 January 2008. If a sub-regional EPA is signed, other countries in the region should be able to join the EPA as soon as they are ready. The effect on regional integration will vary depending on the extent of existing regional integration in the area and the scope of neighbouring agreements.

 Entry to the Channel Islands is governed by UK immigration legislation extended to the Islands. The Border and Immigration Agency does not operate a border control on passengers arriving from the Channel Islands as this falls within the arrangements set out for the common travel area. The objective of the common travel area (the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland) is that all the territories should be treated as a single unit for the purpose of travel within the area. Passengers arriving in the United Kingdom from the Channel Islands are, therefore, not normally subject to examination by an immigration officer. Passengers arriving from countries outside the common travel area, including other European Union states, are required to show their passports or identity cards, where appropriate, on each arrival.</p>

 The proposals contained within the draft Criminal Justice Order (Northern Ireland) 2007 introduce new sentencing options for dangerous violent and sexual offenders; these offenders will only be released when the independent Parole Commissioners consider it is safe to do so. A strategic joint steering group has been established to focus specifically on offender behavioural programmes for high risk offenders in relation to public protection and resettlement. In addition to existing expenditure in this area, we plan to invest a further &#163;4.7million over the next three financial years to implement the strategy. This will include investment in education and psychology services to recruit and train new staff to undertake risk assessments, provide programmes and work directly with dangerous offenders to reduce their risk, and to put the necessary structures in place to manage the process.</p>

 The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), which will come into effect in April 2008, is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring transport fuel suppliers to ensure that an increasing percentage of their total road transport fuel sales is made up of biofuels. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions saved by different biofuels varies considerably and depends on a wide range of factors including the amount of energy used in the cultivation, processing and transportation of the crop. The RTFO will include a reporting mechanism to encourage transport fuel suppliers to source those biofuels which deliver high levels of carbon savings in a sustainable way, and to allow the policy&#146;s greenhouse gas savings to be accurately quantified. The Government estimate that by 2010 the RTFO could save between 2.6 and 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.</p>

 The development of proposals to reduce the traffic generated by the school run does not fall into neat boxes that enable us to identify exactly how many officials are engaged on this.

Additional work to promote and facilitate walking and cycling to school is done by the six officials working in the Department's walking and cycling team and by Cycling England, an independent body set up by the Department in 2005 to promote cycling. In addition, officials in several other teams across the Department work on the development of proposals that have a direct impact on parents' decisions as to whether or not to let their children travel to and from school by non-car modes.

 HMRC&#146;s approach on recovery of overpayments is set out in Code of Practice 26 &#145;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credits&#146;. In cases where recovery is made from an ongoing award, a customer&#146;s award notice will confirm the amount of the overpayment and how much the award will be reduced by to recover the sum. To prevent hardship, payments from ongoing award are restricted to 10 per cent. of the tax credit award for those on maximum tax credits awards (those families with the lowest incomes). For those on a tapered award (those families whose income is higher than the WTC or CTC income threshold) recovery is set at 25 per cent. If families face financial difficulties on the reduced payments, they are advised to contact HMRC and ask for their case to be reconsidered.</p>

As such, it is important to take steps to adapt to the short, medium and long-term risks and impacts. At the beginning of this year, the Department commissioned the Hadley Centre for Climate Change to undertake a high level assessment, building on an internal review carried out in 2003, of the risks that climate change poses to its policies and operations. This was launched at the Department&#146;s Sustainable Development conference in March, which focused and engaged senior officials specifically on the theme of climate change adaptation. The review is expected to be completed by the end of 2007, and will form the basis for a future programme of adaptation work, based on the priorities identified.</p>

1. These figures relate to Great Britain, and are consistent with the assumption for the UK.<br>
2. The assumption on the future claimant count is the average of a number of forecasts, all of which are made by non-Governmental organisations. When these forecasters predict that the claimant count will increase (as here), it follows that the assumption will reflect that increase. Were these forecasters to predict a decrease in the claimant count, then the assumption would remain constant at its current level for all future years.<br>
3. These figures are audited by the National Audit Office.<br>
4. Since very few of the external forecasters predict the claimant count beyond 2011-12, the assumption ends in that year.<br>
5. The claimant count in 2011-12 is equivalent to 2.9 per cent. of the economically active population of working age, based on the calculations underpinning the Long-Term Public Finance Report. Projections for 2012-13 onwards assume that this rate will be constant.<br>

<i> [holding answer 19 November 2007]:</i> The information is in the following table. The winter fuel payment is intended to provide a contribution towards winter heating bills which account for around 60 per cent. of the total annual fuel bill. The payment provides a significant contribution to these higher winter costs. Winter fuel payments have increased from 20 in 1997-98 to the current value of &#163;200 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 years of age, and &#163;300 for households with someone aged 80 or over.</p>
