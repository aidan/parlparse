To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee what provision for bicycle parking has been made at Portcullis House.  [34085]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spnew1"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 The expenditure on both refurbishment and furnishings for the smoking room over the last five years has been of such a minor nature that separate records are not available.

To ask the Attorney-General what percentage of cases prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution

Service were begun with the defendant having indicated an intention to plead <i>(a)</i> guilty to the offence for which he or she was charged, <i>(b)</i> guilty to a lesser charge and <i>(c)</i> not guilty.  [34482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records on plea indications. The information is held in branch offices on individual case files, and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General how many defendants were convicted having <i>(a)</i> pleaded guilty to the offence with which they were originally charged, <i>(b)</i> pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and <i>(c)</i> pleaded not guilty in the last year for which figures are available.  [34478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records on pleas to original or lesser charges. The information is held on individual case files in each branch office, and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. However, central records are kept in relation to the number of defendants convicted following a not guilty plea.
<P>

<a name="80313w01.html_para0">The number of defendants convicted in magistrates' courts following a plea of not guilty was 53,235 in 1997, 74.4 per cent. of contested hearings.
<P>

<a name="80313w01.html_para1">The number convicted in the Crown Court following a plea of not guilty was 13,226, 60.3 per cent. of contested hearings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The information sought is recorded only on individual case files and is not collected or collated centrally. This information could therefore be collected only at disproportionate cost. Home Office statistics for 1989 and 1994 show a decline in convictions for soliciting in the 14 to 17 year old age group.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what steps he has taken to improve the marine environment of the Irish Sea as it affects the Welsh coast line.  [33528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Levels of pollution in the Irish Sea are being investigated in a Quality Status Report being prepared under the auspices of the Oslo and Paris Commissions. A Regional Task Force is overseeing the Report's preparation: its membership is made up of experts from the Irish and UK Governments, including from the Welsh Office.
<P>

<a name="80313w01.html_para2">At the same time, action is in hand to tackle many of the sources of marine pollution. We are currently reviewing the National Contingency Plan for pollution from shipping and offshore installations which sets out the arrangements for dealing with pollution arising from spillages of oil and other hazardous substances into the marine environment. Whilst radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea are already at levels which cause minimal harm to the environment, we are reducing them still further. We have also said that we want to move toward the target of the cessation of discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances. The dumping of sewage sludge at sea is being phased out--Dwr Cymru Welsh Water stopped using this disposal route several years ago. Dwr Cymru is also introducing full treatment at all its coastal sewage discharges.

<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the social exclusion network as it affects <i>(a)</i> North and <i>(b)</i> South Wales.  [33531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The Welsh Office Social Exclusion Network is an internal Welsh Office group consisting of senior officials drawn from across the spectrum of the Department's functions. Its remit is to promote effective co-operation between the various parts of the Welsh Office to tackle social exclusion and to shift the focus of policies and programmes towards preventing social exclusion across Wales. Its work builds on and complements that of the Social Exclusion Unit, which is based within the Cabinet Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will estimate the number of jobs in the timber processing industry in Wales.  [33529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics' 1995 Annual Employment Survey estimated that there were 3,900 employees in the timber processing industry in Wales.

 Information on the qualifications on school leavers is not held by age group prior to 1994. From 1994, the collected information has distinguished as a single group all those aged 17 and over as at 31 August of the preceding academic year. This will include some pupils who leave school aged 17 and a few who left school aged over 19. The following table shows the number of such students who left school with no A-level, AS-level, GCSE, Certificate of Education or vocational qualification from BTEC, Pitmans, City & Guilds or RSA.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it is the policy of Her Majesty's Government to maintain the current coastguard helicopter search and rescue provision at Lee-on-Solent and Portland.  [33378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Coastguard helicopters at Lee-on-Solent and Portland are contracted until 2001. The Coastguard Agency has no plans to change the current arrangements.

<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many individual journeys provided by bus operators in the north west traffic area were cancelled without notice during (i) 1994-95, (ii) 1995-96 and (iii) 1996-97; and what percentage of total journeys these figures represent.  [33959]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department does not collect this information in the form requested. However, under the provisions of the Transport Act 1985 bus operators are required to run services in accordance with the details they register with the local Traffic Commissioner, whose staff monitor compliance on a random basis. Details are not available for 1994-95 and 1995-96 but the results of 22 monitoring exercises carried out in the north west traffic area in 1996-97 and 54 in 1997-98 to date, show that the number of individual journeys which failed to run was a negligible proportion, less than 3 per cent. of total bus journeys in the area. In view of local concerns, the traffic area office are planning further monitoring exercises in the area including Greater Manchester.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the inquiry into the derailment of a train carrying nuclear waste at Harwich on 8 January; and when its report will be published.  [33906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This incident occurred at approximately 17.50 hours on 8 January 1998, at Harwich Parkstone Quay Yard. During shunting operations one pair of wheels of a barrier wagon, between a locomotive and three nuclear flask wagons, became derailed on hand worked points. The barrier wagon contained no nuclear materials and there were no injuries.
<P>

<a name="80313w02.html_para0">The incident was investigated by the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate and a summary of the incident will appear in the 1997-98 Annual Report on Railway Safety which is due for publication in December 1998.

<P><I>13 Mar 1998 : Column: 362</I><P>
Change; and what consultations the Government have had, for the purpose of this study, with organisations outside the aviation industry.  [34112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The DETR plays a leading part in the International Civil Aviation Organisation which is working closely with the IPCC on this special report. One of the report's two lead authors is an adviser to the Department and the DETR is also supporting the participation of other key UK experts.
<P>

<a name="80313w02.html_para1">The IPCC process is an open one and the draft report will be available for review by experts, governments and international non-governmental organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reasons the aviation industry has given his Department for its opposition to new noise limits for departing aircraft at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.  [34114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The grounds put forward by the International Air Transport Association in their recent application for leave to apply for judicial review related to alleged deficiencies in the consultation paper. The Department has undertaken to publish a supplementary paper and IATA has therefore withdrawn its application. I expect those airlines and aviation organisations which are opposed to our proposals will give their reasons for this in their responses to the consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Light rapid transit systems, which include street running tramways, can have a role to play in delivering integrated transport in urban areas--particularly if they are planned as part of an overall local transport strategy. We look to local authorities to develop proposals through public/private partnerships and will consider on their merits any such proposals which require support from Government funds.

<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the number of park-and-ride schemes for which each local authority bid for funding under the transport policy and programmes system for 1998-99, indicating in each case the amount of money bid for; and if he will list by local authority, the number of schemes which received funding under the transport policy and programmes system for 1998-99, indicating in each case the amount of money allocated.  [34522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All the available information is contained in the table. Only park-and-ride schemes that individually cost &#163;2 million or more received scheme-specific allocations for 1998-99. Local authorities also have the freedom to pursue schemes below that value, using the block allocations they receive for packages of 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 1998 : Column: 363</I><P>
transport measures. Under the package approach they are not required to specify before the start of a financial year the schemes they will pursue using those allocations. So

I also set out the government's view that progress on these issues and avoidance of unilateral actions which destroy confidence are essential to restore trust and allow for a resumption of negotiations on final status issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The need for legislation to control the availability and promotion of knives as weapons was considered in detail by hon. Members during 1996 and 1997 during the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 and the Knives Act 1997, introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Baillieston (Mr. Wray) which was fully supported by my right hon. Friend and myself, then in Opposition. We had concluded that simply banning knives with sharp points except when such knives are designated for a specific and legitimate purpose would not achieve the desired end. Knives with legitimate purposes can be as lethal as ones which would not be so designated and such an approach would require a complex and costly designation system.
<P>

<a name="80313w03.html_para10">While the Government have no plans at present for a further review, we remain open to any suggestions for a further tightening of legislation on knives, and would consider banning the sale of any specific bladed or pointed article which could be defined in a way which distinguished it from articles which do have legitimate purposes.

<a name="80313w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis tells me that no central figures are kept on the number of cases where the prosecution has had to disclose that the evidence of an officer has on a previous occasion been discredited. Nevertheless, the Commissioner demands absolute integrity from his officers. If an officer gives evidence which raises concern with the trial magistrate or judge then they will direct that the matter be investigated. The procedure is for an internal investigation to be started. If, following such an investigation, the officer can be shown to be discredited then any cases in which the officer is subsequently involved would be reviewed by the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

<a name="80313w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison Service has in place as part of its drug strategy robust measures aimed at preventing the entry of drugs into prisons. In practical terms, the methods aimed at preventing the entry of drugs are the same for all classes of drugs. All drugs are hard to detect due to the small amounts usually involved, although the additional risks posed by class A drugs are recognised.
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para0">Measures include: searching of visitors and of prisoners following visits; use of closed circuit television in visits areas; and perimeter searching. Many establishments use drug dogs which are an effective means of deterring visitors who may attempt to smuggle drugs. Prisoners found guilty of drug smuggling are liable to be placed on closed visits, while visitors may be arrested and denied future visits if found with drugs.

 France has strict laws against ticket touting under their Penal Code. All tickets for the World Cup will carry the name of the person to whom they are issued by the French authorities. The tickets can be re-sold only with the written permission of the authorities, and without that authority the original purchaser remains liable for the actions of those in the ground who use the ticket. The French authorities have advised they will rigidly apply the law against those who are in breach of the Code. My right hon. Friend has welcomed this approach in meetings with his French counterpart. Additionally, United Kingdom officials have discussed with the French authorities the practical measures in place to minimise the ability to sell tickets without written permission from the relevant authorities. We have registered our concern at the potential impact on safety and security of touted tickets getting into the hands of rival fans.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how release dates of prisoners who are repatriated from abroad are calculated.  [34935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The release dates of repatriated prisoners are calculated on the basis of the legislation in force on the date on which the prisoner is repatriated, subject to the provisions of the Schedule to the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 (as amended by Schedule 2 to the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997).
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para1">The warrants under which prisoners are repatriated may contain reference to two separate periods. The first is the balance to serve, which is deemed to be the prisoner's sentence in this country. The second, for prisoners for whom it is applicable, is a period used solely to calculate the parole eligibility date of the prisoner.
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para2">In calculating the balance of the sentence remaining to be served by a prisoner following return to this country, account is taken of the time served abroad by the prisoner including, where applicable, any remand time and any remission available to the prisoner. The resulting balance is administered in accordance with the relevant United 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 1998 : Column: 371</I><P>
Kingdom legislative provisions. Automatic release in the case of prisoners sentenced abroad to four years or more therefore occurs at the two thirds point of the balance to serve, and for prisoners sentenced abroad to less than four years, at the halfway point. Prisoners sentenced to periods of imprisonment abroad of four years or more are also eligible to be considered for discretionary release on licence (parole).
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para3">As far as parole is concerned, it has always been the policy that a repatriated prisoner should be treated as if he had been sentenced here i.e. he should become eligible for parole after having served one half of his original term of imprisonment (or one third in the case of prisoners sentenced prior to 1 October 1992). For the purposes of achieving this, it was the practice to specify in the warrant for the purposes solely of calculating parole eligibility, a period equivalent to the time actually served by the prisoner abroad.
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para4">Amendments made to the 1984 Act as a consequence of the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 resulted in anomalies with regard to the position of repatriated prisoners. In particular, the amendments linked parole eligibility and automatic release dates. As a consequence specifying a period in the warrant for the purposes of calculating parole eligibility had the unintended effect of bringing forward the prisoner's automatic release date. Judicial reviews brought in 1995 and 1996 brought these difficulties to light for the first time. It also emerged that the parole eligibility dates of prisoners had not previously been calculated fully in accordance with the terms of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para5">The difficulties identified in the legislation were corrected by means of amendments to the 1984 Act contained in Schedule 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. In the light of the amendments and the discovery that parole dates were not previously calculated entirely in accordance with the legislation, it has become clear that it is not always appropriate to specify in the warrant a period equivalent to the actual time served by the prisoner abroad since this does not always result in the correct parole eligibility date.
<P>

<a name="80313w04.html_para6">Since 1 October 1997, therefore, normal policy has been to specify, for the purposes of calculating parole eligibility in accordance with the provisions of the Schedule to the 1984 Act, a period which ensures that the prisoner becomes eligible to be considered for parole after having served one half (or one third) of the original sentence. Each case is considered on an individual basis, taking into account the length of the original sentence, the time served abroad, and the balance to serve in this country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the possible link between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism. [33921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Following recent media coverage of a paper published in <i>The Lancet</i> on 28 February, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, issued a public statement on 12 March as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Since the Lancet article was published there has been much misleading media coverage about possible links between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and autism. I am concerned that health professionals should have available the best information to give to parents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Despite the Lancet paper stating categorically 'We did not prove a link between MMR vaccine and the syndrome described', this work has been wrongly reported as demonstrating a real causal association.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Independent experts and I have seen the published research and we are not convinced that there is indeed any link. No evidence has been published that demonstrates that MMR plays a part in autism.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Only one of the 13 authors of the Lancet paper has suggested, although not via published papers, that MMR should be given as three separate injections at least a year apart. The following points are important for parents and health professionals alike:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no published evidence to support the separate doses suggestion. The suggestion is counter to the recommendations of the Department of Health's independent experts and the World Health Organisation.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 1998 : Column: 378</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are clear adverse consequences from following such a suggestion: take up for three separate immunisations will undoubtedly be less than that where only one is needed--some children will inevitably miss one or two jabs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the period from the first to the third injections children will be left unnecessarily at risk from serious diseases whilst they wait, unprotected, for two years or more between vaccines. During this time they and their contacts are at risk of infection.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Concerned parents, may find it helpful to know that the Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Dr. Ralph Henderson, has written to the Department of Health this week saying:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'We believe none of these data [in the Lancet article] provide a basis for providing the different components of this vaccine in separate schedules.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We wished to inform you of this as a means of offering you and your colleagues support in remaining firm in supporting the continued use of this highly effective vaccine which has such an outstanding safety record.'</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Immunisation policy is built on scientific evidence of benefit and risk. No scientific evidence of the risk of autism from MMR has been published. There is an inevitable increased risk in following the suggestion that children receive three separate vaccines, given that they may then be exposed to serious infections for far longer than necessary. Therefore I strongly recommend that parents continue to have their children vaccinated with MMR."</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80313w06.html_para4">The Chief Medical Officer's statement also included the following joint statement by the British Medical Association, Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association, Faculty of Public Health Medicine, General Medical Services Committee, Royal College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Royal College of Physicians:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We fully support the Chief Medical Officer's advice. We strongly advise all parents to continue with the present MMR vaccination programme. This is essential for the welfare of children."</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80313w06.html_para5">The Chief Medical Officer's statement concluded:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I believe it is important to listen to all the arguments on this topic. Last year I agreed to convene a scientific seminar to air these issues. That independent seminar is now being organised by the Medical Research Council and will bring together experts on virology, epidemiology, gastroenterology, paediatrics and immunology. Following that meeting, on the 23 March, I will be writing to all doctors to let them know my conclusions."</FONT></UL>

However, since I announced the Government's decision to introduce controls on dietary supplements containing vitamin B6 I have read both the papers on the safety of vitamin B6 that were prepared for the COT by its Secretariat, together with a selection of the scientific studies to which these refer.

The Government have every confidence in the rigour with which the COT reviewed the data on the safety of vitamin B6, and the decision to introduce controls on dietary supplements containing this vitamin was taken in the light of the very clear recommendations of the COT and the Food Advisory Committee.

 The animals purchased by the Intervention Board under the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) and the Selective Cull Scheme (SCS) are either being directly incinerated, or rendered into meat and bonemeal (MBM) and tallow which is being safely and securely stored pending destruction.

Whilst the Board is negotiating with a number of companies for the large scale incineration of MBM with energy recovery, no decisions have yet been taken on any option or options. The goal remains to find a disposal solution which takes full account of the need to protect human and environmental health whilst at the same time keeping the cost to the taxpayer as low as is consistent with this.

In order to help clear the backlog of OTMS animals awaiting slaughter following the scheme's introduction in 1996, carcases were held temporarily in cold store. At 1 May 1997, some 134,500 OTMS carcases were still in cold storage, but these had all been removed and rendered by the end of October 1997. No SCS carcases have been put into cold storage.<P>

 We welcome the report. The guidelines offer real support for midwives in dealing with very sensitive situations. It helps them to know the signs, both physical and emotional, to look for and how to help the woman involved and her children. The report has been brought to the attention of Home Office Ministers who have responsibility for domestic violence and the Police. Other professional groups are developing their own guidelines for their members.

<a name="80313w08.html_para4">The Department has produced its own guidance on buying and using consultancy based on the findings of the Efficiency Unit Scrutiny Report on the use of External Consultants published in August 1994. This has been supplemented by individual Agency procedural guidance. External Consultants are only engaged when internal resources are not available; best procurement practices are followed to ensure that value for money is obtained; and assignments are subject to a post implementation review where appropriate. Not all consultancy projects lend themselves to analysis in terms of resultant savings; however the intelligent and selective use of consultants has delivered worthwhile solutions and benefits for the Department.

 The Benefit Integrity Project aims to ensure that those in receipt of DLA are entitled to it. While it is right to check that people are receiving the correct amount of benefit, we are determined that those checks should be undertaken as sensitively as possible. Also, that we should ensure all decisions taken as a result of the project are right. We have, therefore, acted to introduce an extra safeguard to improve the quality of, and confidence in, benefit decisions made by the Project.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1998]:</i> Information for 2003-04 is not available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, if in 2001-02 the basic retirement pension and linked benefits were increased to the same proportion of average earnings as in 1980, with corresponding increases in the lower and upper earnings limits, the main Class 1 contribution rates required for employees and employers would be 13.8 per cent. and 12.4 per cent. respectively. This estimate assumes that each contribution rate would be set so that on full-time average earnings the employee and the employer would pay the same amount of additional contributions.

To offset the extra cost of uprating basic RP and the linked benefits by earnings in April 1999 and April 2000, we estimate that Class 1 NIC rates would stay constant in 1999-2000 and would need to be raised by 0.1 per cent. for employers and 0.2 per cent. for employees in 2000-01.

 The Government made a manifesto commitment to set up a review of central areas of insecurity for elderly people, including all aspects of the basic pension and its value; and second pensions including SERPS. The key objective of the Government's Pensions Review is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement; that they should share fairly in rising prosperity; and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable. The Government are also committed to examining ways of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners. It is estimated that one million do not receive the Income Support to which they are entitled. Research has been commissioned into why they do not claim Income Support. Last November, we announced funding of &#163;15 million for a number of pilot schemes, starting in April, to help find the most effective way of getting Income Support to pensioners who do not claim it.
<P>

<a name="80313w09.html_para6">During his pre-budget statement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the Government were not prepared to allow another winter to go by, when pensioners are fearful of turning up their heating, even on the coldest winter days, because they do not know whether they will have the help they need for their fuel bills. He announced that a total of &#163;400 million was being committed to help all pensioners with fuel bills to pay, for this winter and next--each pensioner household receiving &#163;20, but the poorest receiving Income Support &#163;50.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Net incomes before housing costs have been derived using the 1995-96 version of the Tax Benefit Model (TBM). The TBM is designed to illustrate the weekly financial circumstances of a selection of hypothetical local authority and private tenants.<P>

2. The net income before housing costs (NIBHC) figures reflect each family's net weekly income after income tax, National Insurance Contributions and all income from benefits (including Child Benefit) have been taken into account; but before housing costs (rent and Council Tax).<P>

3. It has been assumed that the &#163;75 per week housing costs specified in the question are comprised of &#163;65 per week rent and &#163;10 per week Council Tax.<P>

4. The table reflects the situation for both local authority and private tenants; at any given level of rent and Council Tax, net incomes are the same for both local authority and private tenants. Owner occupiers are not covered by the table.<P>

5. It has been assumed that the gross earnings levels specified in the question are the result of full-time employment of more than 30 hours per week. Therefore, the 30-hour Family Credit premium of &#163;10 per week is in payment.<P>

6. The net income deciles have been calculated from the Households Below Avenge Income (HBA) dataset, based on the 1995-96 Family Resources Survey, and are the latest available. The decile breaks (at January 1996 prices) are: &#163;118, &#163;144, &#163;169, &#163;195, &#163;227, &#163;262, &#163;303, &#163;363 and &#163;463. The NIBHC figures have been equivalised using the McClement's scale, as used in Department's publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBA).<P>

7. Apart from the assumptions made specific to the question, the TBM also rests on a number of more general assumptions:<P>

<i>(a)</i> No tax allowances apart from personal allowances are in operation;<P>

<i>(b)</i> There is no reduced tax liability for spells of unemployment or sickness earlier in the tax year;<P>

<i>(c)</i> National Insurance Contributions are paid at the not contracted out rate;<P>

<i>(d)</i> The family type actually takes up all of the benefits they are entitled to;<P>

<i>(e)</i> The family receives no income from earnings, benefits or capital other than that shown in the table.<P>

 The Government Actuary in November 1997 was asked for his views on the effect of a number of factors on the national insurance rebates. His report gave advice but did not make recommendations. When deciding on the new rebate levels we did, of course, take careful note of his advice but also had to consider the impact of recent trends in pensions on the resources available to the National Insurance Fund.

 Tinnitus is a symptom not a discrete pathology or diagnosis. It can be due to many causes other than ear pathologies.
<P>

<a name="80313w10.html_para3">Where tinnitus is linked to disablement which is due to service it will be included as part and parcel of that disablement and may result in an increased assessment of the disablement and therefore an increased pension. Tinnitus is therefore, already recognised and considered when determining the level of an award under the War Pension Scheme.

<P>
<a name="80313w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The present &#163;15 earnings disregard was introduced in April 1988 and, in common with other disregards, has not been increased to reflect inflation. However, we continue to review benefits paid to sick and disabled people as part of our commitment to modernise the Social Security system. No decisions have yet been reached, but we will consult disabled people, their organisations and others with an interest before making any changes.

 We remain deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Nigeria. In particular: the continued detention of Chief Abiola, leading trades unionists Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi and other political prisoners despite General Abacha's 17 November 1997 Amnesty; the death in detention of Shehu Musa Yar'Adua on 8 December 1997. We are also concerned about health of other prisoners including General Obasanjo and Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti. In 1997, the Nigerian Human Rights Commission made a number of recommendations for improving prison conditions. There has been no response to date; the continued harassment of journalists (some 18 journalists remain in detention) and human rights/pro-democracy activists who were forcibly prevented from staging a rally in Lagos on 3 March; the failure to resolve the case of the 20 Ogonis facing the same charges as Ken Saro-Wiwa. We have also received reports that in January, up to 100 Ogonis were detained, that Ogoni Mr. Daniel Naador died in January while in custody, and that a woman was shot and killed when the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force fired into the crowd during an Ogoni day event. We are also concerned about the whereabouts and health of Mr. Batom Mitee, brother of Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP)'s Acting President.
<P>

<a name="80313w11.html_para4">As Presidency of the EU, we will be working for a further strong Resolution at the Commission for Human Rights in Geneva in April 1998.

<a name="80313w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We formally complained to the European Commission in October 1995 about Spain's refusal to accept Gibraltar ID cards as valid travel documents within the EU/EEA under the terms of Directive 68/360/EEC.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w11.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We do not accept that there should be a link between the controls Spain operates at the Spain/Gibraltar border and any discussion about Gibraltar's status. Spain has the right to carry out customs controls as Gibraltar is outside the Community Customs Territory. The Spanish Foreign Minister has given an assurance that delays will be kept to a minimum. We look to Spain to respect that assurance and to ensure that any checks are proportionate.

<a name="80313w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We look forward to a wide-ranging, informal and productive political discussion at ASEM 2 and expect to touch on human rights. Leaders at the first ASEM 2 made clear that political dialogue, including consideration of fundamental rights, was one of the key dimensions of ASEM. The successful seminar on Human Rights and the Rule of Law held in Lund, Sweden on 11-13 December 1997 encourages us to pursue this dialogue.

 Since the resumption of the EU/China human rights dialogue on 23 October 1997, China has taken a number of positive steps.

 Democratic principles are a central element in our political dialogue with the Government of Uganda. It is for the Ugandan people to decide what form democracy should take in their country. They will have an opportunity to do so in the referendum scheduled for 2000. We look to President Museveni to ensure that constitutional provisions relating to the referendum are fully implemented, including those that will enable advocates of a multi-party system to put their case to the electorate without restrictions. Legislation on political parties is scheduled for debate during the current session of the Ugandan Parliament.

 We remain committed to the OSCE embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology controlled under entries in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the Military List).
<P>

<a name="80313w12.html_para0">Following consultation with this Department and the Ministry of Defence, and in line with the defence export criteria of July 1997, the Department for Trade and Industry recently issued a licence for the export of equipment containing military explosives, for use in the oil industry in Azerbaijan. While the grant of this licence constitutes an exception to the UK's interpretation of the scope of the embargo, it is in no way inconsistent with the purpose of the embargo and our continuing commitment to uphold it.

 My right hon Friend the Secretary of State set out his proposals for adult education in England in his Green paper, <i>The Learning Age,</i> published on 25 February. My right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, who are responsible for education and training policy in these parts of the United Kingdom, are taking forward the Government's adult learning agenda in their countries.
<P>

<a name="80313w13.html_para2">At the local level in England, the responsibility for securing adequate further education was divided between the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) and local education authorities (LEAs) under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.

 It is, of course, early days, but I am encouraged by the progress made in the New Deal Pathfinder areas, including Eastbourne.

 Where education and training providers do not already have the necessary equipment available, applications can be made to a Discretionary Fund to cover exceptional costs of training within the Full-Time Education and Training (FTET) option. The Fund is designed to ensure that education and training can be accessed where additional barriers to participation exist. Applications to the Fund can be made for special equipment or other assistance needed by young people with disabilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Pathfinder areas were selected to provide a cross section of delivery areas in Great Britain. They comprise a sample of travel to work areas covering a variety of urban and rural locations of different sizes. The process is overseen by local partnerships and delivery of New Deal in the Pathfinder areas is monitored nationally and regionally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 New Deal has been operating in twelve Pathfinder areas since 5 January 1998. In the nine weeks of delivery up to 6 March 1998, no New Deal sanctions have been applied. Young people have warmly welcomed the New Deal and many have sought early entry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The great majority of young people who have entered the New Deal are currently participating in the Gateway, a period of up to four months preparation for work and entry to the options. The number of young people gaining unsubsidised employment in the period 5 January to 6 March in the New Deal Pathfinder areas was 289. The number of young people entering a New Deal option in the same period was 574.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We have very early evidence from the pathfinders about the operation of the New Deal processes which will be taken into account in the national roll-out. In the longer term, monitoring and evaluation of the New Deal will produce evidence on the basis of which possible amendments to its design will be considered. It is presently premature to draw conclusions other than that the initial Gateway interviews have been well received by

 Through our contract we expect Training and Enterprise Councils to review regularly their performance and capability against agreed standards to retain their Licences. These standards include arrangements for quality assurance of their training suppliers, a commitment to continuous improvement and compliance with the TEC National Council's Framework for Local Accountability.
<P>

<a name="80313w14.html_para0">TECs are also required under the terms of their Licence to permit the National Audit Office, the European Commission or the European Court of Auditors access to their own records and those of any of their subsidiaries and/or their providers. However as private companies they are obliged to have their accounts audited by a qualified auditor.
<P>

<a name="80313w14.html_para1">TECs are not required to allow public access to Board meetings but the Framework for Local Accountability expects TECs to open as many Board papers as reasonable to public scrutiny and brief interested parties on the outcomes of Board discussions in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.

 New Deal provision for people of 25 and over who have been unemployed for two years or more will be available from June 1998. I announced on 5 January that we would consider development of the pilots to extend New Deal to people over 25 who have been unemployed for a year or 18 months. These would need to be thoroughly evaluated before decisions could be taken on further extension.

<P>
<a name="80313w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Full-Time Education and Training option of the New Deal is primarily aimed at giving a second chance to gain qualifications for those young people who are not already qualified to NVQ Level 2 or equivalent. However, approval for an Access to Higher Education course can be given where it is clear that completion of the course is the best way to enhance a young person's employability. The course must form part of a realistic action plan leading to sustained employment, and must offer the opportunity for the young person to gain transferable skills such as Key Skills.

We will begin preliminary discussions later this month with strategic partners, both at national and local levels. We plan to issue a document describing the design of this programme in early May.

<a name="80313w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Employment Service has ensured that the Environment Task Force providers, the voluntary sector and ethnic minority organisations have been fully involved in the development and delivery of New Deal. We have taken particular care to ensure that these groups have been fully represented both in national consultations on the design of New Deal and in local partnerships, which have planned and are now setting in place delivery arrangements.

<P>
<a name="80313w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 In planning the delivery of New Deal all local partnerships have fully taken into account a wide range of local factors, including the availability of transport. Innovative local solutions are being developed by partnerships, including a number which have secured concessionary fares for New Deal participants. In addition, the Rural Development Commission (the Government's agency for economic and social development in rural England) has allocated &#163;200k of its funds, to support projects that will test solutions to the problems of delivering New Deal to remote rural communities where public transport is scarce.

<P>
<a name="80313w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Our overriding aim in the New Deal for 18-24 year olds is to offer high quality help through the Gateway and opportunities for work, education and training which will encourage young people to participate. The early evidence from the Pathfinders is that this approach is succeeding; indeed, since 16 February when we started collecting this information, over 350 entered the programme early--about 10 per cent. of all those who started. We recognise of course that a small minority might not wish to take part. If they refuse offers of options without good cause, they will be referred to independent Adjudication Officers who may impose sanctions. As each case will depend on the circumstances and be treated on its merits, it is not possible to forecast the numbers affected.

 The following table shows the estimated savings from the Government's new funding policy for higher education in each year from 1998-99 to 2000-01 on the present cash accounting basis and on a resource accounting basis. Figures are for the United Kingdom and at 1995-96 prices. They do not reflect our decision to pay out loans on a termly basis, which released money in 1998-99.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the question of testing for millennium compliance, the ATRA is in the process of introducing a major new computer service throughout the organisation which is known as TAFMIS (the Training and Financial Management Information System). It is due for completion in 1999 and has been purchased as a PFI project and has, as part of the contract, been subjected to Year 2000 testing throughout its development, testing and introduction. In addition, by taking this approach, the ATRA have transferred the risk and responsibility for Year 2000 compliance to the service provider, EDS Defence Ltd.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about millennium compliancy as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre Defence Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to respond to all three of your questions, and to do so, I would like first to clarify some of the terms I have used. Our programme of <i>testing</i> for millennium compliancy has been followed by <i>rectification</i>, which has in turn been followed by <i>validation</i> of the systems. In some cases this validation has resulted in the need for further testing. While we anticipate that all rectification work should be complete by 31 Dec 98, there will be a need for continued validation work, possibly until the end of 1999. However, our mission-critical IT systems will have been rectified well before 31 December 98.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Testing for Millennium Compliancy.</i> Testing for millennium compliancy has been undertaken in three phases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. <i>Large IT Systems.</i> All work on the mainframe systems should be complete by 31 Dec 98. However a major new system is due in service in Summer 1998 and there is some question about the compliancy of one of its software programmes. For this reason the manufacturer has undertaken to provide a software upgrade, by Sep 98, which will be compliant.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. <i>Personal Computers.</i> All existing PCs will have been tested by 31 Dec 98. However, since there is a continuous flow of replacement PCs coming into the Agency, it is expected that testing will be continued right up to 31 Dec 99 and possibly beyond.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. <i>Embedded Systems and Utilities</i>. JARIC Defence Agency occupies a building belonging to Royal Air Force Brampton. The Agency is therefore dependent on its landlord to work with the providers of public utilities and services such as air conditioning. The landlord has informed us that he anticipates meeting his obligations of ensuring that testing, rectification and validation will have been completed by 31 Dec 99.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Consultants and Contractors</i> ICL (formerly DESC) are the only contractor employed by the Agency on millennium compliancy tasks.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The costs of millennium computer compliance</i> The cost of millennium compliancy work at JARIC was originally estimated at &#163;60,000. To date we have needed to spend &#163;15,000, in order to provide software corrections to the mainframe systems.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the Met. Office, it is our aim to ensure that all individual or stand-alone business critical systems, with the exception of those due to be replaced in early 1999, are millennium compliant by December 1998. For those systems which are due to be replaced, tests to minimise the risks from date problems will also be completed by the end of this year. As far as integrated business critical systems are concerned, these will be Year 2000 compliant by September 1999 which means that the end-to-end testing will be complete by that date. A list of the consultants and contractors who have either worked or are working with us on Year 2000 computer problems is attached.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The estimated full cost of millennium compliance for the many business critical systems in the Met. Office is &#163;8M. Much of this expenditure will be related to in-house staff effort which is assessed as 120-man years, at a cost of approximately &#163;5M. The balance will primarily be spent on external consultants and contractors and the procurement of specific tools.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You may also like to know that, as a trading agency, the Met.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You recently asked the Secretary of State for Defence three Parliamentary Questions relating to specific aspects of millennium compliance at the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO). As these matters fall within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the UKHO I have been asked to reply to you direct. I hope you will accept this reply as a response to all three Parliamentary Questions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Turning first to your question about the completion of millennium compliance, there is undoubtedly a considerable amount of work to be completed and it is anticipated that testing will have to continue right up to the end of 1999. That said the later testing will be in relation to systems of low criticality; it is planned that rectification and testing of our critical systems will be completed by the end of March 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The UKHO has entered into a contract with AMTEC Consulting Limited to carry out most of the work on this project. In addition to this a Project Manager with some key staff from existing resources have been allocated to support the AMTEC team. It is envisaged that a further contract will be negotiated with AMTEC to take through to full assessment, rectification and testing. As a consequence it is inevitable that some staff enhancement will be needed.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, as regards your question about a cost breakdown for the millennium programme, I should explain that the programme is broken down into two distinct projects. The first project is the pre-assessment and scoping project, whilst the second project--that relating to full assessment, rectification and testing--is still in the process of being negotiated. As such, it is not yet possible to provide you with a detailed breakdown of the costs likely to be incurred. Apart from the work let to AMTEC it is also relevant that certain internal staff costs will be incurred as some of the work being conducted for millennium compliance would have been undertaken anyway for internal UKHO business reasons.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am sorry that I cannot be more specific about the costs involved, but it is my judgement, and the one upon which planning assumptions are being made, that the total costs likely to be incurred, covering internal and external services, will be in the region of &#163;2.25M.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason the Government have refused to allow ex-service men to have access to an independent assessor for their complaints.  [32269]<P>

<a name="80313w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1998]:</i> Service personnel, both serving and ex-serving, have the statutory right, under the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 and Queen's Regulations, to submit a complaint to the Defence Council about any matter relating to their service. The current provisions stipulate that complaints must be submitted within three months of the date of the action complained of, although there is provision for the discretionary acceptance of late complaints where it is accepted that earlier submission had not been reasonably practical. 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 1998 : Column: 428</I><P>
The time limit for the submission of complaints, and the application of the provisions to ex-Service personnel, were introduced in October 1997. Prior to that, there was no time limit and complaints from ex-Service personnel were accepted for investigation on a discretionary basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the conclusions were of the survey carried out in 1986-87 into the extent of contamination and the cost and feasibility of decontamination of six former chemical warfare storage sites in the United Kingdom; for what reason this survey was carried out; who carried out this survey; and if he will place in the Library a copy of the report of this survey.  [33795]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many surveys have been conducted into the contamination of and pollution from the former chemical warfare filling and storage sites at <i>(a)</i> Norton Disney/Swinderby in Lincolnshire and <i>(b)</i> RAF Risley in Bedfordshire since 1980.  [33796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 According to available records, since 1980, five surveys have been carried out at the former Forward Filling Depot at RAF Norton Disney and this site was sold in 1997. There have been six surveys of Risley. The surveys include revalidation of earlier studies, radiological and chemical surveys, and Land Quality Assessments.

[33798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80313w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The major work to remove mustard gas contamination from the MOD-owned Risley site in Bedfordshire was carried out in 1988 under Operation Coleman Keg. I am arranging for a copy of the report to be placed in the Library of the House.
