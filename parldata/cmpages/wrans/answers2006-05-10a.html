 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment she has made of the impact of the security situation in Afghanistan on the alternative livelihoods programme. [69481]</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60510w02.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The successful delivery of alternative livelihood programmes is highly dependent on the ability of organisations doing the delivery on the ground, being able to operate safely. Security in many parts of Afghanistan is improving, particularly in central, northern and western areas and further progress can be made by strengthening the effectiveness of the Afghan police and criminal justice system. However security remains a particular challenge in the south and east of the country, where the insurgency is most active.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_6">Continuing threats to the safety of Afghan and international staff have meant that some non-governmental organisations and international contractors are finding it increasingly difficult to operate in some parts of the country. The majority of DFID&#039;s livelihoods programme is channelled through the National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This helps to reduce some of the security risks by using local contractors, but there have been a number of attacks on implementing partners of these national programmes. Although attacks have increased, so far they have not caused widespread suspension of alternative livelihoods programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_7">Helmand province will be a particularly challenging place in which to deliver programmes that will support the development of alternative livelihoods. DFID is currently designing a large multi-year programme to support rural development in Helmand through the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2006 : Column 235W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
National Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This support will only be successful if implementing partners are willing to work in the province. The UK military deployment to Helmand should help to facilitate a greater Afghan Government presence in the province, and improve the capacity of the police and the Afghan National Army to provide the necessary security for development partners to operate effectively.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60510w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Within DFID&#039;s programme in Burma, &#163;500,000 has provisionally been allocated in this financial year to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), of which approximately 80 per cent. is attributable to work with conflict-affected populations. In addition, several other projects funded by DFID which provide assistance through local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (for example, to reduce the incidence of communicable diseases, or to enhance food security) include internally displaced people among their recipients.

 The key recommendations in the social exclusion unit&#039;s (SEU) report on &#039;Young Runaways&#039; were that young people at risk of running away should know who they could talk to about their problems, that local services needed to work closer together to make sure young people got help, and that a safety net of community-based emergency accommodation was needed for those who did run away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60510w04.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_29">The findings of the SEU report, which was published in 2002, influenced the wider Government strategy on children&#039;s services, which was set out in the Green Paper &#039;Every Child Matters&#039; (2003). It is through the &#039;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&#039; programme currently being taken forward by local authorities, and including the reforms set out in the Green Paper &#039;Youth Matters&#039;, that the Government are promoting measures that respond to the SEU report.

<p>
<a name="60510w04.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_30">&#039;Change for Children&#039; aims to help local services respond to the full range of children&#039;s needs&#151;including their health, their safety and their economic well-being. It is particularly concerned with improving targeted support for those children most at risk of negative outcomes, such as those associated with running away or going missing from home. The programme, drawing on the Children Act 2004 reforms, is enabling local areas to improve integrated working arrangements by establishing multi-disciplinary teams, while adopting a lead professional model&#151;someone who is a single point of contact for a young person who can co-ordinate a package of support when multiple needs are present requiring help from various sources. Improved integrated working at a local level is being accompanied by enhanced information sharing between services, leading to earlier identification of children&#039;s needs. This in turn allows young people to be referred to the right source of support, at the right time. New Joint Inspection Arrangements will judge the effectiveness and co-ordination of such local provision.

 Royal Mail offer a range of products that provide bulk purchase and business mail discounts, but these apply only where there is a central point of posting and administration which enables Royal Mail to use their automation of bulk postings to reduce operational costs. As Parliament&#039;s pre-paid envelope service provides the ability to post in constituencies anywhere in the UK, often in small volumes, these services are not applicable.

 The House Authorities regularly re-tender the contract for the supply of stationery. During the contract term they have regular meetings with the contractor in order to monitor the service and costs, most recently in April 2006. Costs are presently lower than they were in 2002 and the contract is due to be re-let in competition in 2007. Members&#039; bespoke stationery is high quality comprising specially designed and milled environmentally friendly paper and envelopes. The stationery contract includes the provision of a next day delivery anywhere in the UK and a unique management system which allows two accounts to be held for each Member&#151;one for their own stationery and one for the bespoke stationery provided separately by the House.
