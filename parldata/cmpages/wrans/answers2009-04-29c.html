 The MOD has chosen not to adopt the specific Cycle-To-Work (C2W) scheme for Service Personnel (SP); instead it encourages greater cycle use under an equivalent scheme. Under the current arrangements eligible SP can claim a non-taxable benefit in the form of Home to Duty Travel allowance (Pedal Cycle) which reimburses them for commuting to work on bicycles. This is paid at a daily rate based upon the distance cycled. An internal review in June last year showed that this allowance is more advantageous than the likely benefits available under the C2W scheme.</p>

As you will be aware, the problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old scheme to the current child support scheme. This decision was kept under review until February 2006 when the Government asked Sir David Henshaw to review the entire system of child maintenance. His subsequent report led to the Government&#146;s White paper and to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which makes provision for a new system of child maintenance intended to be in place from 2011.</p>

It is currently planned that this process will take around three years, after which both of the existing schemes will close.</p>

This should be done within 28 days of notification of the listing decision. An example of a wrongly made decision would be where there has been a factual error or some irregularity in the process, which has affected the outcome.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol.<br>
Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>
Alcoholic gastritis<br>
Alcoholic liver disease<br>
Alcoholic myopathy<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>
Ethanol poisoning<br>
Methanol poisoning<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified<br>
Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. However, admissions do not represent the number of in-patients as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay<br>

 The Emergency Human Resource Programme (EHRP) provides for salary top ups of 52 per cent. for 11 cadres of health workers including nurses and doctors. This top up has been maintained since 2004 with nurses and doctors also benefiting from a separate 20 per cent. civil service-wide pay increase, as well as modest yearly increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="90429w0010.htm_para2"><a name="09042964000076">According to data from the current financial year our assessment is that the gross pay of nurses now ranges from approximately &#163;63 a month for newly recruited nurse technicians to &#163;262 a month for Senior Nursing Officers. This compares favourably with, for example, teachers, who receive between &#163;50 and &#163;142 per month. Doctors salaries range from approximately &#163;260 to &#163;365 per month. Our assessment shows that there has been an increase of between 50 and 100 per cent. in the take home pay for doctors and nurses between 2004 and 2009. We believe that this has been a very important incentive for improved retention and morale, and has helped to reduce outward migration.</p>

It restricts all enforcement, including the commencement of claims without leave of the court for up to 12 months where there has been a temporary, sudden and unforeseeable change in an individual's financial circumstances that leaves them unable to meet their commitments. However, as it is intended only for those with short-term problems, the court must be satisfied that there are realistic prospects of recovery, which will allow normal commitments to be met within six months, before an order can be made.</p>

The ERO was developed as one element of a package of targeted and complementary measures contained in Part 5 of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which are designed to assist the over-indebted. These are intended to provide alternatives for those for whom the current statutory schemes, such as bankruptcy and Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), may not be the best option.</p>

 All consular staff are specifically trained on what action to take in response to any allegation of mistreatment.

They are required to follow up all reports of mistreatment whether they come from the individual themselves, from their friends, family or representatives, or from other sources. What form this follow up action will take will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Most obviously, we can raise our concerns with the relevant authorities. Whatever action we take however, the objective remains the same: to end the mistreatment, and have the incident investigated and the perpetrators of any abuse brought to justice.</p>

 The tax credit system is specifically designed to provide additional support when people need it most, such as when income falls because of a move to working shorter hours. In March, 355,000 households living on a lower income were receiving on average &#163;35 per week more in tax credits.</p>

In the coming year, HMRC will begin new research-driven marketing aimed at those people who stand to gain the most from taking up WTC, and will launch a pilot using data from pay-as-you-earn records to identify and contact potentially eligible people.</p>

 It is not our policy to allow asylum seekers to work. The Government believe that managed migration is a valuable source of skills and labour to the British economy and there are recognised routes into the UK for those seeking to work.

<p><a name="stpa_623"><a name="90429w0021.htm_para5"><a name="09042971000636">An amendment to the General Permitted Development Order in October 2008 conferred special protection on World Heritage Sites by removing permitted development rights for certain types of minor development which could, on a cumulative basis, have an adverse effect on the outstanding universal value of a World Heritage Site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="90429w0021.htm_para6"><a name="09042971000637">Under the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Consultation) (England) Direction 2009, planning authorities are required to consult the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government before approving any planning application made on or after 20 April 2009 to which English Heritage maintains an objection and which would have an adverse impact on the outstanding universal value, integrity, authenticity and significance of a World Heritage Site or its setting. The Secretary of State then has the discretion to call-in the application for her own determination if she considers it appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="90429w0021.htm_para7"><a name="09042971000638">World Heritage Sites are &#145;sensitive areas&#146; for the purposes of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations. Local planning authorities must therefore require EIA to be carried out for any development proposal in or partly in a World Heritage Site if they think it is likely to have significant environmental effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="90429w0021.htm_para8"><a name="09042971000639">The Government consulted last year on a draft planning circular, and accompanying guidance prepared by English Heritage, which will further recognise in national policy the need to protect World Heritage Sites as sites of Outstanding Universal Value. These are being revised in the light of consultation responses and final versions should be published by the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_627"><a name="90429w0021.htm_para9"><a name="09042971000640">In addition, the Government have announced their intention to consult on a revision to planning policy on heritage protection (PPGs 15 and 16) soon. This will provide a further opportunity to comment on this issue.</p>

 In 1995 English Heritage established a Register of Historic Battlefields, which contains 43 important sites. Of these, eight were identified as being at high risk in the 2008 Heritage at Risk Register, with pressure from development being the most common risk. The Government do not maintain detailed information about developments on individual battlefields, though we are aware that certain sites (such as Worcester and Stamford Bridge) have had substantial development. The effect of proposed development on a registered site is a material consideration to be taken into account in determining planning applications. It is also open to local planning authorities to designate as a conservation area any part of their area which has special historic interest and whose character or appearance it is desirable to preserve or enhance.</p>

 Information on the examination results of all young people in custody is not collected centrally. However, since the roll-out of the Offender Learning and Skills Service, led by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), in Prison Service Young Offender Institutions (YOIs) in England in August 2006, some data is now collected nationally by the LSC.

 Since September 2007 the revised professional standards for teachers provide clear career pathways for teachers from Qualified Teacher Status to Advanced Skill Teachers. These clarify what is expected at each career stage, including expectations about teachers' ongoing engagement in their own continuing professional development (CPD) and make clear that teachers are expected to teach challenging, well organised lessons and sequences of lessons across the age range they teach in which they, for example, use an appropriate range of teaching strategies and resources, including e-learning, which meet learners' needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_647"><a name="90429w0024.htm_para0"><a name="09042971000980">To support the professional standards we introduced revised and robust performance management arrangements in September 2007 which ensure that teachers' performance is regularly reviewed and that all teachers have clear and robust development plans which take account of their own individual needs and the school's improvement priorities. Teachers play a key role in this process through engaging with their line mangers to agree their professional development plans.</p>
