 The legislation is intended to aid the regeneration of sites that are contaminated by harmful substances, not just asbestos. Estimates of the cost for cleaning sites contaminated with asbestos are therefore not available. However, the full cost of the Finance Act 2001 relief for regeneration of sites contaminated by harmful substances was estimated at &#163;50 million in 2001&#150;02, &#163;85 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;75 million in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimates his Department has made of the annual cost to British industry of the climate change levy <i>(a)</i> overall and <i>(b)</i> per sector.  [98712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w01.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The climate change levy is expected to raise about &#163;0.9 billion from business and the public sector in 2002&#150;03. This has been recycled back to these sectors through a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' national insurance contributions, support for enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy efficiency measures, and spending on renewable energy and energy efficiency, principally through the Carbon Trust.
<P>

<a name="30225w01.html_para0">The levy package is expected to be broadly revenue neutral between industry and the service sector. It is not possible to determine the impact on individual sectors as this depends on the extent to which they are eligible for discounts for energy-intensive users, their use of levy-exempt renewable energy and combined heat and power, and their take-up of the enhanced capital allowances and support from the Carbon Trust.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what measures have been taken to assist sectors that are unable to comply with the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, and are ineligible for a rebate on the climate change levy, with the cost of the climate change levy;  [98714]
<P>
<UL>(2) what measures his Department has taken to assist small businesses to meet the cost of the climate change levy.  [98713]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w01.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The climate change levy (CCL) was introduced in a package which involves reductions to employer national insurance contributions and support for energy efficiency, which is broadly revenue neutral to business as a whole. As part of the package, the Government supports businesses investing in approved energy-saving technologies through enhanced capital allowances. All businesses can take advantage of the help available from the CCL funded Carbon Trust which supports energy efficiency improvements by business and the development of low carbon technologies. Some of the Carbon Trust schemes, for example their small firms loan scheme, are intended specifically to benefit small firms. In addition, many of the smallest businesses' energy use will be below that at which levy becomes payable, so will not pay any levy at all.
<P>

<a name="30225w01.html_para1">In recognition of the need to protect the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries subject to international competition, the Government allows an 80 per cent. discount from the levy for businesses in energy-intensive sectors covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime, providing they have entered into climate change agreements with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 383W</I><P>
(DEFRA) to meet two-yearly energy efficiency targets. The Government targets relief from the levy on those sectors covered by the IPPC as it covers the main energy-intensive sectors subject to international competition.
<P>

<a name="30225w01.html_para2">Finally, in order to give all businesses an incentive to agree to emissions targets, the Government have also launched the UK emissions trading scheme, with an incentive worth &#163;150 million after tax over five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w01.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Government policy on encouraging the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has centred on encouraging the use of vehicles through lower rates of excise duty and grants to convert cars to LPG through the powershift programme. This policy has been very successful with over 1,100 stations now selling LPG across the country compared to 150 in 1998.

<P>
<a name="30225w02.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Budget 2002 changes to the North Sea taxation regime make new investment in the North Sea more economic for oil and gas companies while extracting a fairer share of revenue for the taxpayer.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what performance targets have been set for the tax credit helpline; and what have been the monthly performance levels against those targets since the helpline was established.  [94237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
: A helpline was set up in August 2002 to handle detailed inquiries about the two new tax credits&#151;Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. The introduction of these two new tax credits in April 2003 represents a large one-off piece of work for the Inland Revenue. That work includes handling telephone enquiries and processing claims. The helpline has not been set stand-alone performance targets because, as a one-off exercise, call handling and claims processing are effectively being managed as a single stream of work&#151;allowing resources to be allocated across the two in the light of changing workload priorities.
<P>

<a name="30225w02.html_para1">The underlying aim at the helpline is to ensure that people can get through when they need to. That is monitored in a number of ways, including looking at the volume of calls received and handled. The best available evidence on calls made and calls received indicates that, in each month since August 2002, a high proportion&#151;certainly more than 90 per cent.&#151;of callers have got through on the same day.

<a name="30225w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer further to his answer of 22 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 42W, on thermal insulation, what the implications are of the European Union Court Case 416/85, EC Commission <i>v</i>. United Kingdom for the possibilities of VAT reduction on the sales and installation of energy saving materials; and if he will make a statement.  [98563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w02.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 European Court of Justice case 416/85 concerned the scope of the UK's zero rates. The Court held that zero-rating could only be justified for clearly defined social reasons and for the benefit of the final consumer.
<P>

<a name="30225w02.html_para2">The long-standing formal agreements with our European partners make entirely separate provision for reduced rates (of no lower than 5 per cent.) and allow relief for the 'supply, construction, renovation and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy'. Under this provision, the UK has been able to introduce a reduced rate for installations of certain energy-saving materials in homes. Our current policy is to restrict the relief to the installation of materials whose primary purpose is to save energy, and the European Court case has no bearing on this limitation.
<P>

<a name="30225w02.html_para3">As I explained in my answer of 22 January, we are not able to introduce a reduced rate of VAT for energy-efficient or energy-saving materials sold direct to the public. This is not because of the European Court case, but rather that the reduced rate provision makes clear that goods and materials can only have a reduced rate when they are supplied as part of an overall service.

In appropriate cases, the CRB searches a list kept by the Department for Education and Skills of people who are considered unsuitable to work with children. An Enhanced Disclosure would also include other information held in local police records which, in the chief officer's opinion, is relevant to the matter in hand and ought to be included in the Disclosure. It is possible that a Disclosure might include information about a civil offence as a result of such other enquiries.

 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) launched an overseas information service on 4 December 2002. This provides information, via a fax-back service, on the criminal record checking regimes available in 15 countries. It is expected that the number of countries included in this service will rise during the course of 2003.
<P>

<a name="30225w04.html_para0">The aim of the service is to provide employers with information that will lead them to sources of information overseas, beyond those capable of being offered by the CRB, to help them make safer recruitment decisions. The only contracted-out element is the fax-back service operated by iTouch (UK) Limited. The amount received by iTouch (UK) Limited over the period of the contract will depend upon the number of inquiries made to the faxback service. The contract is scheduled to run until December 2005, at which time it will be reviewed. All other aspects of the scheme are administered by civil servants employed by the CRB. Two members of staff undertake this work as part of their other duties. The total measurable cost of providing the service during the current financial year has so far been &#163;3,650.00.
<P>

<a name="30225w04.html_para1">The overseas information service is a non-statutory service provided by the CRB. Part V of the Police Act 1997 under which the CRB was created did not envisage the CRB obtaining overseas criminal records as part of the Disclosure service. Nevertheless, it was recognised that foreign nationals (and UK nationals returning from a period of residence overseas) make up a significant portion of the UK workforce. These individuals often occupy positions of trust, which would normally attract a CRB Standard or Enhanced

 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> Basic disclosures are not yet available from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). In light of the operational difficulties that the CRB experienced in the summer of 2002, following the launch of the Enhanced and Standard Disclosure Services, the CRB decided to postpone the implementation of the Basic Disclosure Service, planned to start one year after the Enhanced/Standard Disclosure service. A revised implementation date has not yet been agreed and this is conditional upon the recommendations made to Ministers by the Independent Review Team.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what studies his Department has undertaken in relation to drink-driving offences from the sale of alcohol from <i>(a)</i> supermarkets, <i>(b)</i> off-licences and <i>(c)</i> petrol filling station forecourts; and if he will make a statement.  [98489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 No studies have been undertaken on the commission of drink-driving offences relating to alcohol purchased from different retail categories. However, the Home Office has commissioned research that determines where people had been drinking on the most recent occasion they had driven after drinking alcohol: at home; at someone else's home; in a pub/pubs; in a restaurant; in a nightclub/club; outside in a public place (e.g. park, street); or a specified other. The results are currently undergoing analysis.
<P>

<a name="30225w05.html_para1">The Home Office remains committed to combating drink-driving and shall maintain an emphasis on effective enforcement and publicity. The UK has shown that a combination of rigid enforcement and advertising campaigns has a dramatic effect on reducing the numbers of killed and seriously injured in crashes involving illegal levels of alcohol, although we acknowledge there is still much to do. We are currently looking at the possibilities for helping effective enforcement of drink drive legislation, for example, by introducing roadside evidential testing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Information is not available in the form requested. A range of interventions has been developed at key stages in the criminal justice system which seek to identify and engage drug misusers, particularly those using Class A drugs, in order to access them into drug treatment delivered within a community or custodial setting. Pro-active arrest referral schemes, drug treatment and testing orders, and prison treatment services are available throughout England and Wales. Drug testing under the provisions introduced by the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 402W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30225w05.html_para2">In the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 the Government set out a comprehensive new programme of criminal justice interventions with a view to delivering an integrated "end to end system" aimed at getting drug misusers out of crime into effective treatment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has for merging drug action teams and crime reduction partnerships; and if he will make a statement.  [98083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Police Reform Act, from 1 April 2003, places a statutory responsibility on local authorities, police and others to formulate and implement a drugs strategy mirroring their responsibility for crime and disorder strategies. Multi-agency partnerships are the most effective way of delivering these strategies, but we currently support separate ones for drugs (149 Drug Action Teams in England) and (376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales). To reduce burdens on partnerships, ensure they are properly resourced and reduce overlaps in the delivery of community safety, this Government believe that partnerships should be brought together, through merger or, where that is truly not feasible, by developing closer working arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30225w05.html_para3">Many partnerships have merged or will have merged by 1 April 2003. Others, particularly in two tier authorities, are building on already close working relationships, in discussion with Local Strategic Partnerships, where they exist. We expect that, by April 2003, there will have been a complete overhaul in the way partnerships function, and to see improvements in delivery of the National Drug Strategy and local crime and disorder strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his estimate is of the proportion of property crime related to the need of the perpetrator to support illegal drug use in each of the last five years.  [98174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="30225w07.html_para0">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and acquisitive crime, including property crimes. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 408W</I><P>
analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="30225w07.html_para1">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one-quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.
<P>

<a name="30225w07.html_para2">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Information is not available in the form requested. However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police at 16 sites throughout England and Wales, currently provides estimates of repeat offending by drug misusing offenders. Repeat offending drug misusing offenders are defined as the proportion of arrestees who are using heroin and/or cocaine and/or crack at least once a week and who have offended at least twice a month in the last 12 months. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows the proportion of arrestees falling within the definition of repeat offending drug misusing offenders category was 15 per cent.

The Supporting People programme, which will go live on 1 April 2003, will provide revenue funding for housing related support services for vulnerable people, which may include support for victims of domestic violence.

 The pay gap between women and men currently stands at 19 per cent., down from 30 per cent. in 1975 when the Equal Pay Act came into force. The Government are taking action to tackle the complex underlying factors behind the pay gap, including promoting voluntary pay reviews and good practice on equal pay through the Fair Pay Champions and Castle Awards. Denise Kingsmill is chairing a task force "Accounting for People" which is considering human capital reporting by companies and is likely to have significant implications for women in the workplace. The Employment Act 2002 introduces measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives. These will help women return to the labour market and have a positive impact on the pay gap. The Act also introduces an equal pay questionnaire that will make it easier to tackle pay

 HMG has no reliable annual figures on the level of investment from the UK and the dependent territories to Burma. Burmese statistics, which are often inaccurate, suggest total accumulated British investment of about US$1440 million. The most significant British investments are believed to be Premier Oil's, which are currently in the process of being sold, and those of British American Tobacco. We believe that some of the investment identified as being British is actually foreign investment that has been channelled through dependent territories.

<P>
<a name="30225w08.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent research her Department has <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> begun to undertake to assess the amount of fur derived from domestic animals labelled in a misleading manner for sale to the public; and if she will make a statement.  [98183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w08.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The DTI has received professional advice from LGC Ltd. on the possibilities for undertaking DNA testing of products on sale in the UK that are alleged to contain fur of domestic animals. The advice stated that it had not yet been possible to identify a testing method that could reliably determine the specific type of fur that a product contains&#151;i.e. whether such fur has come from a domestic animal or otherwise. I am placing copies of this advice in the Library of the House. We have asked LGC Ltd. to advise us further on the viability and costs of developing such a testing method.
<P>

<a name="30225w08.html_para7">We are also in discussions with other Governments who are seeking to undertake the same type of testing, to understand the approach they have taken to this problem.
<P>

<a name="30225w08.html_para8">There are no regulations in place requiring fur from domestic animals to be labelled as such. Where manufacturers choose to label their products, they must provide accurate information and action can be taken to prevent misleading labelling under the Trade Descriptions Act.

<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 415W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30225w08.html_para9">However, since it is not currently possible to identify products containing specifically domestic animal furs (as explained above), it is also not possible to determine when products have been mislabelled. The Government are working hard to overcome these problems to be able to determine levels of imports of these products, and to identify any labelling problems that may exist.

 By grants for solar installations we assume it is meant the &#163;20 million First Phase of the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme, which was launched by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 26 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30225w09.html_para0">Under Stream 1 of the programme (small individual systems up to 5kWp), 171 applications had been received by the middle of February 2003, of which 45 had been completed. The average cost of these installations to both Government and the recipient is &#163;7,241, as the grants cover 50 per cent. of total costs. Most of the recipients are private homeowners, but there are also a few small businesses, schools and community groups. For the 45 completed installations (average 2kWp), total carbon dioxide savings are expected to be in the region of 29,000 kg a year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w09.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the remedies to UK employees of multinationals who have been made redundant without the required <i>(a)</i> process of consultation, <i>(b)</i> notice, <i>(c)</i> definition of the criteria for selection for redundancy and <i>(d)</i> evidence that the post has become surplus to requirements.  [98251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w09.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 February 2003]:</i> There is legislation in place to protect employees if they are affected by redundancy. Employees can seek redress through the employment tribunals or, in some cases, the civil courts.
<P>

<a name="30225w09.html_para4"><i>(a)</i> Consultation&#151;Employers in the UK are under a statutory obligation to inform and consult employee representatives about proposed collective redundancies&#151;that is, where they propose to make 20 or more redundancies at one establishment within a 90 day period. The consultation must be conducted in good faith, and must cover ways of avoiding the redundancies, or of reducing their numbers or mitigating their effects. Employee representatives may complain to an employment tribunal where they consider these obligations have not been fulfilled. The tribunal can make a protective award of up to 90 days' pay to each affected employee.
<P>

<a name="30225w09.html_para5"><i>(b)</i> Notice&#151;depending on length of service both the employer and the employee are entitled to a minimum period of notice. Under the legislation this varies depending on how long the employee has been employed, from one week where he/she has been continuously employed for one month or more but less than two years, up to twelve weeks where continuously employed for 12 years or more. An individual employment contract may specify a longer period of notice. Employees who consider that they have incurred loss because they have not been given the minimum notice to which they are entitled under the legislation or under their contracts of employment, can bring actions for damages in the civil courts, or (if the employment has ended) in the employment tribunals.
<P>

<a name="30225w09.html_para6"><i>(c)</i> Criteria for selection&#151; In, a collective redundancy case, the employer must disclose to employee representatives certain information in writing including the proposed method of selecting the employees who may be dismissed. Failure to do so is again enforceable through an employment tribunal.
<P>

<a name="30225w09.html_para7"><i>(d)</i> Redundancy is in principle, a fair reason for dismissal. However, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions, employees can complain of unfair dismissal through an employment tribunal if they believe that they have been unfairly selected for redundancy, that the employer otherwise acted unreasonably in dismissing them or that redundancy was not in fact the genuine reason for dismissal. The remedies available in a case where a tribunal finds in the employee's favour are reinstatement or re-engagement or a monetary award of compensation.

redundant of employees of multinationals operating within the EU of <i>(a)</i> British, <i>(b)</i> Dutch, <i>(c)</i> French and <i>(d)</i> other EU companies.  [98252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w09.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 February 2003]:</i> Job losses due to restructuring or plant closure are reported all over Europe and recent examples of this include Dresdner Bank, Siemens and Mobilcom in Germany, HP-Compaq and Bull in France, Lucent Technologies in the Netherlands, Fiat in Italy, Alcatel in Belgium, and Santander in Spain. In some cases these job losses are part of European or global restructuring programmes, for example, Alcatel, Ericsson and Nokia. UK firms, like those on the Continent, are subject to legislation implementing the EC Directive on Collective Redundancies designed to protect employees affected by redundancies. This requires consultation of employee representatives before collective redundancies can be made. Consultation must be undertaken in good faith with a view to reaching agreement, and must include ways of avoiding the dismissals, reducing the number of employees to be dismissed, and mitigating the consequences of the dismissals. The detailed rules vary from country to country, for example, some EU countries have more lengthy consultation periods than others. The law in the UK provides greater protection in certain respects than that in other Member States. For example, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden do not, unlike the UK, have a statutory requirement for severance pay. And UK law treats workers more equally in the event of redundancy than workers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy and Luxembourg where blue-collar workers receive lower levels of protection than white-collar workers. The system in the UK is relatively transparent and the costs involved for employers and the length of the process are predictable, unlike in many other EU countries. The Government believes that firms should not face excessive barriers to making redundancies that add to the uncertainty and time involved in what is a painful process. To do so could deter investment, and result in fewer jobs overall, not more.

 A settlement of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians would, we believe, enhance global security, including the security of both the immediate region and the United Kingdom.

 We have made no specific representations to the Government of India over the case of Professor Davinderpal Singh Bhullar. In conjunction with the EU, we have demarched India about their use of the death penalty most recently in June 2001. We continue to follow Professor Bhullar's case closely, and are in discussions with EU partners over possible courses of action to take. Foreign Office officials met Professor Bhullar's wife on 12 February to discuss the case.

 There has been no change to the Government's policy for considering arms export licence applications for India in light of any defence cooperation between India and Iran. We continue to consider all applications on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria and the prevailing situation. All export licences will continue to be issued subject to the condition that the stated end-user will not re-export the equipment to a third country or end-user outside the terms of the licence.

<P>
<a name="30225w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 If accommodation is required in a particular city or country, the value for money offered by freehold purchase as opposed to leasing is assessed by comparing the costs and benefits of the two options using the techniques prescribed by the Treasury's guidance on appraisal and evaluation in Central Government (the "Green Book"). A decision to purchase a property freehold or long leasehold will also depend on whether the requirement is permanent, whether foreign governments are permitted to acquire such interests and whether, in practice, they are available on the market, and whether a purchase can be funded from the FCO's budget for capital investment.
<P>

<a name="30225w11.html_para12">In addition to using Treasury Appraisal techniques when deciding whether or not to purchase property freehold, the FCO monitors the value for money provided by its existing freehold and long leasehold estate using similar criteria to check that the retention of an owned property remains a better option than leasing.

 Reducing vehicle emissions is a key transport issue, which has been agreed as a priority across Government.

The type of fuel used by the fleet of some 1400 vehicles is split between petrol (60 per cent. ) and diesel (40 per cent.). Around 35 cent. of the fleet is purchased in the UK and good environmental performance was one of the criteria used to decide the award of the relevant contracts. Consequently vehicles supplied under these arrangements meet current government targets on emission levels.

 So far as I am aware, no recommendations have been made to improve protection against bullying at Bovington Camp, Dorset since October 2002. It is standard practice for each new intake of recruits to be briefed personally by the Commanding Officer within 24 hours of arriving at Bovington on the Army's anti-bullying policy, outlining complaints procedures and welfare support. In addition, on arrival all military instructors must be fully conversant with the Army's zero tolerance stance on bullying and educated to spot the signs of any such behaviour. The Army's policy on harassment or bullying is clear: all incidents and allegations are taken extremely seriously and a thorough investigation is carried out in response to all formal complaints. Furthermore, appropriate action is taken against any individual(s) found guilty of practising or condoning such behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In common with all armed forces deployments, the provision of Military Aid to the Civil Power (MACP) is authorised by a Minister within the Ministry of Defence, following a request from the police. The legal basis for this is the common law duty of every citizen to provide reasonable support to the police should they request it. The primacy of the police is recognised at all times. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has, of course, overall responsibility for the police and for security in the United Kingdom. There is consequently close and continuous consultation between the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office concerning the provision of this support.
<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para1">Support is, for the most part, routine and is linked to active police investigations and operations. By far the largest single category concerns explosive devices. Excluding Northern Ireland, there were 957 occasions in 2001 when experts from the armed forces were asked by the police to provide support in the investigation of improvised explosive devices, and 431 occasions in 2002. The provision of other support, the nature of which varies considerably, is authorised on a case by case basis. On average between 30 and 40 of these requests are authorised each year, a small proportion of which are related to the terrorist threat.
<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para2">There is no specific requirement to inform Parliament on each occasion support is authorised, and in view of the sensitivity of many police operations, it would be wrong to make public all the details of the support being provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 23 January 2003 to the hon.

[98581]<P>

<P>
<a name="30225w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As my noble Friend Lord Bach announced in another place on 19 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column WA175&#150;77, the Government have reached agreement with BAE Systems on the way ahead for these two strategically important defence projects. We have agreed a new structure for the two contracts which reduces risk, while placing new incentives on the company to perform. This will, however, involve a rise in the overall expected cost to completion and further delays to the in-service dates of the two projects.




<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 438W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para3">For the Nimrod MRA4 project, which was originally won by British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) in open competition in 1996, the company has announced that it will be making a provision of &#163;500 million against the project this year in its preliminary results for 2002. This is in addition to a previous provision of &#163;300 million made in the company's 2000 results. For our part, the Government have agreed to delay the start of series production until we have seen demonstrated performance from the first three aircraft, and to increase our funding of the project by around &#163;270 million, subject to final negotiations. This covers our share of restructuring the programme and will result in the achievement of an in-service date by 2009, defined as delivery of the sixth series production aircraft. As a result of the delay to the start of production, we now have the option of considering an increase in the aircraft's capability to meet the defence requirements of the 21st century. We have already introduced improvements to existing Nimrod MR2 aircraft which use some of the technology planned for the new MRA4 aircraft, thereby both reducing risk in the new programme and increasing existing capability.
<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para4">The starting point for the Astute class attack submarine project was different. The original contract was based on a single source supplier, namely GEC-Marconi (which subsequently merged with British Aerospace to form BAE Systems) as the only United Kingdom provider of this unique defence capability. We sought to establish a fair price, given the economic conditions, and agreed joint assumptions on an open book basis at the time of contract signature in March 1997 on how the project would be delivered. These related, in part, to the benefits to be derived from the first comprehensive application of computer aided design (CAD) techniques to United Kingdom submarines. This will deliver significant advantages in the future, but its benefits have proved more difficult to realise on a programme of this complexity than either we, or the company, had assumed. We now know that the introduction of CAD requires more time and effort than either of us had originally anticipated. As a result, the Government have agreed to increase our funding by around &#163;430 million, subject to final negotiations, as against an increased contribution by the company of &#163;250 million which it has announced will be included as a provision in its preliminary results for 2002. These increases reflect the Government's acceptance of a share of the responsibility along with BAE Systems for the underestimate of the required effort and the consequent design delays. They also cover costs incurred through restructuring and other revisions to the project, and will result in the first of class coming into service by 2008. In the light of what we now know about the costs and benefits of CAD, we are confident that the new deal represents a good deal for the taxpayer and will provide outstanding new generation attack submarines for the Royal Navy.
<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para5">This agreement has been reached following intensive negotiations, carried out in a constructive and co-operative spirit since the autumn. Both the Government and BAE Systems agree that the priority now is to put these difficulties behind us. We have agreed with the company that we will introduce new methods of project control and reporting on these and other projects. The exact details of the agreement required to establish 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 439W</I><P>
formally the new financial structure and the revised in-service dates still need to be agreed. This should take several months and the Government will report further to the House when this has been achieved.
<P>

<a name="30225w15.html_para6">Overall, we expect the additional cost to the Government of these two contracts to be around &#163;700 million, although significant additional Ministry of Defence expenditure will not begin until 2008 and will be spread over the following years. The scale of the financial consequences now announced by the company demonstrates that it accepts responsibility for its share of the serious difficulties that have arisen on these two immensely complex and demanding programmes. It is, however, appropriate, for the reasons that I have set out , that the Government should make these additional contributions to the Nimrod and Astute contracts. The unique military capabilities represented by these two programmes are crucial to Britain's future defences, and there are no alternative systems capable of offering comparable levels of performance at economic costs in any existing projects anywhere in the world. The Government are satisfied that both the Nimrod and the Astute project represent value for money. We now look to the company to deliver.

 Lynx helicopters and close-range guns currently provide anti-ship and close in defence for Type 23 frigates. The project to provide surface vessels, including Type 23 frigates, with an improved capability to deal with the threat presented by small enemy craft is in its very early stages. The concepts currently being assessed include small and medium-calibre guns, rockets and non-lethal means. This assessment phase is expected to complete towards the end of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The remit of the Shareholder Executive will be to work with Government Departments to improve their performance as a shareholder in a range of Government shareholdings in public and private sector companies as well as Government's more commercial trading funds. The Shareholder Executive will meet this remit in a number of ways. It will: scrutinise departmental shareholder resource requirements and assist in improving department's capabilities; help departments define their relationship with each company; set best practice standards and procedures for departments in their role as shareholder; and help departments distinguish and articulate long-term commercial and policy objectives for each shareholding. The Shareholder Executive will also become Government's centre of corporate finance and governance expertise, advising departments on shareholder-related management, corporate governance and finance issues as well as wider corporate finance and other industrial issues that arise from time to time.
<P>

<a name="30225w16.html_para5">The Cabinet Office is putting in place arrangements to enable the Shareholder Executive to become operational as soon as possible. An open competition is under way for the recruitment of a Chief Executive, who will be accountable directly to Lord Macdonald and the Cabinet Secretary for the performance of the Shareholder Executive. In due course, between 10 and 15 people drawn from Government Departments and the private sector will be recruited to support the Chief Executive in delivering the Shareholder Executive's remit. The costs of running the Shareholder Executive are likely to be modest relative to the potential benefits arising from improved shareholder performance.

<P>
<a name="30225w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Reactors to the tuberculin test are slaughtered and examined post-mortem. Infection is confirmed by either the presence of typical, visible lesions of tuberculosis or by the laboratory culture of the causative agent (Mycobacterium bovis) in tissue samples. These post mortem examinations, carried out in abattoirs, are less than 100 per cent. sensitive. Failure to detect visible lesions or failure to culture the organism from a test reactor does not necessarily rule out infection with M. bovis. It would be misleading, therefore, to equate unconfirmed test reactors to "false positives" or "negative" reactors.
<P>

<a name="30225w17.html_para3">The latest available data for 2002 show there were 892 confirmed reactors in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. The information is not available separately for each of the counties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Land Drainage Act 1991 sets out the financial powers of internal drainage boards (IDBs). Section 36 provides for IDBs to meet their expenses (net of payments to, and receipts from, the Environment Agency (EA)) by drainage rates and special levies. Section 37 sets out how these payments will be apportioned. Sections 38&#150;39 deal with differential drainage charges which are set by sub-dividing the IDB area. Sections 40&#150;54 deal with levying of drainage rates and related provisions. Section 55 provides powers for IDBs to borrow in relation to their functions under the 1991 Act or to discharge other loans. Ministerial consent is required for new borrowing. Section 56 allows IDBs to set navigation tolls. Section 57 allows IDBs to seek contributions from the EA in relation to water from higher land or dealing with water before it reaches a main river.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> In 2001 the EU agreed new rules requiring the compulsory marking of hen eggs. From 1 January 2004 eggs will have to be marked with a code identifying the method and place of production. This will improve consumer information and choice and will assist with traceability and enforcement of EU egg marketing regulations. We will soon be consulting interested parties on the format of the producer code. There is no truth in the rumours that each egg will have to be traceable back to an individual hen.
<P>

<a name="30225w17.html_para8">Egg marking will only apply to class A eggs most of which are sold at retail level. Some 80 per cent. of eggs produced and sold in the UK are already marked under the industry's Lion assurance scheme. In negotiations, the UK successfully argued for the inclusion of a provision in the new rules to allow the marking of eggs to take place at any approved packing centre as well as on farms. Furthermore, eggs sold by the producer directly to the consumer for their own use (e.g. farm gate sales or at farmers' markets) will not have to be marked, nor will any non-class A eggs or those sold for processing.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was formed in May 2002. Therefore, we do not have information on empty homes from five years ago. The Fire Service College, an executive agency of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, currently has one vacant residential property, at the college site in Moreton-in-Marsh, which it envisages will be let shortly. The College's strategy is to ensure that residential property that is not required for staff use is held out for letting on short term tenancies. Its target is to ensure that it has no residential stock vacant for more than three months.

 Supporting People will enable local authorities to provide user-centred, flexible services designed to meet local need. Local authorities are required to review all services (including those for older people) in their area between 2003 and 2006, to ensure that services meet the needs of users, are of high quality and are cost effective. It is the responsibility of each authority (and each service provider) to ensure that adequate staffing resources are in place to meet local need, and that the balance between the use of mobile and permanent staff is appropriate.

 The DfES provides considerable support to schools to fulfil their statutory obligation to educate young people about drugs. In 2002&#150;03, &#163;15.5m has been made available via the Standards Fund to improve the extent and quality of drug education. Of this, &#163;1.3m has been set aside under the drug, alcohol and tobacco education training package to support teachers' continuing professional development. We are currently revising and consolidating our guidance to schools to make clear the statutory responsibilities and outline good practice in drug education and incident management. This guidance along with the curriculum materials produced by the QCA and the learning and development website for PSHE will further help schools in this area. Additionally, through the National Healthy School Standard and local programmes support is given to schools in meeting national criteria in drug education.
<P>

<a name="30225w20.html_para2">Through schools' pastoral support systems, pupils vulnerable to drug misuse should be identified to ensure that those who need extra help either receive it in school or through access to external specialist help. Connexions advisers, which all young people should have access to, also play an important role in identifying and addressing pupils' needs.

[99110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The tendering process was aimed at reducing burdens on schools through establishing framework contracts with a range of suitable suppliers of electronic registration solutions to offerschools choice and a simple way of contracting with their preferred supplier. The decision to abandon the procurement exercise was taken because too few of the short-listed suppliers could meet the terms and conditions of the framework contracts, thus severely restricting the choice for schools. Information about these contracts and short-listed suppliers is commercially confidential.
<P>

<a name="30225w20.html_para3">Tendering was stopped in accordance with all appropriate regulations and the schools included in the electronic registration project are now free to buy systems on the open market subject to ratification by the Department. Guidance on purchasing systems has been made available to schools and this, together with information on the process for the approval of systems is available to view on the TeacherNet website:http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/Management/tools/ict/IMS/Electronic Registration/

<P>
<a name="30225w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will publish his costings that underlie his estimate that the administration costs for a graduate tax would be in the region of &#163;1 billion. [96671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The estimate of up to &#163;1 billion was not for administration costs, but for the additional upfront cash costs of implementing a graduate tax over and above the cost of variable fees and loans, as proposed in the White Paper "The future of higher education". The costs of a graduate tax system are greater for several reasons:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The graduate tax would need to support both maintenance and tuition costs, and the upfront costs of non-means tested maintenance grants for all, to be funded by the tax, are considerably more than the cash costs of means-tested loans;
<P>
<BR>
Under a graduate tax there is no possible mechanism for early additional repayments. With our existing loans, graduates are making additional repayments to clear their debts faster, and this reduces Government's costs. In addition, some students may choose not to take out a loan, but to pay up-front, which also reduces costs; and
<P>
<BR>
The rate of repayment is slower for a graduate tax than for loans, and so it takes longer for the Government to reach 'break even' point.

 I was highlighting the new measures announced in "The Future for Higher Education" which are aimed at ensuring that teaching is of a universally high standard. These new arrangements will mean that reputation for research excellence will no longer be assumed to be a proxy for high quality teaching. Concerns about the quality of teaching were raised by students with Ministers during their visits to universities, and reflected in some reports by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.

<a name="30225w21.html_para3">As shown in the table above, the funding allocated to 'teaching and learning' will increase by &#163;1,020 million between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06. Of that increase, &#163;287 million will be for capital and &#163;733 million for recurrent expenditure, made up of funding to cover increased costs and the anticipated increase in student numbers. The recurrent increase also includes additional funding for human resources and pay differentiation for those who teach well (which will be consolidated into all institutions' block grants and allocated by formula once they develop satisfactory human resources strategies) and Centres of Teaching Excellence. The funding allocated for the Centres of Teaching Excellence, and other smaller initiatives that will not be allocated to all institutions by formula, will make up around 6 per cent. of the total recurrent increase in teaching and learning.

 No such studies have been made by the Government itself; but the Universities and Colleges Employers Association has undertaken surveys of university staff in general. The findings indicate recruitment and retention is an issue in certain disciplines only, including some aspects of information technology. In 2000, the Government announced funding of &#163;50 million, &#163;110 million and &#163;170 million in England for the years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to underpin human resource strategies in each higher education institution to address recruitment and retention among other things.

 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is currently a National Curriculum foundation subject at all four key stages of compulsory education. The 14&#150;19 strategy document "14&#150;19: opportunity and excellence", published on 21 January 2003, confirmed that ICT will remain compulsory during Key Stage 4, recognising the importance that ICT plays in preparing young people to participate in a rapidly changing world in which work and other activities are increasingly dependent on access to, and skilful use of, technology.

 The level of grant available for students from households with income between &#163;10,000 and 20,000 will depend on the threshold below which the full grant will be paid. I refer my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the annual cost will be of the forthcoming uplift of National Insurance Contributions for <i>(a)</i> higher and <i>(b)</i> further education institutions. [98672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The additional cost in employers' national insurance contributions in 2003&#150;04 for all Higher Education institutions in England is estimated to be around &#163;60 million and for all Further Education institutions in England the estimate is &#163;25 million. Higher and Further Education institutions receive funding for staff costs from a variety of sources, both public and private, so the element of the increase to be covered from public sources will be only a proportion of this. The actual cost in National Insurance contributions will depend on the number of staff
<P>

<a name="30225w22.html_para3">employed and their pay level. These are matters for the institutions to determine.
<P>

<a name="30225w22.html_para4">In the 2002 Spending Review, Higher and Further Education received generous increases in total funding, averaging 6 per cent. in real terms in each of the three years to 2005&#150;06. As a result of these increases, publicly planned funding per full-time equivalent student will rise by 7 per cent. in real terms between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06 in both Higher and Further Education. This will put Further and Higher Education institutions in a good position to meet these costs.

<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Dari Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether the formula used to calculate shares of the Science Research Investment Fund 2004&#150;06 takes account of universities engaged in applied scientific research.  [98810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Science Research Investment Fund in England is allocated to institutions according to a formula based on institutions' total research income and on the amount of quality-related research income that they receive from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Both of these factors take account of applied scientific research.

<a name="30225w23.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Skill Shortages</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what assessment he has made of the skill shortages experienced by employers in England;  [96728]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the skill shortages experienced by employers of <i>(a)</i> mechanics, <i>(b)</i> plumbers, <i>(c)</i> electricians and <i>(d)</i> builders in England. [96769]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 My Department has funded a number of surveys of employers to assess their current and future skill needs, and also monitors a number of external measures of skills shortages such as those coming from the CBI's Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey.
<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para0">The Employers Skill Survey, funded by my Department, interviewed 27,000 employers across England in 1999 and in 2001, and was carried out on a smaller scale in 2002. The survey results provide evidence on trends in skill shortages, including headline measures for broad industries and occupations.
<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para1">Our own surveys, and the CBI measures, indicate that skills shortages are relatively low and stable given the historically high levels of employment we are experiencing. However, the Employers Skill Survey results do show that skilled craft trades are among the occupations most affected by skill shortage vacancies, and also that the construction industry experiences one of the highest levels of skill shortage vacancies relative to its employment levels.
<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para2">The Skills in England report, published earlier this month by the Learning and Skills Council, also stresses that the construction sector has the most severe skills shortages (as a percentage of employment). The health and social care sector also suffers from a disproportionately high share of skill shortage vacancies. Occupationally associate professionals and skilled trades have the greatest share of skill shortages.




<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 470W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para3">Detailed information on specific occupations is not collected by the Department. It is the role of the Skills for Business network (the Sector Skills Development Agency and the Sector Skills Councils) and the two Industry Training Boards to assess detailed skill needs within their particular industries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills why he has established skills sector councils to improve skills in the hospitality and leisure sector.  [95861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) has been established to fund, support and champion a new UK-wide network of influential employer-led Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). SSCs have been charged to lead the skills and productivity drive in industry or business sectors recognised by employers. They bring together employers, trade unions and professional bodies to work with government to develop the skills that UK business needs.
<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para4">A proposal to set up a Sector Skills Council for Hospitality, Leisure, Travel and Tourism, is now in the development stage. The prospective SSC is receiving support from the SSDA to prepare a detailed Labour Market Assessment and Business Proposition. Their final proposal will be judged against the criteria set out in the published SSC standard. If successful, the SSDA Board will recommend that the Secretary of State issues a five year licence to operate as a Sector Skills Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps he has taken to identify the special educational needs of children born to <i>(a)</i> crack cocaine and <i>(b)</i> cocaine-addicted mothers. [94214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has a statutory duty to advise the Government on drug misuse. Its Prevention Working Group has carried out an in-depth inquiry into the needs of children of problem drug users and is due to report to Government in summer 2003. The report will include policy and practice recommendations for Government on how they can ensure the needs of these children are met, including the role of health, social care, education, criminal justice and other services.
<P>

<a name="30225w23.html_para5">Children's special educational needs are assessed on an individual basis regardless of their family or social circumstances. The Government recognise the importance of early identification and intervention for all children with SEN and will include our plans to strengthen action in this area in a new SEN action programme to be launched later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many youth action groups have been established with funding through partnerships of study support schemes.  [98184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Partners for Study Support grant scheme, which finished in March 2002, encouraged schools to work with voluntary, private and public sector organisations to develop innovative and sustainable study support partnerships. One of the 134 projects funded through the scheme enabled Crime Concern to work with St Helen's Crime and Disorder Reduction Task group and other local organisations to develop a youth action group at local schools in the St Helen's area. Outside the study support scheme, my Department is also funding other school-based projects to prevent crime. For example, we have set up 100 Safer School Partnerships where a police officer works in a school to reduce crime locally, make the school a safer place for learning, help keep young people in education, and re-engage them with their community.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department provides capital funding for new pupil places as part of its annual capital round, but at this stage it is too early to say what the costs will be for new provision in Ashford. Most of the revenue funding for new pupil places would be provided through Kent LEA's Education Formula Spending Share. Education Formula Spending Share, and most DfES revenue grants, are primarily provided on a per pupil basis; new pupil places created as a result of the Sustainable Communities plan in Ashford would receive their share of national revenue funding totals accordingly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what his estimate is of the average cost to the public purse of <i>(a)</i> training a plumber, <i>(b)</i> training an electrician, <i>(c)</i> training a plasterer and <i>(d)</i> a degree course, broken down by further education colleges, universities and higher education institutions, for each parliamentary constituency and each local education authority area. [94703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Publicly funded training of plumbers, electricians, plasterers and other craft occupations is usually provided through Modern Apprenticeships for young people or through programmes provided by further education institutions. Reporting on the costs of this learning is the operational responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council. I have asked John Harwood, the Council's Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Member providing the information requested and a copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30225w24.html_para0">Figures for degree courses broken down in the way requested are not held centrally. For higher education in England, the Government allocates funding via the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The HEFCE provide teaching grants on the basis that similar courses are funded at similar rates irrespective of the type of institution providing the education. The detailed allocations are calculated according to the numbers and types of students in the institutions, and the courses they are taking. Different courses are weighted at different levels to reflect, for example, the higher costs of providing laboratory-based and medical courses. There are also adjustments made to the calculations to reflect London weighting, the additional costs of teaching students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature and part-time students. The cost to the public purse of a degree course will therefore reflect these weightings and adjustments.

 This Government is committed to ensuring the continued provision of appropriate civilian maritime search and rescue services for our coasts. We have listened very carefully to all the arguments for and against moving the helicopter based at Portland and announced last week that the Coastguard helicopter will continue to fly from there. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is now in a position to let a new contract for the continued provision of a helicopter based at Portland for beyond May 2003, when the current contract expires.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's responsibilities and its relationship with the Scottish Government are set out in the Transport Act 2000. The SRA has overall responsibility for the strategic development of the national passenger and freight railway network serving Scotland, England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30225w26.html_para0">The SRA must have regard to directions and guidance from the Scottish Ministers in respect of ScotRail services, provided these are not inconsistent with its directions and guidance from the Secretary of State or its financial framework. It also takes into account non-binding advice from the Scottish Ministers in respect of cross-border passenger services provided by non-Scottish franchises.




<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 481W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30225w26.html_para1">The SRA is working closely with the Scottish Executive on the replacement process for the current ScotRail franchise, which ends in 2004. The SRA must seek the consent of the Scottish Ministers before awarding the franchise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Guidance on the setting of speed limits already exists in the form of Circular Roads 1/93. This remains good advice but we recognise the need to update it. Work currently under way which will feed into a review, is planned for the latter part of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Since 1 April 2002 the Strategic Rail Authority has employed the services of 95 consultancy firms with expenditure valued above &#163;25,000. The work procured covers a wide range of subjects, including legal, financial, technical and IT services. Information regarding the work procured valued at under &#163;25,000 is not readily available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to encourage local authorities to introduce traffic lights based on light emitting diodes.  [98028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is widely recognised that light emitting diode (LED) traffic signals potentially offer good optical performance combined with high reliability and good energy efficiency. A number of LED traffic signals are available for local authorities to purchase and install. Some authorities are installing them, in spite of the significantly higher prices of these signals over conventional filament lamp types. Energy cost savings go some way to offsetting the price difference but there is still a major financial commitment if LED signals are used.
<P>

<a name="30225w26.html_para2">LED traffic signals are still relatively new and we expect there to be improvements in their specifications generally, including reliability and power consumption, and lower prices as product designs improve. As a result, 



<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 482W</I><P>
authorities may, not unreasonably, be waiting to see these demonstrated before committing to large-scale purchase.
<P>

<a name="30225w26.html_para3">As there is a competitive market for light emitting diode signals, with at least five manufacturers supplying them, and in view of the above, I do not believe specific incentives are required to encourage their use.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he will announce the terms of reference of the review of his 10 year transport plan referred to in the Sustainable Communities Plan.  [98619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The 10 year plan for transport published in 2000 set out the intention to review the plan periodically "to ensure that the Plan continues to provide the most cost-effective and efficient means of delivering our transport strategy and that it takes account of new pressures and developments". The report on progress towards delivery of the Government's 10 year plan for transport, published last December, confirmed that we will be conducting such a review to consider with Spending Review 2004. That review will take account of the progress made so far and the challenges that have to be met in the period up to 2015 and beyond.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what level of interference with asbestos is required to meet the definition that a person has disturbed asbestos for the purposes of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002; and if he will make a statement.  [98665]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Asbestos has been disturbed if asbestos fibres have been released. The types of work that would do this include, for example, drilling holes with power tools and sawing or sanding material. Working near asbestos-containing material may disturb it if it is in poor condition for instance knocking against the material. To assess whether asbestos will be disturbed the type of material, location, extent, accessibility, amount of damage and deterioration (and if it is sealed in) all need to be considered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Heald: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether it is the Government's policy that asbestos should be removed only as a last resort; what assessment he has made of whether the availability of 150 per cent.tax relief on the removal of asbestos has led to asbestos being removed unnecessarily; and if he will make a statement.  [98686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Government's policy is that asbestos in good condition that will not be disturbed is safe to leave in place providing it is properly managed. HSE has no evidence that 150 per cent. tax relief, which applies only to the regeneration of derelict buildings to remove asbestos, is an inducement. The Government will keep the position regarding tax relief under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what recent research has been conducted into benefit uprating methods; and what conclusions were drawn from recent reviews of uprating methods.  [97684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2003]:</i> We meet our statutory obligation by uprating benefits by the retail prices index (RPI) or Rossi (RPI less housing costs) to maintain their value in real terms.
<P>

<a name="30225w27.html_para0">RPI is a reliable measure of the impact of inflation on family budgets. Over 120,000 prices are collected every month, for a basket of goods and services covering the full range of consumers' expenditure. The basket is reviewed and updated annually to take account of changes in the pattern of expenditure. In addition, there is a programme of research into the methodology used in the RPI.

 No guidance has been issued specifically regarding family birthday or Christmas expenditure when calculating normal household expenditure for the purpose of assessing ability to repay overpayment of benefit.
<P>

<a name="30225w27.html_para1">If someone feels that the recovery rate of their overpayment is excessive, consideration can be given to their weekly outgoings to decide if recovery should be made at a lower rate. Basic necessities such as food, clothing or fuel costs are always taken into account when considering this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w28.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the cost to the Exchequer, net of savings in means-tested benefits and of additional income tax revenue, of an increase of &#163;5 per week in the basic state pension together with the introduction of age additions of &#163;5 per week at age 75&#150;79 and &#163;10 per week at age 80 years and over, on the basis that the age additions for those aged 75 to 79 and 80 years and over are paid in full, regardless of contribution record. [92156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Our priority is to target help on those current pensioners who have the lowest incomes. While it is true that older pensioners tend to be poorer on average, income inequality is far more pronounced across the whole pensioner population than between pensioners of different ages. For example, the median net income of the richest fifth of pensioner couples is around four times that of the poorest fifth.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para3">Age additions are not the most effective way to target those pensioners with the lowest incomes. For example, just under half of all minimum income guarantee claimants are aged under 75.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para4">As a result of the minimum income guarantee, no pensioner need live on less than &#163;102.10 a week and a couple on less than &#163;155.80 per week from April 2003. All pensioners receiving MIG will be at least 21 per cent. better off in real terms as a result of MIG rises compared to 1997, with the youngest households gaining as much as one third. Following the introduction of pension credit, the average pensioner household will be over &#163;1,150 per year better off due to Government measures introduced since 1997 and the poorest third of pensioners will be over &#163;1,500 per year better off.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para5">In addition to extra help for the poorest pensioners, the Government is committed to providing support for all pensioners throughout retirement. From April 2003 the full basic state pension will increase to &#163;77.45 a week&#151;an increase of 7 per cent. in real terms since 1997. Since 1997 the Government has also doubled winter fuel payments to &#163;200, guaranteeing this for the rest of this Parliament, and has introduced free TV licences for those aged 75 and over. Both of these measures are helping pensioners regardless of their income.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para6">If the maximum rate payable of the basic state pension was increased by &#163;5 per week and weekly age additions of &#163;5 were introduced for people aged 75&#150;79 and &#163;10 for people aged 80 and over in 2003&#150;04, we estimate that the increase in public expenditure could be around &#163;2.6 billion. This is calculated on the generous assumption that consequent savings in other benefits and any additional tax yield are channelled back into the basic state pension.

<i>Notes:</i>

1. Estimates are in cash terms for Great Britain and are rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.
<BR>
2. The estimate takes account of offsetting savings in income related benefits and additional tax yield. Income related benefit offsets are calculated using the Department for Work and Pensions Policy Simulation Model for 2003&#150;04. Additional tax yield is calculated by the Inland Revenue based upon the Survey of Personal Incomes 2000&#150;01, projected to 2003&#150;04.
<BR>
3. Calculations assume the maximum rate payable of the basic state pension is increased by &#163;5 per week and all other payments proportionately and that age additions of &#163;5 per week are paid to all those aged 75&#150;79 and &#163;10 per week to those aged 80 and over.
<BR>
4. For modelling purposes, pension credit is assumed to be in place throughout 2003&#150;04. In fact, pension credit will begin in October 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate by how much it would be possible to raise the basic State Pension for the over-75s on a revenue neutral basis, and taking account of offsetting savings in expenditure on means-tested benefits and enhanced income tax revenue, if he were not to introduce the pension credit and were instead to spend the money on the state pension for the over-75s. [92153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Increasing the basic State Pension for those aged 75 and over would not target resources on those who are most in need. While it is true that older pensioners tend to be poorer on average, income inequality is far more pronounced across the whole pensioner population than between pensioners of different ages. For example, the median net income of the richest fifth of pensioner couples is around four times that of the poorest fifth.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para7">If Pension Credit was not introduced and expenditure re-directed into the basic State Pension for those aged 75 and over in 2004&#150;05, the maximum rate payable of the basic State Pension for those aged 75 and over could be increased from around &#163;79 per week to around &#163;98 per week and all other payments increased proportionately. This increase would only be possible on the generous assumption that savings from other benefits and any additional tax yield were channelled back into the basic State Pension for those aged 75 and over.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para8">We estimate that the poorest third of pensioners could be around &#163;130 a year better off under Pension Credit than if the maximum rate payable of the basic State Pension was increased to &#163;98 per week for those aged 75 and over and Pension Credit abolished in 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30225w28.html_para9">In this scenario, the only gainers from increasing the maximum rate payable of the basic State Pension and abolishing Pension Credit would be pensioners aged 75 and over. Among those aged 75 and over, the biggest gainers would be those higher up the income distribution.

 On 1 April 1998 the then Department of Social Security transferred almost all of its estate through the Private Sector Resource Initiative for Management of the Estate (PRIME) to the private sector consortium now called LandSecurities Trillium. At that time the Department occupied approximately 700 buildings. Of these, only the 212 freehold and long lease buildings had a capital value and these are listed in the table. As part of the PRIME contract the Department received a cash consideration of &#163;250 million for assets transferred. At the time of the transfer the Departments' property advisers estimated the value of the Estate to be over &#163;300 million. The excess value of the estate is being recovered through reduced facilities payments.

market policies have helped to deliver record levels of employment across the country, and unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s.
<P>

<a name="30225w30.html_para2">As the table shows, my hon. Friend's constituency has shared in this success. As well as the reductions in claimant unemployment in Jarrow since 1997, long-term unemployment (over 12 months) has been cut by over 70 per cent. The local Jobcentre has played an important part in these achievements, helping their clients move into work and working closely with employers to fill their vacancies. It is not only unemployed people that have been helped, across the New Deals in Jarrow over 2,000 people have been helped into work.
<P>

<a name="30225w30.html_para3">We have also introduced Action Teams for Jobs to help disadvantaged people in the most employment deprived areas move into jobs. Be the end of 2002, the Action Team operating in my hon. Friend's constituency had helped 820 people move into work. The Team has developed innovative ways to help jobless people overcome the barriers to work they may face. For example, they have secured funding from the Transport Projects Fund we introduced last year to provide a bus service from South Shields to the Metro Centre and Team Valley, running through Jarrow, to help their clients overcome their transport barriers to work. The Team are also taking their services into the communities they help in Jarrow using a Mobile Unit.
<P>

<a name="30225w30.html_para4">We are building on the services we provide in Jarrow. The new Jobcentre Plus office in Jarrow will open later this year, delivering a single, integrated service to benefit claimants of working age, with a clear focus on work. Jarrow will also be part of a progress2work-LinkUP pilot starting in the autumn. This new initiative will provide further support for those facing the greatest disadvantages in the labour market, including ex-offenders, homeless people and recovering alcohol misusers.

<a name="30225w30.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what recent assessment he has made of trends in the rate of unemployment in Portsmouth; and if he will make a statement.  [98346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Government's policies have created a strong economy geared to delivering stability, low inflation and have helped deliver a high and stable level of employment benefiting every part of the country. Alongside this, through Jobcentre Plus and programmes such as the New Deal, our labour market policies are helping more people move into work.
<P>

<a name="30225w30.html_para5">The number of people out of work and claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in Portsmouth has fallen by over 60 per cent. since 1997. Between January 2001 and January 2002 the number of claimant unemployed people in Portsmouth, as a percentage of the resident population of working age, fell from 2.7 per cent. to 2.4 per cent. However, in the last 12 months unemployment has levelled out and is 2.4 per cent. in January 2003. But, with unemployment at levels not seen since the 1970s and inflation and interest rates low, we believe that the UK is better placed than for many years to weather the current uncertainties in the world economy.

The NHS Plan reinforced this, including a commitment to significantly increase investment in services. Since the publication of the NSF, an additional 359 million revenue funding has been made available, most of this in baseline allocations, to enable local health communities to develop the services they need to meet the needs of their local population.

<P>
<P><I>25 Feb 2003 : Column 512W</I><P>
100 per cent. juice only counts once per day even if more than one portion is consumed. Beans and other pulse vegetables only count once per day even is more than one portion is consumed. A portion of dried fruit counts, but other types of fruits and vegetables should be consumed to meet the rest of the five a day target.
<P>

<a name="30225w33.html_para3">Potatoes and other vegetables that are eaten as the main starchy 'staple', such as yam and cassava, do not count towards the five a day target. Starchy foods are an important part of a healthy, balanced diet.

<a name="30225w33.html_para8">Those NHS hospital trusts not yet involved in the modernisation project will now need to discuss with their respective primary care trusts whether they wish to modernise in 2003&#150;04 or 2004&#150;05.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether he expects to use non-NHS providers to achieve full coverage of digital hearing aids under the Modernising Hearing Aid Services Programme.  [97877]<P>

<P>
<a name="30225w33.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Following a successful pilot, which provided National Health Service aids via private hearing aid providers, we intend to extend public private partnerships to boost NHS capacity, reduce waiting times and to make it easier for people with hearing impairment to access services&#151;on the high street rather than in hospitals. We are drawing up plans for this work and want to make rapid progress.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w33.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 It is currently estimated that an additional two audiological posts will be required by each site as it is modernised to become a service that provides digital hearing aids. As modernised hearing aid services are rolled out across England over the next two years, work will be continuing on skill-mix and involvement of the private sector, which could have an effect on that estimate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS trusts do not offer digital hearing aids; and what estimate he has made of when each of them will be able to start fitting digital hearing aids.  [97891]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w33.html_spnew11"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 All National Health Service hearing aid services will be providing digital hearing aids by April 2005. We plan to modernise 80 in 2004&#150;05 and the remaining services, approximately 70, in 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30225w33.html_para9">By the end of March, there will be a total of 50 NHS trusts providing digital hearing aids as part of a modernised hearing aid service. In addition, any NHS hearing aid service which has received appropriate training and equipment is able to access the NHS digital hearing aid contract. This represented in the region of 23 additional trusts accessing the contract at the beginning of this financial year, five of which have since joined the modernisation programme. By April 2003, a further 17 services will have received, through the modernisation programme, the equipment and training to enable them to access the contract. We understand that there may be other trusts who supply digital hearing aids outside the NHS contract. Those figures are not held centrally.

<a name="30225w34.html_para1">The Department funded National Treatment Outcome Research Study demonstrates that around half, or 47 per cent., of drug users who have gone through residential programmes, and more than a third, or 35 per cent., of those from methadone programmes are still abstinent from opiates at four to five years. More than a third, or 38 per cent., of all the residential clients were also abstinent from all six illicit target drugs&#151;illicit heroin, non-prescribed methadone, non-prescribed benzodiazepines, crack cocaine, powder cocaine, amphetamines&#151;at four to five years.

<P>
<a name="30225w35.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The average (mean) waiting time for a first out-patient appointment for patients referred to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics by general practitioners is 2.15 weeks as of September 2002. However GUM services are open-access and the vast majority of patients self-refer, so this figure may not be an accurate reflection of waiting times which vary across the country.
<P>

<a name="30225w35.html_para0">Data from clinicians in the field shows that medium time to first appointment in GUM services has lengthened to 12 days for men and 14 days for women. However there is wide variation in waiting times across the country. It is important that people with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are able to access GUM services quickly. Evidence from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (2000) shows that people with an untreated STI typically pass the infection on to a further one to four partners. If there is a wait for several weeks, there is a high risk that the patient will not turn up for the appointment.

<a name="30225w35.html_para1">We have invested a total of &#163;5.3 million in GUM services this financial year. This funding was allocated in recognition of the pressure GUM services are facing and in response to concerns from the profession about the possible impact of the new adult sexual health campaign launched in December.

The Yellow Card Scheme is a scheme by which health professionals in the UK can report suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products. Data are colleted and<P>

reviewed by the Medices Control Agency, with independent advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Approximately 18,000 reports of suspected adverse reactions to medicines are received through the scheme each year.<P>

Table 2 provides a breakdown of the number of reports of hepatoxicity received in association with any medicine through the Yellow Card Scheme by year since 1993. These reports include all levels of severity of liver problems, from mild elevations of liver enzymes to liver failure. It is important to note that a report of suspected adverse reaction through the scheme does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the medicine.<P>

Data from the Yellow Card Scheme cannot be used to calculate the incidence of medicine-related liver injury as not all adverse reaction to medicines are reported.<P>

policies of the Agency within the framework set by Ministers. The Agency's Chairman, Professor Alasdair Breckenridge, will be responsible for increasing its public profile and, in particular, for ensuring that the public is well-informed about issues concerning the safety of medicines and medical equipment. The Agency will also publish an annual report on its operations.

 The National Audit Office report was published on 16 January and officials of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) are currently considering the recommendations of the report. The Board of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will take the recommendations fully into account when it considers the operation of the new Agency. Officials from the Department of Health and the MCA will be giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee on the subject of the report in March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30225w37.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Although the Department has not undertaken a direct assessment of this, studies have reported that those receiving assertive community treatments were more likely to remain in contact with services than people receiving standard community care. People allocated to assertive outreach teams were less likely to be admitted to hospital than those receiving standard community care and spent less time in hospital, results show a 35 per cent. decrease in hospital admissions, hence reducing the use of in-patient beds.
<P>

<a name="30225w37.html_para0">Studies have also shown that in terms of clinical and social outcome, significant and robust differences between assertive community treatment and standard community care were found on accommodation status, employment and patient satisfaction. More users were maintained in treatment longer than in routine case management, users experienced fewer admissions involving the police and there were fewer involuntary admissions.

 The European Commission has so far made no proposals to permit imports of pig meat from Brazil further to this report. If such a proposal were made, we would expect the shortcomings identified in the report to have been addressed before the United Kingdom could support it.

 Quarterly data are collected on the number of operations cancelled by the hospital for non-clinical reasons at the last minute (for example, on the day patients are due to arrive or after arrival in hospital or on the day of their operation) and on the day of surgery. These data are available in the Library and on the Department's website at www.doh.qov.uk/hospitalactivity/data requests.htm
