 The detection of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> directly from live badgers and their excretions using techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is complex and difficult.

Note:<br>

1. Data in the table is from waste collection authorities and the Environment Agency for England as recorded on the Flycapture database from April 2004&#150;March 2005.<br>

2. Volume details are an estimate only as the database records summary numbers linked to average sizes rather than reporting specific volumes in an incident database. &#039;assumption&#039; indicates an average size that can be assumed, whereas &#039;guidance&#039; indicates that a suggested size is proposed in the database guidance.<br>

1. Environment Agency data capture on the nature of wastes fly-tipped and available for 2001 to 2005 is in the table. The number of pollutants identified will exceed the number of incidents due to single incidents with multiple pollutants.
2. Environment Agency volumetric data capture commenced last year It is therefore as yet detailed will not provide as complete a picture as Flycapture.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate the Government have made of the financial implications for local authorities of its proposed household duty of care on waste.  [26925]</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51128w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Waste (Household Waste Duty of Care) (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 give local authorities a new power to take action against householders for breaches of the duty of care. There is no duty on local authorities to enforce this requirement or to prosecute offenders. Therefore, the extent to which this new power is used will be a matter for individual local authorities based on their enforcement and prosecution policies, and the financial implications will vary accordingly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_33">As many local authorities have enforcement teams to deal with fly-tipping and other local environmental quality offences, there will be no additional cost as this is simply another power they can use to target offenders. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 16W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Local authorities have been requesting this power for some time. They currently spent around &#163;44 million from April 2004 to March 2005 on clearing fly-tipping, 55 per cent. of which was household waste. Enforcing the household waste duty of care will help to reduce illegal dumping and could lead to resource savings for authorities.

The decision as to whether carcases are required for examination is made during this second, more detailed assessment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likely effect of the EU&#039;s most recent offer in the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations on <i>(a)</i> applied EU agricultural tariffs and <i>(b)</i> total levels of EU agricultural subsidy.  [29489]</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51128w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 For most EU tariffs, the general &#039;most favoured nation&#039; (MFN) applied tariffs are the same as the bound tariffs. This means that, in general, the cuts in the bound tariffs will translate into equivalent cuts in the general MFN applied tariffs. (The most notable exceptions are some of the tariffs in the cereals, rice and fruit and vegetables sectors.)
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">For some countries EU applied tariffs are less than the applied MFN tariffs. These lower applied tariffs are granted to groups such as the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (for least developed countries most tariffs are already zero under the everything but arms agreement). At present there is no proposal for any specific reduction in these preferential tariff rates. Neither is there any proposal for a reduction in the concessionary within-quotas tariffs which already exist.

<a name="51128w06.html_para1">
Total agricultural support consists of two broad categories: market price support (keeping domestic agricultural prices above world prices), which involves costs to consumers and Government expenditure; and direct payments by Government. The two aspects of the EU offer which will have the most impact on consumer costs are the elimination of export subsidies and the reductions in tariffs. The elimination of export subsidies and the reductions in tariffs will allow prices to fall, resulting in a decrease in the overall level of subsidy due to a decrease in consumer costs. However, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of this effect because of the complex interactions between domestic support reforms, trade reforms, and reforms in other major agricultural producing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">The EU&#039;s offer on domestic support will consolidate the 2003 CAP reforms. The result of the offer would be a real reduction in trade-distorting subsidy from both the pre-2003 position and the current position. However, the non-trade-distorting direct payments are not affected by the EU&#039;s offer in the WTO negotiations as these are eligible for the WTO &#039;green box&#039;.

 The use of animals in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom is strictly regulated by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Licences are granted for animal experiments undertaken for specific permissible purposes. There must be no alternative to the use of animals, the potential benefit of the work has to outweigh the adverse effects on the animals involved and the number of animals used and any suffering that may be caused must be minimised.

One of the functions of the Ethical Review Process is to examine the efficacy and conduct of work to be undertaken. In addition, research councils and charities fund many research projects carried out under the 1986 Act and such work is evaluated by and reported to those organisations. A licence application is only submitted to the Home Office once participants in the local ethical review process are satisfied that the work can be justified.

 Information on how many female asylum seekers are pregnant on application for asylum is not available. Information on asylum applications by sex is published annually.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s protocol is for returning personal documentation to failed asylum seekers.  [31182]</p>




<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate will take all reasonable steps to return personal documentation to asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. The process for returning these documents depends on the circumstances of the person&#039;s case.

<p><a name="qn_56"><a name="51128w07.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Benyon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) whether the immigration and nationality directorate review of managed migration routes has resulted in <i>(a)</i> the suspension of and <i>(b)</i> delay to applications from Commonwealth citizens residing in the UK under the ancestral visa scheme for indefinite leave to remain;  [25345]
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_3">(2) how many individuals from each Commonwealth country have had applications through the ancestral visa scheme for indefinite leave to remain <i>(a)</i> delayed and <i>(b)</i> suspended since the outset of the review of managed migration routes.  [25346]</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Concern about possible abuse of the UK ancestry route was identified during the course of the top-to-bottom review of managed migration routes launched by the Prime Minister in April 2004. The review found evidence of suspected abuse of the ancestral visa route from Zimbabweans, which has therefore resulted in suspension and delay of these applications. The suspension on decision making relates only to those UK ancestry cases submitted by Zimbabwean nationals and has affected approximately 300 indefinite leave to remain applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w07.html_para10">
It is only right that the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) should take all actions necessary to identify the level of abuse and put in place measures to prevent it, and I regret any delay this creates for bona fide applicants. However I am pleased to announce that the investigation is now at such a stage that consideration of UK ancestry cases from Zimbabwean nationals can now be resumed.

<p>
<a name="51128w07.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_52">We are currently consulting on a new points based system for managed migration to cover routes to work, study and train in the UK. As we develop the new system, we will consider how it relates to existing routes such as UK ancestry, and will assess the possible impact before making changes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the penalty is for lorry drivers who allow illegal immigrants to enter the UK in their lorry.  [26457]</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The civil penalty regime, as amended by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, enables the imposition of a penalty on drivers, owners, operators and hirers of transporters of up to a maximum of &#163;2,000 per clandestine entrant carried to the UK or to a UK immigration control operated in a prescribed zone. In cases where liability is incurred, the level of penalty: code of practice sets out the factors to be taken into consideration when setting the amount of penalty.

<a name="stpa_54">In 2003&#150;04, 22 per cent. of people in the London region had a high level of worry about violent crime and 25 per cent. of people perceived a high level of disorder in their local area, compared to 29 and 34 per cent. respectively in 2002&#150;03.

Perceiving a high-level of disorder (also termed the overall antisocial behaviour measure) is defined here from responses to five disorder strands (the BVPI 122 measure). Perceiving a high-level of disorder has since been redefined, and is now derived from responses to seven individual disorder strands, see Dodd et al. 2004 (HOSB 10/04) for further detail.

<sup>(36)</sup> The Crime Reduction programme (CRP) was a multi-million pound intervention programme running for three years from April 1999. The effectiveness of each initiative was evaluated to add to the knowledge base of what works in reducing crime in England and Wales. Over &#163;340 million has been committed to over 1,470 projects in England and Wales under the various initiatives that formed part of the Crime Reduction programme. Figures are not available for constituency or CDRP level. The CRP funded projects rather than allocated money to CDRPs.<br>

<sup>(37)</sup> The figures relate to the regional figures for the whole south east region and cannot be further broken down.<br>

<sup>(38)</sup> The figures relate to allocated funds to Milton Keynes BCU within the Thames Valley police force area.<br>

 Following the publication of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary&#039;s report &#039;Closing the gap&#039;, which concluded that the existing 43 force structure was no longer fit for purpose, police authorities and chief constables have been asked to submit proposals for restructuring by 23 December. Restructuring would commence in 2006 and be completed by April 2008. Against this backdrop, we have considered what arrangements should apply in the short term when chief officer vacancies arise. In his capacity as chair of the Senior Appointments Panel Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, recently wrote to police authorities advising, except where specific approval had already been granted, not to proceed with existing or future plans to recruit new chief constables. Currently there are discussions between the Thames Valley police authority and Sir Ronnie Flanagan on how to address this particular situation and I would expect the police authority to make an announcement in due course.

<p>
1. Quarterly figures are provided because this is consistent with the Agency&#039;s compliance measurement. It also takes account of the variations in NRP payment patterns which make it difficult to produce an accurate average over a shorter time frame
2. This excludes cases for which no maintenance was due via the collection service (e.g. cases with a nil liability and maintenance direct).




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 72W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
3. The figures quoted relate to the average amount of maintenance received per case, as opposed to the value of the average calculation. A non-resident parent can pay maintenance in respect of more than one case.
4. The figures for the self-employed presented reflect the status of the non-resident parent currently held on the system as of the last intervention by the Agency. This will not necessarily reflect the current status of the non-resident parent if the Agency has not been informed of (or not yet actioned) a change of circumstances.
5. Figures are rounded to the nearest pound.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent assessment he has made of the effects of energy costs on competitiveness in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [29755]</p>




<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51128w26.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. In January this year the Department set up the Gas Prices Working Group with the Energy Intensive Users Group and Ofgem, with the remit of examining the workings of the gas market and developing ideas for improving its operation. The group has now agreed a list of action points for the short to medium term, such as maximising gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas and electricity prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas or electricity a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">In making decisions about phase 2 of the EU emissions trading scheme the Government are determined to minimise the impact on the UK&#039;s international competitiveness. The evidence to date suggests that the impact of the scheme on electricity prices in the UK is around the average for the EU as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">Despite recent rises, UK gas and electricity prices for industrial users at July 2005 were at or below the EU median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices which might differ from these averages. There is anecdotal evidence that, for very large users of gas, gas prices in the UK are above those on the continent, as they buy gas at wholesale prices. On 16h May DTI held a seminar with major users to discuss forward gas prices. We and Energywatch are planning a further seminar with smaller users on 30 November 2005 to discuss energy purchasing strategies.

 The Government have taken a number of measures to support the development of small and micro generation technologies connected to the distribution networks close to the point of demand. Not least of these was the creation of the industry-wide Distributed Generation Coordinating Group (DGCG) which operated over a three-year period to November 2004 and which initiated a range of projects designed to address barriers to the integration of distributed generation. Building on the valuable work of the DGCG, the DTI together with Ofgem established in January 2005 the Electricity Networks Strategy Group (ENSG), which looks more widely at issues relating to the electricity networks while maintaining a focus on the development of distributed generation.

 In January 2005 the Department published proposals for the allocation of the &#163;50 million &#039;Marine Renewables Deployment Fund&#039; that will support the continued development of the marine renewables sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_218">At the core of those proposals was a &#163;42 million Wave and Tidal Stream Energy Demonstration Scheme for which the eligibility criteria are available on the DTI website. The demonstration scheme is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2006 and to receive applications on set dates throughout the year. It will be for device developers to demonstrate that they meet the eligibility criteria for the demonstration scheme. As the allocation of funding is on a competitive process it is not possible at this stage to allocate funds to individual proposals.

 No application for consent has been received in respect of the proposed Gwynt y Mor offshore wind farm and, there is, therefore, no formal objection process in place.

<p><a name="qn_284"><a name="51128w30.html_wqn3"><b> Michael Gove: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the likely effect of the EU&#039;s most recent offer in the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations on <i>(a)</i> applied EU non-agricultural tariffs and <i>(b)</i> services trade liberalisation.  [29490]</p>




<p><a name="st_284"><a name="51128w30.html_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The EU&#039;s second offer sought agreement on a simple Swiss tariff formula for industrial goods. This is a non-linear, harmonising formula that is effective at reducing high tariffs and peaks and narrowing tariff escalations. Such a formula would lead to a substantial improvement in real market access through cuts in the applied duties of developed and more competitive developing countries, on the understanding that developing countries should do less. The UK is working hard within the EU to ensure no new obligations are imposed on LDCs and that any NAMA agreement for developing countries respects the principle of less than full reciprocity and maximises Special and Differential Treatment. We recognise the importance for developing countries of maintaining flexibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_221">The EU proposal on services aims to substantially improve market access, and recognises a distinction between developed and developing countries in setting targets and the need for balance in the negotiations. The UK&#039;s established preference is for a settlement that avoids all new mandatory requirements on developing countries to liberalise services, and we will continue to work towards this goal. We are particularly determined to ensure the maintenance of flexibilities to reflect the individual circumstances of developing countries and preserve members&#039; ability to respond to targets based on their own national policy objectives.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will press for trade justice rather than free trade at the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Hong Kong in December.  [29523]</p>




<p><a name="st_285"><a name="51128w30.html_spnew4"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 In his open letter of 2 November to the Trade Justice Movement, the Secretary of State emphasised our commitment to securing the best possible deal for developing countries at Hong Kong.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 114W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">For ease of reference I set out the full text of his letter here:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"> This has been a big year for international development. In June, Gordon Brown&#039;s deal with world finance ministers cancelled large chunks of the debt that has crippled the poorest countries and held back their development. In July, at the G8 summit in Gleneagles, the Prime Minister secured an agreement that pledged $50 billion extra in aid.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"> The third crucial area with which to tackle world poverty is fairer trade. The World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong in December offer an opportunity for the world community to address the imbalances in the world trading system and to deliver an outcome that will enable developing countries to trade their way out of poverty.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"> Trade offers huge potential for developing countries. Inequities in the world trading system disadvantage poor countries. Boosting Africa&#039;s share of world trade by just 1 per cent. could deliver seven times as much income as the whole continent currently gets in aid. So increasing the opportunity to trade is vital. But there are risks in trade liberalisation for developing countries&#151;dislocation, job losses and income volatility&#151;if it is done too quickly and not as part of a broader development strategy. So we oppose forced liberalisation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"> Today, as thousands of campaigners are lobbying Parliament to make poverty history by delivering trade justice, I want to record Government&#039;s support for your objective of no forced liberalisation. We want to ensure better access to Western markets, as well as removing the hidden barriers to trade faced by developing countries and other inequalities that remain in the world trading system.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"> The Trade Justice Movement is asking the UK government to use its influence within the EU to deliver on four key concerns:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106"><i> Stop pushing poor countries to open their economies through world trade talks.</i> We agree. The UK believes that developing countries should not be forced to open up their markets either through trade negotiations or aid conditionality.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107"> <i>Respect poor countries&#039; right to decide on trade policies to help end poverty and protect their environment.</i> We agree. It is for developing countries to make their own decisions on the timing, pace, sequencing and product coverage of any market opening in line with their own national development plans and poverty reduction strategies.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108"> <i>Allow developing countries to shape trade policies that protect vulnerable farm sectors and promote national industries.</i> We agree. A pro-development agreement at Hong Kong should include meaningful provision for special and differential treatment, including special products, that enables developing countries to promote food security, rural development and the protection of livelihoods.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_109"> <i>Allow countries to choose the best policies for poor people and the environment in services such as water, health and education.</i> We agree. We strongly support the current voluntary arrangement for trade in services precisely because it allows liberalisation of services to take place in a way that supports national development plans. In the run up to Hong Kong, we are pushing other developed countries to ensure that the Hong Kong deal gives developing countries the flexibility that they need to plan and sequence trade reform in line with their national development plans. It may not be possible to deliver all that we would like to see, but we are committed to use our influence to secure the best possible deal for developing countries.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_223">It will be challenging to build the consensus around a package at Hong Kong that truly delivers on the promises of the Doha Development Agenda, but, as the Prime Minister has said, we will not let this opportunity pass without a monumental struggle.
