 Operation Telic has evolved through a number of separate phases since the start of operations in 2003. Initial high-intensity war fighting soon transitioned to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations, and in 2009 there was a fundamental change of mission to training and mentoring. Planning for the future of Operation Telic is the subject of ongoing work but the partnership between the UK and Iraq will continue to be strengthened through co-operation in a range of areas including the economy, culture, commerce, education and defence. It is clearly in the UK's interest to continue to develop a strong bilateral relationship with Iraq and in support of this we will look to build on our long tradition of defence co-operation. The nature and timing of such co-operation will depend on the wishes and approval of the Iraqi Parliament.</p>

 The Environment Agency continues to monitor for the presence of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), as a consequence of the Buncefield explosion in December 2005. This monitoring showed a peak in concentrations of pollutants indicative of fire fighting foam and petrol during 2006. Since 2006 the concentrations have reduced but the Environment Agency's monitoring still shows these pollutants consistently throughout the chalk aquifer, with higher levels under the site itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="100712w0001.htm_para56"><a name="10071226000076">Similarly, in May 2010 the Highways Agency made permanent restrictions on two sections on the A1(M) southbound in County Durham at junction 63 to north of junction 62 at Lumley Road Bridge, Great Lumley  <br>

and at junction 61 north of Coxhoe to north of junction 60 at Bishop Middleham. At these sections HGVs are restricted from using lane 2 (the right hand lane in the direction of travel) between 7.00 am and 7.00 pm, seven days a week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="100712w0001.htm_para57"><a name="10071226000077">The agency has also considered introducing overtaking restrictions for HGVs on other sections of the A1, including A1 south of the A57 at Markham Moor; A1 south of Grantham; A1 south of Stamford (between the A6121 and Carpenter's Lodge Roundabout); A1 junction 49 (junction of A1/A168) to start of A1(M) at junction 56; end of A1(M) at junction 65 to A1/A697 junction; B6345 overbridge at Felton, Northumberland to approximately one mile north of B1340 overbridge at Denwick, Northumberland; and the dual carriageway section near North Charlton, Northumberland. However, analysis has shown there to be either insufficient justification or an adverse impact on safety for traffic emerging from side roads at these locations, thus discounting the introduction of HGV overtaking restrictions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 June 2010]:</i> The Highways Agency already takes a variety of steps to inform motorists about both closures and other events that might have an impact on their journey on the motorway and trunk road network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="100712w0001.htm_para59"><a name="10071226000081">For drivers who have already embarked on their journey, variable message signs (VMS) are used to inform them of any problems ahead. These can be used both in the immediate vicinity of the closure, to give drivers useful advice and information, and at a more strategic level, to suggest alternative routes that will take road users around the closure, and thus prevent excessive delays.</p>

 The national health service bowel cancer screening programme in England began by inviting people aged 60 to 69 to be screened because over 80% of bowel cancers are diagnosed in those aged over 60. Although the pilot on which the programme was based invited people aged 50 to 69, those in their 60s were more likely to complete a testing kit. There was also insufficient endoscopy capacity at the time to invite a wider age range. This decision was informed by a formal options appraisal undertaken in 2004 by the School for Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the University of Sheffield. The programme is currently being extended to people aged 70 to their 75th birthday, and the review of the Cancer Reform Strategy will consider how best we can extend screening to people in their 50s.</p>

The HCA's regional offices will be assessing which other schemes can be progressed. Moreover, given public sector borrowing in 2010-11 was forecast to hit £167 billion, such levels of spending on "borrowed money" was unsustainable-contributing to the forecast £1.4 trillion of public debt by 2014.</p>

 The information is not available from my Department. The presence of asbestos in the home is one of 29 potential hazards assessed through the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).

However this reporting requirement is not specific to individual hazards.

For example, we are increasing the number of children under five who are immunised against childhood diseases, backed by £150 million over 10 years to the GAVI Alliance. We work to tackle under-nutrition which contributes to one third of child deaths as well as one fifth of maternal deaths. We are increasing our support for the prevention and treatment of malaria. Some 90% of deaths from malaria are in children and malaria is the cause of one in five child deaths in Africa.</p>

The technology automatically reads vehicle registration marks (VRMs) allowing these details to be compared against database records. Therefore, ANPR does not "track" every journey but relies on intelligence-led policing and flags VRMs which are linked to criminality and allows the police to focus on those engaged in unlawful activity; law-abiding road users go unhindered by ANPR technology.</p>

 UK payment data as reported by Experian show that the time taken for payments to suppliers across the economy in May 2010 was 0.5 days faster than the level recorded in May 2008.

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="100712w0004.htm_para64"><a name="1007132000053">There is therefore no pre-existing breakdown of the costs imposed on it by EU regulations upon which the Department can draw to produce an estimate of such compliance. To produce such an estimate would be a major undertaking, and would involve disproportionate expenditure. By way of comparison, the administrative burdens measurement exercise, which provided an indicative estimate of administrative burdens across the UK economy, cost in excess of £10 million to undertake.</p>

The 1999-2000 figure does not include maintained nursery schools; these data were first collected in 2003-04. There are no relevant data for the years before 1999-2000.</p>

 Like academies, the funding agreement contract will include provisions which require the school to have regard to the SEN Code of Practice and use best endeavours to meet any guidance on exclusions. Where a school fails to meet its SEN funding agreement obligations, the Secretary of State has the role of ensuring that those obligations are met. Disability discrimination legislation will also apply to free schools to prevent discrimination against disabled pupils and, as with other schools, free schools will have to make reasonable adjustments to prevent such discrimination.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 June 2010]:</i> The legislation that protects school playing fields, under section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, extends to all of a school's outdoor areas. No school or local authority in England can dispose or change the use of a school playing field or any part of a school playing field without the Secretary of State's consent. The legislation defines playing fields as land in the open air which is provided for the purposes of physical education or recreation, and includes playgrounds, hard games courts, social areas etc as well as grassed playing fields.</p>

 No specific funding is provided by central Government to fund post-16 transport. Local authority statutory responsibilities for transport in relation to post-16 students are funded through revenue support grant and through income generated by councils, including council tax. Formula grant is not hypothecated to a particular service. Local authorities are free to use the funding in line with the wishes of their electorate to meet local needs while taking into account their statutory responsibilities.</p>

However, consolidation of the court estate both in terms of function as well as location could mean that some court users will make fewer trips to court, e.g. CPS officers and solicitors may have to travel to fewer courts, and so lessening the overall impact.

 Public consultations on the delivery of courts services in England and Wales were announced on 23 June. These proposals include the closure of a number of magistrates and county courts, five of which are in the Nottinghamshire area. Decisions on case transfer will not be made until after the Lord Chancellor makes decisions on which of these courts ought to be closed and when. Such decisions will need to take into account court workload across all of the east midlands area, No estimate has therefore been made of the number of cases likely to be heard in magistrates courts in Nottinghamshire over the next three years.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice produces annual projections of the prison population in England and Wales, most recently in August 2009. These project the prison population under three different scenarios (high, medium and low), based on different assumptions about future sentencing trends.

 Data are not available at constituency level. However, the accompanying tables show the number of Stop and Searches (section 1, 60 and 44) in 2008-09 for the West Midlands police force area. Statutory powers exist under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), for a police officer to search a person or vehicle without first making an arrest. Other police powers not under PACE include Stops and Searches in anticipation of violence (under section 60 of Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) and searches of pedestrians, vehicles and occupants (under sections 44(1) and 44(2) of the Terrorism Act 2000).</p>
