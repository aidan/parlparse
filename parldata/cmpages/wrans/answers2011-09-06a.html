 Bovine TB is a devolved issue and, while we work closely with the Welsh Government, we have no current plans for a joint strategy. However, we recognise that this disease does not respect national borders and will continue to co-operate with the Welsh Government and seek to coordinate activity as far as possible.</p>

 Fully natural grasslands are very rare in England and are limited to high altitude grasslands and, in the lowlands, some very exposed, unstable south-facing slopes in southern England on chalk/limestone where the prevailing environmental conditions prevent shrub and tree invasion.

 It is a condition of payment under the single payment scheme that farmers have to meet a range of environmental standards known as cross compliance. These include a requirement for farmers to adhere to specific regulations in the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (England) (No 2) Regulations 2006. These regulations are designed to protect uncultivated land and semi-natural areas from being damaged by agricultural work. They also guard against possible negative environmental effects from the restructuring of rural land holdings. The regulations apply to projects that are greater than two hectares, but this threshold can be disapplied where it is thought that a project of less than 2 ha may have a significant impact on the environment (for example, this may be due to the particularly high environmental quality of the land or the cumulative impact of the project.</p>

               <a name="11090713000085"> Cross compliance also requires farmers to avoid over grazing or unsuitable supplementary feeding on natural or semi-natural vegetation.</p>

               <a name="11090713000086"> There is a broader obligation in the EU rules governing cross compliance that member states need to monitor the proportion of agricultural land that is ‘permanent pasture’ and maintain levels of ‘permanent pasture’ above a minimum ratio, set on a historic basis. However the EU definition of ‘permanent pasture’ does not distinguish between natural/semi-natural grassland of high environmental value and enriched and reseeded grassland of low environmental value so provides little protection to the former. The Task Force on Farming Regulation recognised this failing in the current system. The UK will consider this issue as part of the forthcoming negotiations to reform the CAP.</p>

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has put special measures in place to track claims arising from these disturbances, and has received two such claims as of 18 August. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2008 (the Scheme) gives people two years from the date of the incident in which they were injured to apply for compensation, so it is too early to say what the total number of claims might be. CICA cannot currently estimate the cost of those claims already in the system because they will need to receive and assess the relevant evidence for each case.</p>

 Payments began on 30 June, and hundreds of payments have been made to date. The Scheme intends to make around £500 million worth of payments to eligible policyholders by April next year, which is a significant logistical exercise. To ensure that the required systems are fully tested and robust, the Scheme's, implementation plan is to make a low volume of payments initially. Payment volumes will continue to be ramped up over the coming months as the Scheme's complex payment processes are refined further.</p>

 The euro area summit on 21 July agreed to lower the interest rate on euro area loans provided by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to Ireland. The Government welcomed this reduction in EFSF loan interest rates. This allows the UK to reduce the interest rate on our bilateral loan to Ireland, while ensuring all the benefit goes to Ireland and not to higher interest rates paid to euro area governments. The amount by which the interest rate will be reduced is under consideration. The Government will still be more than covering the cost of their borrowing. The loan can be drawn after the approval of the third quarterly review of Ireland's Memorandum of Understanding with the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.</p>

               <a name="11090715000405"> This Government are committed to eradicating child poverty in the UK by 2020. We published our first child poverty strategy, “A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families' Lives”, covering the period to 2014, in April this year. It sets out a new approach to tackling poverty and securing, social justice aimed at transforming lives and tackling the causes of poverty. At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, tackling worklessness and benefit dependency and increasing children's life chances, with tailored support to overcome barriers and a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures.</p>

We are drawing on our strong local networks to embed an evidence-based focus on what works best in sustainably eradicating child poverty, including sharing evidence from across the suite of child poverty pilots (which included a child poverty innovation pilot in North Warwickshire, a teenage parents in supported housing pilot in Worcestershire) and to ensure local experiences are properly reflected in the development of our national policy.</p>

               <b>Mr Gauke:</b>
 The principal VAT directive, which governs the application of VAT in the European Union requires member states to apply a VAT exemption to certain activities in the public interest, including supplies of sporting services by non-profit making organisations. Subscription fees charged by non-profit-making golf clubs are therefore exempt from VAT. The exemption does not extend to subscription fees received by proprietary (profit-making) clubs.</p>

               <a name="11090715000514"> HMRC consider that, under UK law, green fees paid by non-members to both non-profit-making and proprietary clubs are taxable. In a recent decision, the First Tier Tribunal found that green fees paid by non-members to non-profit making golf clubs were exempt. HMRC has been given leave to appeal this decision to the Upper Tier Tribunal and businesses should continue to treat these green fees as taxable pending a decision of the Upper Tier Tribunal.</p>
