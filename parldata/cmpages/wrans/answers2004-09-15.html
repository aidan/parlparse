 The Government wish to encourage all town and parish councils to reach the standards of the best. To achieve this, councillors and clerks need a wide range of skills to act as the voice of their communities, deliver services and create strong local partnerships. Therefore, town and parish councils should be actively supporting their councillors and clerks to participate in training and continuing professional development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w03.html_para0">
The Rural White Paper (November 2000) established the &quot;QUALITY&quot; town and parish council scheme and provided &#163;2 million in assistance to help councils meet the new quality standards and establish a national strategy to provide training and support for parish and town councils.
</p>

<a name="40915w03.html_para1">
The National Training Strategy for parish and town councils was published in November 2001 in partnership with the Government, the Countryside Agency, the National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks. Jointly, these organisations have used the &#163;2 million mentioned above to:

 Forms will be issued in March 2005 for farmers to apply, by 16 May, for the allocation of Single Payment Scheme entitlements and for payment against those entitlements. As part of the application process, eligible farmers will be able to ask for a number of their entitlements to have an authorisation attached. Those allocated entitlements with an authorisation will be able to grow fruit, vegetables and potatoes on the equivalent number of hectares which they will need to have to support their annual claim for payment against those entitlements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w03.html_para3">
Eligibility for the allocation of entitlements with authorisations will be restricted by regional ceilings, which represent the average number of hectares of fruit, vegetables and potatoes that were grown in each region in the period 2000&#150;02. Allocations to individual farmers will be based first on the number of hectares they grew of those crops in 2003. If there is any headroom remaining between the regional ceiling and the number of individual claims based on 2003 production, then 2004 production may also be taken into account. If there still remains headroom under the ceiling then 2005 production may additionally be taken into account. With this in mind, farmers who wish to claim entitlements with authorisations will be asked to provide details of their 2003, 2004 and 2005 production of fruit, vegetable and potatoes on their application forms. Entitlements, including those with authorisations, will be allocated by the end of 2005.

 Some concerns have been raised that the introduction of the Single Payment in 2005 could affect the willingness of landowners to let land in that year. The Department has discussed these issues with representatives of the farming industry and their professional advisers and our view remains that the interests of both landowners and growers can be protected by appropriate contractual arrangements between the two parties.

Compliance with these conditions is assessed during routine inspections.

Since most storage takes place outside, monitoring of leakage using instrumentation does not take place. However, the Environment Agency visually inspects the conditions under which fridges are stored and compliance with storage conditions minimises the risk of leakage from the coolant circuit.

This suggests that it is principally the south and the west of the country that are at the highest risk.

<p><a name="40915w04.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Forestry Commission will continue to pay the woodland creation grants approved in existing Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS) contracts. These contracts extend beyond 31 March 2006 and include capital grants for establishment, additional grants for afforestation of improved agricultural land and for creating new woodland with public access. A range of premiums will also be paid to support the National Forest, Community Forests, South West Forest and the North West&#039;s &#039;Forest Futures&#039; initiative.

Subject to meeting the technical and administrative requirements of the WGS, grants will also be paid on those applications received before the WGS closed to new applications for new planting, but which have yet to be approved.

<p>
<a name="40915w04.html_para6">
Payments will also be made under the associated Farm Woodland Premium Scheme operated by Defra. This makes annual payments in accordance with the terms of the scheme for up to 15 years. This scheme will apply to some of the WGS applications which have yet to be approved.

It is expected that from mid 2005 new applications for grant aid will be accepted by the Forestry Commission for woodland creation under the English Woodland Grant Scheme.

 The force structure changes detailed in the &quot;Future Capabilities&quot; paper that was published in July 2004 (Cm 6269) will provide a broad spectrum of capabilities to ensure that the UK is capable of conducting limited national operations, or of being the lead or framework nation for coalition operations at small and medium scale where the US is not participating.

<p><a name="40915w10.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 Under the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, a number of countries have undertaken to consolidate and secure collections of pathogenic material in the Russian Federation and other countries of the Former Soviet Union. In the biological area the UK has given priority to the risks of proliferation of scientific expertise rather than materials.

<p><a name="40915w10.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence has a bilateral Defence Relations Activity Programme designed among other objectives to facilitate appropriate military reform. Key elements are:

</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para4">
<i>Military to Military Co-operation</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para5">
The Naval programme has established affiliations between UK and Russian counterparts and progressed into exercises conducted by both ships and training establishments. Army co-operation has covered specific activities of UK expertise, including countering Improvised Explosive Devices and Peace Support Operations. It is intended to advance this programme through the development of unit affiliations leading to field exercises in the peace support arena.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para6">
<i>The Russian Resettlement Project</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para7">
Trains members of the Russian armed forces in skills that will assist them in finding civilian employment following discharge. Since 1995, we have trained 20,800 former members of the Russian armed forces, of which 70 per cent. have found gainful employment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para8">
<i>The Arctic Military Environmental Co-operation (AMEC) Agreement</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para9">
The Arctic Military Environmental Co-operation (AMEC) Agreement between Norway, USA, Russia and UK aims to deal with the legacy of Soviet military equipment and ameliorate its impact on the Arctic environment. Since joining in 2003, the UK has become involved in a range of projects, including the dismantling and stabilisation of nuclear powered submarines and surface ships.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para10">
<i>Financial Reform</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para11">
The Russian MOD requested advice on financial control in the military, which was delivered via in-depth briefings at the MOD to Deputy Defence Minister Kudelina in early 2004.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para12">
<i>NATO-Russia Council (NRC)</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w10.html_para13">
The UK also supports Russian military reform as a member of the NRC, which facilitates engagement between the 26 member states of NATO and Russia. It provides a forum for discussion of key issues, including defence reform.

<p><a name="40915w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is regulator of the public examinations system. It oversees the work of the examinations awarding bodies, to ensure that their administration, marking and awarding procedures run smoothly. Awarding bodies are independent organisations and, as such, Ministers have no powers to intervene in their actions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w11.html_para1">
The QCA does expect awarding bodies to offer a broad portfolio of qualifications, but cannot insist on them offering specific subjects. QCA can, however, insist that the awarding bodies give sufficient notice to centres and give support to centres in finding suitable alternative qualifications. In this instance the QCA felt that appropriate notice had been given by AQA to drop its GCSE Archaeology specification and, considering the fact that most candidates were post-16 (there were only 92 pre-16 candidates for GCSE archaeology in 2003), the AS qualification seemed a suitable alternative.

<p><a name="40915w11.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 July 2004]:</i> The Department provides funding for schools and their pupils aged 3&#150;15, other education services, Children, Young People and Family Services, and the Youth Service, in the Isle of Thanet and Canterbury City, through Kent county council and local partnerships. In 2004&#150;05, Kent county council and local partnerships in the county receive funding from the Department through the funding streams set out as follows. Schools can already spend most of these funds in any way they choose and we will be working with schools and local authorities to take further steps to rationalise funding streams, including a Single Improvement Grant.

Notes:<br>

1. Average additional State Pension figures are derived from a 5 per cent. sample of DWP administrative data taken at March in each year.<br>

2. State Pension is calculated as the maximum rate of basic State Pension plus the average amount of additional State Pension in payment for recently retired men aged 65 and women aged 60. Weekly rates are shown.<br>

3. The real value of Retirement Pension is calculated by uprating the cash value in April of each year to April 2004 prices. In each year the April increase in basic State Pension is related to the increase in the Retail Price Index in the year to the previous September. In most years the increase in the Retail Price Index in the year to April is not exactly the same as the increase in the year to the previous September. Measuring the real value of BSP in April inevitably appears to show some small reductions or increases that would not appear if the new level of basic State Pension were introduced in September. These small variations do not affect pensioner living standards as any differences in inflation are automatically reflected in the following year&#039;s uprating.<br>

 There is no such thing as a state retirement age; many employers choose to set a retirement age for their employees typically at 60 or 65. The Government are currently consulting with key stakeholders on the future of retirement age in light of the 2006 age legislation, and will consider the effects of their final decision on individuals and employers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w15.html_para7">
The state pension age, the age at which an individual may receive their state pension is currently 65 for men and 60 for women. As announced in the 2002 Pensions Green Paper &quot;Simplicity Security and Choice: Working and saving for retirement&quot;, the Government have no plans to increase the state pension age beyond 65. Our aim is to provide the choice and opportunity for all individuals to work longer if they wish and to retire at a point that best suits their circumstances. A number of new measures to support this approach were introduced in the 2002 Pensions Green Paper.

As we are not planning to increase state pension age beyond 65 we have not conducted nor commissioned the specific research raised in the question. However, DWP research report 182 &quot;Working after State Pension Age: Quantitative Analysis&quot; finds that those choosing to work beyond state pension age are much more likely than those not working to report excellent or very good health status. The findings from this report also indicate that those remaining in work beyond state pension age were as least as likely to maintain good health status as all other groups, and found some limited evidence that work could lead to improvements in health status. A copy of the report is available in the Library.

 Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that at 30 June 2004 2,042,864 stakeholder pensions had been sold since their introduction in April 2001. Official figures for the 2002&#150;03 tax year confirm that 98 per cent. of sales have been to people in work and that the majority of stakeholder pensions are being bought by those on modest incomes; over three-quarters (860,000) of stakeholder pension plans with contributions in them in that year were for workers earning under &#163;30,000 a year and around two-thirds (660,000) were for those workers earning under &#163;20,000 a year. Stakeholder pensions are now an established product and provide an important route for people to save for their retirement.

In total just over 500,000 employers offer their employees access to a stakeholder pension scheme. Of those around 270,000 employers have designated a stakeholder pension scheme as required by law. The remainder do so voluntarily, for example as additional or optional pension provision where a company pension scheme is in place. Many more employees now have access to a good value pension arrangement through their place of work irrespective of their position in the company.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40915w16.html_para1">
The Employers Pension Provision 2003 survey indicates that around three quarters of employer designated schemes have no members. Research shows that an employer contribution is the most important factor in encouraging pension take-up by employees. Where there is an employer contribution, average take-up by the workforce is around 70 per cent.; compared with 13 per cent. where there is no employer contribution. We will continue to work with employers so they are aware of the important role they play in helping their employees provide for their retirement. Through our Informed Choice Programme we have a range of measures to encourage work place savings. Our initiatives will make it easier for employers to promote good schemes in the workplace, will extend the issue of combined forecasts of State, personal and occupational pension showing projected entitlement and establish the best ways of ensuring that their employees are provided with a decent standard of pension information through the workplace.

From April 2005 the stakeholder pension will become part of the Sandler stakeholder suite of savings products. The new structure will enable providers to market stakeholder pensions more actively and it will also be possible for firms to provide advice to more people. It will continue to offer a good deal for the consumer. Stakeholder pensions are part of our wider plans to help people to save for a decent income in retirement. These include our Informed Choice Programme, The Employer Task Force and the Pension Commission, all of which will assist in increasing private pension access and provision.

The Health and Safety Executive has therefore developed a best practice approach to help employers and managers, in partnership with their employees and their representatives, to proactively manage long-term sickness absence and help those who are absent from work due to sickness. In addition, existing occupational health services also have a role in promoting a return to work after an accident has occurred. NHS Plus, a network of occupational health departments in the NHS, provides such services, which are particularly focused on small and medium sized enterprises.

 There has been significant progress in removing inequality. This includes the comprehensive public health strategy, &quot;Investing for Health&quot;, which has set an ambitious cross-governmental agenda to improve health and well-being and reduce health inequalities.

Patients who develop infection will have samples taken as part of their clinical care but trusts will also carryout screening for MRSA infection and colonisation. The NHS is recommended to use the report of a working party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the Hospital Infection Society, and the Infection Control Nurses Association, published in 1998. This gives guidance on which patients should be screened for infection or colonisation by MRSA but policies will need to take account of local circumstances.
