 Since 2004, the Army has sought to obtain a recruit's medical records on arrival at the Phase 1 Training establishment, together with a completed medical questionnaire during the recruiting process, from the recruit's GP. No formal evaluation of this policy was conducted in 2007. However the Army considers this to be a highly effective way of helping to identify particularly vulnerable recruits during the recruiting process and at the very start of basic training. As a result the Army has been able to ensure that recruits have the appropriate support throughout their time in the Army training system.

 Stations are awarded Secure Station status for a two year period once they have met the required scheme accreditation standards on station design, station management, crime management and passenger perceptions. After this two year period, stations can seek reaccreditation under the scheme. The vast majority of accredited stations seek and obtain re-accreditation.</p>

Six such stations have achieved full accreditation in this way.</p>

It provides people on bail and on Home Detention Curfew with private, rented accommodation in small houses and flats with up to five people sharing. It is not our practice to disclose the addresses as these are the private homes of those provided with the accommodation. If an address does become public ClearSprings and NOMS will consider the risks to the occupants and to the public, consulting the police and other agencies as appropriate, and take such action as is considered appropriate. Local authorities are consulted by ClearSprings about the locations of properties. The Department has not issued guidance to local authorities about the disclosure of addresses. However, in its communication with local authorities in July 2008, ClearSprings asked that they respect the private nature of the houses and share address information on a &#145;need to know&#146; basis only.</p>

The Offender Management Implementation Manual places a clear responsibility on staff, offender managers in the community and offender supervisors in prisons, to ensure that IPP prisoners understand the sentence they have received. The Implementation Manual was accompanied by a further information leaflet for prisoners.</p>

 The Government recognise the risk of radicalisation in prisons, just as there are risks in the wider community.

Its programme of work includes gathering intelligence and establishing a clear national picture of the risk; training and awareness-raising for staff; support for Muslim chaplains in their work with those vulnerable to radicalisation; and work to research and develop appropriate interventions.</p>

 There are two statistical counts of persistent offenders used in the Criminal Justice System.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_473"><a name="81029w0007.htm_para19"><a name="08102958000559">The first count is of Persistent Young Offenders (PYOs). A PYO is a young person aged 10 to 17 who has been sentenced guilty of recordable offences on three or more separate occasions, and within three years of the last of these is arrested by the police for a further recordable offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="81029w0007.htm_para20"><a name="08102958000560">During the three month period from April to June 2008, there were 7,389 criminal court cases across England and Wales in which PYOs were found guilty and sentenced. Of these, 292 were in Lancashire. Within East Lancashire, there were 59 and 48 cases respectively in the &#147;Eastern&#148; and &#147;Pennine&#148; Base Control Unit (BCU) police areas during the same period. Further information on PYOs can be found on the Ministry of Justice website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="81029w0007.htm_para21"><a name="08102958000561">The second is for Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPOs). The PPO programme tackles a small hard-core of offenders (not confined to any age group) who commit a disproportionate amount of crime, and cause disproportionate damage to their communities. It is a crime reduction programme with a reducing re-offending focus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="81029w0007.htm_para22"><a name="08102958000562">Data from the PPO scheme performance framework indicated that at the end of March 2008 there were a total of 11,296 PPOs being managed in England and Wales, of whom 305 were in Lancashire. In the East Lancashire area (encompassing for this purpose the local authorities of Burnley, Hyndburn and Pendle) there were 99 offenders being managed as PPOs.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice if he will provide guidance to sentencers on the appropriate use of sentences of imprisonment for public protection for offenders with mental health problems; and if he will ensure that such offenders who need treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983 are provided with hospital orders.

 Sentencing is an independent function and judges and magistrates are responsible for making decisions in individual cases, which are governed by the statutory framework laid down by Parliament. Responsibility for issuing sentencing guidelines rests with the Sentencing Guidelines Council, not the Government. The Council was set up under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and is an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice. The Council's guide for sentencers and practitioners on dangerous offenders makes it clear that if the conditions for a hospital order are satisfied, the court may make such an order, even if the criteria for passing a sentence of imprisonment (or custody) for life, imprisonment (or detention) for public protection or an extended sentence are met.</p>

The 2007 Act reflects the continuation of the Government's policy that mentally disordered people who commit offences should receive specialist mental health treatment rather than being punished, wherever that can safely be achieved.</p>

 I refer the hon.

The figures in the study are based on a detailed survey of the services and resources needed to treat infections at that time. This major piece of work took several years to complete. The study is still the best estimate of total resource required for each health care acquired infection and current costs can be calculated by applying standard deflators. It will be possible to provide figures for 2007-08 when the relevant deflator is available. When considering cost-per-case, we consider this indicator to be more useful than one that apportions costs across all in-patient episodes.</p>

However, following a recommendation of the independent Smith review of the Home Office crime statistics, the British Crime Survey is being extended to include those aged under 16 years from 2009. This will assist in providing a clearer understanding of youth victimisation. We know that young people are more likely to be victims of other young people, and we are committed to driving down levels of youth victimisation. Through the implementation of the Youth Crime Action Plan, we will introduce a new national objective to substantially reduce the number of young victims by 2020.</p>

 The Government are committed to reducing the harms caused by illegal drugs, including drug-related crime. Most recently the Government have committed through public service agreement (PSA) 25 to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and drugs. Within this PSA three indicators relate to drugs; one of which is a commitment to reduce the rate of drug-related offending.</p>

Latest figures show that since 2002 the Drug Harm Index has fallen by 28.4 per cent., representing a substantial fall in drug related crime types. As there is some delay in the availability of data which contribute to this measure, we continue to gather performance data relating to the previous PSA using the Drug Harm Index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"><a name="81029w0016.htm_para6"><a name="08102962000520">Effectiveness in relation to PSA 4 is also assessed through monitoring the numbers of drug users entering treatment through the Criminal Justice System. The Government's target to increase the number of drug misusers entering drug treatment through the Criminal Justice System to 1,000 per week was met two months early in January 2008 and we are currently consistently achieving over 4,000 entering treatment each month.</p>

Recent research on DIP found that around half of offenders who came into contact with DIP had 79 per cent. lower levels of offending in the six months after their contact with the programme. The overall volume of offending for the entire cohort was 26 per cent. lower.</p>

 At 30 June 2008, the estimated number of individuals with a record on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) held for all United Kingdom police forces was 4,503,186. The most recent estimate of the United Kingdom population published by the Office for National Statistics is that, at mid-2007, it was 60,975,000. Comparing these two figures gives a figure of 7.39 per cent. of the United Kingdom population having a record on the NDNAD. This figure does not take account of any increase in the United Kingdom population between mid-2007 and 30 June 2008, and is, therefore, likely to be a slight overstatement.</p>

 The Government are helping to meet the challenge of developing and commercialising wave and tidal stream technology and have put in place the most comprehensive package of support measure for marine energy anywhere in the world. Since 2000 over &#163;100 million has been committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="81029w0021.htm_para4"><a name="08102962001206">The package of support measures we have put in place, includes the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's (EPSRC) Supergen Marine programme, Carbon Trust funding, research funding from the Technology Strategy Board and the Energy Technologies Institute.</p>

The RES sets out the wide-ranging reforms of the planning system being taken forward by Government to enable more efficient and timely decision-making.

 Informal adult learning, including personal and community development (PDCL) is highly valued by Government. We have made an unequivocal commitment to sustain its funding, with &#163;210 million available every year until the end of the CSR period for adult safeguarded learning and &#163;153 million for PCDL within this. This year we have also conducted a wide consultation on informal adult learning because we recognise the enormous contribution that this activity makes to the quality of life, health and well-being of individuals, neighbourhoods and wider society. These consultation findings will provide the basis for a new informal adult learning strategy for the 21st century.</p>

 The Government recognise that these are challenging economic times, but believe it is appropriate for the community infrastructure levy (CIL) to be introduced in due course. The development industry agrees that CIL is the right instrument to put in place for the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_680"><a name="81029w0028.htm_para5"><a name="08102969000805">As we made clear in our August policy statement, four particular features of CIL help to ensure it is fit for the full range of economic conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_681"><a name="81029w0028.htm_para6"><a name="08102969000806">First, local authorities will be able to decide whether the circumstances in their area make the introduction of CIL appropriate and at what level to set the charge. Local authorities will proceed at different speeds in establishing a levy and some may decide not to introduce CIL at all. This means there will not be a &#145;big bang&#146; introduction of this instrument across the country. Rather its introduction will be gradual and local.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_682"><a name="81029w0028.htm_para7"><a name="08102969000807">Secondly, if local authorities do decide to proceed with a CIL, they will need to set charges which reflect the economic circumstances of their areas, and will need to subject their CIL proposals to consultation with developers and the local community, and testing by an independent person. Chapter 3 of the August policy statement sets out the Government&#146;s proposals for this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="81029w0028.htm_para8"><a name="08102969000808">Thirdly, the Government expect that charges will need to be kept under review and revised if, for example, changes in land values led to charges becoming unviable. The Government will be considering what procedures for revision might look like, and how they can provide for appropriate levels of both flexibility and stakeholder scrutiny; and will work closely with stakeholders on these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_684"><a name="81029w0028.htm_para9"><a name="08102969000809">Fourthly, the Government propose that charges will be indexed against a measure of inflation, enabling wider change in costs or prices (including deflation) to be automatically reflected in charges. Charging authorities will need to make judgments about how far such automatic responsiveness can accommodate changes in the market; and when a more thorough revision of the charging schedule might be necessary.</p>

 As the Government set out at paragraph 2.7 of its August policy statement on the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), CIL will provide further new resources to support housing growth and the development of local communities. Estimates on CIL's revenue raising potential are heavily dependent on assumptions about the number of planning authorities who choose to implement a CIL and the level at which CIL is set in each area.

 HomeBuy Direct is expected to provide the opportunity for up to 10,000 households to access affordable home ownership over financial years 2008-09 and 2009-10. It is difficult to give an accurate estimate of delivery in each year before the conclusion of the competition to select suitable schemes and properties from house builders. This competition opened on 1 October and is expected to conclude by the end of the 2008-09 financial year. However, we have published indicative figures that suggest that there could be up to 8,333 HomeBuy Direct completions in 2009-10.</p>

 Department for International Development (DFID) assistance is helping the Government of Afghanistan to deliver positive results. Since 2002 the non-poppy economy has grown by an average of 15 per cent. per year, with overall growth up to 2005-06 standing at 42 per cent. The first parliamentary elections for 36 years were held in September 2005. 6 million children are now in school of which 35 per cent. of whom are girls. This is in comparison with 2001, when an estimated 1 million children were in school and very few were girls as they were denied education under the Taliban.</p>

In 2006 alone the DFID-supported National Rural Access Programme improved 9,790 km of roads, connecting 2,800 rural villages.</p>

 The UK Government are committed to work with international partners to reduce drug prices and increase access to more affordable and sustainable treatment over the long term in developing countries. We are working with the World Health Organisation and others to develop a global procurement database that could yield cost efficiency savings of at least &#163;50 million per annum, enough to fund medicines for an additional one million people every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_742"><a name="81029w0034.htm_para11"><a name="0810301000086">The UK Government launched the Medicines Transparency Alliance (MeTA) in May. By disclosing information on the price, quality and availability of medicines, MeTA will help to increase public accountability and improve access to medicines, including HIV treatment. The UK Government have made a 20 year commitment of up to &#8364;60 million per year by 2010 to support the international drugs purchase facility, UNITAID. This will help reduce the cost of HIV treatment. This also includes exploring the possibility of a voluntary patent pool for antiretroviral drugs.</p>

We have consistently and strongly supported the right of developing countries to use flexibilities available under World Trade Organisation agreements to facilitate access to medicines. This includes using compulsory licences, which permit countries to produce or import generic versions of patented drugs.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated &#163;9,935,381 over three years (2008-11) to the Platform2 programme.</p>

Review visits to Ghana by our implementing partners have been very positive.

 In principle, the UK Government stand ready, as part of a wider international effort, to support Zimbabwe's economic recovery if a new administration shows a clear commitment to change and a willingness to tackle the root causes of economic, political and social decline. Macro-economic reform&#151;including tackling hyperinflation&#151;must be at the forefront  <br>

of any reform efforts, as well as reviving the wider economy and supporting basic social and humanitarian needs. There is broad agreement among international donors on a core set of common sense global values which would signal such a change: these include an end to political violence, free and equal humanitarian access, commitment to democracy and to economic reform and respect for human rights. In order to succeed, recovery and development efforts must be led by a Government of Zimbabwe that is committed to reform. The timing and details of any donor conference must be decided by the new administration.</p>

The UK Government are engaged in a range of discussions on recovery with the major international financial institutions and other bilateral donors. Such meetings take place regularly in Harare and between donor capitals. Zimbabwe is also discussed at ad hoc international events: recent examples of which include the 63rd session of the UN General Assembly and the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in early October 2008.</p>
