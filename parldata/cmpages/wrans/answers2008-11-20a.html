The current restrictions, which took effect from October 2006, recognise both a night period, (2300-0700 hours), and a night quota period, (2330-0600) hours. During the whole of the night period, the noisiest types of aircraft (classified as QC/8 or QC/16) may not be scheduled to land or to take off and they are effectively banned from doing so (other than in the most exceptional circumstances) in the night quota period. The next noisiest types (QC/4) may also no longer be scheduled to operate in the night quota period. In addition, during the night quota period movements by most other types of aircraft (including the new QC/0.25 category) will be restricted by a movements limit and a noise quota, which are set for each season.

 HMRC has reviewed all its accommodation to align it to future business requirements, and thereby create efficiency savings and reduce overall accommodation costs.

 HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) work force change proposals for the south-west relate to office premises that are either held by inter-departmental (non-lease) arrangements with other Departments or are held under its 20-year STEPS (strategic transfer of the estate to the private sector) contract with its estates partner, Mapeley, which commenced in 2001. Instead of contracts for lease for these premises, HMRC occupies space under the terms of this contract. The STEPS contract provides HMRC with the flexibility to reduce a proportion of its estates holding without penalty subject to a notice period (usually 12 months). HMRC intends to fully utilise this flexibility to achieve office vacations at nil cost where possible to support the work force change proposals. An assessment of whether possible exit costs may be incurred, whether in the south-west or elsewhere, is dependent on the timing of the specific vacation and will be considered as part of HMRC's wider UK proposals as decisions are taken to vacate properties.</p>

3. Data quality: Work force statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

A copy of the publication has been placed in the Library. Earlier this year the Chief Dental Officer and colleagues contributed to three regional conferences on implementation of the toolkit. Our oral health promotion programme has also included reforming the legislation governing the fluoridation of water to give communities with high levels of dental disease a real option of having their water fluoridated. And we continue to promote the Brushing for Life scheme whereby health visitors and other health professionals give families with young children a free pack containing a tube of fluoridated toothpaste, a toothbrush and a leaflet on oral hygiene. To provide for appropriately trained staff to undertake these tasks we are conducting a review of dental public health capacity which addresses the requirement for consultants in dental public health and oral health improvement officers.</p>

 1. 2006-07 is the most recent currently available annual data.<br>
 2. Time waited (days)&#151;Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. HES also calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
 3. Finished consultant episode (FCE)&#151;An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
 4. Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure&#151;These figures represent the number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) operative procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one operative procedure field of the record. Please note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a &#145;cataract operation&#146; would tend to have at least two procedures&#151;removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one&#151;counted in a single episode.<br>
 5. Main procedure&#151;The main procedure is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (eg time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedure.<br>
 6. Data quality&#151;HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 7. Ungrossed data&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>

 We share employer&#146;s concerns that cutting back on training threatens their future competitiveness. We are taking forward &#145;World-class Apprenticeships&#146; proposals to support and encourage small and medium-sized businesses to take on apprentices. We recently launched sector growth pilots to trial a range of support, including wage and training subsidies; and overtraining trials to expand existing programmes. I encourage small businesses to bid for this funding. We are also encouraging the development of Group Training Associations to help support small businesses to provide Apprenticeship places. And the Department is leading the way on ensuring that public procurement plays its part in driving up Apprenticeship opportunities.</p>

 We estimate 8 per cent. of all apprentices in England are employed in the public sector. The Learning and Skills Council estimate there are 15 public sector apprentices in the Isle of Wight. It is essential that the public sector plays its full role in offering apprenticeships to younger and older people. This is why, last month, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families launched a campaign to encourage the public sector to take on more apprentices. We are setting up a network of ministerial champions for apprentices, which is going to meet next month. The new National Apprenticeship Service will drive forward work in this area.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many and what percentage of people on the national DNA database were aged <i> (a)</i> under 16 and <i> (b)</i> under 18 years at the time their profile was loaded, broken down by police force. [231778]</p>

 The number of profiles added to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) by each police force in England and Wales, where the profile is recorded as relating to a person aged under 16 or under 18 at the time the DNA sample was taken, is shown in the following table. The numbers given for under 18s include the numbers given for under 16s. The figures are correct as at 29 October 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="81120w0011.htm_para13"><a name="08112075000561">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are given for England and Wales as a whole, but not for particular forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="81120w0011.htm_para14"><a name="08112075000562">The table also shows what percentage of the total number of profiles added by English and Welsh police forces are recorded as relating to persons aged under 16 or under 18 at the time the DNA sample was taken.</p>

 Under the Children Acts of 1989 and 2004, it is the responsibility of local authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of any separated child who is assessed to be at risk of harm and in need of accommodation. As separated children at risk of harm, trafficked children become the responsibility of local authorities as looked-after children. They also have access to legal advice, education, medical and psychological support. The Government&#146;s White Paper &#147;Care Matters&#148; and Children and Young Persons Bill currently in Parliament contain additional measures to strengthen the service provision and improve outcomes for all looked-after children even further.</p>

 The UK contributes 7.8 per cent. of the cost of the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) through its assessed payments to the UN&#146;s peacekeeping budget, and also contributes through the provision of UK military staff.

The UK currently has five military personnel in the mission, including three based in Goma and a senior military advisor to MONUC&#146;s force commander.

Local residents and local businesses may make representations or seek a review under the Act as can bodies acting on their behalf (e.g. residents&#146; associations, parish or town councils, or trade associations). Any of these individuals or groups may specifically request a representative to make a representation on their behalf (e.g. a Member of Parliament or a local ward or parish councillor). Local councillors can also make representations in their own right if they live or are involved in a business in the vicinity of the premises in question. I have received no indication from any source that these arrangements have led to significant problems. Furthermore, I think it would be inappropriate for an hon.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is funding the Hotel and Catering Institute in Sylhet, through the Skills and Opportunities for Employment Project (SKOPE). This funding was approved in February 2008. SKOPE is a three-year, &#163;12.9 million project run by a leading Bangladesh education non-governmental organisation (NGO) (the Under Privileged Children's Education Project, UCEP). It provides skills and training to the urban poor that is directly linked to getting a job in the private sector. A portion of this project, &#163;400,000, has been ear-marked to establish the Hotel and Catering Institute in Sylhet. The Institute will be a private-public partnership between UCEP and the Government of Bangladesh. A Memorandum of Understanding to that effect was signed this year on. 1 September.</p>

The Institute will provide training in food preparation and cooking, beverages, reception, and accommodation services. Around 300 students will complete training in the first five years, and this should provide a model for future skills development in Bangladesh.</p>

 We have long recognised that the most visible form of homelessness is that of people sleeping on the streets. In 1998 the then Prime Minister set a target that by 2002 the number of rough sleepers should be reduced by at least two thirds. The target was met ahead of time and is being sustained. On 18 November we launched a new strategy &#147;No One Left Out: communities ending rough sleeping&#148;, in which we stated our vision to end rough sleeping once and for all by 2012. The strategy includes a 15 point action plan which has been developed with leading rough sleeping charities and will use action, advice and assistance across England to prevent the flow of people onto the streets, as well as to support those already there to get off the streets into stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="81120w0019.htm_para4"><a name="08112075001368">In November 2006 the Government announced a package of measures to prevent and tackle youth homelessness. Alongside this we made a commitment that by 2010, no 16 or 17-year-olds should be placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by a local authority under the homelessness legislation, except in an emergency. Since then we have seen a dramatic fall from an estimated baseline of 1,000 in September 2006 to 420 at the end of June this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="81120w0019.htm_para5"><a name="08112075001369">We have improved access to homelessness mediation across the country (including family mediation for young people) and have helped local authorities establish supported lodgings schemes across the country, providing accommodation, advice and mediation services for young people who can no longer stay in the family home.</p>

 &#145;Sub-location&#146; is a VOA description or label for a particular category of property having similar characteristics and which should therefore be treated in the same way for valuation, but may not cover a geographically continuous area.</p>

 Sub-locations are not ranked as such because they are intended to identify groups of property which will reference a particular pool of market evidence for arriving at a valuation level. However properties within them may have different values reflecting their individual physical characteristics and/or specific location factors.</p>

However, neither PPS6 nor our Proposed Changes to Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for town centres, published on 10 July 2008, contain a presumption against out-of-town retail development. PPS6 sets out a clear framework within which local authorities should plan for their town centres and the considerations which need to be taken into account when managing development proposals for town centre uses in specific locations. Our proposals reaffirm and strengthen this policy framework. They refine the way in which development proposals should be considered and tested if they are outside town centres and not in accordance with an up to date development plan strategy.</p>

 The Department introduced legal provisions in the 2006 Education Act which gave school staff new powers to confiscate mobile phones and to discipline pupils for bad behaviour outside the school gate, including cyber bullying. We published detailed guidance for schools on how to prevent and tackle cyber bullying in September 2007, and have more recently produced a resource pack for school staff which includes a DVD and a booklet for teachers. We ran a digital information campaign on cyber bullying last year aimed at 12 to 15-years-olds, and as part of anti-bullying week we are currently re-running this campaign to drive home the message that if young people laugh at, or pass on bullying messages online or with mobile phones, they are taking part in bullying. I have asked the Anti-Bullying Alliance and National Strategies to work with local authorities and schools to ensure the cyber bullying guidance is effectively implemented on the ground, and that schools make effective use of the other materials.</p>

 Statistics on the numbers of all children who are reported as missing, and on the number of children who sleep rough are not collected centrally. However, a recent Children&#146;s Society survey (&#147;Still Running II, 2005&#148;) estimates that each year 100,000 children in the UK run away or are forced to leave home to escape problems. That survey suggests that one in six of those young people will sleep rough while they are away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="81120w0024.htm_para0"><a name="08112114000377">In June 2008, the Department, in partnership with the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government, published the Young Runaways Action Plan. This set out how we will support those who have run away from home or care, draws on the findings of a series of parliamentary hearings, and reflects the direction set by the working group of officials and local government and voluntary sector experts which my Department set up earlier this year to drive work to improve services for runaways. In particular, we have committed to update the statutory guidance for local authorities about service provision for runaways; to produce a resource pack that schools and other organisations working with young people can use to educate them about the dangers of running; and to review the provision of emergency accommodation, which helps those young people who do run to stay safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="81120w0024.htm_para1"><a name="08112114000378">Additionally, the National Police Improvement Agency&#146;s Missing Persons Bureau has been working with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the charity Missing People to establish joint working arrangements to improve the recording, sharing and exchange of information, to improve the way in which missing persons are dealt with, and to inform our understanding of the problem in order to develop strategies to address it. A comprehensive national police database of missing and unidentified people reported either to the police or the charity has been established, and will be supported by a new police Code of Practice on the recording of data relating to missing people, which will be in place in the spring. Local areas will be asked to confirm the extent to which this data is collected and used appropriately at a local level as part of the new indicator, N1 71, &#145;Missing from Home or Care&#146;, which will be in place from April 2009.</p>

The VBS Full Business Case of 28 September 2007 showed set-up costs for 2007-08 and 2008-09 are expected to be &#163;84 million in total, with five-year operational costs expected to be &#163;246 million. Hence, over the five years of implementing the scheme, and vetting approximately 11.3 million people, the total costs will be &#163;330 million. Since the figures quoted in that business case, the costs have not risen.</p>

 For the period from 2000, reliability of the UK National Grid transmission network in England and Wales has been 99.99983 per cent. There are incentives on operators of electricity distribution networks in Great Britain to reduce the number and duration of interruptions to supply over their network.</p>

 The west of Shetlands and west of Scotland represents a potential 17 per cent. of the UK&#146;s remaining oil and gas reserves. Getting the right infrastructure in place to capitalise on this area is of growing significance as we continue to meet the challenge of a secure and diverse energy supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="81120w0029.htm_para2"><a name="08112114001136">No one company or single field is sufficient to drive the building of this infrastructure and my Department established a Government/Industry Taskforce to seek a collective solution. The task force identified a number of options for new infrastructure and agreed an industry sponsored process to test the appetite for third party investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="81120w0029.htm_para3"><a name="08112114001137">An independent broker was contracted to approach a range of potential investors including UK Continental Shelf licensees with interests to the west of Shetland, utility companies and financial organisations. The process closed at the end of October. I understand that there has been interest expressed by a number of licensees beyond the co-sponsors of the third party process (the Laggan/Tormore field and Rosebank field partners.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="81120w0029.htm_para4"><a name="08112114001138">It is now a matter for these interested licence groups to consider the options and establish the commercial arrangements necessary to bring forward development proposals for consideration by my Department. I am hopeful that we will see further technical work begin early in the new year that will lead to a development decision during 2009.</p>
