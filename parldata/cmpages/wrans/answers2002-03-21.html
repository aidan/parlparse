To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library a copy of the report produced by the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down in 1985 entitled "Pyridostigmine pre-treatment and neuromuscular transmission in man&#151;a study using single fibre electromyography".  [43445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Yes. This technical note reports preliminary results and analysis. The full results and final conclusions of the work in which Service volunteers who had been exposed to a low dose of Sarin and monitored over a number of years using single fibre electromyography have already been published entitled: "Single fibre electromyographic changes in man after organophosphate exposure" (Human and Experimental Toxicology 1996, 15, 367&#150;75).

<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 At present there are no definitive figures detailing the numbers of Service volunteers who have been exposed to vesicant agents or all the agents which were used. However, it is believed that some 8,000 individuals have participated in studies which have involved the use of the following two vesicants:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the future of the BUTEC and Rona test and evaluation ranges, and if he will make a statement.  [44428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The BUTEC and Rona ranges are Ministry of Defence facilities operated by QinetiQ under contract to MOD. They provide a comprehensive range of test and evaluation facilities, for which the MOD has a continuing requirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the quality difference between shells manufactured in <i>(a)</i> the USA and <i>(b)</i> the UK by BAE Systems.  [43392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 All munitions, irrespective of the country of manufacture, must meet the Department's same high quality requirements and rigorous safety standards before entering service with the UK armed forces.

<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence by what means he plans to apply benchmark prices to munitions.  [43394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Benchmarking is already an integral part of the Framework Partnering Agreement (FPA) between Royal Ordnance Defence (ROD) and the MOD. A specific Benchmarking Working Group, comprising both MOD and ROD staff, has been established within the FPA and currently uses two techniques to monitor benchmarking. These techniques are comparative analysis and performance analysis.

<P>
<a name="20321w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department entered into a Framework Partnering Agreement with Royal Ordnance Defence in 1999. Long-term security of supply is not specifically defined within the agreement; however, both parties are committed to a long-term relationship and continuous dialogue on matters of mutual interest, including security of supply.

 The Royal Ordnance Defence (ROD) facility at Radway Green is explicitly included in the Framework Partnering Agreement because of the organisational structure of the Company. Beyond this, individual ROD facilities are not specifically included or excluded from the Agreement.

New paths have been constructed at Sennybridge, including one that will permit wheelchair access.

 There is a presumption in favour of access to the defence estate wherever this is compatible with operational and military training uses, public safety, security, conservation, and the interests of Ministry of Defence's tenants. This policy was set out in 2000 in the estate strategy "In Trust and on Trust" together with a number of objectives in respect of access and recreation.

 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) has a formal procedure for investigating and resolving complaints about Service Families Accommodation (SFA), which is publicised in the Occupants Handbook. A copy is available in each family quarter. The current targets are to acknowledge written complaints within one working day and to send a full response within 10 working days.
<P>

<a name="20321w02.html_para2">In the first nine months of the current reporting year, which started on 1 April 2001, the DHE responded to 95 per cent. of all written complaints within the target times.

 No cases of suspected fraud relating to the provision of housing by the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) have gone to court since 1997. However, a case of property fraud has been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for advice, with a view to criminal prosecution. Two additional cases of suspected fraud have been referred to the Defence Fraud Analysis Unit (DFAU) for investigation and may come to court in the future.

the following surveillance commissioners to assist Sir Andrew Leggatt, the chief surveillance commissioner. There are three commissioners for England and Wales, two for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland.

<a name="20321w03.html_para6">The commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the commissioners remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that the commissioners have accepted their appointments. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Government and industry are taking forward three policy initiatives designed to increase the overall productivity and competitiveness of the UK construction industry.
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para10">First, Rethinking Construction. In partnership with the industry we are using demonstration projects, case studies and best practice dissemination to prove the business case for change and to provide practical means by which companies can improve their productivity and competitiveness and clients can demand products that actually enhance their own performance. We have agreed to continue the initiative until April 2004.




<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2002 : Column 452W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para11">Second, my Department supports a substantial programme of construction-related innovation and research. Sir John Fairclough, a former Government chief scientist, has recently conducted a review for us of how we should best provide that support in the future. The report establishes an excellent framework for improving the effectiveness of construction research. We are consulting the industry on how we can work with them to take forward the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para12">Finally, the Quality Mark Scheme, which will enable builders to demonstrate their competence and to distinguish themselves from their less reputable rivals. The scheme will be rolled out across the country over a three to four year period.
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para13">These three closely connected initiatives are being taken forward against a backdrop of continuing work with the industry to understand the various issues it faces, especially in relation to wider Government policy, to ensure we develop polices and regulations that recognise the competitiveness issues in the industry while meeting Government's broader objectives on the environment, safety and so on.

 Entitlement to time off on bank holidays depends on an employee's contract of employment.

They may use part of this entitlement to take time off on bank holidays, subject to their employer's agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w03.html_spnew4"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The Bill responds to the Scott report's key recommendations that the existing export control should be replaced with legislation that:
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para14">Sets restrictions on the Government's power to control exports;
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para15">Gives Parliament the power to scrutinise orders introduced under export control legislation.
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para16">In addition the Bill gives the Government important new powers to control trafficking and brokering in arms, and the transfer of sensitive technology by intangible means.
<P>

<a name="20321w03.html_para17">Lord Scott has welcomed the Bill, commenting that "for the first time in some 50 years there are proposals for export controls which will have constitutional and democratic respectability." (Lord Scott made this comment during the Bill's Second Readings in the House of Lords&#151;<i>Hansard</i>, 8 January column 482).

Other schemes, or their UK funding streams, may need to be or are being notified to the commission so that their compatibility with the EC treaty can be determined. I have received representations from Members of Parliament and businesses about the state aid rules.

<a name="20321w07.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK has played a major role in tackling the unsustainable debt burden of the poorest countries. We led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which was agreed in September 1999. Up to US$100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries. So far, 26 countries have qualified for this exceptional relief. These countries will receive more than US$60 billion worth of debt relief, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. We hope that more countries will qualify for debt relief but substantial further progress will be difficult, as many of the remaining HIPC countries are either affected by conflict or have severe governance problems.
<P>

<a name="20321w07.html_para1">The UK goes further than is required under the HIPC Initiative and provides 100 per cent. relief on its bilateral debts to countries once they qualify, and holds any debt repayments 'in trust' in the meantime. The Government have already cancelled their aid debts to all the poorest countries, not just HIPC. The UK is also the second largest contributor (US$306 million) to the HIPC Trust Fund to help international financial institutions meet their share of HIPC costs.
<P>

<a name="20321w07.html_para2">We seek to reduce the poverty of children, which causes suffering to today's children and jeopardises the well-being of future generations, by working to address the cause of poverty and deprivation in the families and communities in which they live. Support for children's rights to basic health care, education, nutrition, shelter, protection from violence and abusive labour, along with sustainable livelihoods for their parents, is central to our work towards the millennium development goals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w07.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are firmly opposed to any suggestion that World bank highly concessional loans should be converted to grants. The International Development Association (IDA) of the World bank provides very concessional loans which are paid back over 40 years with a 10 year grace period and low service charge. Such loans are highly effective in helping countries to reduce poverty and are complemented by grant resources provided by other agencies. Any move to change IDA loans to grants would undermine the effectiveness of IDA and its future financial integrity.

 By the end of the financial year, 31 March 2002, my Department will have provided &#163;20 million of budget support to Pakistan. Next year, I plan to allocate &#163;40 million. This is a slight change from the planned disbursement I announced to Parliament last December, and reflects the pattern of resource availability in my Department. Our overall commitment to provide &#163;105 million financial aid over three years remains unchanged.

These include the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as a number of NGOs.

 The Government are working to implement the action plan of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in a variety of ways both through out bilateral programmes and our multilateral work. Over the past four years, we have increased the proportion of aid allocated to least developed countries, as a proportion of our bilateral country resources, from 33 per cent. to 45 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20321w08.html_para0">We are supporting the Commonwealth Secretariat's Trade and Investment Access Facility to deliver a range of activities designed to strengthen the capacity of least developed Commonwealth countries to address trade issues. We also continue to work with multilateral organisations including the United Nations and the European Commission to ensure that the momentum generated by the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, on key issues such as trade, aid untying and financial issues is maintained in follow-on international conferences. These include the current Financing for Development conference in Monterey (18&#150;22 March) and the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.

 A "Comparative Study of Air and Sea Access" was published last July. A copy of the report was placed in the House of Commons Library. It identified various options, which have since been under consideration by the St. Helena Government. As part of that process, the views of the islanders have been sought. The outcome has been a majority preference in favour of possible air access in future, as an alternative to replacing St. Helena's dedicated passenger and supply ship. Island representatives have recently visited the UK to discuss air access and will be reporting their discussions to the St. Helena Government at the beginning of April.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what support his Department has given to the British Retail Consortium to <i>(a)</i> establish and <i>(b)</i> manage retail crime partnership; and what contribution his Department makes to the British Retail Consortium annual retail crime survey for England and Wales;  [39863]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 My hon. Friend (Mr. Ainsworth) addressed the launch of the British Retail Consortium annual crime survey on 27 June 2001. I also visited a number of retailers in the St. Leonards areas of Hastings on 6 February 2002 when the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme was launched.
<P>

<a name="20321w09.html_para3">Home Office officials are in regular contact with several retail representative bodies to discuss a range of issues, including retail crime prevention. Home Office Ministers and officials will continue to hold meetings with retail representatives such as the British Retail Consortium to ensure that their concerns are heard and understood by Government.
<P>

<a name="20321w09.html_para4">My Department has supported the work undertaken to establish partnerships by funding development work by a consultant for the past two years. This has resulted in the production of a definitive guide on how to establish and run a retail crime partnership, and we have encouraged retailers and other stakeholders in main shopping centre areas to establish partnerships to tackle retail and related crime. We are aware of the following retail crime partnerships currently in existence in England and Wales and registered with Business Crime Check.

 The principal link for the security industry in the matter of false alarm calls is the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) through their Research and Development Committee. Home Office involvement includes an alarm technology programme which aims to define new ways in which the police service uses alarm systems to tackle burglary and volume crime. In addition, the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office has published a number of papers on the subject and will carry out a study into false alarms in partnership with ACPO. This will investigate the causes of false alarms and highlight the need for best practice throughout the security industry. In the meantime Police Scientific Development Branch will continue work on alarm verification, expanding it to include all of the latest types of sensor devices and audio and imaging techniques.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to deal with the rise in the prison population.  [45391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w10.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Halliday review of the sentencing framework has given us a unique opportunity to examine what we should do to prevent, tackle and punish offending behaviour. The recent rise in the prison population suggests that sentences are not currently being targeted as effectively as they could be. Prisons are focusing on housing more and more prisoners for whom it is not demonstrably the right option. The Government is currently considering how to take the sentencing reforms forward with a view to publishing our conclusions in a White Paper to be published in the Spring. Whatever the population pressures, the Government is uncompromising in its response to serious and dangerous offenders. Where there is a need to protect the public, this should take place in a secure environment. Communities must be protected from such offenders.
<P>

<a name="20321w10.html_para4"> As part of this I am very keen to look imaginatively at alternatives to full time custody, and in particular would like to explore options for piloting intermittent custody and introducing a new suspended sentence (custody minus). These sentences, alongside the tougher and more flexible community sentences we already have, as well as those being proposed, will give sentencers the confidence to explore alternatives to short custodial sentences. Easing pressure on the shorter-term population will enable the Prison Service to focus on providing longer term prisoners with the regimes, training and programmes they need to correct their offending behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20321w10.html_para5"> Home detention curfew (HDC) is a key resettlement tool which gives us the opportunity to monitor an offender during their transition back into the community. It is also a useful tool in helping us manage the prison population by reducing over-crowding at the same time as improving the resettlement and rehabilitation opportunities for less serious offenders. From the beginning of May prisoners serving sentences of between three months and under 12 months, with the exception of those convicted of violent or drugs offences within the previous three years, and prisoners who have any history of sexual offending, will be released on home detention curfew for the latter part of their sentence unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. All offenders not statutorily excluded will be subject to a risk assessment and released on HDC only where it is safe to do so. Under the HDC scheme released prisoners serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew usually from 7pm to 7am. At any one time we expect that this measure will remove up to 1,350 prisoners from prison accommodation, in addition to the 1,800 who are already on the scheme. The impact of these arrangements and any further extensions of the HDC scheme will be kept under close review.

<P>

<a name="20321w11.html_para4">The process referred to by the term is an investigative method which involves sampling from an often long list of potential witnesses who may have information that can be used to corroborate or rebut an allegation of sexual abuse which may have taken place a considerable time beforehand.

Instead the study has identified a balanced strategy which will deal with congestion problems for motorists, but which does so by investing across all modes of transport and in a sustainable way.

 Benchmarking is a powerful tool to support performance improvement, which can be applied in a wide range of ways. One approach is to compare the performance of an organisation against an ideal, in order to identify areas for improvement. This approach has been adopted for he Departmental Change Programme, being developed by the Office of Public Services Reform in the Cabinet Office. Departments will be reviewed against a model of high performance, which includes a module on policy making, to inform he generation and implementation of an integrated change programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many complaints about the quality of ILA learning providers were received by her Department in each month since January 2000; and how many investigations of those complaints were <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> completed in each month.  [37539]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w15.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Information specific to the quality of learning is not collected separately. As at 31 January 2002, 517 complaints had been recorded, expressing dissatisfaction with learning providers and a further 47 relating to general learning provider issues. During the early months of the programme complaints were few and as such, no complaint categorisation system was put in place. The figures quoted are as a result of a system introduced in March 2001.
<P>

<a name="20321w15.html_para11">Complaints received about the quality of learning in themselves do not result in an investigation. Investigations are put in place to deal with potential abuses of the programme.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 1 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 634W. The only Private Finance Initiative with which my Department is involved is a Public Private Partnership to deliver the Connexions Card. Therefore the same figures apply. In addition, since 25 January, my Department has spent an additional &#163;56,183.03 on public private partnership consultants. This equates to one full- time equivalent, and consisted of 49 billed consultancy days, at an average cost per consultant of &#163;1,146.59. We have again used four consultancy firms.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2002]:</i> The Civil Service Management Code specifically precludes the provision of private medical insurance as a part of any structured remuneration package for civil servants.

 Local education authorities receive financial support, through the Education Standard Spending Assessment, for the cost of educating children of asylum seekers in the same way that it does for all pupils on school rolls. The Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant, part of the Department's Standards Fund, is available to help schools address the needs of minority ethnic pupils at risk of underachievement and support pupils, including children of asylum seekers, for whom English is an additional language. All LEAs are eligible for this funding, which in this financial year is providing around &#163;154 million of support.

 On 31 January movement restrictions were placed on cattle herds which had missed a six or 12-month TB test after the lifting of movement restrictions, in annually tested parishes. This measure was introduced in response to a veterinary risk assessment which has shown that herds undergoing these kinds of tests have historically had the greatest risk of bovine TB infection. In addition the backlog of TB tests that have arisen during the foot and mouth outbreak are being prioritised and where possible extra resources are being diverted to carry out this work.

Since its creation in 1995 the Company has for example achieved an expansion of woodland cover in the National Forest area, covering 200 square miles in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, from 6 per cent. to 12 per cent. Detailed changes to the company's operations will be made in order to maximise effective delivery and value for money. A full report of the review is available at www.defra.gov.uk.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]:</i> The Government introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over on 1 November 2000. An estimated 3.4 million households previously paying the full licence fee are now entitled to a free licence. Three million free licences were issued in the financial year 2000&#150;01. 3.2 million free licences were issued between April and December 2001 and the forecast take-up of the concession for the year as a whole is 99 per cent. In addition, approximately 500,000 people living in residential homes and sheltered housing, who previously qualified for the &#163;5 Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary fee, now receive their licence free of charge; we believe this represents the great majority of those eligible, though precise figures are not available.

<a name="20321w20.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2002]:</i> In relation to my own Department, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers and the Departments for which the Attorney General is responsible, section 8 paragraph 8.2.1 of the civil service management code requires Departments and agencies to ensure that staff use the most efficient and economic means of travel in the circumstances, taking into account any management benefit or the needs of staff with disabilities.

<a name="20321w20.html_para16">The Crown Prosecution Service's travel and Subsistence policy already makes it clear that official travel should always be conducted in the most effective and economic manner and normally by public transport.

<a name="20321w20.html_para17">The main principles of the Crown Prosecution Service's travel and subsistence policy are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No reimbursement is appropriate when no extra expense is incurred;
<P>
<BR>
All official journeys must be necessary, duly authorised, and undertaken in the most economical manner consistent with the efficient conduct of official business;
<P>
<BR>
Payment from public funds will normally be based on the cost of the journey by the most economical route and the most reasonable mode of conveyance;
<P>
<BR>
The Department may refuse claims for unreasonable expenses, or expenses which could have been avoided if the journey had been better planned.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20321w20.html_para18">The Crown Prosecution Service grants entitlement to first class travel to all staff at Level C, Pay Bank C2/ Level B, Pay Band B3 and above. This entitlement is a contractual right that forms part of the terms and conditions of service for those Crown Prosecution Service staff members. On a number of occasions, the Department has considered the removal of this right but has withdrawn from that approach because of the cost associated with a buy-out of the contractual right.
<P>

<a name="20321w20.html_para19">Furthermore, staff entitled to standard class travel only, may be allowed to travel first class in the following circumstances:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When required to travel overnight;
<P>
<BR>
When necessarily travelling with a civil servant entitled to first class travel or a non-civil servant travelling first class;

 As part of their review of the VAT treatment of internet service packages, Customs sought input from a range of interested bodies, including major internet service providers. However, this process was not undertaken as a formal consultation exercise, and there are therefore no formal consultation responses available for publication. Customs are debarred by statute form disclosing details of individual taxpayers' or companies' affairs.

<P>
<a name="20321w21.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Improving the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit is a key part of our reform programme.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para3">We are today launching a set of comprehensive performance standards covering the full range of administration. For the first time local authorities will know exactly what it is we are expecting them to achieve. A copy of the product has been placed in the Library and this month two copies of the package will be sent to every English, Welsh and Scottish authority administering these benefits.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para4">Local authorities will now be able to undertake a comprehensive self-assessment against the standards, to determine how far they deliver these benefits effectively and securely.




<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2002 : Column 522W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para5">The standards cover seven functional areas and deliberately address the full range of administrative activity, not just speed, accuracy and security. They will provide a basis for measuring performance in administering housing benefit and council tax benefit, enabling local authorities to conduct a self-assessment to determine their own level of performance and to work in an environment of continuous improvement.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para6">In addition, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate will assess performance against these standards using an authority's self-assessment as part of the inspection process.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para7">The performance standards demonstrate our determination to improve the standard of housing benefit and council tax benefit administration, as part of our wider drive to reduce barriers to work, promote dignity and security in retirement and to protect the system against fraud and error.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's report on the city of Salford council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para8">The report finds the city of Salford council to be a poorly performing authority in almost all aspects of benefits administration and counter fraud activity.




<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2002 : Column 523W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para9">BFI reports finding evidence of good policies and procedures, but these were undermined by inadequate implementation or monitoring. For example, a benefit take-up policy existed but there was limited evidence of implementation.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para10">The report identifies a range of examples of poor administration. This includes an inadequate management checking regime, poor standards for verifying claims for benefit, and failure to process all new claims within 14 days of receiving all the necessary information.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para11">Procedures for dealing with changes to claimants' circumstances were found to be flawed and a failure to apply the law was likely to lead to over and under- payments of benefit.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para12">The council had no policy on overpayments. The lack of quality management information and a lack of managerial or supervisory involvement contribute to poor overpayment recovery. In March 2000 the council's recorded overpayment debt stood at almost &#163;5 million and was rising year on year.
<P>

<a name="20321w21.html_para13">While the city of Salford council had a positive counter fraud strategy and had provided officers with a good procedures manual, investigation quality was found to be inadequate. There was no control over investigations, nor over the workload of each investigator which was found to be excessive.

<P>
<a name="20321w22.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's second report on Kirklees metropolitan council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para0">The BFI first inspected and published a report on the performance of Kirklees metropolitan council on 29 May 1999. It found that the council was performing poorly. Following publication of this first report, the council accepted the recommendations and drew up an action plan to improve performance. BFI's second report finds that Kirklees has largely failed to implement its own action plan and has not fully addressed any of the major recommendations included in the first BFI report. Inspectors consider that the council's performance in administering benefit and countering benefit fraud has got worse since the first inspection.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para1">Poor performance was identified in many areas of benefit administration. A failure to improve the verification of benefit claims; no improvement on previously slow processing times for new and renewal claims; a deterioration of procedure for dealing with the 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2002 : Column 524W</I><P>
overpayment of benefit; and a lack of supervisory management were all reported by inspectors. At the time of the inspection there was a backlog of around 7,000 cases awaiting assessment and 65,000 documents awaiting filing.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para2">On counter fraud work, the report notes failures by the council to introduce and implement a counter fraud strategy and to introduce and implement a prosecution policy. There was also increased potential for internal fraud, fewer fraud staff and a lack of management within the counter fraud teams.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para3">The BFI considers that Kirklees metropolitan council's inadequate response to the findings of the first inspection casts grave doubts on its commitment to provide an efficient and secure benefits system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions when he plans to implement the recommendations on housing benefit reforms set out in the Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all".  [32620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w22.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have a three-stage strategy for reforming housing benefit and dealing with the legacy of neglect we have inherited. The first stage, which is now well under way, is to radically improve HB administration and bear down on fraud.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para6">The HB help team is working in partnership with local authorities to support them in improving the administration of HB. We are already seeing real improvements in administration as a result of the team's work and the on-going programme of inspections by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate. We also want to help more authorities deliver a high standard of HB service by sharing good practice. We are developing a dedicated website to do so and we plan to make available shortly on CD a "toolkit" which the help team has developed.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para7">In April we will publish performance standards for the full range of HB administration. These standards offer local authorities practical guidance on effective and secure administration of benefit. Local authorities will be able to self-assess their performance against standards.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para8">We have already increased HB administration subsidy for the year 2001&#150;02 to &#163;166 million, in 2002&#150;03 it will increase to &#163;170 million and to &#163;174 million in 2003&#150;04. This three-year settlement provides local authorities with stability, enabling them to plan more effectively for the future administration of HB and council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para9">With the introduction of the pension credit, we are removing the need to reclaim HB every year for pensioners aged 65 and over. For those over 65, we will be making awards for five years. The HB income threshold will also be raised by the maximum amount of 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2002 : Column 525W</I><P>
the pension credit savings reward, to an expected level of &#163;113.80 for single pensioners in 2003 and we will treat pensioners' capital more generously.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para10">Introduced nationally from April 2002, our new anti-fraud incentive scheme, puts more emphasis on prevention of fraud, as well as its detection. And we are working to get an accurate and robust measurement of fraud in the system, through the HB reviews begun last April. In time we expect to gain sufficiently reliable information from the reviews of the level of loss in the system to be able to measure progress against an agreed target.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para11">The second stage, which is already beginning, is to restructure rents. This is an essential prerequisite to the third stage of reform, instituting fundamental changes to the structure of HB. Fundamental reform of HB has to be built on the platform of the first two stages if it is to succeed, as was clearly set out in the Housing Green Paper.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w22.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Relocation expenses are available to DWP staff in the event of a compulsory and permanent transfer which necessitates a move of home. In determining whether these expenses are available to individual staff, alternative options such as local recruitment or redeployment are considered first to ensure that these transfers are cost effective.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para12">The financial assistance available would normally cover all necessary legal, removals and estate agents' costs. Assistance from a specialist relocation company in marketing homes is also available. On-going assistance may also be forthcoming if a member of staff relocates to a dearer housing, as determined by the use of Valuation Office data, resulting in increased housing costs. All new housing costs are closely compared to those at the original home to ensure that comparable property types are used. These expenses and controls are in line with the central guidance in section 8 of the Civil Service Management Code.

<a name="20321w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 4 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 28W, on age discrimination, how much money has been allocated to the Age Positive Campaign; how many <i>(a)</i> companies, <i>(b)</i> academic institutions and <i>(c)</i> research or lobby organisations have signed up to the campaign; how many workers are employed by the companies that have signed up to the campaign; how many companies expect to sign up to the campaign; how he monitors organisations that have signed up to comply with the campaign; how many people are employed to monitor organisations that have signed to comply with the campaign; and how many companies have been removed from the Age Positive Campaign after being found to be not maintaining the campaign's code.  [41842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w22.html_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2002]:</i> The Age Positive budget for 2001&#150;02 is &#163;1 million and is used to develop and promote the business case for non-ageist employment practices to all employers and individuals across Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para14">Those who wish to actively support the Age Positive campaign do not formally sign up to it. They are encouraged to provide positive case studies and may apply to become age positive champions. To become an age positive champion, a potential applicant must submit strong evidence of commitment to age positive practice. Officials of this Department vet applications from potential champions.
<P>

<a name="20321w22.html_para15">Organisations that do not have in place a wide enough range of age positive practices to be accepted as champions are still often able to provide useful case studies illustrating particular age positive aspects of their employment policies. Age positive champions play a vital role in the campaign. By promoting their own best practice and highlighting the practical business benefits of a mixed age workforce they encourage other employers and individuals to tackle age discrimination in the workplace. There are currently 32 age positive champions and around 50 case studies, although both figures are steadily increasing. The newest feature of the campaign is the age positive website www.agepositive.gov.uk

 Solicitors are members of a self-regulating professional body, the Law Society.

The Government have warned the OSS that failure to make significant improvements in performance could result in the powers to appoint a Legal Services Complaints Commissioner being activated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20321w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The legal profession is independent of Government and as such it is the professional bodies which, in the first instance, are responsible for the regulation of their members. The Government have no current plans to alter this. However, we are aware of concerns about the standard of complaints handling by the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors (OSS). For this reason, the Government have already taken reserve powers to impose standards for complaints handling on the legal professional bodies. These powers would allow for the establishment of a new post, the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner, whose function would be to set targets for the handling of complaints by failing bodies. The Lord Chancellor is considering the OSS's performance against targets and any decision about the appointment of the Commissioner will be made in due course.

The level of funding voluntary hospices receive is a matter for local decision based on a strategic view of local palliative care services.
