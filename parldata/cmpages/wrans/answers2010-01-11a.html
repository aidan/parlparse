The Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority have, however, been in contact with airport operators and airlines throughout the period of severe weather to monitor the operation of the supply chain. The Department has also agreed to a temporary and limited relaxation of the enforcement of EU drivers' hours and working-time rules, up to the end of Monday 11 January, for those hauliers involved in the distribution of de-icer products direct to airports.</p>

 The December Transport Council took place during the recess. I therefore reported on the outcome of the Council, including the outcome of discussions on intelligent transport systems, in a letter to the Hon. Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee. The text of that letter is as follows:</p>
<a name="100111w0008.htm_brev1"><a name="10011118000960"><ul><p class="tabletext">"I attended the second Transport Council of the Swedish Presidency, in Brussels on 17 December.</p>
</ul><a name="100111w0008.htm_brev2"><a name="10011118000961"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Council reached a Political Agreement on a Regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport. The Regulation aims to make bus and coach transport more attractive, particularly to disabled people and people with reduced mobility; and to create a level playing field across Europe, both between operators and different modes of transport. I was one of several Ministers to maintain reservations on the scope, asking for the Regulation to apply only to long-distance national and international services. Some other Member States argued strongly for widening the scope. The Presidency offered a compromise of removing the compensation and assistance provisions from the application to urban, suburban and regional services. This means that the only provisions from which Member States would not be able to exempt such services would be those requiring that ticket prices and conditions must be offered without any discrimination based on nationality or the place of establishment of the carrier, and that there must be no discrimination on grounds of disability or reduced mobility with regard to booking a journey or boarding a vehicle. This compromise was acceptable to all, and on this basis I accepted the text of the Political Agreement.</p>

I joined some other Ministers in opposing mandatory deployment. We only support the further deployment of ITS where there is a sound business case for doing so in pursuit of our transport goals. I expressed the UK view that such decisions should be for Member States, and my understanding that nothing in this Directive prejudices that right. We will continue to regard this as critical in discussions on any future proposals. The Presidency hoped that the Directive could be adopted as soon as possible during the New Year and that agreement will be reached with the European Parliament.</p>

The Directive seeks to facilitate maritime transport by simplifying administrative procedures for ships travelling between EU ports by the introduction of streamlined electronic reporting.

We will seek to see these resolved at a later stage of the negotiating process.</p>

Long-term sick employees are encouraged to return to work on a programme of recuperative duties where appropriate.

 We have just completed a fundamental review of exemptions from the need for an environmental permit for waste operations. Revised regulations will come into force on 6 April 2010. One of the aspects of the review was funding the recovery of the Environment Agency's costs of registering exempt waste operations and carrying out appropriate periodic inspection. Currently, some exemptions from permitting are subject to annual registration fees, while the majority are not. We consulted on proposals to introduce a £50 fee for the registration of most exemptions. The majority of those who responded to this consultation were against the introduction of fees.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with reference to the written ministerial statement of 24 November 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 48-9WS, on departmental expenditure limit (2009-10), for what reason the funding for the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is being transferred to the Department for Energy and Climate Change; and which department is now the sponsoring department for WRAP.

 In Budget 2009, the Chancellor announced that he was making available £10 million to support the development of anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting projects in 2009-2010. Some £8.4 million of this funding was allocated to DEFRA with the remainder going to the devolved administrations. DEFRA and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) decided that the timescales associated with the planning and construction of new anaerobic digestion and in-vessel composting projects precluded DEFRA from fully utilising the Budget 2009 funding in the current financial year. Therefore DEFRA, HM Treasury and DECC agreed that £4.4 million of this allocation should be transferred to the latter to allow it to accelerate the implementation of the Anaerobic Digestion Demonstration Programme in 2009-2010. This programme is delivered by WRAP on behalf of DEFRA, but is funded by DECC's Environmental Transformation Fund. In recognition of this arrangement, DECC will be making a reciprocal transfer of £4.4 million to DEFRA in 2010-2011.</p>

The Government deplore all attacks, whatever their motivation which are engineered by any extremist group. A key element of CONTEST, the Government's strategy for countering international terrorism, is "Prevent"-that is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting violent extremism. To do this we need to prevent people supporting violent extremism and the ideology that fuels terrorism. Part of our Prevent work is to challenge those who support violence. But we also want to actively promote the shared values (including democracy and the rule of law) on which our society and the cohesion of our communities depend. We aim to do this by working in partnership with communities to challenge the ideology of violent extremism and disrupt those who promote it. The Government aim to empower all communities to reject violent extremism. We are also working with police forces, local authorities, schools and universities, and local communities to protect vulnerable individuals from radicalisation.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.

 The Primary Capital Programme was rolled out to all local authorities from April 2009, supported by funding allocations of £755 million in 2009-10 and £893 million in 2010-11. In 2008-09, 23 regional "pathfinder" authorities received funding of £149 million and 32 exemplar projects-20 new build and 12 refurbishment-have already been completed. The programme commits to renewing at least half of all primary schools by 2022-23, and national output assumptions are that 5 per cent. of schools in the worst condition will be rebuilt or taken out of commission and 45 per cent. refurbished.</p>

 The main route by which insulation and energy efficient light bulbs are promoted to households is through the Carbon Emission Reduction Target. This is an obligation on energy suppliers to meet household carbon emission saving targets. The suppliers unit cost of purchase and the level of subsidy they employ is commercial in confidence. Government estimates for the total unit cost of compact fluorescent lights (including administrative costs) is around £1.41, and for cavity wall insulation is around £455. There are a number of variables which impact the estimates for the level of subsidy suppliers employ, including whether the household is a priority group or non priority group customer and whether it is in social housing. For example, for cavity wall insulation in non social housing, estimates for energy supplier subsidy is on average just under 100 per cent. for priority group households and just over 50 per cent. for non priority group households.</p>

On the other hand, they must be thoroughly trained on the equipment they use before they face the enemy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="100111w0020.htm_para9"><a name="10011140001794">We endeavour to deploy complete equipment capability, which is a combination of trained manpower and sustainable equipment. To do this, often the first delivery of a new items of equipment is required for training to ensure the best effect is achieved from the new capability once deployed. That said, there can be occasions, particularly with less complex equipments, when it makes sense to strike a different balance and train in theatre.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) delivers more humanitarian assistance through the World Food Programme (WFP) than through any other agency.</p>

The WFP plays an important role in emergency logistics, preparedness and disaster risk management and in fragile and post-conflict situations is often uniquely placed to help deliver effective transitions to stability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="100111w0022.htm_para2"><a name="10011140001867">WFP is also increasingly working to enhance long-term food security.

 UK direct contributions to WFP in 2008 and 2009 were £89.9 million (equivalent to US$169 million) and £81.7 million (equivalent to US$127.6 million) respectively. These are the two highest contributions in the period 2004-09. Our ranking among WFP's donors was similar (seventh in 2008 and eighth in 2009) and our share of WFP's total income (in US$ terms) was almost the same (3.3 per cent. in 2008 and 3.2 per cent. in 2009). In both years we contributed more to WFP than to any other humanitarian agency or fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100111w0022.htm_para3"><a name="10011150000075">Our contributions to WFP take into account the different ways in which we can help protect the most vulnerable. The main reason we contributed less to WFP in some countries in 2009 is that while the food price crisis of 2008 required an exceptional food assistance response, the persisting problems of food insecurity required a broader range of actions-not all involving WFP. For example in Bangladesh we are tackling chronic food insecurity through our social protection, livelihoods and health/nutrition interventions. In Kenya we are supporting NGOs who are specifically working on child malnutrition.</p>

<i> Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Data quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of episodes to years:</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

 The new independent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) process involves the suggestion of topics by stakeholders and collation of information about potential new indicators reviewed by its independent Primary Care QOF Advisory Committee. Potential topics are prioritised by the committee for further development and go through a period of piloting in a number of general practitioner practices across the United Kingdom. They are then subject to a period of consultation with stakeholders before final publication on the NICE menu for QOF. NHS Employers (on behalf of the Department) and the British Medical Association will then negotiate on which of the published indicators will be applied nationally and what the value of these indicators should be. Full details of the new process can be found in the published document called "Developing clinical and health improvement indicators for the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)-Interim process guide".

From mid-2007 this policy has been applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. The strategy requires each prison to undertake regular analysis of the problem areas, consider solutions and provide an action plan to improve personal safety and reduce violence. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety. This includes environmental and physical measures, as well as alternative ways of managing behaviour.</p>

Since David Blakey's report, "Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons", was published in July 2008 good progress has been made in implementing Blakey's recommendations. We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to ten years' imprisonment for the conveyance of drugs, mobile phones or other prohibited items into a prison. There is also a range of offences used to prosecute staff in these circumstances, including misconduct in public office and possession with intent to supply.</p>

Data on this previous measure for the 2002-2005 cohorts were reported in early 2004-2007 respectively. After 2007 the basis of the measure changed to offenders that received a pre-court disposal (reprimand or final warning) or a first-tier or community penalty or were released from custody between January and March.

There are therefore differences in the offences which count towards reoffending. In addition to this, local juvenile reoffending data is based on a one year follow up period with a further three months allowed for any cautions or convictions to occur, whereas the national statistics allow a six month period for cautions or convictions.</p>

 2. Volumes are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
 3. Unlike participation figures, figures are comparable between 2008/09 and earlier years as demand led funding does not affect starts.<br>
 4. Apprenticeship starts for 2008/09 are provisional. Starts will rise by approximately 2-3 per cent.. This revised information will be shown in the December 2009 SFR, and the accompanying supplementary tables.<br>
 5. Full-year numbers are a count of the number of starts at any point during the year. Learners starting more than one framework will appear more than once.<br>
 6. Higher level apprenticeships are included with advanced apprenticeships. Programme-led apprenticeships recorded in WBL ILR returns are included in the above figures.<br>

 Good progress is being made with the relicensing of Sector Skills Councils. The assessment and relicensing process for Sector Skills Councils formally opened in July 2008 with the launch of the Prospectus, 'Empowering SSCs-Employer driven skills reform across the UK'. By the end of 2009 18 SSCs had successfully met the performance standard. In the case of Skillfast-UK, the SSC for the fashion and textile sector, Government decided to uphold the UK Commission's recommendation not to issue a new license. Instead, the intention is for the coverage of this sector to come within the scope of another SSC. The UK Commission expect to make further recommendations to Government early in 2010 in relation to the remaining SSCs.</p>

 By March 2010, 20,000 graduate internships overall will have been created in the private, public and third sectors to help young people develop the skills they need to build their employability. There will be different models for these internships. Up to 10,000 of these places will be delivered in partnership with the Federation of Small Businesses, of which at least 5,000 will receive an allowance towards the cost of the internship. That will provide £100 per week towards the wage costs involved and employers will meet the balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="100111w0036.htm_para6"><a name="10011155000714">These places are being provided through the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the universities.
