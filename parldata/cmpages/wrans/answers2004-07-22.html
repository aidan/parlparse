 Social statistics available for Iraq are currently limited and unreliable. DFID is considering ways in which to assist building statistical capacity in Iraq and has made available &#163;30 million to the UN, including for statistical support, through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility For Iraq.

<p>
<a name="40722w01.html_para0">
The UN is working with the Iraqi Central Statistics Organisation and Ministries to develop up to date statistics. A United Nations Development Plan (UNDP) survey of Living Conditions of Iraqi Households is due to be completed in November this year and will include economic indicators such as income, day to day expenditures, availability of health and education facilities and access to public services. A World Food Programme Baseline Food Security Assessment, due next month, is likely to produce estimates of the amount of poverty in Iraq.

<p>
<a name="40722w01.html_para1">
In early July, peak production was averaging around 4,500 MW, just above pre war production levels. Progress has not been as rapid as planned, primarily as a result of sabotage and security constraints. High summer demand due to increased temperatures has resulted in reduced hours of electricity supply to most areas of Iraq. Significant programmes of long-term rehabilitation of electrical infrastructure continue.

<p>
<a name="40722w01.html_para2">
Estimates suggest that immediately after the conflict, 60 per cent. of urban and 30 per cent. of rural populations had access to safe water. Considerable work has taken place since the end of the conflict to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of water supplies. There are no reliable statistics of current coverage, but informal estimates by the former Coalition Provisional Authority (South) indicate that, in the south, coverage has increased by 10&#150;15 per cent. since May 2003. Water quality and volume in Basra is expected to exceed pre-conflict levels during the summer of 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w01.html_para3">
The joint UN and World Bank Needs Assessments of last year estimated that of the 70 per cent. of the Iraqi population that live in urban areas, 30 per cent. live near the poverty line. Approximately 60 per cent. of the population is dependent on free food rations under the Public Distribution System (PDS). Poverty in southern Iraq is particularly serious. A 2003 World Food

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is supporting a number of initiatives on developing trade and regional integration between African countries. As part of the G8 Africa Action plan DFID has committed to support African efforts to advance regional economic integration and intra-African trade, including the development of regional institutions. This includes support for the work of the Trade and Regional Integration Department at the UN Economic Commission for Africa, and the Africa Union&#039;s Trade, Customs and Immigration Ministerial Committee.

DFID is also supporting the regional economic communities in Africa to implement free trade areas and customs unions. One example is the &#163;12 million regional trade facilitation programme to help expand trade in Southern Africa, and improve the incomes of poor people by increasing economic opportunities in the region. The programme will cover the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern African (COMESA) secretariats and member states.

The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which are currently being negotiated between the EU and the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries also offer an opportunity to promote regional integration in Africa.

The UK is pressing the European Commission to ensure EPAs progress towards this objective as well as supporting capacity building in African countries to purse this in the negotiations.

 It is not possible to give this information without incurring a disproportionate cost. DFID&#039;s &quot;Policy Information Marker System&quot; does not include specific markers for institutional or regulatory capacity building projects. While a substantial proportion of DFID projects have a capacity building component not all do so. To identify those that do would require examining all projects approved since 1997 individually. Since 1997 over 4,500 individual projects, each with a commitment level exceeding &#163;100,000, have been approved.

All DFID&#039;s development initiatives with a spend of more than &#163;1 million are subject to environmental screening, which is also advised for projects of less than &#163;1 million where there is a likelihood of significant environmental impacts. Where appropriate, screening will initiate a more comprehensive appraisal and assessment for policies, plans and programmes. The procedures, and guidance on the screening process, are detailed in DFID&#039;s Environment Guide (2003), which is available on the Department&#039;s public website www.dfid.gov.uk.

In the last year, the rate of application of environmental screening to projects has almost doubled (from 34 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 62 per cent. in 2003&#150;04), following a review and strengthening of the procedures. A new team has been established within DFID to monitor and strengthen these procedures.

<p><a name="40722w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The value of beef exports from the UK to France in 1995 was &#163;250 million. However a large proportion of this was in the form of carcase beef from Over Thirty Month cattle. Exports of such beef are not permitted under the EU rules of the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES). Trade would also have been affected by factors such as the exchange rate, consumer confidence in France and the need for any UK slaughterhouses wishing to export to be approved under the stringent requirements of the DBES.

Compensation for losses resulting from the ban must be sought by those directly affected.

<p><a name="40722w04.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 As I explained in the written statement that I made earlier today on this subject, I have concluded, in the light of results from this season&#039;s monitoring of the UK element of the offshore bass fishery, that current levels of bycatch in the fishery as a whole may constitute a threat to the common dolphin population. In the course of this research conducted by the Sea Mammal Research Unit on our behalf, 169 dolphin casualties were observed. It has also become clear from our research that exclusion devices which previously showed some potential in reducing bycatch are not currently sufficiently developed to reduce bycatch to more acceptable levels in the immediate future.

Community action to address this problem is needed. We will therefore be requesting that the European Commission introduce emergency measures to close the fishery while more permanent measures are developed.

 No specific assessment has been made within the regulatory impact assessment of the effects on pet retailers selling tortoises.

 The Government accepted 101 of the 105 recommendations in the report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. These are being taken forward through the Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food. However, the onus is not on Government alone to deliver these changes: many of the Commission&#039;s recommendations were targeted wholly or partly at industry, which has a pivotal part to play in this process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w05.html_para0">
We are making good progress towards delivering the Strategy&#039;s objectives, most significantly through implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement in June 2003. The deal will provide a more sustainable basis for European agriculture and reflect the wider environmental and rural development objectives which society seeks to achieve. The decoupling of payments will break the link between subsidy and production, so the farming industry will be free to react directly to market signals, not encouraged to follow the unsustainable production patterns of the past. CAP reform is expected to deliver significant economic benefits for the UK. These are estimated at between &#163;400 million to &#163;550 million a year at present exchange rates. The introduction of the Single Payment means that farmers will be freed from many of the bureaucratic rules associated with production linked subsidies and will have greater opportunity to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 404W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
restructure their businesses to best meet the needs of the market. We estimate that overall there will be an increase in farm incomes up to &#163;150 million which represents around 5 per cent. of UK Total Income From Farming in 2003.

<p>
<a name="40722w05.html_para1">
Enhancing our environment is central to the vision set out in the Strategy. A new agri-environment scheme, Environmental Stewardship, is being introduced in England in 2005 and this includes the new Entry Level Stewardship (ELS). The ELS will be at the heart of improving farming&#039;s environmental performance. It will be open to applications from all farmers, enabling them to deliver what society wants: the sustainable management of our countryside as a whole.

The Government recognise the need for smarter regulation of agriculture, focusing on outcomes rather than processes in order to minimise burdens on the industry. We are working to join up regulatory requirements into a whole farm approach which will reduce bureaucracy. The Whole Farm Appraisal is one of the key initiatives being developed to assist the farming industry in streamlining regulation; this has been successfully piloted and will be launched in autumn 2005.

Customs and Excise overseas trade information does not distinguish exports of fruit produced in the UK from re-exports of imported fruit. Also food consumption survey data does not distinguish UK and imported produce. This makes it difficult to provide accurate information on consumption of UK produced fruit. Therefore information has been presented to show the proportion of the total supply of fruit in the UK that is represented by UK production.

<p>
<a name="40722w07.html_para1">
The main fruits produced on a commercial scale in the UK include apples (where the production as a percentage of total supply was 21 per cent. by quantity in 2003), pears (20 per cent.), strawberries (53 per cent.) and raspberries (63 per cent.).

The milk must enter via an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) where it is subject to veterinary inspection to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and to ensure that it has remained in a satisfactory condition during transport. The checks ensure that all the required documentation is correct and applies to the consignment in question. 50 per cent. of consignments of milk imported for human consumption are also given a physical check which can include taking samples for laboratory analysis.

 Wheat prices rose sharply last year as a response to the lower than expected harvest in central and southern Europe, but have since fallen to more normal levels in response to the gradual improvement in the supply situation and forecasts for the level of the harvest in 2004. In this immediate pre-harvest period, there is a certain amount of price volatility as old stocks are run down and the trade waits for more certainty about the availability and quality of the new harvest. Quotes for feed wheat currently range from &#163;88.50-tonne spot July to &#163;65.50-tonne at harvest.

 There have been four occasions in the last year when automated payments of benefits have been paid late to DWP customers. Some disability living allowance customers received their payment two banking days late on one occasion, and one banking day late on another. The other occasions delayed payments to some jobseeker&#039;s allowance customers and income support customers by one banking day. Departmental policy provides a scheme for financial redress for maladministration. This scheme is available to consider ex-gratia payments for customers who face financial inconvenience or distress because of late payments. This is dependent on the individual circumstances of the case.

 If the Civil Partnership Bill is enacted same-sex couples, whether they have formed a civil partnership or are living together as civil partners, will be treated in the same way as opposite-sex couples in the income-related benefits. It is possible that DWP will realise some savings as a result.

There is very little information about the number of same-sex couples in this country. The Labour Force Survey suggests that there are about 50,000 cohabiting same-sex couples in the UK, very few of whom are pensioners.

<p>
<a name="40722w13.html_para3">
However, there is likely to be some under-reporting, because individuals&#039; reluctance to disclose information about their personal circumstances. Further, the Department does not have any statistical information about individuals currently receiving income related benefits who are cohabiting with someone of the same sex. Savings are, therefore, difficult to assess with any degree of confidence and it has not been possible to include estimates in the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Civil Partnership Bill.

<p><a name="40722w15.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions does not set a target of 14 days for deciding new claims; the regulations require a claim to be decided within 14 days of the relevant information having been received or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. The Department launched national Performance Standards in April 2002, which set a standard of 90 per cent. of new housing benefit claims to be decided in 14 days, but these are not mandatory. In the fourth quarter of 2003&#150;04 (the most recent data available) the national average performance was 75 per cent. of new claims decided within 14 days with 23 per cent. of local authorities currently meeting or exceeding the 90 per cent. standard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w15.html_para3">
In order to improve this performance the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate targets its inspections on those authorities that have the longest processing times. We also provide every local authority chief executive with information as to how they compare against national standards and performance.

2. Figures produced relate to accounts not claimants, a benefit recipient may therefore have more than one account. Figures do not include any benefit payment that is made &quot;in combination&quot;, through another benefit system, such as state pension paid through the pension credit system as a combined payment.<br>

3. Over the counter payments includes order books and giros.<br>

4. Figures are rounded to the nearest 5.<br>

5. Figures refer to pensioner age benefit recipients residing in GB only.<br>

6. Included in these figures is payments made to customers by girocheque. Girocheques are encashable at either a bank/building society account or a post office.<br>

7. Some customers who are paid direct into an account can also collect their payments in cash at post offices through the wider range of banking services now available at the post office. There is no data available on the number of benefit claims collected in this way.<br>

<p><a name="40722w19.html_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 No single source of information gives a complete and reliable measure of work-related ill health in Great Britain. The most inclusive and broadly based estimates come from self-reporting surveys in which individuals are asked to report any work-related ill health they have suffered in the last 12 months. In the period requested only one such measure is available, for 2001&#150;02. For this year the estimated incidence rate was 2,200 per 100,000. A more up-to-date estimate, covering 2003&#150;04, will be published later this year.

 Comprehensive figures do not exist for the number of cases of ill health suffered as a result of work activity by members of the public, that is, by people other than workers.

<p><a name="40722w19.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) will not be setting a maximum working temperature, as, due to the diversity of workplaces and work activities, it would be impractical to do so. Temperature is but one of a range of environmental and personal factors that thermal comfort in the workplace is dependant upon. Other factors include ventilation, humidity, radiant temperature, clothes worn, and the type of work involved.

 As set out in the Butler Report, intelligence and information from a wide range of other sources, especially from UNMOVIC, demonstrated that there were false statements and omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq.

<p><a name="40722w21.html_spmin6"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The UK remains committed to building a stable, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which set up the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to help establish an autonomous, self-governing Kosovo. Free and democratic elections were held in 2001 which resulted in the formation of a Provisional Kosovo Government (PISG). In November 2003, the UNSC set out key standards that the PISG needed to reach for a process on final status to begin. The UN Secretary General, consulting the Contact Group, will assess progress in a formal review in 2005.

The underlying causeof death is most often the disease or injury which led them to be admitted to hospital, rather than the MRSA which may have complicated the course of the illness. Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation on the completion of death certificates requires only those conditions that contribute directly to death to be recorded.</p>

<p><a name="40722w23.html_wqn4"><b> Adam Price: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what checks are carried out to ensure that compensation in cases of pension mis-selling are equivalent to reinstatement of the original pension scheme.  [185767]</p>








<p><a name="40722w23.html_spnew3"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 I understand from the FSA that in the case of pension compensation cases which are part of the formal Pensions Review, recompense is not normally payable in the form of cash but by addition to the individual&#039;s pension. The term &quot;redress&quot; is apposite rather than the term &quot;compensation&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w23.html_para4">
Where a loss has been caused by non-compliant advice and reinstatement into the original pension scheme is available at fair cost, then an offer of reinstatement must be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w23.html_para5">
Otherwise, the normal method of redress is by topping-up the individual&#039;s personal pension. The value of pension and other benefits that would have been available from the original pension scheme, is compared with that from the personal pension after allowing for any relevant differences in the individual&#039;s pension contributions. The shortfall in value is added to the personal pension as redress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w23.html_para6">
As the level of benefits and risks differ between pension arrangements the method of working out the value of benefits needs to allow for this. Under the Pensions Review, which reviewed sales of personal pensions between 29 April 1988 and 30 June 1994, and which is now virtually complete save for relatively few difficult cases, the following method and checks applied:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To ensure that benefits provided by the personal pensions were equivalent in value to those provided by the original pension scheme, the method of valuation was specified in regulatory provisions using actuarial methodology together with assumptions about future investment return, inflation and longevity.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">These assumptions were based on independent actuarial advice, confirmed by the actuarial profession and regularly reviewed.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Where other assumptions were needed about the individual&#039;s particular situation, either standard amounts were specified in the regulator&#039;s provisions or sufficiently important assumptions were required to be disclosed to the individual so that he or she could question them and provide further information if available.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Firms were required to confirm that the redress complied with the regulatory provisions for each case and also to carry out audits of their review process and results.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In addition, firms were subject to supervisory checks by the regulators.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">If a consumer was not content with the offer made and was unable to resolve his or her concerns with the firm, he or she had the right to complain to the relevant Ombudsman, the normal time scales for complaints having been waived.</p>
</ul>
<p>

The European Commission estimates that in the 10 years after 1992 the internal market created 2.5 million jobs in the EU and increased its GDP by &#8364;877 billion. This amounts to an average &#8364;5,700 of extra income per household (source: European Commission (2002) &quot;The Internal Market&#151;10 Years without Frontiers&quot;). In addition to increased jobs and prosperity, the Commission report points to benefits to consumers from the increased choice, price competition, and product quality and innovation in the world&#039;s largest single market. For example, according to a Commission survey, 80 per cent. of EU citizens believed that the internal market has led to wider choice and 67 per cent. that it had led to improved quality.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn0"><b> Ian Lucas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to make it easier to open a Post Office Card Account.  [184888]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The design and management of the Post Office card account is an operational matter for the Post Office. I understand from the company that the application process is as simple as possible within the legal and regulatory requirements for the banking industry. I also understand that the account opening process is no more onerous than that for a bank account with a financial institution. We have not seen any real evidence that the process for opening a Post Office card account is difficult. Already, over 2.8 million card accounts have been opened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w33.html_para0">
While there has been no problem with the opening of the account, the Government have identified a problem that too many customers were failing to pass on their Post Office card account details to DWP or the Inland Revenue, so making it impossible for those Departments to pay money into the new account. Having identified the problem, solutions are being put in place, including the creation of a pre-populated bank account details form (with the account number, sort code and mandate for the spending Department to credit the account) which will be given to customers at

their local post office when they collect their card. By signing the forms there and then customers can start receiving benefits into their card account much quicker.


</p>







<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Peter Duncan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) how many applications for Post Office card accounts have been completed and returned, but not yet processed and approved;  [186255]

</p>



<p>(2) how many applications for Post Office card accounts have been rejected owing to errors on the application form.  [186256]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The operation and management of the Post Office card account is a matter for Post Office Ltd. and I have therefore asked the Chief Executive to reply direct to the hon. Member.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn2"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what specific fuel will be used by the biomass energy industry to produce electricity or heat for domestic consumption.  [185843]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The biomass industry will use a range of fuels for production of energy&#151;including all of those eligible for the Renewables Obligation such as straw, willow, miscanthus and forestry residues.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government have set a target that 10 per cent. of electricity supply in the UK will come from renewables by 2010 and an aspiration to double this by 2020. The Government does not set targets for contributions from individual renewable resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w33.html_para1">
However the Renewables Innovation Review indicated a practical potential for biomass of some six per cent. of electricity supply by 2020 based on a range of assumptions

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her assessment of the <i>(a)</i> resource implications and <i>(b)</i> environmental impacts of the movement of biomass over to fuel large power stations is.  [185846]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b>

<a name="40722w33.html_para2">
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution made an assessment of the carbon dioxide associated with biomass production and transport in their recent report on Biomass as a Renewable Energy Source. Total life cycle emissions from biomass remain low compared to fossil-fuel fired power plant.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of imports into the UK were from Brazil in 2003&#150;04.  [184183]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 In 2003 Brazil accounted for 0.62 per cent. of the UK&#039;s total imports of goods. In the first five months of 2004, Brazil accounted for 0.63 per cent.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the UK policy is on the Brazilian production of generic AIDS drugs to prevent the spread of AIDS; and what assessment has been made of their use in Africa.  [184187]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 508W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines&#151;through affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems and the rational selection and use of drugs&#151;in the developing world. Our policy paper, &quot;Increasing access to essential medicines in the developing world: UK Government policy and plans&quot;, was published on 30 June and copies are available in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w33.html_para4">
Brazil is one of a number of developing countries whose generic drug manufacturing capacity is sufficient to allow manufacture of their own HIV/AIDS drugs. Brazil has close links with a number of countries in Africa. The UK Government have made no specific assessment of the use of Brazilian AIDS drugs in Africa.

<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 In 2003, UK exports to Brazil and UK imports from Brazil of manufactured goods (defined as Divisions 5 to 8 of the Standard International Trade Classification) were worth &#163;784 million and &#163;669 million respectively. The two most important sectors by value for UK exports were medicinal and pharmaceutical products and power generating machinery and equipment. For Brazilian exports to the UK, the two most important sectors were power generating equipment and machinery and cork and wood manufactures (excluding furniture).

<p><a name="40722w33.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many business failures there have been in each year since 1997.  [185511]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The following table shows the number of company and individual insolvencies in each year from 1997 to 2003. While company insolvencies are all known to be business failures, individual insolvencies also include consumer insolvencies. For bankruptcies, a breakdown into &quot;self-employed&quot; (small businesses) and &quot;other individuals&quot; is available, although a similar breakdown is not available for individual voluntary arrangements (IVA&#039;s). For this reason it is not possible to separate all business failures from the total individual insolvencies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether her Department has made an assessment of the cost to small businesses of changes to employment legislation introduced since 1997.  [185543]</p>








<p><a name="40722w33.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The DTI estimates the potential impact on small businesses of changes to employment legislation in its Regulatory Impact Assessments. Summing these estimated costs to all businesses of employment legislation introduced since 1997, produces a figure of &#163;5.1 to &#163;5.6 billion a year of policy costs (such as the cost to employers of paying the national minimum wage), but just &#163;32 to &#163;39 million per year of on-going &#039;implementation&#039; costs (the administrative or &#039;red-tape&#039; costs). Small firms might account for &#163;1.5 to &#163;1.6 billion of the policy costs and &#163;9 to &#163;11 million of implementation costs. At the same time, it should be remembered that there are very significant benefits to small firms associated with these changes to employment legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w33.html_para5">
The DTI has also commissioned research into what the effects on small firms of changes to employment legislation have been. The impact of employment legislation on small firms: a case study analysis, by Paul Edwards, Monder Ram and John Black, 2003 for the DTI, found that &quot;the impact on firms appears generally to remain relatively small.&quot;

The Government are working with the Overseas Territories to implement the Export Control Act by the end of the year. In the absence of centrally kept records, an estimate of the exports of defence equipment from the Overseas Territories would be meaningless, and liable to be misconstrued as an official figure.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to use <i>(a)</i> private finance initiative and <i>(b)</i> public private partnership mechanisms to decommission nuclear submarines.  [184663]</p>









<p><a name="40722w39.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 There are no plans to use either the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or Public Private Partnership (PPP) to defuel and decommission nuclear powered submarines when they leave operational service. Since 1990 this work has been contracted out to Devonport Management Limited in Plymouth. As part of this process, the submarine&#039;s reactor is defuelled at the earliest practicable opportunity and the fuel&#151;High Level Waste (HLW)&#151;is removed for long term storage at British Nuclear Fuels plc at Sellafield.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w39.html_para0">
We are undertaking Project ISOLUS, to determine storage arrangements for the Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) from the decommissioned submarines, pending a decision on a national waste management solution, and are currently considering industry outline proposals. PFI, partnering and prime contracting are the procurement options being considered. PFI will only be pursued if it can be demonstrated that it offers the most effective procurement strategy.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what assessment he made of the demand for a version of the Community Legal Services leaflet Claiming Asylum to be printed in Welsh, before the leaflet was printed.  [185938]</p>








<p><a name="40722w39.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 Section 5(1)<i>(a)</i> of the Welsh Language Act 1993 provides that English and Welsh languages should be treated on a basis of equality in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales.

<a name="40722w39.html_sbhd10"><h3 align=center>Community Legal Service</h3>





<p><a name="40722w39.html_wqn12"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs (1) which legal suppliers have over-billed for services provided on behalf of the Community Legal Service in each year since 1997; and what the total cost was of over-billing in each year;  [185647]

</p>



<p>(2) how many of those legal suppliers that over-billed for services provided on behalf of the Community Legal Service had their contracts terminated in each year since 1997; and on what date each termination took place.  [185648]</p>








<p><a name="40722w39.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) monitors whether costs claimed by suppliers are reasonable, either by individual bill submitted (for civil representation) or by auditing a sample of files (for controlled work under an LSC contract). At some stage, virtually all suppliers in receipt of public funding will have had their bills reduced, either by the LSC or by the court through its assessment process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w39.html_para1">
The LSC does not record costs in a way which enables them to identify the total cost for over-toiling in each year. Neither does it distinguish between those firms that have stopped doing work because the LSC has actively terminated contracts, and those firms that have withdrawn voluntarily. The LSC may terminate contracts for a range of reasons including over-toiling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w39.html_para2">
The LSC carries out cost compliance audits on all firms who are contracted with them to measure whether the suppliers are claiming correctly on their files. This is an 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 530W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
objective audit where LSC compares what is claimed by the suppliers against what is actually evidenced in those files. Where a supplier is confirmed as &#039;category 3&#039;&#151;the lowest rating under the LSC&#039;s cost assessment audit&#151; the Commission recovers the amounts claimed from the supplier. In 2003&#150;04, the LSC recovered in excess of &#163;7 million from 711 suppliers as a result of these audits.

 Issues covered by recorded messages on the Community Legal Service (CLS) Direct advice line relating to education are as follows: parents rights relating to school exclusion, advice for parents unable to obtain a place for their child at their preferred school, rights and responsibilities of a parent whose child is truanting and advice for students facing difficulties with their university.

 In the Department for Constitutional Affairs including its agencies, (i) at present all staff at Span 3 (formerly AO) and below have a normal retirement age of 65. Staff at Spans 4 and 5 (formerly EO) normally retire at age 62. Staff may stay on under the &quot;short service concession&quot; rule, that is if they have not completed 20 years reckonable service. The normal retirement age for all other staff is 60, although even then all staff may stay on beyond 60 if there are sound business reasons. The DCA board has recently agreed that the normal retirement age should be increased to 65 for all staff with effect from 1 April 2005, subject to consultation with the departmental trade unions. (ii) There is no set maximum age beyond which applications for employment will not be considered.

 Schedule 12 of the Constitutional Reform Bill provides that the Commission will consist of a lay chairman, five further lay members, five judicial members, two professional members (a barrister and a solicitor), a tribunal member and a lay justice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w40.html_para5">
Of the Commissioners appointed as judicial members, one must be a Lord Justice of Appeal; one a High Court judge; one either a Lord Justice of Appeal or a High Court judge; one a circuit judge and one a district judge.

Of the others: the professional members must be a practising barrister and a practising solicitor; the lay members must never have held a listed judicial office or been a practising lawyer; the tribunal member must be the holder of an office listed in Part 3 of Schedule 14 of the Bill; and the lay justice must be a justice of the peace.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what money is owed to the Legal Services Commission; and what the reasons are for the Commission not having collected this debt.  [185046]</p>








<p><a name="40722w40.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) had debts due to it at the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04 of &#163;262 million. Much of this debt (around 72 per cent.) is secured by the registration of a statutory charge against property and is not, generally, immediately collectable. The LSC allows the funded client to postpone the operation of the charge, subject to certain conditions, and the debt is not repayable until the property is sold or upon the death of the client.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w40.html_para8">
Cases relating to the statutory charge have since 1988 attached interest. The rate of interest is linked to the Bank of England base rate and currently stands at 5 per cent. simple interest. &#163;50 million of the gross debt due to the Commission relates to interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w40.html_para9">
Other debts due to the LSC are normally immediately repayable and are pursued by a dedicated debt recovery team. In 2003&#150;04, the LSC successfully recovered &#163;28 million worth of debt. Some of these debts may be owed by funded clients (e.g. unpaid contributions towards funding legal aid) and are difficult to recover given the limited financial circumstances of the clients.

 UK assistance to the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) has increased since UN Security Council Resolution 1279 of November 1999, as exigencies have dictated. Figures for 1999 are not readily available, but available figures from 2001 to UN Security Council Resolution 1493 of July 2003 show that UK commitment to MONUC has:

<p>

In monetary terms, increased from &#163;10.7 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;18.5 million in 2002&#150;03.

In terms of manpower, the UK had six officers in MONUC from 2000 to 2003, now reduced to five. The UK currently has five troops serving with MONUC.

 We remain seriously concerned by reports of religious intolerance and human rights abuses against Christian and other religions in Turkmenistan.

The UK actively supports the promotion of human rights including freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.

We are also aware of raids on premises used by Christians, in particular, prior to autumn 2003, although none have so far been reported to our embassy in 2004. We condemn all instances where religious groups are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned.

<p>(3) if he will make a statement on his Department&#039;s work on the <i>(a)</i> planning and <i>(b)</i> production of affordable rental housing.  [186129]</p>








<p><a name="40722w48.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister set out a radical reform programme in our &quot;Sustainable Communities Plan&quot;, which was published on 5 February 2003, to increase the provision of affordable housing, including through increased investment, improvements to the planning system and the establishment of four growth areas to provide an additional 200,000 homes. As a result of the Spending Review announced last week, the Government will more than double spending on new affordable housing since 1997 up to &#163;2.25 billion. This funding will provide an extra 10,000 social rented homes a year by 2008&#151;a 50 per cent. increase&#151;to help tackle homelessness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w48.html_para1">
The private rented sector also has an important role to play in providing affordable accommodation for those who cannot afford to buy their own homes, the growingnumber of students and single person households. The sector offers a flexible form of tenure to young professionals. It contributes to greater labour market mobility, the efficient functioning of the housing market and to the success of the wider economy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w48.html_para2">
The Government believe that there is scope for the private rented sector to make a bigger contribution to meeting individuals&#039; housing needs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is seeking to encourage this including through consultation on the promotion of investment in commercial property and the private rented sector by removing the tax disadvantages currently faced by institutions. In addition, the Housing Bill seeks to raise quality, especially of management, in some of the worst parts of the private rented sector, where the most vulnerable members of society frequently bear the brunt of some of the poorest conditions and services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w48.html_para3">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Ministers proposed update to Planning Policy Guidance Note No. 3 (PPG3) titled &quot;Influencing the size, type and affordability of housing&quot;, due to be published in October 2004, includes the requirement that local planning authorities should address the housing requirements of the whole community by ensuring a better match between a community&#039;s housing needs and supply. It requires that all local planning authorities must have policies on affordable housing to help deliver affordable housing where it is needed. Local authorities are increasingly looking to the private rented sector as a means of meeting housing need.

A 2003 Audit Commission report on local authority housing rental income found that the performance of rent arrears services had been judged by housing inspectors to be weak relative to other housing services. Based on these findings a number of recommendations have been put forward for improving the prevention and management of arrears:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. Local authorities should have clear, effective rent arrears strategies in place to prevent, manage and recover arrears.</p>

<p>(3) how many late applications the police have received for air gun licences; and in how many cases <i>(a)</i> a licence has been granted and <i>(b)</i> the gun has been confiscated by the police and destroyed.  [179586]</p>








<p><a name="40722w50.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 June 2004]:</i> We estimate that between 50,000 and 70,000 self-contained gas cartridge guns have been sold in the UK. Not all will still be in circulation but because they were not previously subject to control it is not possible to say how many might have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of before the new laws came into effect. I understand from the Association of Chief Police Officers that as at 30 April a total 5,791 guns had been entered on certificate and a further 1,524 had been surrendered for destruction. Separate information on the number of late applications is not available. It is for the police to determine in individual cases whether the circumstances warrant acceptance of a late application. Owners have already had over three months in which to either surrender their guns or apply for a certificate. Those who have failed to do so are committing an offence although the Association of Chief Police Officers have advised that where somebody voluntarily comes forward to surrender a gun which they have only just learned has been banned, it will often be sufficient to seize the gun and not to prosecute.

 None. The alkyl nitrites (poppers) are not controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation.

The new Sentencing Guidelines Council will also have a role in providing information to sentencers, for example about sentencing patterns, which will inform discussions at a local level.

Where a driver is detected committing a fixed penalty offence, the police will decide what action to take in the particular case. The driver may be given an informal warning or issued with a fixed penalty notice or reported for prosecution. The police operate to Association of Chief Officer of Police (ACPO) guidelines advising on what course of action might be appropriate but it is in law ultimately a matter for the individual officer&#039;s decision.

Fixed penalty notices for traffic offences may be issued using one of four different procedures. One involves fixing the FPN to the vehicle. This is normally used for parking offences. The FPN may be issued to the driver at the time of the offence in two sets of circumstances: one for non-endorsable offences, such as failure to wear a seat belt, the other for an endorsable offence, such as speeding. For endorsable offences, the driver has to produce his driving licence at the roadside or later at a police station.

Police may also issue fixed penalty notices for disorder offences. Guidance has been provided by the Secretary of State for police, community support officers and persons accredited by a Chief Constable under community safety accreditation schemes under section 6 of the Act. Supplementary guidance has also been provided on the issue of fixed penalty notices to persons aged 16 and 17-years-old since the scheme was extended to them in January 2004.

An incident is classified as a concerted indiscipline when a number of prisoners collectively refuse to comply with a lawful order or involve themselves in disruption of an establishment&#039;s normal regime. Hostage incidents are when a prisoner or prisoners take another prisoner, or on occasion a member of staff, hostage. At height incidents usually involve a prisoner or prisoners getting onto a roof but can be other climbs.

<p><a name="40722w57.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 We have looked at schemes in other countries but the experience of ethnic minorities in other countries depends on a range of factors which are not necessarily comparable. These include:

We have announced that we are building a base for a compulsory scheme. One of the advantages of a compulsory scheme is that any requirement to produce a card would not be discriminatory as everyone would have one. We have said that there will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand to see their card. Our draft Bill does allow public services to specify how a card might be produced but Parliament will have to approve the rules on a case-by-case basis. There are also provisions to guard against &#039;compulsion by the back door&#039; by prohibiting organisations from making an ID card the exclusive means of proving identity in advance of the scheme being compulsory.

Bichard&#039;s Report, the Government shall introduce the first national police intelligence computer system. Entitled &quot;Impact&quot;, it will ensure that all forces use the same system to manage and share intelligence information. In the following debate, in answer to the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), the Home Secretary indicated Impact could be in operation in two years, building on the Police Local Exchange (PLX) which should be available next spring. In the meantime three phases are being taken forward. Firstly, Impact will combine intelligence and data from forces&#039; operational systems to deliver real data sharing. This is happening as we speak and progress is encouraging. Secondly, Impact will have analysis tools to pick out patterns of crime. Thirdly, it will enable specific police operations, within and between forces, through briefing and tasking functions. The Police Information Technology Organisation is now undertaking a full feasibility study of the requirements and solutions to build a technical demonstrator by next spring.

<p><a name="40722w61.html_spnew14"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 There is no simple way to track the spread of innovative working practices between the private and public sectors of the Prison Service. However since the first private prison opened in 1992 significant improvements have been achieved in the treatment of prisoners, regimes and facilities, staff deployment and the use of technology. The introduction of contestability through Market Testing will further encourage the dissemination of good practice.

<p><a name="40722w62.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Home Office&#039;s National Probation Directorate (NPD) has commissioned one study that looked at the relationship between case management and accredited programme completion in the Probation Service. The research was conducted by Oxford University and it was managed and published by the National Probation Directorate in 2004. The Home Office&#039;s Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) has evaluated it. The published findings &quot;Think First Prospective Research Study: Effectiveness and Reducing Attrition&quot; are available on the National Probation Service website (www.probation.homeoffice.gov.uk).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w62.html_para0">
The research found that good case management was associated with improved completion rates of the Think First programme. Of greatest value was when case management involved intense supervision around the start of the programme, support with personal problems, and frequent contact after completion of the programme to assist offenders in using what had been learnt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w62.html_para1">
NPD is planning to carry out a study to look at the impact of the Think First programme on reconviction rates (an established proxy measure for re-offending). The results should be available in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w62.html_para2">
Also, the Home Office RDS is carrying out a systematic review of the international evidence in what works in offender management in the delivery of correctional services to reduce re-offending. The results from this are expected to be available in 2005.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) will build upon the range of work probation boards undertake at a local level.

 Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction (SPCR) is planned as a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of around 4,000 new prisoners. The study will examine the range of interventions that prisoners receive during their sentence and whether these make a difference during and after custody. Tracking the movement of prisoners between establishments will be an important part of this work.

A parallel study of offenders on community sentences is also planned. Investigating Targeting, Tailoring and Sequencing of Interventions on Re-offending of Offenders on Community Sentences (ITTSI) will explore how interventions work in combination to address the range of criminogenic needs of offenders on community sentences. It will track a large and representative sample of offenders; profile offenders and their needs; track experiences of interventions; and evaluate the impact of interventions in combination on reducing re-offending. The research will also aim to track any offender from the cohort who moves out of the study probation areas.

 In Great Britain in 2002, 3,431 people were killed in road traffic incidents, 35,976 were seriously injured and 263,198 were slightly injured. A proportion of these would have involved serious motoring offences such as Careless Driving, Dangerous Driving and Causing Death by Dangerous Driving.

Information is not available on the number of victims of other forms of road use related crime, such as unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle and aggravated vehicle taking or on victims of any other types of criminal offence.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="40722w63.html_para0">
There has been no change in the policy on assessing applications from Chinese students although procedures for processing applications have been revised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w63.html_para1">
Our visa teams across China are working hard to ensure a proper balance between the facilitation of genuine student applications and effective immigration control. They have now developed better mechanisms to identify the increasing problem of visa and document abuse. Visa sections in China have also altered the procedures covering the assessment of student applications. This has streamlined the process and provided a more convenient service to the applicant, whilst reflecting increased concerns over the level of visa abuse, relating to the student market in China.

 The Prison Service has collected its water consumption and cost figures centrally for the period covered by the question. The non-prison estate has only been collecting water consumption figures for key office buildings since 1999&#150;2000, when these figures were included in the annual &quot;Sustainable Development in Government&quot; annual reports (previously known as the Greening Government annual report). As these reports only required consumption per staff member figures, information on consumption prior to 2001&#150;02 was not retained. The figures are set out in the table.

They are also responsible for addressing the service needs of their local communities and developing the workforce they require to deliver services. In commissioning services, PCTs need to plan local services near to patients and ensure that they are identifying the health needs of patients and securing services for them. It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.

<p><a name="40722w66.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The gross and net fees paid to dentists for the provision of general dental services (GDS) represent the main element of primary dental care costs and are the data most readily available by health authority area. Data since 1997 is shown in the table. These figures exclude some payments to dentists such as commitment payments, maternity and seniority payments as well as superannuation payments made on their behalf. There is a discontinuity in the figures for Hampshire and Worcestershire in the middle of 2002&#150;03 because of the change in health administration areas.

Community, personal and hospital dental services have not been included in this table; these are directly commissioned by individual health authorities from locally managed resources rather than funded from a central national budget as is the case with the GDS.

 The national health service is treating patients in better more efficient ways, for example the proportion of finished admission episodes at London NHS providers classified as day cases (where patients are admitted to hospital for a planned surgical procedure, returning home on the same day) increased from 28.8 per cent. in 1997&#150;98 to 31.8 per cent. in 2002&#150;03.

We have also increased capacity outside of hospitals with the introduction of 10 NHS treatment centres in London. Treatment centres separate elective care from emergency care so that it is not disrupted and between April 2003 and May this year, 65,000 patients received treatment in this way.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice he has received about the prescribing of Seroxat to people in the 18 to 29 years age group.  [184292]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 642W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40722w70.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In May 2003, the Government&#039;s independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), established an expert working group on the safety of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) because of continuing concerns about withdrawal reactions and possible suicidal behaviour associated with these products. The expert working group is still considering evidence regarding the safety of all SSRIs (including paroxetine). The group is expected to report on its findings later this year, and its report will be made available to the public with copies placed in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para0">
In June 2003, the CSM considered newly received clinical trial data for paroxetine in children and adolescents and, on the basis of these data and advised that paroxetine should not be used in patients under 18 years of age in the treatment of major depressive illness, because of evidence of an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and a lack of efficacy in this population group. This advice was communicated to prescribers and patients in June 2003 and again in December 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para1">
In March 2004, the CSM issued advice to remind prescribes of the recommended starting and daily doses of paroxetine, as stated in the summary of product characteristics for this medicine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para2">
A Europe wide review of the risks and benefits of paroxetine has also been undertaken by European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), with the United Kingdom in the lead. This review included an assessment of whether some young adults as well as those in the under 18 patient group may have an increased risk of suicidal behaviour when using this drug. No strong evidence has been found to support an increased risk and the CSM and the CPMP have advised that the balance of risks and benefits for paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive illness and anxiety disorders in patients of 18 years or older is favourable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para3">
The CPMP has recommended that patients at high baseline risk of suicidal behaviour should be closely monitored during treatment with paroxetine. These include patients with a known history of suicidal behaviour or thoughts prior to starting treatment, and possibly young adults as a patient group. In April, a summary of the opinion of the CPMP referring to the need for monitoring during paroxetine treatment of patients at risk of suicidal behaviour, including those with a history of suicidal behaviour and young adults was released by both the European Medicines Agency and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para4">
The CPMP review and recommendations are now being considered by the European Commission, with final decisions expected in the near future. When decisions have been reached by the Commission, a review of the evidence will be made public. If necessary, the product information for prescribers and patients will be updated and communicated, with details harmonised across the European Union.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 643W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para5">
The MHRA emphasises that the patient information leaflet for Seroxat currently advises that symptoms of depression, including suicidal behaviour, may increase in the first few weeks of treatment and that patients should seek urgent medical attention if they have any distressing thoughts or experiences during this initial period or at any other time.

 The only vaccine currently used in the United Kingdom routine childhood immunisation programme that contains a mercury compound is the diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine which is given combined with haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. The mercury is present as ethylmercury in the excipient thiomersal (also known as thimerosal). As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA and CSM have thoroughly reviewed the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, on a number of occasions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para6">
In 2001, the CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data as it has emerged. In 2003, following a review of further studies, including two UK studies involving more than 100,000 children, CSM advice was placed on the MHRA website at http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the United States have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with autism.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para7">
On the basis of the available data, the CSM&#039;s advice remains that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions (typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the United States Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w70.html_para8">
There is a global goal to minimise environmental exposure to mercury compounds. In line with this and despite the strong evidence supporting the safety of thiomersal in vaccines, the EMEA continues to promote the development of vaccines without thiomersal or with the lowest possible levels of thiomersal. However, the EMEA acknowledges that during some manufacturing processes, the use of mercury compounds is necessary and in such cases, residual levels might be present in the final vaccine product.

 The funding of medical training salary costs is resourced through a central overall funding allocation that makes no distinction between full-time and part-time trainees. The distribution of funding between full-time and part-time training at local level is the responsibility of the respective strategic health authorities (SHAs). No figures are held centrally for the local breakdown of resources; the total funding provided to SHAs in 2004&#150;05 was &#163;3.8 billion.

This was during a short period when new pay rates for full-time trainees were being progressively introduced and new part-time salaries, introduced in full in one step, were high by comparison; this is no longer the case.

<p><a name="40722w72.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 It has long been central to UK transport policy that users should pay the full costs, including those of security. Organisations delivering training in air cargo security are required to be approved in that role by the Department, and to that end the instructors are required to have attended an air cargo managers course and are then provided with a training

 The principal external costs considered in work supporting &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper were environmental costs, the largest of which is the impact of aviation on global emissions. The supporting paper to the White Paper, &quot;Aviation and Global Warming&quot;, February 2004, reports&#151;for an additional runway at Stansted followed by an additional runway at Heathrow&#151;a net present value of the cost of associated global emissions to lie between &#163;3.3 billion and &#163;5.2 billion.

<p><a name="40722w73.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 Cycle routes are in the main the responsibility of local highway authorities. A cycle route will often consist of a variety of linked highways such as dedicated cycle tracks, cycle lanes on the carriageway and the use of roads designated as suitable for cycle routes. Sustrans, the Transport charity, predict that the National Cycle Network will consist of 10,000 miles by the end of 2005. In addition local authorities forecast building over 6,000 miles of new cycle lanes and cycle tracks over between 2001&#150;02 and 2005&#150;06.

We have a safer cycling programme, which is a package of measures including improved infrastructure&#151;better cycle routes, off road cycle tracks, cycle lanes, advance stop lines, toucan crossings etc., better driving standards by improving training and testing for motorists, and publicity aimed both at drivers and cyclists. It also covers the promotion of measures which cyclists can take to protect themselves, such as taking cycle training, making themselves conspicuous and wearing a cycle helmet.
</p>

We have also recently published an &quot;Action Plan for Walking and Cycling&quot;, which sets out more than 40 actions from across Government to make cycling and walking easier, safer and more attractive, enabling people to get around more by foot and by bicycle.

 The Department has not carried out any formal assessment of the problems caused by cyclists cycling illegally on footpaths and footways (the pavement) and we have no plans to commission specific research into the subject. We are however aware from our post bag that many pedestrians, particularly elderly and disabled people are concerned at the danger and inconvenience caused by cyclists who cycle illegally on footpaths and pavements.

<p>
<a name="40722w73.html_para3">
While we do not condone it, we believe that some cyclists cycle on the pavement because they feel safer there than cycling on heavily trafficked roads. We hope that as facilities for cyclists and cyclist training improve, cyclists will feel safer on the road and that the number of cyclists using footpaths and footways illegally will reduce.

Local Transport Note 2/86 (Stationery Office) concerns Shared Use by Cyclists and Pedestrians. This advises local highway authorities that such shared use facilities are not a general or area-wide remedy to cycle safety problems but should be confined to specific links in cycle routes and quiet footways along heavily trafficked roads. The guidance also advises that shared use may be unacceptable if significant use is made of a pedestrian facility by disabled, blind or partially sighted or elderly people.

Since April 1999, the accounts of the Office of the Rail Regulator have been qualified once. The Resource Accounts-for financial year 2002&#150;03 were qualified. The qualification related to resource expenditure of &#163;0.4 million in excess of the amount authorised for the Request for Resources.

<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The White Paper The Future of Transport&#039; which was presented to the House on Tuesday 20 July by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explains that we are developing new measures of traffic congestion. Estimates of average peak-time traffic speeds on weekdays were published in April of this year in Traffic Speeds on English Trunk Roads: 2003&#039; available on the Department&#039;s website.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 672W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>(a)</i> the cost of the local road repair backlog and <i>(b)</i> the proportion of principal local roads with no residual life as at 1 April.  [186163]</p>








<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Department does not yet have firm enough data to make a robust estimate of the maintenance backlog on roads and footpaths.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w79.html_para0">
The structural condition of roads is represented by its &quot;residual life&quot;. Where a road&#039;s residual life falls to or below zero its deterioration is no longer predictable. It may remain serviceable but needs to be monitored closely to see if maintenance is needed. In the most recent available figures, for 2003, 17 per cent. of English principal roads came into this category.

<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Results of the National Road Maintenance Condition Survey show that there has been a significant improvement in the condition of English local roads between 2000 and 2003, the latest year for which results are available. The Government is therefore on track to meet its target of halting the deterioration by 2004.


</p>

<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 31 out of the original 40 schemes, contained in the targeted programme of improvements (TPI), are already completed, under construction or will be on site by April 2005. A further three schemes are planned to start this year.

<p>(2) what steps he is taking to lessen the power consumption of railway rolling stock.  [182380]</p>








<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 These are matters for the industry. Increased train weight arising from safety and other design features and the wider use of air conditioning and power operated doors have tended to increase the power needs of modern trains. But current and future developments should offset that. For example, future technology in body construction is expected to lead to lighter trains which draw less power and regenerative braking, which produces new power during the braking process, is already being introduced where practicable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what powers <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> other bodies have to require franchisees to maintain an adequate supply of rolling stock of acceptable quality.  [185269]</p>








<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Rolling stock issues are among those considered when the terms of individual franchises are being drawn up. Where a need for rolling stock refurbishment or replacement is identified, the detailed requirements will be set out in the franchise agreement. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 673W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Franchises are currently awarded by the Strategic Rail Authority, though it is proposed that this responsibility will in due course pass to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State as described in his statement to the House of 15 July.

<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 By early July 2004, 522 Mark 1 vehicles had been withdrawn. The remaining 1,200 or so will follow progressively over the coming months. The final date for the elimination of Mark 1s from passenger service is the subject of a consultation being conducted by Her Majesty&#039;s Railway Inspectorate who have indicated that they are minded to approve a proposal that the deadline should be November 2005. 908 new vehicles have been introduced into service.

[185733]</p>








<p><a name="40722w79.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b>

<p>
<a name="40722w79.html_para2">
We are supporting a number of projects to help existing schemes be compliant with the national specifications. The London Oyster Card is one example. Others are the conversion of existing schemes in Cheshire, Nottinghamshire and Southampton and a new rural scheme in Cumbria and Lancashire (known as NoWcard).

[185697]</p>








<p><a name="40722w80.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Department of Transport was unable to establish a baseline for 2002&#150;03 for either <i>(a)</i> road transport vehicle carbon dioxide emissions or <i>(b)</i> single occupancy car commuting, due to the lack of available data.


</p>







<p><a name="40722w80.html_wqn1"><b> John Thurso: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what have been identified as the most significant sustainable development impacts in relation to the operation of the estate of his Department.  [185728]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Jul 2004 : Column 675W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40722w80.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Most staff in the Department for Transport are located in about 100 larger properties while the remainder are located in relatively small properties belonging to the agencies. Consequently, the most significant sustainable development operational impacts of the main office estate are typically in respect of utility use, waste, paper, procurement and travel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w80.html_para0">
On the non-office estate there are also few sites that might be considered to have significant sustainable impacts beyond the typical and these are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Air Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough that handles crash wreckage from civil aircraft accidents and serious incidents within the UK, which they investigate.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency Maritime Rescue Sub Centres and Co-ordination Centres which are manned and operational 24 hours a day and include air-conditioned emergency operational areas, rescue equipment, emergency generators etc.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The 24 acre Driving Standards Agency&#039;s training residential centre at Cardington.</p>

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40722w80.html_para1">
The sustainable impacts at these sites vary considerably depending on the nature of the work undertaken at them but are likely to cover such aspects as biodiversity, estates management, control of pollution, handling hazardous substances or waste and the discharge of water.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>
