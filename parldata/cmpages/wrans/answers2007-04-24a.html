 Subject to certain qualifying conditions, the &#147;Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006&#148; apply when a business or undertaking, or part of one, is transferred to a new employer; or when a &#145;service provision change&#146; takes place (for example, where a contractor takes on a contract to provide a service for a client from another contractor).</p>

 Under the Human Rights Act 1998 it is unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with the Convention rights. For these purposes a &#147;public authority&#148; includes any person or body who is exercising functions of a public nature. Local authorities have a statutory duty to make arrangements for the provision of care and accommodation to those in need of it by reason of age, illness or disability. Individuals that are assessed to be in need of care may be placed in a care home run by the local authority itself, but many are placed in homes run by private providers. Those who are placed in care homes by local authorities (including homes that are privately run) can enforce their rights against the local authority because the authority is clearly a &#147;public authority&#148; for the purposes of the Human Rights Act.</p>

If that is found to be the case, then residents who are placed by local authorities in private care homes will be able directly to enforce their rights against a private care home provider.</p>

 The regulation of agreements between solicitors and their clients is a matter for the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).

 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) extended the deadline for signature to 2 April 2007.

This represents 97 per cent. of not-for-profit organisations and 94 per cent. of solicitors. Overall, 5 per cent. of providers did not sign. There are also likely to be many more sub-contractors who are not required to sign the unified contract, but who provide legal aid services.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 April 2007]:</i> The National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services sets standards for children's health and social services and the interface of those services with education. Sure Start local programmes had discretion on how to allocate funds to meet local needs. Some chose to add to the resources for health services in their areas by employing midwives and health visitors. The roll-out of children's centres since 2003 across England reflects the change from this pilot initiative, testing out new ways of working, to an integrated common approach to delivering mainstream children's services. Local authorities and their partners in Children's Trusts are working together to plan and deliver their children's centres services, reconfiguring services where necessary. The Department cannot give a detailed estimate of the costs of funding commitments under the National Service Framework, as these are funded from a variety of sources to provide children's health and social care services. Between 2002-03 and 2005-06 the Department has spent an estimated &#163;1.9 billion on Sure Start local programmes and children's centres. There are now 1,258 children's centres up and running reaching over 1 million children under the age of five.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 April 2007]:</i> There are currently seven Sure Start local programmes in Cornwall. The programmes opened on a rolling basis between 2000 and 2003 and aimed to reach over 4,800 children. In their first two to three years, programmes were building up their services and did not generally operate at peak levels until the third or fourth year. The average expenditure per child for every year for which the grant was paid or allocated is in the following table. From 2006-07, the earliest programme's grants start to taper to a level consistent with delivering the children's centres offer. We expect that local authorities will be in a position to make savings through economies of scale, for example on administration, finance and evaluation, now that the grant for the programmes is paid directly to them.</p>

 Muqtada Al-Sadr's group have not left the Iraqi parliament. Muqtada Al-Sadr recently called on Sadrist Ministers in the Iraqi Government to withdraw from their positions.

On both election days our High Commission in Abuja, offices of the Department for International Development in Nigeria and other diplomatic missions also deployed observers, to complement the work of the visiting international observers.

Thanks to the efforts of the staff in the screening programme, these targets have now been achieved in all local breast screening units. The expansion is already showing an effect, with nearly 12,000 cancers diagnosed by the programme in 2004-05, an increase of 40 per cent. on 2001 when the expansion began.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="70424w0007.htm_para1"><a name="07042458000132">However, the changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of the programme. We are aware that this has had an impact on some services maintaining the three-year interval for screening and we are taking steps to bring all screening intervals back to three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="70424w0007.htm_para2"><a name="07042458000133">We take the issue of the 36-month standard between screens very seriously.

In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>

An application process was launched for &#163;40 million, administered on behalf of the Department by Help the Hospices. At our request, Help the Hospices established an independent steering group comprising key figures from the hospice and palliative care movement, clinicians, architects and engineers.<br>
This group assessed each application against pre-defined criteria and provided advice to the Department on which applications should be supported.<br>
Of 227 bids, 191 schemes in 146 hospices were approved for funding. There were 36 unsuccessful bids and seven hospices without a single bid accepted.<br>

<i> [holding answer 19 April 2007]:</i> There are currently 311 hospital-based computer systems deployed through the national programme for information technology that are connected to and use the spine. The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients&#146; health and care. It forms the core of the national health service care records service (NHS CRS). It also supports other key elements of the national programme for information technology, such as choose and book, the electronic prescriptions service, and general practitioner (GP) to GP record transfer, each of them using the spine&#146;s messaging capabilities as part of their own services.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 April 2007]:</i> Proof of solution testing before the system went live in 2004 demonstrated that the choose and book system would be able to perform satisfactorily when dealing with the design target for bookings during the peak hour, that is some 8,400 bookings per hour, which is equivalent to 15.8 million bookings per year.

 NICE (National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) guidance is explicitly included in Standards for Better Health, which sets out the Government&#146;s high level expectations for the health service. The developmental standards on clinical and cost effectiveness and public health require that national health service organisations should be making progress towards implementation of NICE clinical guidelines and public health including the guidance on obesity. It is anticipated that assessment by the Healthcare Commission of progress in implementing NICE obesity guidance will be made as part of the 2007-08 annual health check.</p>

 There has been increasing concern from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine can be extracted from over the counter (OTC) remedies relatively easily and used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Methylamphetamine was reclassified on 18 January 2007 by the Home Office as a Class A controlled drug, based on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"><a name="70424w0011.htm_para5"><a name="07042458000721">Although the prevalence of misuse of methylamphetamine is believed to be currently low in the United Kingdom, ACPO are receiving increasing levels of intelligence about the prevalence of methylamphetamine. If methylamphetamine did secure a hold in the UK, the consequences would undoubtedly be very serious. The international experience shows that misuse can spread rapidly when certain conditions prevail and the advice of UK enforcement authorities is that most of these conditions now prevail in the UK.</p>

The evidence to date centres on advice from ACPO and SOCA that the availability of methylamphetamine is increasing, evidenced in part by the increase in the number of illicit laboratories manufacturing methylamphetamine found by the police in the UK. The police have identified in specific cases that multiple packs of particular pharmacy pseudoephedrine containing products had been purchased and used in the illicit manufacture of methylamphetamine. They have also identified that, in part, these packs were obtained from numerous pharmacies to obtain adequate quantities for manufacturing.</p>

Ministers accepted this advice and a full public consultation exercise commenced on 7 March 2007 and can be accessed via the MHRA&#146;s website at:</p>

Further analysis of the 2003 survey revealed that, among 18 to 24-year-olds, those respondents identified as &#145;binge drinkers&#146; (defined as those who drank alcohol and felt very drunk at least once a month in the last 12 months) were more likely to offend than other regular drinkers and non-drinkers. Young male binge drinkers were twice as likely to commit a violent offence than other young male regular drinkers. Binge drinkers were also more likely to commit criminal or disorderly behaviour (such as getting into a fight or damaging something) during or after drinking than other regular drinkers.</p>

In Malawi, where DFID is the major donor in the health sector, with an investment of &#163;100 million over the period 2004-10, a rapid scale up in preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT) services is taking place. During 2005, 5,000 of 7,000 HIV positive pregnant women received a complete course of ARV prophylaxis. In Zambia, we support UNICEF's expansion of PMTCT.</p>

The results will be shared with the EU commission and other member states with the aim of introducing an EU-wide enforcement system.</p>

The first priority though is to design schemes that are as easy as possible to use and understand&#151;and which will ensure high levels of compliance by domestic and foreign vehicles.

This is an ongoing and gradual process, occurring as people have flowed off the benefit, for example through retirement.</p>
