 The Government intend to increase public confidence in their handling of the millennium bug problem by continuing with our policy of open public scrutiny. As I outlined in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) on 30 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>403-04</i>, I shall provide regular reports to the House.

[28202]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80213w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The cladding of the Millennium Dome, which will house the Millennium Experience, is translucent, allowing through natural daylight. The New Millennium Experience Company considered installing photovoltaic cells but concluded that this would reduce translucency and hence increase the power needed for artificial lighting. The NMEC is, however, currently investigating the potential for using a number of sustainable power sources within the Dome for demonstration and educational purposes.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department does not keep records of whether QCs are practising or non-practising, because the Lord Chancellor has no Ministerial responsibility for the practice of individual barristers.

<P>
<a name="80213w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 While local authorities in Wales investigate all complaints made to them by or on behalf of elderly people in private residential homes, there is no clear or agreed basis for defining abuse in these circumstances. The information that is collected is therefore not available on a consistent basis but my officials will work with local authorities to examine how an effective reporting framework can be developed as an essential tool in helping to measure the quality of care provided for elderly people in residential homes.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80213w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Responsibility for determining planning applications for wind farms rests initially with local planning authorities. The Secretary of State is responsible for determining appeals and applications which have been called in. Decisions on all such applications should be made in accordance with Government Policy set out in Planning Guidance (Wales): Planning Policy, Technical Advice Note (Wales) 8: Renewable Energy, and policies in development plans, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.

<a name="80213w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Quinn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on passport fees.  [29769]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80213w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Privy Council has approved an Order in Council, the Consular Fees Order 1998, which gives authority for an increase in passport fees on 26 March. The fee for a standard 32 page passport will increase from &#163;18 to &#163;21 and for a 48 page passport from &#163;27 to &#163;31. The fee for amending an existing passport will increase from &#163;5 to &#163;11, to reflect the economic cost. The cost of a separate passport for children will be &#163;11 for a passport valid for five years. An additional charge of &#163;10 will be introduced for those making applications in person in the United Kingdom and for applications made abroad to reflect the greater cost of providing these services. The fee for a collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups, will remain unchanged at &#163;40.
<P>

<a name="80213w01.html_para3">This is the first general increase in passport fees since November 1992 and, for the over 80 per cent. of applicants who apply by post, is in line with the level of inflation for the period. In relation to the cost of travel abroad, a fee of &#163;21 for a standard ten year passport still represents very good value for money.

 Following the Audit of Prison Service Resources last summer, I made available to the Prison Service additional funding of &#163;43m over two years to increase capacity and regime activity. In the event, the Service has done well in containing costs and has not had to call on the extra provision for 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="80213w02.html_para0">I am now making available &#163;112m in 1998-99 on top of the existing budget of &#163;1,704m.

 The 1998-99 local government finance settlement is extremely tight and councils will have to make difficult choices when they set their budgets for next year. There is no scope to increase overall support for councils but, following discussions with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, I am pleased to announce a scheme which will allow many councils throughout Scotland to increase spending on front-line services by a further 0.25 per cent. of base budgets on top of the limits determined by my provisional capping principles. I hope that councils will direct this additional spending at our shared priorities, such as education. To offset this increase they will have to reduce their capital expenditure by the same amount.
<P>

<a name="80213w02.html_para10">I am also determined to keep council tax levels down, so local authorities will be allowed to take up this flexibility only if they keep their Band D council tax increase next year below &#163;60. Councils will continue to face difficult decisions but this scheme will allow them the flexibility to make their own choices suitable to their local circumstances.

<a name="80213w04.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs aims to dispose of seized alcohol and tobacco by the most environmentally friendly means. Beer is recycled into agricultural products, and spirits into methylated spirits, although more recently Customs have set up arrangements which allow the resale of bulk consignments back to the originating UK manufacturer. Wine and tobacco products, because of their limited shelf life and the need to store them in the right conditions, are destroyed.

 The option to establish a properly balanced waste management strategy is open to all local authorities at any time. It is for each local authority to decide on its use of the various waste management options within its available resources.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para7">In October 1997 I announced that the Government accepted in full the recommendations of the Review Group on the Local Authority Role in Recycling, which reported in February 1997. One of its key recommendations was that Waste Disposal Authorities should work closely with their constituent Waste Collection Authorities to establish a fully integrated municipal waste management strategy.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para8">The Department is also shortly to issue revised guidance to local authorities on the preparation and revision of recycling plans. I hope that all local authorities will look at all the available options for managing waste in developing an integrated municipal waste management strategy with other authorities, the public, the private and voluntary sectors. Recycling is to be preferred to incineration with recovery if and when it represents the 



<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 1998 : Column: 416</I><P>
best practicable environmental option. Equally, incineration with energy recovery is generally likely to be preferable to disposal.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para9">That guidance also advises authorities developing integrated strategies that the high capital costs of energy from waste plants generally require long-term waste contracts to be agreed. Local authorities considering energy from waste will therefore wish to guard against over-reliance on this option, and will wish to take a view on likely future developments in waste management practices and technology. In particular, they will wish to ensure that the use of energy from waste plants does not divert waste from recycling and composting, and, indeed, allows scope for increases in recycling and composting activity.

 The Solent is an estuarine water body under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.

 The existing standards for the discharges to the Solent were set by the Environment Agency to secure compliance with all relevant environment quality standards contained in EC Directives in force at the time. The Environment Agency is required to review discharge consents at least every four years.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para12">So far as the current proposals are concerned, the Environment Agency undertook a substantial review of existing data in 1993-94 to confirm that the Solent should be designated as an estuary under the terms of the Urban Waste Waster Treatment Directive. This means that all qualifying discharges into the Solent, including the Portsmouth and Havant schemes, are required to receive secondary biological treatment by 2000.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para13">The Environment Agency will derive the appropriate quality standards for the Portsmouth and Havant discharges by applying national policy and technical guidance relating to water services companies' discharges. This is currently set out comprehensively in the AMP2 Guidelines Version 2 in the Environment Agency's Discharge Consents Manual.




<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 1998 : Column: 418</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para14">An important element of the proposals is to provide secondary biologically treated effluent for flows arising from the Portsmouth, Havant and Hayling Island catchments discharging through the Eastney long sea outfall into the Solent. The Environment Agency is currently determining the consent applications and has employed external consultants to audit the proposals rigorously to ensure they fully comply with the requirements of all relevant Directives. So far as the Bathing Water Directive is concerned, the Environment Agency will ensure continued compliance with the Imperative standards and is assessing the achievement of the more stringent Guideline standards.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para15">All relevant EC Directives have been taken into account in assessing the compliance of the current storm overflows at Budds Farm. In particular, the Dangerous Substances Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive apply directly to Langstone Harbour. The Environment Agency exerts control for the purposes of the Dangerous Substances Directive by imposing upon water services companies, requirements for limiting trade effluent discharges to sewers. Studies have shown the impact of the storm overflows in relation to the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive sensitive waters requirements are not significant. The treatment scheme will also address aesthetic improvements to storm overflows and will significantly reduce spill frequencies in recognition of the important commercial, amenity and conservation interests within Langstone Harbour.
<P>

<a name="80213w05.html_para16">The Environment Agency has issued, for comment, copies of discharge consent applications and supporting documentation to all statutory consultees, including local authorities, the County Council, MAFF (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science), Southern Sea Fisheries and English Nature. The Environment Agency will take account of their comments when determining the discharge consents. The applications have also been advertised in accordance with the Control of Pollution (Applications, Appeals and Registers) Regulations 1996. The Environment Agency has responded to all correspondence received, which will also be taken into account when determining the discharge consents.

<P>
<a name="80213w05.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive lays down requirements for treatment of waste water discharged to estuaries and designated sensitive areas. All discharges to estuaries serving population equivalents greater than 2000 must receive secondary treatment. Discharges to sensitive areas must receive more stringent treatment involving the removal of nitrogen or phosphorus. The Environment Agency is responsible for determining, through the discharge consent system, how these requirements should be applied in particular cases. However, in July 1997, my Department issued a Guidance Note for dischargers and regulators on the implementation and interpretation of the Directive's requirements, which had been developed in consultation with other Government Departments, the water industry and its regulators.

<a name="80213w06.html_para5">Ordnance Survey updates its maps primarily in relation to the local rate of change in the landscape. Thus more work is done locally where new roads, housing estates, etc are created than in mountain and moorland areas. No specific breakdown of effort has been made in the past between England, Scotland and Wales but systems will be put in place to provide such statistics to the Scottish Parliament (the hon. Lady may already be aware that the subject matter of the Ordnance Survey Act 1841 is reserved in the Scotland Bill published last December). The best estimates currently possible are that Ordnance Survey expends approximately 7.5 per cent. of its total out-goings on re-mapping Scotland and that this fairly reflects a combination of continuous revision caused by new developments in Scotland and periodic revisions to cover the whole country.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 1998]:</i> In our consultation paper "Local Democracy and Community Leadership", which we published on Monday 9 February, we recognised that there is a strong argument for councils' adopting political and management structures which involve a separation of executive and representational roles. It will be open to local authorities to pilot such structures, including those of executive mayors, if the Local Government (Experimental Arrangements) Bill is enacted. This Bill, to which the Government are giving all the support that they can, is currently being considered in another place. I will consider the responses we receive to the consultation paper, and we will publish our proposals in a White Paper later this year.

Further information is available in the Department's Annual Report 1997 (Cm. 3607), but it is not possible to list projects individually, nor to identify the previous land use.

<a name="80213w07.html_para0">The Jubilee Line Extension is one of the largest construction projects in Europe. With a project of this size and complexity, problems are bound to arise.

Additional delays arose from construction problems at some stations, in particular

Tunnelling and other civil engineering works are now complete, fitting-out is under way and the new trains are being introduced to passenger service on the existing Jubilee Line. Development of the high technology signalling system for the line is however taking longer than anticipated, leading to the need to prepare and install more conventional signalling for use until the new system is ready.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to reply to your request for a statement on the recent initiatives concerning Porton Down volunteers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout their history, the Ministry of Defence laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire, now the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), have been involved in the research and development that has underpinned the UK's biological and chemical defence capability. Volunteers from the Armed Forces have been a vital part of the research programme as subjects in a whole range of trials. In all, over 20000 volunteers have visited Porton Down; in the last thirty years, more than 5000 have participated in projects looking at defence against or medical treatment for chemical and biological agents.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The vast majority of the volunteers who have visited Porton Down have come and gone, quite unconcerned about their attendance. Indeed, studies have always been, and continue to be, carried out with the utmost regard for the safety, health and well-being of volunteers. Nevertheless, in the last few years about 150 have enquired about the trials in which they took part, sometimes out of curiosity, but sometimes because they have concerns about their health and wonder whether there is a link.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the past, many of the actual records and reports of the experiments were, quite justifiably, kept secret in the interests of national security. Understandably, this has fuelled the concerns and uncertainties. Further, some people have not known where to go for information, or they believe that it is being withheld. The recent initiatives, prompted by the Minister for the Armed Forces, are aimed at making it easier for former volunteers to get information about their attendance at Porton Down.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DERA has set up a dedicated helpline to take enquiries from former volunteers (0845 603 9140) and has produced a leaflet to explain the type of information and help that may be available, with useful addresses. Staff at Porton Down will look at individual records and formal technical reports to provide volunteers with as much information as possible about the trials in which they participate. It will also be possible for former volunteers to visit Porton Down to see the records for themselves or to talk to the medical and scientific staff about their experiences.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 12 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>135</i>, where each of the 23 UK personnel working in the US and the four US employees working in the UK are located; and if he will make a statement on their current duties.

 As of 11 February 1998, the number of UK personnel stationed in the US reduced to 22, following the disestablishment of the Personal Secretary post in Washington. Of these, four are located in Washington and a further three in California with duties associated with the 1958 UK/US Mutual Defence Agreement: the remaining 15 are located at Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia (12), Kings Bay, Georgia (1), New London, Connecticut (1), and Laurel, Maryland (1), with duties associated with the Polaris Sales Agreement, as amended for Trident.
<P>

<a name="80213w08.html_para2">Of the four US personnel serving in the UK, three are located at Bristol and one at Barrow. Their duties are related to the Polaris Sales Agreement, as amended for Trident.

<a name="80213w08.html_para3">In this context it has been brought to my attention that in my reply to my hon.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP was conceived as a response to the Benefit Review which identified a potential for up to &#163;499m DLA fraud annually; it is essentially a measure designed to secure benefit integrity--that is to get the right amount of benefit to the right people--rather than an explicitly anti-Fraud measure. The methodology adopted, which takes account of the sensitivities involved in approaching large numbers of the most seriously disabled people in society, makes it unlikely that overt fraud will be uncovered but maximises the likelihood of revealing incorrect provision.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 31 December 1997, the BIP has identified 89 cases in which fraud was suspected, of which 36 have been referred to the Benefit Fraud Investigation Service for further investigation, which have not yet been completed. In the remaining 53 cases, fraud staff in the Disability Benefits Directorate decided that there was no realistic prospect of determining whether fraud had occurred and the files were closed without further action.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Special action is taken to try and minimise unnecessary disruption to customers suffering from certain categories of illness so they will not be contacted as part of BIP. These include customers suffering from; a terminal illness (where life expectancy is likely to be under six months); quadriplegics; paraplegics; people who are both deaf and blind; double amputees and those within the BA definition of severe mental impairment. These categories were introduced following a meeting with Disability organisations in June 1997.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From June 1997 customers included in these categories have been identified from computer records. A small number of customers have more than one disabling condition and our computer records make provision for only one to be recorded, as a result some customers in the relevant categories have not always been screened out. Since November 1997 a clerical check of these records has been introduced to identify as many as possible of these cases. Regrettably there is a small number of customers whose clerical records do not provide sufficiently detailed information for us to identify them as persons who should not be contacted. I apologise for these errors.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The number of customers mistakenly contacted is set out in the attached table.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whilst all efforts are taken to avoid these customers being contacted, should it occur, and evidence is gathered, the Adjudication Officer would have to take the information into account when deciding entitlement. Entitlement to DLA is based on the effects of a person's disabling condition on their day-to-day life, rather than on the basis of the disabling condition itself.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps his Department will take to ensure that the cost of cattle passports will be shared throughout the value chain.  [28719]

<P>
<a name="80213w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We expect that the cattle passport charges which will pay for the computerised Cattle Tracing System will be reflected in the price paid to cattle breeders by their customers, and thence passed up the marketing chain. Moreover, farmers should benefit from the introduction of the Cattle Tracing System through improved customer confidence, which should in turn help demand for farmers' products.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking to ensure that food imported into the United Kingdom and consumed within the United Kingdom is subject to the same food standards regime as food produced in the United Kingdom.  [28718]

<P>
<a name="80213w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Most products of animal origin imported for human consumption from member states or from third countries must comply with harmonised Community rules. These rules are intended to ensure that, in general, equivalent health requirements apply whatever the origin of the products. Products not subject to Community rules may be imported only if they comply with our national rules. Food which fails to meet food safety requirements can be refused entry into the UK or it can be seized and taken before a Magistrate for condemnation, under provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990.

<P>
<a name="80213w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1998]:</i> The Department has received a great many representations following my right hon. Friend's statement on 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>677-79</i>. EU rules on agrimonetary compensation limit the extent to which Member States can favour one type of production over another by concentrating aid on particular groups of recipients. Cattle and sheep farmers outside the less favoured areas (LFA) have also been affected by green rate revaluations, and, in our judgment, the balance of the revised package announced on 3 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>591-92</i>, is fully justified and equitable.

 The Commission is expected to introduce its proposals for reform of the tobacco regime at the Agriculture Council on 16/17 February. The Government will continue to press for disengagement from support. With producer Member States in a majority, abolition of the subsidy is unlikely.

 All consignments of all animal products imported into the European Union (EU) are subject to checks at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) regardless of the Member State for which they are destined. All consignments are subject to documentary checks. The levels of identity and physical checks are laid down in Community legislation and are determined by the product and country of origin. Once consignments have passed through a BIP, Single Market rules permit random spot checks only at the final destination.

<a name="80213w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the mechanism for calculating sheep annual premium payments at EU level in respect of the setting of the average market price in the EU; and if it will be his policy to direct higher levels of premium towards those parts of the Union with lower prices.  [29306]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80213w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I recognise that the rise in the average EU market price for sheepmeat in 1997 is almost entirely attributable to the revaluation of currencies in particular sterling. At the same time, the price of sheepmeat on the domestic market has fallen sharply. I cannot accept, however, that we should seek to reshape the rules for the calculation of the Sheep Annual Premium simply because they do not suit the UK in any particular year. When sterling weakened, UK producers were to some extent over compensated. I cannot, therefore, agree that supplementary premia should be paid in those Member States where the average market price is below the Community average.

<a name="80213w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no generally accepted definition of what is rural. For example, the Rural Development Commission defines rural communities as those with up to 10,000 inhabitants. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines rural areas as those with a population below 150 inhabitants per square kilometre. But other definitions may be appropriate for particular circumstances.

 The wholesale milk production figures are compiled by the Intervention Board using returns submitted by approved purchasers of milk.

In the event of a bid which qualified for consideration under the Fair Trading Act 1973, my right hon.

<P>
<a name="80213w12.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the minimum age at which borrowers with existing student loans will continue to be repaying such loans; when the decision was taken to raise the age limit from 50 years; and for what reasons Parliament was not informed.  [28911]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80213w12.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The cancellation arrangements applying to the existing student loan scheme are set out in the Education (Student Loans) Regulations 1998. The maximum age at which a borrower might be repaying his or her loan under these arrangements is 59 in cases where the borrower was aged 40 or over when the loan was taken out, and 49 in other cases. We have no plans to change the cancellation arrangements for borrowers under the existing scheme.
<P>

<a name="80213w12.html_para9">The Government are proposing that the age at which the liability to repay income contingent loans is cancelled should be 65. This is because income contingent loans will typically be repaid over a longer period than loans made under the existing scheme. The decision to set the age limit for cancellation at 65 was one of a number of detailed decisions about the implementation of the new arrangements that we have made since we first announced our proposals for student support on 23 July 1997. It was published in the "Progress Report on New Student Support Arrangements in Higher Education from 1998-99" which was placed in the Library and distributed to other interested parties last month.
<P>

<a name="80213w12.html_para10">The cancellation arrangements applying to borrowers taking out income contingent loans from 1998-99 will be set out in regulations to be made later this year under the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, once enacted.

<a name="80213w13.html_para8">A person with infectious tuberculosis of the respiratory tract may be detained in hospital under section 37 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act, 1984. This would happen only when all other routes to establish treatment compliance has been exhausted and the person was deemed a risk to public health. Although compulsory admission to hospital is allowable under the law, compulsory treatment is not.
