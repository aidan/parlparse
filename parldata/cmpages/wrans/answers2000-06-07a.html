<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions in the past three months UK military or diplomatic personnel have been confronted in Sierra Leone by persons purporting to be United Nations personnel but who were not; if he will give details of such instances where United Nations insignia or colours were being worn; and if any such incidents involved the discharge of firearms.  [124837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 None.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what instructions are given to United Kingdom service personnel when they are required to communicate or collaborate with soldiers of the Sierra Leone Army whom they suspect are below 18 years of age; if those instructions provide specifically for cases where the child soldier is armed; and if he will make a statement.  [124832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is the policy of the Government of Sierra Leone not to employ children under 18 in the Sierra Leone Armed Forces. Instructions were issued recently by President Kabbah that anyone under 18 currently serving in those forces should be disarmed and demobilised.
<P>

<a name="00607w01.html_para0">Should UK personnel come into contact with any suspected child combatant in the course of their duties, they are instructed to inform the most senior Sierra Leonean Army Commander on the scene and draw his attention to the Government of Sierra Leone's stated policy. This instruction applies whether the suspected child combatant is armed or not.

 We do not at present know who will be applying for entry to the United Kingdom as part of Mike Tyson's support team. But the question of whether entry may be granted to those accompanying him will be considered by the Immigration Officer on arrival in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="00607w02.html_para0">It would be open to Immigration Officers to question them about any relevant matters, including their criminal convictions. However, they are likely to do so only if there is reason to believe that any of them has a relevant conviction. This is to ensure consistency with existing

practice. Proposals in our consultation paper would introduce the requirement for all non-European Union passengers to declare convictions resulting in imprisonment. It would be premature to implement those proposals while the consultation process is still ongoing.
<P>

<a name="00607w02.html_para1">In the case of Steve Fitch, we are aware that he has relevant convictions. In January, Mr. Fitch was granted entry for an extremely limited period, and he observed the conditions imposed on his stay. If he is part of Mr. Tyson's entourage on this occasion, his application for entry will be considered separately in accordance with the Rules.

[124683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 provides courts with additional sentencing options for dealing with fine defaulters, persistent petty offenders and others. The provisions were piloted in Norfolk and Greater Manchester and the final report evaluating the trials was published as a Home Office Occasional Paper on 29 February this year. A decision will be taken in due course on whether to bring these measures into effect throughout England and Wales.

 Only convicted football hooligans who are subject to international banning orders can be prevented from leaving the United Kingdom. The Dutch and Belgian authorities have extensive powers to refuse entry to any individual or group who they consider may pose a risk to public order. This includes people subject to domestic bans. The National Criminal Intelligence Service has provided their Dutch and Belgian counterparts with details of the 506 people currently subject to football banning orders and another 500 or so names of suspected hooligans have also been passed on. Police will be monitoring all England supporters at every United Kingdom exit point throughout the period of the tournament and the information gathered will be shared with the Dutch, Belgian and French police teams and United Kingdom police operating in these countries.

<P>

<a name="00607w02.html_para4">When the separation distances are for agronomic or commercial reasons, for example to protect crop integrity, which is the case for the farm-scale evaluations, they are a matter for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who consult appropriate bodies representing, for example, organic farmers and honey producers.

 Officials from my Department and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were first informed of the contamination when they met with representatives from Advanta on 17 April. At that meeting, Advanta informed them that some Hyola oilseed rape in Germany had been found to be contaminated with GM oilseed rape. Since then officials were in regular contact with Advanta to establish the facts of the case and in particular to determine which GM variety was involved and the extent to which the contamination extended to seeds in the UK.

 Although Britain has a good road safety record there are still far too many people killed and injured in road traffic accidents. It is for local highway authorities to ensure that any roadside memorials to commemorate the lives of those killed in accidents comply with the provisions of the various Highways Acts and Road Traffic Acts and do not themselves become a road safety hazard either through obstruction of the highway or a distraction to road users.

<a name="00607w04.html_para9">The draft guidance, "Preparing Community Strategies", recognises that the key to any effective community planning process lies in engaging local communities, listening to their concerns and addressing their needs and priorities.

<a name="00607w04.html_para10">Community strategies will represent a significant shift in the way local organisations work together and the way that they relate to local people. Strategies should bring together public, private and community sector organisations, and focus their activities on responding to local needs articulated by local people.

<a name="00607w05.html_para5">The Council discussed the Commission's first review of the Internal Market Strategy and broadly endorsed its priority actions, although I emphasised that the UK could not endorse every action, such as some of those relating to tax. The Commission presented the latest version of the Single Market Scoreboard and France and Sweden outlined their priorities for the Single Market for their Presidencies in the context of the Joint Work Programme of the Three Presidencies. The Council approved the draft Conclusions on the review of the Simpler Legislation in the Internal Market (SLIM) initiative, which took full account of input from the UK. The Council also endorsed the report of discussions of the Commission's White Paper on Food Safety.

 The Insolvency Service have been closely involved at every stage in the development of limited liability partnerships. The Government's proposals include the application, by secondary legislation, of existing safeguards and sanctions relating to disqualified directors. This will ensure that those who have been disqualified on the basis of unfit conduct under any of the provisions of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 will also be prohibited from being a member of, or being in any way, whether directly or indirectly, concerned with taking part in the formation or management of a limited liability partnership, unless they obtain leave of the court to so act.

In addition, the court will be under a duty to disqualify a person where it is satisfied that his conduct as a member of an insolvent LLP renders him unfit to so act. Simply being a director of a failed company (or, in future a member of a failed LLP) will not, though, necessarily result in disqualification--the intention is to punish abuse of limited liability, not the mere fact of failure.

 No such consultations have taken place. Secondary legislation will apply to LLPs appropriately modified parts of the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Companies Act 1985. This will include the wrongful and fraudulent trading provisions, and powers of investigation. The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 will also apply, such that disqualified directors will not be eligible to be members of an LLP and vice versa. In these cases the regulation of an LLP will be the same as that of a company.

 After considerable consultation, and taking account of the views of the Trade and Industry Committee, the Government concluded that LLPs would not be required to maintain any kind of fund or insurance to protect against claims. The main reasons for reaching this conclusion were:
<P>

<a name="00607w06.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the lack of justification for requiring a higher level of funding than is required of private companies;
<P>
<BR>
the difficulty of setting an appropriate level which is high enough to safeguard the interests of third parties, but does not discourage firms from either setting up in business or trading through difficulties;
<P>
<BR>
the general availability of LLPs makes it difficult to design a regime which could adequately distinguish between the many types of business which might become LLPs and the different liabilities they might face;
<P>
<BR>
it is more appropriate to regulate an activity, rather than an entity, so as to tailor the regulation effectively. For example, where professions require professional indemnity insurance, the level of

 In 1999-2000, 82.4 per cent. of the Local Schools Budget was delegated to schools, compared with 79.2 per cent. of a broadly comparable figure in the previous year. This increase of 3.2 per cent. in the delegation rate represents an extra &#163;634 million delegated to schools. Fair Funding will result in a further increase in delegation in 2000-01, since it is being implemented in two stages. Comparisons between individual local education authorities for change from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 will appear in expenditure tables to be available shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> We are making available &#163;620 million to local education authorities to deliver our pledge to reduce infant class sizes to 30 pupils or fewer. This will allow authorities to provide some 6,000 extra teachers and to build over 2,000 additional infant classrooms. We do not keep information on the number of schools which have adjusted their standard numbers in order to meet the infant class size limit. However, we estimate that around 12,000 additional places are being provided in popular schools as a result of our initiative to eliminate large infant classes.

School admission authorities may, however, use distance when determining how to allocate places if the school is oversubscribed. If a pupil is attending his or her nearest suitable school, and that school is beyond statutory walking distance, the local education authority must provide free transport. Statutory walking distances are two miles for pupils aged up to seven and three miles for those aged eight and over.

The international community will provide humanitarian relief for those affected by drought and displaced by war. But what the people of both countries need is peace and development.

 We are committed to the International Development Target of achieving universal primary education by 2015. This is the priority for our education assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa, where over the last two years we have committed over &#163;150 million to support the development of universal primary education programmes, which include support for primary school infrastructure and equipment. Our aim is to help African countries build and sustain effective and equitable education systems which give priority to primary education for all. This requires a shift from the traditional projects-based approach to a sector-wide approach to basic and primary education, with development agencies working together around a focused, agreed strategy drawn up by the Government of the country concerned. Uganda is a good example. In collaboration with five other donors and the Government of Uganda, we have played a key role in the establishment of a sector-wide approach to education, resulting in 1998 in our largest ever commitment to a programme in Africa (&#163;67 million) towards the Education Sector Support Programme. This will provide flexible budget support to the Government for five years.

 I share many of the concerns for developing countries expressed in Christian Aid's recent reports. The impact of climate change is likely to constitute one of the biggest global environmental problems for the 21st century. It is likely to affect developing countries and particularly poor people disproportionately, since they are both more vulnerable to disaster and less able to cope in its event.
<P>

<a name="00607w08.html_para2">Our objectives in assisting countries to deal with disasters are to save lives through emergency relief, to protect and rebuild livelihoods and communities, and to reduce vulnerability to future disasters. We are working to improve understanding of the possible impacts of climate change on developing countries in order to help them take account of these in their development planning and so reduce their future vulnerability. We also work with developing countries to help improve their energy efficiency and reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions.

<P>
<a name="00607w08.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I continue to receive many letters from Church and other voluntary organisations on debt relief, many referring to the G8 Summit in Okinawa in July. When the Prime Minister met the Japanese Prime Minister last month, they agreed the importance of discussing debt issues in Okinawa.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w08.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia are all Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, and in need of the exceptional debt relief provided under the HIPC Initiative. Mozambique received debt relief totalling $1.72 billion in June 1999, and will receive a further $250 million under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Following the flooding there multilateral and bilateral creditors took special action to free up resources for reconstruction. The World bank and the IMF agreed to provide 100 per cent. relief on debt service payments in the first year, and the Paris Club has suspended all payments until Mozambique reaches its Completion Point under the revised HIPC framework, which is expected to be early next year.
<P>

<a name="00607w08.html_para6">Malawi and Zambia are both working towards qualifying for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. To do so they need to maintain progress on economic reform and to develop national poverty reduction strategies.

<a name="00607w08.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 So far, only five countries have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This is disappointing. But at the recent Spring Meetings of the IMF and World bank, it was agreed to establish a joint World bank/IMF committee to oversee the implementation process, as the Chancellor and I had suggested. The committee has now begun its work, and should provide a focus for efforts towards meeting the commitment that three quarters of eligible countries will start to receive debt relief before the end of 2000.

 Over the next decade these new technologies have the potential significantly to improve poor people's access to information, markets and other services, but also the very real potential to increase the gap yet further between the rich and the poor. We intend to play a significant role in helping to bridge this emerging digital divide. Our new Development White Paper will specifically address the issue of information and communication as one of the key factors in globalisation. The White Paper will outline what role the UK can play, both directly and indirectly, to promote widespread access to information and communication in developing countries.

<P>
<a name="00607w10.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Risk capital is a vital source of finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the potential for rapid growth. The Government have introduced a number of measures to encourage individuals, institutional funds and companies to invest more in this sector.
<P>

<a name="00607w10.html_para3">For individuals, this year's Finance Bill introduces significant reductions in capital gains tax (CGT) for investment in unquoted companies. All such holdings, with no minimum threshold, now qualify as "business assets", and higher rate taxpayers who now invest in such shares for at least four years will pay an effective rate of only 10 per cent. on the capital gains realised.
<P>

<a name="00607w10.html_para4">The Finance Bill also makes several improvements to the operation of the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), which provides tax incentives for individuals to invest in smaller higher risk trading companies. Income tax reliefs will now be available on shares held for at least three years (rather than the previous five year limit), and SMEs will be able more easily to seek capital from both EIS investors and venture capital funds. Parallel changes to the tax reliefs for individuals investing in risk capital via Venture Capital Trusts are also being introduced.
<P>

<a name="00607w10.html_para5">With the aim of reducing the regulatory cost to SMEs in raising risk capital from individuals, the Government have consulted, and are considering responses, on whether to create specific exemptions from the prohibition on financial promotion for defined classes of "high net worth individuals" and "sophisticated investors". This would enable smaller companies and others to communicate more easily with potential investors who are able and willing to invest without the standard protection offered by financial services legislation.
<P>

 Definitions of venture capital vary between countries: the UK definition normally includes leveraged buyout funds, whereas the US definition does not. In both countries, figures are based on surveys of some, rather than all pension funds and are therefore not precise.
<P>

<a name="00607w10.html_para10">The British Venture Capital Association has calculated figures based on the 1999 Annual Survey of the National Association of Pension Funds. According to these calculations, approximately 0.6 per cent. of the assets of those pension funds who responded to the Survey were invested in a broad definition of venture capital. A survey of 189 pension funds in the US (Source: Report on Alternative Investing by Tax Exempt Organisations 1999, Goldman Sachs and Frank Russell Company) showed 116 of them investing in alternative assets. Those 116 funds invested 6 per cent. of their assets in venture capital and leveraged buyout funds.

<a name="00607w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government are introducing a wide range of initiatives that will benefit entrepreneurial new companies. Small companies will benefit from the new 10 per cent. starting rate for Corporation Tax. R&D tax credits will encourage innovation by small and medium-sized companies. They increase tax relief for R&D spending, and companies not in profit such as start-up ventures, can take the relief up front as a cash payment. The Corporate Venturing Scheme will encourage companies to invest in small, higher-risk trading companies. The investment will attract corporation tax relief at 20 per cent. Enterprise Management Incentives will make it easier for new companies to attract and retain the best people. Companies can reward key staff with share options free of income tax and national insurance charges. The development of each of these three schemes has involved detailed consultation with businesses and representative bodies. All three have been welcomed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of the increase in capital gains tax on share options in each year since 1996.  [124759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w11.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There is no Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the exercise of share options. CGT may be payable when shares acquired on exercise of the options are sold if the gains exceed the annual exempt amount. The effective rate of CGT depends on the size of the gain, whether the shares were business or non-business assets, and how long the shares have been held. The effect of taper relief is to reduce the tax on gains the longer the shares are held. CGT taper relief normally runs from the date that the shares were acquired.
<P>

<a name="00607w11.html_para0">The November 1999 Pre-Budget Report announced the intention to make further improvements in CGT in order to promote productivity. Following consultation, the Budget announced proposals to improve the CGT treatment of shares owned by employees and officers in the trading companies in which they work. For periods from 6 April 2000 such shares will be treated as business assets, and will benefit from more generous taper rates. Business asset treatment applies whether the shares were acquired through share options or by other means.
<P>

<a name="00607w11.html_para1">The Government are introducing in the current Finance Bill two new employee share plans. Under the All Employee Share Plan, employees who keep their shares in the plan until they sell them will have no CGT to pay however great the increase in value of those shares. In addition, under the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) scheme, companies will be able to grant each of their key employees share options worth up to &#163;100,000, normally without any Income Tax or National Insurance charge on exercise. When the shares are sold, CGT taper relief will normally start from the date the options were granted.

<P>

<a name="00607w11.html_para2">The Government believe the Tobin tax idea is, in principle, interesting, but has a number of practical drawbacks. In particular, it could introduce serious economic distortions to the international financial system, and is unlikely to have much effect in a crisis. It would be practically impossible to achieve global coverage, and there would be huge scope for avoidance.

There is no estimate of the cost of damage which was slight because the petrol did not ignite. There have been no similar incidents in the area although a brick was thrown at the window of this house on 9 August. It is not thought that parades had any bearing.

 When the assault by occupants of a vehicle was reported, police immediately circulated the limited details of the vehicle which was not located. The scene was visited and potential witnesses were interviewed but no further evidence came to light. There is nothing to suggest that this was a sectarian attack. There have been no recent incidents of this type in the area. Parades in the area have caused tension but it is not thought that they had a bearing on the incident. The community affiliation of the three assailants is not known. The investigation remains open but is dependent on additional information becoming available.

 To date there have been five occasions when applications for judicial review have been made on determinations made by the Parades Commission:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Ormeau Road parade on 13 July 1998:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The Commission's decision not to impose route restrictions on the Orange Order parade was the subject of an application for judicial review on 7 July 1998. The grounds of the application were that, in not prohibiting the parade from parading on the Lower Ormeau Road as it had done in relation to previous parades, the Commission had exceeded its statutory powers. It was argued that the functions of the Commission were the balancing of local interests, and that the meaning of "community" in the Public Processions Act 1998 was confined to the people living in the area through which it was proposed that the parade should pass. The Commission could not, therefore, come to a different conclusion in relation to the 13 July parade if, as it was bound to do, it restricted itself to local considerations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The application was dismissed. The decision, when appealed, was upheld.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> No substantive hearing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Apprentice Boys Parade in Dunloy on 8 August 1998:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The Commission's decision not to permit the Dunloy Apprentice Boys to parade through the village of Dunloy was the subject of an application for judicial review on 6 August 1998. The grounds of the application were, among others, that the Commission had failed to distinguish the various groups which are commonly described as the 'loyal orders' and had imposed an obligation on those loyal orders to engage with the local community. This, it was argued, had fettered the Apprentice Boys discretion.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The application was dismissed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> No substantive hearing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Parkmount Junior LOL No. 150 parade in Portadown on 29 May 1999:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The Commission's decision not to impose conditions on the parade along a section of the lower end of Garvaghy Road in Portadown was the subject of an application for judicial review on 27 May 1999. The grounds for the application were that in deciding not to impose conditions the Commission had not acted in accordance with its own procedures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> Leave to apply was not granted. The applicant appealed the decision and the Court of Appeal subsequently granted leave and heard and determined the application.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> The judgment found that the Commission had taken into account relevant factors, and had not taken into account irrelevant factors, and that the decision to impose no restrictions was lawful, procedurally proper and reasonable in the circumstances.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Long March Parade on 3 July 1999 (Lurgan to Portadown):</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The Commission's decision to re-route that part of the march notified to pass through Lurgan was the subject of an application for leave to apply for a judicial review on 2 July 1999. The grounds for the application were that the Commission had not complied with its own procedures in failing to consult with the organiser of the march in order to facilitate mediation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The court considered that the Commission had not acted " in a way which was clearly outside its powers or contrary to its prescribed procedure". The application was refused. The applicant appealed the decision on 2 November 1999. A preliminary hearing was held on 8 November 1999, and the substantive hearing on 1 December 1999. The appeal was dismissed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Dismissed on invitation of appellant's counsel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. St. Patrick's Day parades in Kilkeel on 17 March 2000:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The Commission's decision to permit parades by two nationalist bands to proceed along their notified route was the subject for an application for a judicial review on 16 March 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Jun 2000 : Column: 284W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2000. The ground for the application was that the Commission had failed to comply with its procedures in not consulting widely enough to gain sufficient information on which to base its decision. It had therefore failed to take into account previous disorder in relation to the parade, and to consider the adverse impact of the parade on community relations, and had not advised anyone that "they were minded to alter the status which had existed for over 20 years".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The judge agreed, in view of the time constraints, that he would deal with both the leave application, and if this were successful, the substantive hearing. The Court held that the Commission had not acted outside its powers or contrary to its procedures, and the application was dismissed.</FONT></UL>

 Vacancies in the ranks of Constable to Inspector are circulated throughout the force in accordance with force orders. Applicants, who must have completed their probationary period, are required to complete an application form and receive a line manager's recommendation before being interviewed by a selection panel consisting of officers of at least Chief Inspector rank, one of whom is from the specialism involved. The Chairman of the panel is always from outside the specialism. Successful candidates undergo a one-year aideship and only on successful completion will an appointment to the branches be made permanent. Appointments at the ranks of Chief Inspector and above are the responsibility of Force Command, advised by Personnel Branch, who consider the number of vacancies and the policing experience of potential appointees before making recommendations.

<a name="00607w14.html_para0">The time taken to complete each stage of the disciplinary procedure is affected by many factors, including the nature and extent of the allegations, the complexity and availability of evidence, the resources devoted to the investigation, the progress of related criminal or civil proceedings and the level and nature of co-operation afforded by the complainant.
<P>

<a name="00607w14.html_para1">A comprehensive review of the police complaints system in Northern Ireland was carried out by Dr. Maurice Hayes, who published his report in January 1997. The present Independent Commission for Police Complaints will be replaced by the Office of the Police Ombudsman on 1 October 2000. The Police Ombudsman will receive and investigate all complaints about the police and will make recommendations for criminal and disciplinary action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is his Department's estimate of the annual savings to the social security budget of the disposal of non-local offices from London in each of the last five years.  [124401]<P>

<P>
<a name="00607w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Prior to 1 April 1998 and within the last five years, the Department vacated only one "non-local office <sup>1</sup> " in the London area, where it was the major Government occupier. This was Euston Tower, but being a leasehold building there was no disposal value; savings simply accrued through the discontinuance of rent, rates and the service charge.
<P>

<a name="00607w15.html_para4">On 31 March 1995, an initial release of space at Euston Tower produced net annual savings of &#163;436,694, after the deduction of additional occupation costs following relocation of the Headquarters staff involved to the Adelphi. The final moves, involving a number of units, took place in 1996. The net annual savings after relocation were in the region of &#163;1.4 million.
<P>

<a name="00607w15.html_para5">On 1 April 1998 the Department subsequently transferred all of its property, both freehold and leasehold, to the private sector consortium Trillium plc under the PRIME Agreement. We now no longer own nor rent any buildings. Instead, serviced office accommodation is purchased from Trillium. So now, if we withdraw entirely from a building, or hand back only a proportion of our space, it is for Trillium to dispose of.
<P>

<a name="00607w15.html_para6">In the two years since the PRIME contract began, as part of estates strategies in the London area, the Department has handed back some 45,431m <sup>2</sup>  of space in both local office and non-local office buildings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w15.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Department's Analytical Services Division currently produces a range of local level information by matching a claimant's postcode against the Office for National Statistics postcode directory for the key benefits including Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Incapacity Benefit. For some benefits, incomplete or missing postcode information makes such a process unreliable and work to improve the accuracy of this information is ongoing. For example, August 1999 Child Benefit data were recently enhanced through the imputation of postcode from claimant address details. A final phase of work to match this against the 2000 postcode directory will soon result in the production of reliable small area estimates for child benefit for the first time.
<P>

<a name="00607w15.html_para7">A copy of the child benefit data for all parliamentary constituencies will be placed in the Houses of Parliament Libraries by the end of July 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00607w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) does not prescribe how pension funds should invest their assets. Investment practice is a matter for pension schemes. The MFR is intended to provide a reasonable level of security for members in the event of the employer becoming insolvent and requires defined benefit schemes to hold a minimum level of assets to meet their liabilities valued according to a prescribed methodology. We have asked the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries to carry out a review of the minimum funding requirement and will be consulting shortly on the proposals in their report. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has also asked Paul Myners to conduct a review of institutional investment which is considering this and other issues.

 As I told the House on 20 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 833-36, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the establishment of the Joint Entry Clearance Unit (the JECU). Copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. This week the JECU has moved to its new offices at 89 Albert Embankment. By bringing together Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office expertise in a single unit, it will provide a better co-ordinated and more effective service to entry clearance applicants. More information about the new Unit, including contact numbers within it, will be circulated to Members.
