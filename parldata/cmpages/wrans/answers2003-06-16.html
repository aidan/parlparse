 The almost continuous conflict in Afghanistan over the last 25 years means that reliable health and population data are hard to come by and where available need to be treated with much caution.
<P>

<a name="30616w01.html_para0">The World Bank estimates that life expectancy in Afghanistan was 40 in 1980, 42 in 1990 and 43 in 2000. It is generally thought that life expectancy is very similar for men and women.

: The benefits to developing countries from the Doha 'Development' Round will depend on the final outcome at the end of the negotiations in 2005. A beneficial outcome for developing countries, including African countries, in the agriculture negotiations would need to address both domestic support and export guarantees. Reductions in currently high levels of trade-distorting support are necessary to address overproduction in the developed world and the swamping of world commodity markets, both of which are of interest to developing countries. Under export guarantees, more explicit rules on the terms of use of export credits and food aid, as well as reductions in export subsidies are needed to address the issue of dumping which is currently harming developing countries' local production and trade.
<P>

<a name="30616w01.html_para1">The UK is committed to ensuring real reductions in OECD agricultural subsidies, as well as to making progress in other areas of concern not only to African developing countries. These include improving market access for agricultural products and establishing fair rules for special and differential treatment to safeguard food security and rural development in Africa.

 The former Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short appointed the following Special Advisers after May 1997, all were paid appointments: Jessica Crowe, Daniel Harris, David Mepham, Dee Sullivan, Susannah Cox and Ruth Driscoll. No more than two advisers were in post at any one time. All of the appointees listed were accountable to Ministers for their decisions and actions. Under Exemption 12 of the code of Practice on Access to Government Information details of individual salaries are not disclosed in order to protect the privacy of the individuals concerned. The new Secretary of State for International Development, Baroness Amos has not yet appointed any special advisers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w01.html_wqn3"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what steps the Government are taking to alleviate the effect of the downturn in international commodities markets on <i>(a)</i> developing country producers and <i>(b)</i> the environment, with particular regard to (i) coffee, (ii) cocoa and (iii) cotton.  [119008]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Price fluctuations are a feature of many primary agricultural commodity markets, including those for coffee, cocoa and cotton. This instability can have negative implications in producer countries at both national level (e.g. in terms of foreign exchange earnings, government revenues and the ability to service debt etc.), and at household level, even in countries where a degree of diversification has been achieved. Any negative effects on the natural and physical environment, such as inappropriate farming practices, cannot be disassociated from the livelihood challenges which a downturn in commodity markets creates for those dependent on the production, marketing and trade in these products.
<P>

<a name="30616w01.html_para2">Many of the world's poorest countries, particularly those in Africa, remain dependent on these three commodities. We are committed to helping these countries reduce their dependence on these commodities and increase their resilience in the face of unstable world prices. The UK Government, through its development programme and other efforts at international level, are seeking to expand trade opportunities, although existing trade barriers (including tariff escalation) and developed country agricultural policies are major impediments to this. The UK is working to secure reform of international trade rules in general and to reduce the impact of protectionist regimes on developing countries such as the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, there is scope for creating a more favourable domestic environment within commodity dependent countries themselves. This is necessary to generate broader more diverse economic growth that will provide the means to reduce vulnerability to shocks, such as falling prices. The UK provides support to a variety of activities in this area.

 In accordance with the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000, DFID published a Race Equality Scheme in May 2002. This reiterates DFID's commitment to promoting race equality and sets out how the department plans to meet its obligations under the new Act, both as a service provider and as an employer.
<P>

<a name="30616w01.html_para4">Due to the international focus of its work, DFID has only a few functions which provide services to the UK public.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what financial assistance the Department is providing to projects to help widows in <i>(a)</i> Afghanistan, <i>(b)</i> Iraq, <i>(c)</i> Nigeria and <i>(d)</i> Angola.  [118648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w02.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID supports a number of projects in Afghanistan, Iraq and Nigeria to assist women; these are detailed as follows. DFID also provides un-earmarked core funding to UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women), which will be &#163;3.6 million in 2003. This supports a partnership set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper agreed with UNIFEM in 1999. Women's human rights are central to all UNIFEM's programmes.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para0">In Afghanistan DFID's assistance strategy targets vulnerable people, particularly women, who are in need of direct assistance. The World Food Programme, which DFID has funded as part of the strategy, runs employment projects solely for vulnerable women. These projects, such as bakery co-operatives and small farms, are run in both urban and rural areas. DFID provided &#163;4.7 million to WFP in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para1">This year DFID is also providing support to other projects that are targeted at vulnerable women; &#163;200,000 to a micro-finance initiative run in Afghanistan by the Bangladeshi Rural Advancement Committee, and &#163;1 million to an Aga Khan Network project for improving livelihood opportunities in Badakhshan province. This assistance is targeted at vulnerable women in general, rather than specifically at widows.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jun 2003 : Column 5W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para2">In Iraq, DFID has provided &#163;819,000 to the NGO 4RS since 1999 for their work with widows and vulnerable households headed by women. Their work includes income generation projects in the Kirkuk area of northern Iraq and in particular the Anfal widows. In addition DFID has provided &#163;105,673 to 4RS for their work to assist displaced unsupported women in northern Iraq during the recent conflict.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para3">In Nigeria, DFID has provided &#163;5,000 during the last six months to train 1,000 widows through the Access to Justice programme operating in Enugu state. A further 1,000 widows will receive training during the coming six months at a cost of &#163;3,700.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para4">In Angola, DFID has no projects directly aimed at helping widows, but our &#163;8 million Angola country programme focuses on reducing poverty for all Angolans and we are increasingly working with the Government of Angola to help it meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

[118649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w02.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID's longer-term development work on institutional and governmental reform and capacity building in Afghanistan focuses on reform of the institutions for the benefit of all poor or disadvantaged people, especially women, but not specific groups such as widows.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para5">The Government is committed to including women in the reconstruction of Iraq, in line with UN Resolution 1325. DFID and other Departments are talking to a range of women's groups within and outside Iraq to ensure women are well represented in planning and reconstruction issues at all levels, and that they play a full role in shaping the new Iraq.

 The 5th World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Cancun this September will take stock of progress on delivering the 'development' agenda for the "current" round of multilateral trade negotiations launched in Doha in November 2001.

<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para8">The benefits of the Doha round for developing countries will depend on the final outcome at the scheduled conclusion of the negotiations on 1 January 2005. It is widely acknowledge that multilateral trade reform can have significant benefits for developing countries. For example, the World Bank estimates that eliminating all barriers to trade in goods would generate an extra US$250 billion&#150;US$620 billion in global income, up to half of which would go to developing countries. In terms of poverty reduction, this could lift over 300 million people out of poverty by 2015.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w02.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government seeks an Environmental Liability Directive that delivers clear environmental benefits and is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable and easy to implement. In Council negotiations we have made it clear that we will not support proposals that would damage business competitiveness while lacking a clear focus on achieving environmental gain.
<P>

<a name="30616w02.html_para9">The assessment of the implications of compulsory financial security was carried out by my Department in consultation with business generally, with the insurance industry, and with other relevant Government Departments. It revealed that the cost to UK businesses of a compulsory insurance requirement could range from &#163;130 million to &#163;1.8 billion per annum. These costs would far outweigh the environmental benefits of the Directive, as evaluated in the Department's Extended Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (COM(02)17). These factors point strongly against such a requirement. The Government's policy therefore is not to support compulsory financial security.

That is why the Government asked the Tenancy Reform Industry Group to put forward proposals for tenancy reform. The Tenancy Reform Industry Group has reached an industry consensus on these issues and its report to Government was published on 3 June. We have welcomed the report and will be considering the Tenancy Reform Industry Group recommendations carefully.

The recently published results of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers' Annual Tenanted Farms Survey for 2002 shows that in England and Wales some 18,200 hectares of previously un-let land have been let on Farm Business Tenancies. After taking account of losses of let land during the survey period there has been a net gain to the tenanted sector of some 10,500 hectares. The Central Association of Agricultural Valuers' survey also shows that the average length of a Farm Business Tenancy is just under 4 years and that some 80 per cent. of lets involve bare land.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 4 June 2003, ref 116075, what quantities of animal and plant products she estimates have been illegally imported into the UK over the last three years for which figures are available; what products were involved; how many <i>(a)</i> prosecutions were brought and <i>(b)</i> cautions were issued; and what the resulting penalties were.  [118580]<P>

<P>
<a name="30616w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Veterinary Laboratories Agency published a risk assessment report on 25 March 2003. This estimated the amount of illegal meat imported annually, on average, to be 7,500 tonnes, with 90 per cent. certainty that the amount of illegal meat imported will range from 2,800 tonnes to 17,500 tonnes per year. Copies of the report have been placed in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="30616w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Health and welfare rules for the intra-Community movement of live animals require animals to be fit for the intended journey in accordance with the provisions of directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport. An official veterinary surgeon must inspect animals before transport and must certify that they are healthy and fit for the intended journey. In addition, there may be checks by inspectors at the time of loading onto the vehicle or at the port of departure. Information about checks on sheep and pigs exported for fattening or slaughter are available on the Defra website (www.defra.gov.uk).

 The Mersey Forest project is one of 12 Community Forests set up under the Countryside Agency's Community Forest Programme. The North West Regional Economic Strategy identifies the Mersey Forest, and other forestry projects in the Region, as factors that are helping to create the right conditions for inward investment, regeneration, tourist development and overall quality of life. In order to evaluate the programme the Agency has commissioned a range of independent research projects. These projects have identified a number of contributions that the Mersey Forest has made, or is making.
<P>

<a name="30616w03.html_para6">The research has shown that the Mersey Forest and the Red Rose Forest (around Manchester) are identified, among other projects, as having a role to play in helping to reposition the region's image for attracting businesses and tourists to the region. The Mersey Forest project has helped develop an integrated approach to the development of rural businesses and the management of the landscape in which they work. In order to encourage more people to participate in outdoor activities, the Mersey Forest has created a network and support structure for the Mersey Forest Friends groups, which are self-managing and are given support to undertake the sustainable management of their local woodlands. In addition, the Mersey Forest's "Schools Ground Development" programme was established to create wooded play areas surrounding

<a name="30616w03.html_para7">The research indicates that the Mersey and Red Rose Forests have been involved in pioneering work on closed landfill sites, establishing new methodologies for assessing sites and determining their suitability for woodland. I understand that 12 per cent. of the derelict land (4,000 hectares) within the Mersey Forest area has been reclaimed, of which some 65 hectares of woodland was planted on damaged or disturbed ground in 2001. The Mersey Forest (in association with the Red Rose Forest, the Forestry Commission, the North West Development Agency and the Environment Agency) is using the Capital Modernisation Fund to deliver community woodland on derelict, under utilised and neglected land.

 The 12 Community Forests (including the Mersey Forest) set up under Community Forests Programme (administered by the Countryside Agency) were envisaged as pilot projects. Through this Programme the Countryside Agency planned to test out the idea that "community forestry" could provide signficant benefits for the local community. Partners in many other areas could apply the lessons learnt and promote community forestry projects without national support, while the continued existence of the twelve pilot forests would stand or fall on the basis of the value placed on them by organisations in their locality and region.
<P>

<a name="30616w03.html_para8">The commitment to support the pilot Community Forest projects was for a period of 10 years from 1995. I am considering the current position in the light of the development of regional agendas and strategies, including Regional Forestry Frameworks that are being brought together by the Forestry Commission. These frameworks will be owned by Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies. It appears likely that the Regional Forestry Frameworks will be the main vehicle for securing regional ownership for a mainstream role for community forestry in Government Office and Regional Development Agency strategies and future business plans.

 There is not a specific "Pub is the Hub" scheme. A good practice guide of that title was published in December 2001 to inspire rural pubs to diversify their services. However, the Vital Villages Community Service Grant, administered by the Countryside Agency on behalf of Defra, can be used to fund "Pub is the Hub" style projects. Levels of funding for this type of project since April 2001, when Vital Villages was launched, were &#163;9,048 for 2001&#150;02 and &#163;14,262 for 2002&#150;03.

 I assume this question concerns the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) a common constituent of aerosol products and a known contributor to the formation of tropospheric ozone which has been widely researched, and which is known to cause damage to ecosystems and to human health, primarily to the respiratory system.

<P>

<a name="30616w04.html_para15">Since 1990 overall UK emissions of VOCs have fallen by approximately 44 per cent. to 1514 kilotonnes in 2001. Under the National Emission Ceilings Directive we are committed to further reductions to 1200 kilotonnes by 2010.
<P>

<a name="30616w04.html_para16">Estimated emissions of VOCs from aerosol household products makes up about 0.5 per cent. of total UK VOC emissions. This amounts to approximately eight kilotonnes out of the 2001 total of 1514 kilotonnes. Spray furniture polish constitutes a relatively small proportion of the total aerosol household products category.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our policy aims for ports are to promote competitiveness, high national safety standards and best environmental practice. 'Modern Ports', published in November 2000, set out a range of specific initiatives designed to help the ports industry rise to challenges it faces, and we are making good progress on these. We are also working with European partners and the UK industry to promote and develop effective, efficient and sustainable coastal and short sea shipping.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what financial assistance has been given to the British ports sector since 1997 to improve services; and if he will make a statement on proposals to increase the number of large ports in the UK.  [118280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In general we believe that port developments should not need public subsidy, but each case is judged on its merits and if there is evidence of market failure and the project offers worthwhile economic and/or environmental benefits, it may qualify for an element of public funding. For example, since 1997 the Government has awarded three freight grants worth a total of over &#163;15 million to three UK ports to assist with capital projects designed to remove freight from road and onto to water. Information on other possible sources of public funding given to ports is not held centrally. Proposals to develop new ports are primarily matters for the private sector companies involved, subject to obtaining the statutory consents required.

 A substantial programme of work is in hand to implement Sir John Wheeler's recommendations on airport security.

Useful progress is being made in all of these areas.

<a name="30616w05.html_para4">Sir John's review was confined to security at airports rather than in the air.

When in force, following ratification by 10 States, the 2002 Convention will significantly increase the amount of compensation available for death or personal injury claims to fare-paying passengers travelling on international services by sea. It will also make it easier for claimants to access compensation through a requirement on ship owners to maintain insurance cover, and by means of a right of direct action against the ship owner's insurer. The UK actively participated

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w08.html_spnew4"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 Home Office Ministers, the National Director of the Anti-social Behaviour Unit and Members have received wide-ranging representations through formal and informal meetings, visits, and correspondence with members of the public, voluntary organisations, business organisations and local authorities. This has ensured that the White Paper, Bill and the Government's overall drive to tackle anti-social behaviour is based on the experiences of local communities faced with anti-social behaviour from across the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w08.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We are aware that inconsistent sentences are being given for breaches of Anti-social Behaviour Orders around the country. To address this, the Home Office is working with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Lord Chancellor Department (LCD) to draw up a protocol to ensure the court is made aware of the context of the anti-social behaviour on victims, witnesses, and communities when determining sentence. In addition, the Magistrate's Association is producing sentencing guidelines that are scheduled to be published this summer.

<P>
<a name="30616w08.html_spnew6"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Anti-social Behaviour Bill, which will be at Report Stage on 24 June 2003, contains as Part 1 the power to close premises where Class A drugs are being produced, used or supplied and there is serious nuisance.
<P>

<a name="30616w08.html_para4">This power is principally aimed at tackling Crack Houses and has been designed to ensure that any premises where dealers can continue their activities unobserved, and even in safety, can be rapidly closed

 Section 55, which came into operation on 8 January 2003, is one of a package of new measures to move towards a more streamlined and cohesive asylum system. Statistics on the operation of section 55 up to 31 March 2003 were published at the end of May 2003 and we are continuing to monitor the impact closely.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary Benn) met Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons on several occasions in recent months. I met Anne Owers on 9 June 2003 when we discussed a range of issues, including population pressures in prisons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w08.html_spnew10"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The United States is our biggest single extradition partner so I am delighted that it has been possible to reach agreement on a new extradition treaty which modernises the 1977 and 1986 treaties. We hope that it will be possible to bring the new treaty into effect later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w08.html_spnew11"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 In December 2002, the Government published the first National Crack plan. It recognises the particular problems caused by crack cocaine and the need to take specific and focused actions to address them. The Plan requires action to prevent crack use, deal with the criminality and disorder associated with it and provide appropriate treatment for those using crack. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jun 2003 : Column 29W</I><P>
That we are treating crack as a priority is illustrated by the power to close crack houses contained in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill. Premises, in particular crack houses which are venues for Class A drugs, to be supplied and used causing serious nuisance to the community and neighbours will be closed rapidly and effectively.
<P>

<a name="30616w08.html_para5">As a whole, the resources available to fight drugs are increasing from &#163;1.026 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;1.483 million in 2005&#150;06. We will ensure that in this expansion all elements of the drug strategy apply to crack, enabling:

 The reclassification of cannabis is designed to continue to deter the use of cannabis while allowing the police to redeploy their resources to tackling more serious offences, including dealing in Class A drugs. It is vital that the police direct their resourcing priorities to tackling drugs, such as heroin and crack cocaine, which cause the most harm and often lead to other crimes, and this is what the reclassification of cannabis will enable them to do.

<P>
<a name="30616w10.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government are not currently planning to commission an assessment of the impact fee-charging cash machines have on those on low incomes.
<P>

<a name="30616w10.html_para12">Issues regarding cash machines will, however, be considered as part of the Government's ongoing monitoring of payment system issues.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will regulate fee-charging for ATM withdrawals.  [118944]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w10.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Cruickshank report of March 2000 rejected the idea of directly regulating the retail charges for ATM cash withdrawals or banning such charges. The Government agrees with this finding and currently has no plans to regulate fee-charging for ATM withdrawals.
<P>

<a name="30616w10.html_para13">The costs of providing unrestricted access to cash, 24 hours a day at thousands of locations around the country are considerable. It is a matter of commercial judgment for ATM owners whether to pass these costs on to customers in the form of retail charges. Such charges allow ATMs to be located where otherwise it would not be cost effective to do so. Nevertheless, the Government do not think that it would be appropriate for ATM owners to charge customers in excess of reasonable costs.
<P>

<a name="30616w10.html_para14">Recent years have seen a large increase in the number of ATMs&#151;over 32 per cent. since March 2000. This expansion in the UK's network of ATMs has been to the benefit of consumers.
<P>

<a name="30616w10.html_para15">The Government remain committed to introducing legislation to give the Office of Fair Trading new regulatory powers to promote effective competition in payment systems&#151;and aims to do so as soon as parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Mortgage Interest Relief was withdrawn with effect from April 2000. This tax relief is now only given on loans, taken out before 9 March 1999, and used by people aged over 65 to purchase life annuities. These loans have to meet certain conditions&#151;for example, the loan must be secured on the borrower's main residence. Loans replacing such loans may also qualify for relief. There are no plans to change the rules governing this relief.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to advertise <i>(a)</i> the changes in the system for claiming for housing and council tax benefit, <i>(b)</i> the loss of the automatic right to help with health costs and <i>(c)</i> the loss of the automatic right to milk tokens following the changes in the child tax credit; and if he will make a statement.

 The introduction of the child tax credit has caused no changes in the rules for claiming housing or council tax benefits. As before, these benefits are adjusted to take into account tax credit income. Families on income support or income based jobseeker's allowance who are also in receipt of housing and council tax benefit have been notified about the introduction of tax credits. If they require any information or require help with their tax credit claim, they can go to their local Jobcentre Plus Office.
<P>

<a name="30616w11.html_para5">Low income families will remain entitled to help with health costs and milk tokens while they receive child tax credit. The Inland Revenue has published a leaflet, "WT6&#151;Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit&#151;Other Types of Help You May Be Able To Get", which explains how the tax credits can help families receive other benefits such as having health costs met and getting milk tokens. The leaflet is available from Inland Revenue Offices and Enquiry Centres and online at the Inland Revenue website.

 The father should contact the Inland Revenue to bring to an end the tax credit award made to him and his wife and make a fresh claim for tax credits in his name alone. In these circumstances, the Revenue will do everything it can to see that the new award is set up as quickly and smoothly as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what orders have been given to the Reserve Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell for the withdrawal and then re-issue of desert combat clothing; and if he will make a statement.  [119197]<P>

<P>

 In accordance with Materiel Regulations for the Army, the Reserve Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell withdraw from demobilised Reservists all additional kit above standard TA clothing scales, with the exception of next to skin items such as Socks and T-shirts. Desert Combat Clothing (DCC) is not part of standard TA clothing scales and is therefore withdrawn from Reservists. It is standard practice to return laundered kit (including DCC) to stock for re-issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) when hovercraft were last used in military operations by British forces and in what way; and if he will make a statement on hovercraft capability;  [116240]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment has been made of the value of hovercraft to amphibious and other military operations; how many are in service with the armed forces; if there are plans to increase numbers; and if he will make a statement.  [116239]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Hovercraft were used during the recent operations in Iraq for tasks including reconnaissance and mine clearance. The advantages of hovercraft include speed, the ability to access a higher percentage of beaches than conventional craft, the ability to travel over small obstacles and in shallow water and a relatively high level of immunity from the threat of mines.
<P>

<a name="30616w15.html_para5">Currently, the Royal Marines (539ASRM) operate four Griffon 2000 TDX hovercraft. They have the capacity to lift 12 fully equipped troops or 2 x 1000kg pallets of stores and are capable of deployment in C130 Hercules aircraft. It is expected that the current fleet of hovercraft will be replaced in around 2007. There are no

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No funding has recently been allocated to developing the hovercraft. The technology is well established and suitable craft are available as military off-the-shelf procurements or as modifications of commercial civilian designs.

[116242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There have been a number of routine fact-finding visits and meetings involving Ministry of Defence personnel and representatives of industry to establish the military utility of Hovercraft. These have included representations by companies based in the United Kingdom and United States. Most recently the Griffon 8000TD Hovercraft, a larger version of the 2000 TDX hovercraft current used by Royal Marines, was demonstrated to UK Military staff on 15 May 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his latest estimate is of the cost of the war in Iraq.  [119005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs, which the MOD would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises for example&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.
<P>

<a name="30616w15.html_para6">Calculating all the costs of military action will take some time to determine since it will include the cost of ammunition, bombs and guided weapons consumed in excess of peacetime levels and the cost of equipment destroyed and damaged. These sums are likely to be significant. However excluding those costs, the latest estimate is that the net additional cost of Operations in Iraq for 2002&#150;03 will not exceed &#163;1 billion; the amount set aside at spring Supplementary Estimates 2002&#150;03.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> the Secretary of State for International Development and <i>(b)</i> the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance regarding the restitution of the refuse collection system in Baghdad.  [116258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have had no specific discussions with either the Secretary of State for International Development, or the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as ORHA is now termed, concerning the restitution of the refuse collection system in Baghdad. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jun 2003 : Column 55W</I><P>
However, improving sanitation is among the Coalition's top priorities in the reconstruction of Iraq, and the CPA has recently facilitated the removal of almost a third of the 300,000 cubic metres of refuse that it is estimated remain uncollected in Baghdad.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many cluster bombs were used by British forces during the recent campaign in Iraq; and what assessment he has made of the number of unexploded cluster bombs in Iraq.  [116927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom forces used some 66 RBL755 air-delivered cluster bombs, each containing 147 bomblets, for which recent statistics show an overall failure rate of 6 per cent. and some 2,098 artillery-delivered L20 extended range bomblet shells, each containing 49 bomblets, which have a proven maximum bomblet failure rate of 2 per cent. Further evaluation of the latter will be required to establish the exact rate on the ground. We do not have comparable assessments for the rates of unexploded cluster munitions not delivered by UK forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w15.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Providing a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for the coalition. The United Kingdom itself has made a significant effort to educate the local population in its area of operations about the dangers of mines and unexploded ordnance, but the actual responsibility for developing a programme for the removal of landmines rests with the Iraq Mine Action Centre (IMAC) and not the UK military. The UK and the IMAC are in the process of marking and documenting around 400 unexploded ordnance sites. In addition to this, the UK has, with the support of UNICEF and the ICRC, developed a Theatre Mine Risk Education programme. A poster and leaflet campaign has been carried out, head teachers in Basrah have been briefed and military teams are delivering mine and unexploded ordnance awareness training to primary and secondary schools on a daily basis using material approved by the ICRC. In addition to this, local radio stations are informing the local population about unexploded ordnance and encouraging them not to tamper with anything that has either been marked as or may look like unexploded ordnance.

<i>[holding answer 11 June 2003]:</i> A coalition-wide operation is currently underway to check and mark all suspected areas of mine and unexploded ordnance contamination. In addition to this, the United Kingdom has made a significant effort to educate the local population in its area of operations about the dangers of mines and unexploded ordnance. UK forces, in conjunction with the Iraqi Mine Action Centre (a part of the Office of the Coalition Provisional Authority), are in the process of marking and documenting around 400 unexploded ordnance sites in the UK area of operation in Southern Iraq. Radio broadcasts are being used to inform the population of marking practices and encouraging them not to tamper with the markers. A Theatre Mine Risk Education Programme has been developed with the support of UNICEF and the ICRC. A poster and leaflet campaign has been carried out, head teachers in Basrah have been briefed and military teams are delivering mine/UXO awareness training to Primary and Secondary schools on a daily basis using material approved by the ICRC.

In addition, a number of MOD officials have met from time to time over the past five years with Sri Lankan Ministers and officials, both in the UK and in Sri Lanka.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30616w17.html_para0">Partnerships provide a legal framework within which general practitioners, as independent, self-employed professionals, organise themselves to provide general and personal medical services. The Government is committed to equality for female GPs and the new general medical services contract, if accepted, facilitates good human resource practice and improved working lives for all general practitioners, including a wider range of employment options.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what assessment he has made of the benefits to the public of the new form of conditional fee agreement introduced by his Department on 2 June.  [118709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The new form of conditional fee agreement (CFA) will for the first time enable people to enter into lawful agreement with their solicitor that in the event of winning the action the claimant will receive all of their damages and the solicitor will recover their reasonable fees from the losing party. People will have a clear choice between solicitors offering simple CFAs of this type and those offering other forms of CFA or funding arrangement. The simplified CFA is the first step in a programme the Government will be taking forward with key stakeholders including consumer groups to review and simplify the overall CFA regime. We would like to see a regime that it is easier for the consumer to understand and for solicitors to use and against which it is harder for mischievous challenges to be brought. The Government will be publishing a general consultation paper in the next few weeks and will be consulting widely to identify views and the specific actions needed.

 It is not possible to provide an answer to the question in the terms asked.
<P>

<a name="30616w17.html_para1">The Legal Aid Board's 'Legal Aid Franchise Quality Assurance Standard' (LAFQAS), which is also known as a franchise, was replaced by the Legal Services Commission's (Legal Services Commission) Specialist Quality Mark (SQM) in April 2002. All franchised organisations were passported through to the SQM level. Solicitors' offices can hold both a General Civil and Criminal contract under these standards.
<P>

<a name="30616w17.html_para2">As at 31 March 2000, 4,010 solicitors' offices and other organisations held franchises with the Legal Aid Board. As at 4 June 2003, 5,994 solicitors' offices and other organisations held the SQM.
<P>

<a name="30616w17.html_para3">Solicitors' offices accounted for the majority of these organisations.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the amendments set out in section 13 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 allowing wider use of Administration Orders at county court level to resolve cases of debt without recourse to bankruptcy will be implemented.  [118426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Government have concluded that section 13 will not be implemented in its current form, due to concerns over its feasibility. While some aspects of section 13, such as the three year time limit on orders, are welcome in that they would provide certainty for both debtors and creditors, its implementation would remove the current parameters to the scheme while not providing any safeguards, such as the opportunity to deal with physical assets and investigation into misconduct. The Government are consequently considering a wide range of options for reform in this area and will publish a paper on options for change later in the year. In the meantime, I refer my right hon. Friend to the White Paper "Effective Enforcement" issued by my Department in March 2003 for further details.

<a name="30616w17.html_para7">Continuing representations made by and on behalf of the legal profession have, with the co-operation of the Paris Bar, secured certain of the benefits which associated with implementation of the Directive. In the light of this and of the action taken by the European Commission, before the European Court of Justice, the Government have taken the view that separate representations from them would not add anything at the present time; however we are continuing to monitor the position.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how the Department is intending to remove the funding advantages that would be given to foundation hospitals in the south east, and other areas of high prices, from the sale of land and property.  [106809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 April 2003]:</i> The establishment of the national health service foundation trusts will not reduce the amount of capital available for developing NHS services for NHS patients. Proceeds from NHS trust asset sales are not added to central funds but instead remain in the local health economy. The creation of NHS foundation trusts will not therefore reduce the central funding available to the NHS. There will be no unfair funding advantages that will accrue to asset rich trusts.

<P>
<a name="30616w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with stakeholder organisations, through the Fire Safety Advisory Board, to refine our proposals to reform fire safety legislation, on which we consulted last year. Although the consultation exercise formally ended on 22 November 2002, we took the decision to take account of any further comments received while consideration of responses was being conducted. That work is now largely complete and we expect to be in a position to bring legislation, in the form a Regulatory Reform Order, before Parliament in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="30616w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Although basic credit approvals are mainly issued by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, the total is determined as part of departmental spending plans. For 2003&#150;04, each individual local authority's share of the total depended on

<a name="30616w23.html_para8">The basis for distributing basic credit approvals for each of the individual service elements identified at 1. above differs:
<P>

<a name="30616w23.html_para9"><i>The Department for Education and Skills</i> uses a needs based formula for credit approvals which is split 40 per cent. based on pupil numbers and 60 per cent. on the building condition need. This formula does have a regional weighting factor, which is based on a relative assessment of building costs in the area. Worcestershire's weighting factor is 0.96 and Warwickshire's is one.
<P>

<a name="30616w23.html_para10"><i>The Department for Transport</i> bases its allocations on the length of networks and numbers of bridges etc. It also factors in the relative size of backlogs compared to the national picture. Some adjustments may be made to allocations based on information supplied by the Government Office, local authority and Department for Transport, which can take account of cost differentials.
<P>

<a name="30616w23.html_para11"><i>The Department of Health</i> allocation of BCAs is based on two factors: tender price indexing for social housing (TPISH) and an authority's population figures. As both 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jun 2003 : Column 89W</I><P>
Worcestershire and Warwickshire are in the West Midlands region, the same TPISH figure will apply. Population figures are split into three age groupings (based on Census 2001 data) which are weighted. Allocation differences will arise from the individual local authority population differences.
<P>

<a name="30616w23.html_para12">In addition to basic credit approvals, local authorities also receive supplementary credit approvals from Departments and these are mostly allocated following a bidding process. In these instances, local authorities supply the cost data supporting their bids, which are then assessed and processed by the relevant Government Departments.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what size of shire county he estimates is sufficient to produce reliable statistics for the calculation of the labour cost adjustment made by his Department.  [118947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minster considers that each pre-reorganisation county area outside London and its fringe area is of sufficient size to produce reliable labour cost factors for use in the funding formula, with the exception of the Isle of Wight.
<P>

<a name="30616w23.html_para13">During the consultation on the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister accepted that the Isle of Wight has a New Earnings Survey sample size, which is not large enough to ensure stable labour cost factors over time. Accordingly, the Isle of Wight has been grouped together with Hampshire for the calculation of the area cost adjustment.

<P>
<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minster has received no correspondence regarding the area cost adjustment in recent years from Berkshire county council, which ceased to exist in 1998.

<P>
<a name="30616w23.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Michael Foster: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the impact of allocating additional resources to (i) Warwickshire, (ii) Gloucestershire, (iii) Birmingham and (iv) Dudley in the form of area cost adjustment, and <i>(b)</i> the impact on Worcestershire of not receiving such resources;  [118950]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30616w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The area cost adjustment (ACA) is a top up in the grant formula, which provides extra grant to areas with higher labour and business rate costs. It is directed at those areas which, because of labour market pressures, have higher recruitment and retention costs. The following table shows the size of the ACA formula top up for four key services for the authorities named above. These figures correspond to those given in the 'simpler presentation of formula outcomes tables', produced for the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement, detailed in the table.

<P>
<P><I>16 Jun 2003 : Column 98W</I><P>
for Retirement" (Cm 5677-Chart at page 51) noted that, in 2001&#150;02, more than half of all employees were contributing to a private pension. The Family Resources Survey 2001&#150;02, on which the relevant Green Paper material was based, indicated that 11.8 million employees (45 per cent. of the total) were not at that time contributing to a private pension. Many of these may, of course, have private pension provision to which they were not contributing at that time.

 We are still considering responses to the consultation document "Equality and Diversity&#151;Making it happen" on future institutional support for equality legislation including the submission from the Disability Rights Commission. We will be making a statement on the broad shape of future arrangements in due course. The challenge for Government is to ensure that whatever decisions are made deliver a structure which serves the needs of all people covered by equality legislation including disabled people.

<a name="30616w26.html_para6">7. Management information data for financial year 2000&#150;01 is not available for all local authorities. The total for Great Britain includes estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures for financial year 2000&#150;01 have been rounded to two significant figures.<P>

<a name="30616w26.html_para7">8. Information for 2001&#150;02 is from a count of prosecutions and sanctions completed by all local authorities; this data is collected from local authority subsidy returns. Subsidy data may differ from management information data (shown for financial year 2000&#150;01) at local authority level; however, analysis shows a high level of consistency between the two data sources at national level.<P>

<a name="30616w26.html_para8">9. The DWP figures are from the Fraud Information By Sector database, which shows completed cases commenced in the relevant period. Due to the elapsed time between commencement of an investigation and completion of a prosecution there are cases that are inserted into previously completed data for earlier periods. All DWP totals are therefore correct at the time when quoted but subject to adjustment at a later date<P>

<a name="30616w26.html_para9">10. In accordance with National Statistics Guidelines all DWP figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Due to rounding process totals may not agree.

<P>
<a name="30616w26.html_spnew5"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Around one million people in Scotland received a winter fuel payment for the winter of 2002&#150;03. Information broken down by constituency and local authority is not yet available but figures for 2001&#150;02 are given in the tables. Most, but not all, people aged 60 and over are eligible for a winter fuel payment. The majority of entitled people receive their payments automatically but some have to claim and, because of this, we cannot provide a percentage of eligible people who received a payment.
