The CSA assesses Child Maintenance liability on the basis of a non-resident parent's income and transfers payments to the person who is responsible for the child's day to day care.

<i> [holding answer 14 June 2010]:</i> The nature and volume of work undertaken by the UK Border Agency in Kent has changed over recent years following the introduction of the juxtaposed controls in Northern France. This, along with the need to establish a local immigration team in neighbouring Sussex, resulted in a review of the structure and size of the local immigration team in Kent. Working together, staff and local managers, have designed a structure which reduces the overall number of staff in Kent, by significantly reducing the number of managers. As a result of the planned restructuring, there will actually be more frontline, arrest-trained officers across Kent and Sussex. These changes are not expected to result in any compulsory redundancies.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory, which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

 My Department does not hold this information. Being a councillor is not a job, it is a vocation. Accordingly councillors do not receive salaries, rather they receive allowances designed to ensure that being a councillor does not leave them out of pocket. The roles of the councillor will vary from authority to authority, ward to ward and even person to person. It is for each authority to determine how best to organise their meetings and for each councillor to determine how best to organise his or her work-load.</p>

 Concluding the Doha Round is a high priority for the UK Government, and we are working with the EU to secure an ambitious deal as soon as possible. The liberalisation of environmentally friendly goods and services is an important part of the negotiations. The World Trade Organisation's Committee on Trade and Environment is mandated to take forward these negotiations, and all parties, including the EU, have reaffirmed their commitment to the negotiations. However, progress has been slow, primarily due to difficulties with defining environmental goods.</p>

 On behalf of the Secretary of State, the 2nd PUS chairs a Defence Environment and Safety Board (DESB) which monitors and reviews performance, including that of the Defence Ordnance Safety Board (DOSB). The DOSB's concerns were highlighted in the DESB's report to Defence Board and Defence Audit Committee. The department recognises that there are issues with the state of some of its ammunition storage depots which, if not attended to, would become increasingly serious. Our requirements for ammunition storage will be reviewed in the light of the strategic defence and security review and this may mean that some storage depots can be shut altogether. We will consider work to address any defects in the depots that remain open in the context of the forthcoming planning round.</p>

 The following table shows the numbers of claims leading to orders being made for the repossession of property in the Harlow constituency by mortgage lenders in each year since 2000 and landlords in each year since 2003. Data for previous years are not available due to the lack of valid postcodes. These statistics are not available at smaller geographies. We are currently investigating how we can put these into the public domain without inadvertently revealing the identities of people who are subject to a possession order. I will write to the hon.
