 The effect on the structural and surface conditions of a road as a result of an increase in heavy goods traffic is dependent on the prior condition of the road. A detailed survey of a particular road would be necessary to establish the prior structural and surface conditions in order to assess the impact of future traffic. However, motorways in England are well built and typically a busy motorway carries 20,000 heavy goods vehicles per day. A doubling of this flow is likely to have a significant effect on the structural and surface conditions. On the A class roads, the type of construction and the structural and surface conditions are extremely variable. It is not possible to produce a similar estimate.</p>

In 2006-07, the share of &#147;A&#148; rated air conditioning appliances had increased to 15 per cent., and the share of &#147;B&#148; rated appliances dropped to 50 per cent. However, a small number of new air conditioners, which also act as heaters, have appeared on the market. These are less efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="70725w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07072573000437">A domestic &#147;A&#148; rated air conditioner is expected to use around 320 kWh/year of electricity. For comparison, a three bed-roomed semi-detached house built to 2005 Building Regulations and without electric heating, is expected to use around 4,250 kWh/year of electricity. The purchase of an &#147;A&#148; rated air conditioner, and its associated energy consumption would therefore result in additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of around 138 kgCO2 /year. The 72,300 domestic air conditioners purchased in 2006-07 would therefore be expected to increase CO2 emissions by at least 9,900 tonnes CO2  per year.</p>

Under the EC Regulation No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases, users of air-conditioning equipment must ensure that any detected leakage is repaired as soon as possible. More complex domestic equipment will need to be installed by a qualified person once further European Commission proposals currently under discussion are agreed and implemented.</p>

 DEFRA, in partnership with the Bovine TB Husbandry Working Group, has produced guidance for farmers to reduce the risk of TB transmission.

 Following a bovine TB (bTB) breakdown we aim to confirm the presence of the disease at herd level by post-mortem inspection and culture of Mycobacterium bovis in the laboratory. We do not culture samples from every single animal slaughtered, and so it is not possible to identify the proportion of slaughtered animals with confirmed TB. It is also important to note that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory does not mean that an animal was not infected with bTB.

These include both regional and national &#145;meet the buyer&#146; events and support for a series of guides aimed at making it easier for regional and local food producers to supply both supermarkets and the food service sector. In addition, we have helped facilitate more local sourcing of food by providing funding to address issues such as distribution, marketing and the encouragement of new outlets.</p>

 Employers invest very substantial time and resources in the skills of their employees. In 2005 employers reported that they spent around &#163;33 billion on training (including the wage costs of trainees). However, Lord Leitch&#146;s review of skills last year set out the major challenge ahead if the UK is truly to be a world leader in skills by 2020. The Government have recently published &#145;World Class Skills&#146;, setting out how we will implement the Leitch review in England. This says that achieving the change in culture that the Leitch ambitions demands, will require a major new investment of time, effort and money by employers and individuals. But it also says that Government have a responsibility to support them, and &#145;World Class Skills&#146; sets out how we will meet that responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_596"><a name="70725w0008.htm_para3"><a name="07072579000174">Government have a range of support in place designed to motivate employers to invest in the skills of their employees. This includes Train to Gain, Apprenticeships and Foundation Degrees. Train to Gain is a major new service that will raise skills levels and the quality of training across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="70725w0008.htm_para4"><a name="07072579000175">Train to Gain offers a holistic service to employers. Independent and impartial skills brokers work with the employers to identify how skills might help them meet their business goals, including increased productivity. The Skills Brokers help the employer identify possible sources of public funding available, as well set out the employer investment, in both cash and in paid time off for employees to study for the relevant qualification. Training when appropriate is often held on the employers premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="70725w0008.htm_para6"><a name="07072579000177">From 2008-09, employers will be able to access matched funding for level 3 programmes as part of the package they put together with skills brokers, and we will continue to develop the higher level skills offer in the light of the current Higher Level Skills Pathfinders. We will also support discrete Skills for Life programmes as well as those embedded within level 2 programmes for those who do not already have a level 2 qualification.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]:</i> In Rwanda, DFID provides support worth &#163;4,250,000 through non-governmental organisations towards anti-retroviral therapy and community based care to 2,500 HIV positive women genocide survivors and their families. The number of people on treatment in Rwanda has risen from 4,000 in 2003 to 37,200 in March 2007 with national incidence of the spread of HIV/AIDS stabilising at around 3 per cent.</p>

Evidence shows that anti-retroviral treatments are effective, with an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 premature deaths averted in the developing world in 2005 alone. Overall, in low- and middle-income countries the trends are upwards, from 400,000 in 2003 to more than 2 million people on treatment today.</p>

 It is the UK Government&#146;s policy that patents are owned by the body carrying out the research. It is DFID&#146;s policy that any new anti-retroviral treatments developed by publicly-funded research should be made available at the lowest possible price (eg cost price) for public markets in developing countries. The organisations involved in developing the new treatments have negotiated intellectual property agreements individually with their various private sector partners. The organisations developing the new treatments also use cost per treatment as one of the criteria to determine which products to take forward in their portfolios.</p>

This means that Lesotho does not classify as a heavily indebted poor country (HIPC). However, the UK is committed to ensuring debt relief for all IDA-only low income countries that can use the resources effectively for poverty reduction. Lesotho would qualify for DFID&#146;s Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative once its public expenditure management systems are effective enough to ensure funds can be spent on the intended purposes of poverty reduction.</p>

Lottery funding also provided &#163;42 million to support scaling up of the original pilots across five government regions between 2002 and 2004. The Department spent &#163;0.75 million in 2001-02 and &#163;0.3 million in 2002-03 on administering and evaluating the NSFS pilots. The national rollout to all local education authority infant, primary and special schools across England of the scheme was completed at the end of 2004 and in the year 2004-05, the Department spent &#163;28.5 million on the Scheme.</p>

As the Scheme has developed, we have been able to achieve efficiencies in its overall administration and the supply and distribution of the fruit and vegetables which has resulted in spending on the scheme reducing over the last year.</p>

At that stage, the children who participated in the evaluation had only been receiving free fruit and vegetables since June 2004. The results provided a useful insight into the initial impact of the Scheme but it was recognised that further work would need to be undertaken to measure the impact of the Scheme over a longer period. In 2006, we commissioned a further evaluation of the Scheme and the report will be published shortly.</p>

 The 2006 Budget announced a rationalisation of the number of inspectorates and proposals to significantly reduce the cost of inspection by around a third in the medium term. The Audit Commission is on target to meet this reduction as a result of a more targeted and proportionate approach to inspection and a reduction in the volume of inspections needed for CPA. In its commission to the local services inspectorates, the Government made it clear that they expected the new assessment and inspection regime as a whole to reduce the burdens on the inspected and fit with the Government&#146;s commitment to a one-third reduction in the cost of public service inspection by 2008.</p>

 Demand for housing is high. That is why the Prime Minister increased the annual housebuilding target for 2016 from 200,000 to 240,000 new homes a year. As set out in the Budget, the time limited stamp duty land tax relief should help to generate interest in the market for zero carbon new homes. The Government have set a target that from 2016, all new homes will be zero carbon. Furthermore, a recent survey found that 92 per cent. of respondents want to see sustainability features offered as options on new homes.</p>

 The costs of zero carbon homes and non-zero carbon homes vary depending on the technologies and construction products used. A regulatory impact assessment was undertaken to support the Government's announcement that from 2016, all new homes will be zero carbon. The regulatory impact assessment sets out the estimated cost of a zero carbon new home in 2016 above the cost of a non-zero carbon home. The regulatory impact assessment can be found on the Department's website and in the Library of the House.</p>

The waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&#151;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time.</p>

 Local authorities' borrowing powers are laid down in the Local Government Act 2003. Authorities are free to borrow without Government consent, provided that they can afford to service the debt from their own resources. Authorities would require the Government's consent to borrow other than in sterling, but apart from that may obtain their loans from any source. That includes borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board or seeking &#147;lender's option borrower's option&#148; loans from private sector banks. Authorities may also raise finance by issuing bonds, again without Government consent. Information on authorities' issues of bonds is not held centrally. We have no plans to give authorities a power to securitise, since they can obtain the same level of finance more simply by borrowing on the strength of their revenue streams.</p>

We therefore felt it essential to wait for the SGC, who are responsible for publishing definitive sentencing guidelines for all criminal offences for England and Wales, to produce guidelines to ensure consistency in sentencing. Although the guidelines will not apply to Scotland, it seemed sensible to implement the offence at the same time in all the areas concerned.</p>

 The review mentioned in the answer of 3 July 2007 was an internal review of the policy on retirement ages of the judiciary and was intended to inform and advise the then Lord Chancellor about the retirement age policies currently in place. It was carried out by officials in the former Department for Constitutional Affairs and was timed to advise the Lord Chancellor ahead of the coming into force of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, in October 2006. The advice was not published. Following the advice, the Lord Chancellor concluded that no changes would be made to the current policies on retirement ages of the judiciary.</p>

 The purpose of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is to hold a record of a person's DNA which can be matched against DNA taken from crime scenes.

<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]:</i> The new scanners are able to automatically read more data from passports and other travel documents than the old swipe system, which means that fewer details have to be input manually and improved security and fraud checks can be undertaken. They are also able to read the new biometric chips, providing immigration officers with an additional tool to combat identity fraud.</p>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is underway to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Ministry of Justice reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Michael Gibbons review was published on 21 March. Alongside the Gibbons review, we published a consultation document seeking views on ways of helping resolve employment disputes successfully in the workplace. That consultation closed on 20 June 2007, and we received over 400 responses to it. We are analysing the responses received and will publish the Government response when it is ready, in the autumn.</p>

<i> FAE</i><br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the national health service, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> The ICD10 Codes used to define alcohol related conditions are as follows:</i><br>
T5l&#151;Toxic Effect of Alcohol<br>
K70&#151;Alcoholic Live Disease<br>
F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol<br>
<i> Age</i>:<br>
Data is for those who were between 13 and 19 years old at the start of the episode<br>
<i> Admission Method</i>:<br>
 Admission method 21 and 28 were selected for A &amp; E admissions<br>
This data is for patients admitted to hospital as an inpatient, via A &amp; E. This does not reflect the number of A &amp; E attendances.<br>

 The national health service is required to undertake a wide range of pre and post employment checks, as set out in guidance issued by NHS Employers in May 2005 on safer recruitment. The guidance covers all procedures for the full range of checks to be made, before appointment of anyone in the NHS. It applies to all NHS settings. The Healthcare Commission monitor NHS trusts on their compliance with the guide. A copy of this guidance, entitled &#147;Safer Recruitment, A Guide for NHS Employers&#148;, has been placed in the Library.</p>

However, CRB checks are limited to the United Kingdom and will not reveal anything on staff who have just entered the UK for the first time. NHS Employers guidance states that employers who recruit staff from abroad should carry out the necessary police checks in line with that country&#146;s justice system and UK requirements.</p>

<i> Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> FCE with an Operation</i><br>
A count of FCEs with an operation is the number of episodes with at least one coded procedure field. More procedures are carried out than finished consultant episodes with an operation. For example, patients undergoing a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures&#151;removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one&#151;counted in a single finished consultant episode.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected, in the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 In December 2005, the Department announced that &#163;88.2 million would be allocated to local authorities in 2007-08 via the child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) grant. This grant is to be used by local authorities to improve CAMHS, in accordance with local needs and priorities, as set out in local CAMHS development strategies. In 2007-08, &#163;50 million has been made available to strategic health authorities for CAMHS as part of a larger bundle of revenue funding for the national health service. In 2007-08, we have also made available to the NHS &#163;31 million of capital funds for investment by providers of CAMHS. Bids for these funds have been invited and priority will be given to projects which will help to eliminate the inappropriate use of adult psychiatric wards for children and young people.</p>
