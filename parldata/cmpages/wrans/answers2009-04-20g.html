However, this will contribute only a small part of the estimated &#163;2.1 billion tourism gains for the UK as a whole that will result from the games in the period 2007 to 2017.

 The European Initiative on the Exchange of Young Officers Inspired by Erasmus, sometimes known as military Erasmus, is focussed on European exchanges at the initial officer level.</p>

These three different courses all last approximately one academic year. The training has a strong focus on UK specific elements such as legal issues and specialist equipment training, with the aim to prepare officers for the next stage in their training on more specialist military courses. It would therefore not be practical to train officers at other nations&#146; institutions.</p>

Similarly the higher proportion of, and the opportunity for, exchange training for UK officers comes later in officers&#146; careers.</p>

 One of the core recommendations from the Gregg review of conditionality was the creation of a new &#145;Progression to Work&#146; group. Gregg recommends that this new approach should be for those people who may not be ready to work immediately, but who with the right mix of support and encouragement could get back into employment. This model would apply to employment and support allowance claimants (other than those in the employment and support allowance support group) and lone parents, and partners of benefit recipients, with children aged one to six. The Progression to Work pathfinders have been created as a result of this recommendation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90420w0027.htm_para1"><a name="09042124000445">The claimants involved in the Progression to Work group will be required to actively engage with their adviser on an ongoing basis to consider, discuss and agree an action plan comprising activities they think will improve their prospects of moving back into work. They must then undertake these agreed activities as part of their own journey towards employment following directions from advisers where these are strictly necessary. This will be underpinned with recourse to sanctions for those failing to engage with support without good cause. However, although still in the Progression to Work group, lone parents and partners of benefit recipients, with children aged one and two will be encouraged, rather than required, to undertake work related activity and will not be sanctioned for refusing to undertake work related activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90420w0027.htm_para2"><a name="09042124000446">This pathfinder will cover approximately 10 to 15 per cent. of the new employment and support allowance claimants and parents with a youngest child aged between one and less than seven nationally. Based on current inflows, this equates to roughly 65,000 employment and support allowance claimants, 60,000 lone parents and 10,000 partners of benefit recipients each year. These pathfinders are anticipated to begin in late 2010 and last for two years. They are likely to be across six districts and delivery will be a mixture of provider led and Jobcentre Plus led.</p>

Based on published caseload projections, we estimate that approximately 17 per cent. of existing customers will be covered by these pathfinders. Estimates will be refined as part of the tendering process for the pathfinders and will be published at the Pre-Qualification-Questionnaire stage.</p>

3. Figures for August 2008 will be revised when the new quarter&#146;s data are released.<br>
4. Data shown are quarterly due to the frequency of the 5 per cent. data.<br>
5. Caution should exercised when looking at the August 2008 quarter as this maybe deficient due to a proportion of claims being received late. The best statistics on benefits are now derived from 100 per cent. data sources. However, the 5 per cent. sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100 per cent. data sources.

 1. Baseline published projections of expenditure on pensioner benefits assume that the basic state pension is increased by earnings from 2012.<br>
 2. Estimates given show the gross additional basic state pension spend due to increasing the basic state pension by earnings from 2010 and implementing the 2007 Pensions Act reforms from April 2010. During the next Parliament, we will re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.<br>

 4. In the financial years up to and including 2013-14 Treasury Economic assumptions consistent with PBR 2008 have been used to model earnings uprating. After this point a long term earnings growth assumption of 4.93 per cent. has been applied.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases the UK Border Agency's Case Resolution Directorate plans to resolve in each quarter of <i> (a)</i> 2009, <i> (b)</i> 2010 and <i> (c)</i> 2011. [242838]</p>

The Home Office does not collect figures on the percentage of seizures analysed by individual suppliers. However, as the FSS is the largest forensic supplier, it is likely that it tests around two thirds of the total seizures referred for forensic analysis.</p>

 Cannabis seizures made by law enforcement agencies are usually submitted to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) Ltd. to provide only a confirmed identification and weight. Only a small proportion of cannabis seizures are further examined to determine the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, as a result of a customer request; customer requests for cannabidiol content are extremely unusual.</p>

The cannabidiol content of cannabis resin varied between 0.1 to 7.3 per cent., with a mean content of 3.5 per cent. In today&#146;s market, seizures of cannabis resin are comparatively rare compared to herbal cannabis.</p>

 The original ministerial announcement of funding to the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners (CRFP) in 1999 was expressly subject to the CRFP&#146;s performance, particularly the condition that it became self-financing through registrant&#146;s fees and there should not be a long-term reliance on grant.</p>

This was likely to become considerably worse because of the withdrawal of support for the registration process by police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="90420w0035.htm_para8"><a name="090421105000647">The grant was latterly provided by the National Policing Improvement Agency, who last year jointly commissioned with the CRFP an independent analysis of CRFP&#146;s finances.

 CCTV is a powerful crime fighting tool. Police operational experience and various research studies show that it deters and detects crime and helps secure convictions. It can also reduce fear of crime. CCTV works best as part of a package of measures to deal with specific events and crime problems.</p>

The main points of the review will be summarised and made available to police forces by the summer.</p>

 Visa services deploy a range of indicators and checks concerning the quality of decisions to issue a visa. These include sampling of decisions by Entry Clearance Managers, spot checks on whether applicants have left the UK, refusals of visa holders at ports of entry and monitoring of compliance when in the UK. In addition, the use of biometrics allows us to identify those who have entered the UK on a visa but subsequently destroyed their ID papers. This information is fed into risk profiles to inform future visa decisions. UKBA is also employing structured decision-making techniques to improve consistency in decision-making.

A National Youth Theatre tour, funded through the programme, has also given young people an opportunity to educate their peers on the risks and consequences of knife carrying.</p>

Young people have contributed to the campaign&#146;s development and are encouraged to share the campaign messages with their peers. The campaign has used a range of radio, viral, online and poster adverts as well as events and competitions to get the messages across. Over 10,000 people are also members of the campaign&#146;s thriving Bebo community, providing young people with an online forum to share their views and take a stand against knife crime.</p>

 Following the success of a 12-month trial in 10 police forces, the Home Secretary agreed on 24 November 2008 to allow chief officers of all forces in England and Wales, from 1 December 2008, to extend the use of Taser to specially trained units in accordance with current Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) policy and guidance. This sets out that Taser can only be used by specially trained units where officers would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject(s). The number of specially trained officers in each police force is a matter for individual chief officers based on their own operational requirements.</p>

 On 2 March 2009, the indicative revised prioritisation of Building Schools for the Future (BSF) was published, based on the revised expressions of interest which authorities provided in November 2008. Partnerships for Schools (PfS) the body which assists local authorities procure their BSF investment, is already engaging with authorities to discuss their readiness to deliver. No project will formally enter BSF until PfS is satisfied that there is robust evidence that the authority is ready to deliver. It has therefore not yet been decided which will be the next authorities to enter the programme after 2010-11.</p>

</ul><a name="90420w0055.htm_brev1"><a name="090421105012043"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ofsted recognises that inspecting provision and outcomes for deaf or hearing impaired pupils requires particular specialist knowledge and skills with regard to issues such as language development, communication methods, and acoustic conditions.</p>
</ul><a name="90420w0055.htm_brev2"><a name="090421105012044"><ul><p class="tabletext">You asked how Ofsted ensured that its inspectors had adequate levels of training and expertise in education for the deaf and communication with deaf children. Ofsted has a small core team of four Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) who are specialists in the inspection of sensory impairment who are routinely deployed in the inspection of schools for deaf and hearing impaired pupils. Ofsted also requires our contracted Regional Inspection Service Providers to provide inspectors who are suitable for each individual inspection. Every effort is made to inspect special schools with inspectors who have expertise in that particular field. Where there is specific provision for pupils with SEN in mainstream schools, then every effort is made to provide the inspection team with an inspector with expertise in the particular field of SEN provided by the school. Training on inspecting special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, special schools and pupil referral units was provided for HMI and Additional Inspectors (AI) during 2008, and is being updated for the coming year. All inspectors have access to extensive guidance available to support this area of work.</p>

These contracts will cover all the inspection remits in schools and colleges, apprenticeships, adult skills and initial teacher education. The procurement process for the new contracts has provided the opportunity for Ofsted to renew the commitment of its contractors to deploy appropriately skilled and specialist additional inspectors for each school's context, including those with deaf children.</p>

 Information on the number of GCSEs sat for young people in custody are not collected centrally.

These data show that during the 2008 academic year, for young people under the age of 18, there were 106 GCSE achievements between grades A and C, and 159 GCSE achievements below grade C. However, these figures do not reflect all of the GCSEs achieved in juvenile custody because this does not include young people in Secure Children's Homes, Secure Training Centres, or private prisons. Also some of the young people in Young Offender Institutions are still registered at schools and colleges and therefore any GCSEs that they achieve whilst in custody will be reflected in achievement figures of schools and colleges, rather than the figures reported by the LSC for those achieved in custody.</p>

They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority&#146;s previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department&#146;s time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

This response provides data based on the size banding used when analysing inspection outcomes for Ofsted&#146;s Annual Reports. These also include the figures on small schools (primary schools with 100 pupils or fewer, and secondary schools with 600 pupils or fewer), previously provided in response to Parliamentary Question 258254. Data identifying the total number of pupils on a school&#146;s roll in each academic year are derived from the Annual School Census produced by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Please note that schools for which the number of pupils on roil is not available have been excluded from this analysis.</p>

Under the school inspection framework used between January 2000 and August 2005 (commonly known as Section 10), the school&#146;s overall effectiveness judgement was made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. Since September 2005, the overall effectiveness judgement has been made under the current school inspection framework (commonly known as Section 5) using a four point scale: outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate. Tables A to D show the percentages of primary and secondary schools by grade for each academic year since January 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="90420w0065.htm_para0"><a name="090421105010757">No child with special educational needs (SEN) should be denied admission to a mainstream school because of staffing levels. They are protected against being treated worse then other children in the admissions process. For children with SEN statements, under section 324 (5) (b) of the Education Act 1996, local authority maintained schools, including maintained mainstream schools, are required to admit pupils whose statements name the school. The statements may set out extra staffing resources to meet the child's needs. The statutory School Admissions Code says that admission authorities and school governing bodies must ensure that their admission arrangements are fair and do not unfairly disadvantage particular social or racial groups including children with SEN. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, children with SEN who also come within the definition of disability under that Act are protected against discrimination in the matter of admissions on the ground of disability and their parents can make claims to the First-tier Tribunal (SEN and Disability) or to local admissions panels if they feel their child has been discriminated against.</p>

The total school workforce staff (teacher and support staff) has grown by 42 per cent. since 1997, with the number of teaching assistants having increased by 12,700 between 2007 and 2008. Full-time teacher vacancies in local authority maintained schools were running at 0.7 per cent. in East Sussex, the same percentage as for England as a whole.</p>

 Energy supply companies are required to meet carbon reduction targets by promoting the installation of energy efficiency measures under CERT. Insulation measures make up a significant percentage (62 per cent.) of energy suppliers&#146; progress towards their targets to date (as end December 2008). We are currently consulting on expanding the CERT by 20 per cent. and on extending a CERT mechanism beyond March 2011 to 2012. We hope that these two proposals, in combination with work to improve the exchange of information between the insulation industry and energy suppliers, should help to generate greater continuity and confidence in the market and lead to appropriate investment.</p>

 On 11 September 2008 the Prime Minister announced the Home Energy Saving Programme which included a 20 per cent. uplift to the level of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and a new obligation, the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). These schemes operate as obligations on the energy suppliers (and the electricity generators in the case of CESP) to achieve carbon savings by encouraging households to take-up energy saving measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="90420w0072.htm_para9"><a name="090421136000347">The figure of &#163;910 million refers to the estimated extra investment suppliers and generators will need to make in order to deliver these additional obligations. No Government funding is involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_635"><a name="90420w0072.htm_para10"><a name="090421136000348">In terms of CERT, Ofgem, the scheme administrator, does not collect data on energy supplier spend. However, based on the costs of the measures promoted by suppliers, we estimate that the overall spend by suppliers on delivering the 20 per cent. increase to the CERT obligations will be around &#163;560 million. However, we expect the CESP to lead to supplier and generator investment of some &#163;350 million by 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="90420w0072.htm_para11"><a name="090421136000349">The proposals for CERT and CESP are currently subject to public consultation.</p>

No official record of the meeting was kept, although after the meeting we sent JCC members an e-mail confirming the meeting's conclusion that they should send us any final comments on the document. I have previously placed on the website, and in the House Library, a copy of the consultation document. This explains the part played by the JCC in helping my Department consider the NIA's application and in identifying where further information was needed. The questions which we asked as a result of this process, and the NIA's revised application, were also published as part of the consultation document.</p>

 Analysis undertaken for the Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) consultation document suggested that to meet our 2020 target, we may need about a quarter of the UK&#146;s renewable energy to come from biomass-fuelled heat and electricity. A range of biomass sources will be required, including purpose-grown energy crops, wood, and organic wastes such as wood and food waste, manure and slurry. The RES consultation document referred to a previous estimate that there is potential to plant an additional 350,000 hectares of energy crops across the UK by 2020.

In one scenario presented in the consultation, the shares of technologies were: 13 per cent. renewable energy from onshore wind, 19 per cent. from offshore wind, at least 5 per cent. from biogas heat and 3-4 per cent. from marine power sources.</p>

 The Governance of Britain Green Paper set out to tackle the problems that power remains too centralised and too concentrated in Government and some people have become cynical about the political process and disengaged from it. It also set out to explore how the United Kingdom can benefit from articulating a shared understanding of what it means to be British.</p>

Numbers in the team varied, with the maximum being the equivalent of 21 permanent members of staff, added to which a number of other staff within the Constitution Directorate have contributed to the delivery of various of the proposals. It would, however, entail disproportionate cost to determine the precise number of staff time devoted to the delivery of each of the proposals in the Green Paper.</p>

 The available figures, extracted from the dataset used to compile &#147;Sentencing Statistics, 2007&#148; published in November 2008, are contained in the following table. The maximum penalty has increased from two to four years imprisonment for offences committed after 12 February 2007. These penalties relate to possession of a knife. Where a knife is used to commit a crime a more severe sentence will be imposed. In some cases (e.g. for grievous bodily harm with intent) this could be life imprisonment.</p>

 The Charity Commission's regulatory case report into Age Concern England and its Heyday membership scheme raises some wider issues for the charity sector.

The ongoing inquiry into Green Crescent is a matter for the Commission who notified us that they had opened an inquiry under section 8 of the Charities Act 1993. However, in accordance with its normal practice, the Commission will publish a statement of the results of the inquiry setting out its findings and any wider lessons once the inquiry is completed.</p>

 The Charity Commission&#146;s regulatory case report into Age Concern England and its Heyday membership scheme raised some wider issues for the charity sector. In particular, the report highlighted the importance of strong governance arrangements alongside accountability and transparency. The Office of the Third Sector promotes good governance in the third sector, for example through the leadership and governance workstream of Capacitybuilders&#146; National Support Services Programme. In relation to the Department&#146;s funding of the charity sector, appropriate controls and monitoring arrangements are in place both before any grant funding is awarded, and for the duration of any funding agreement.</p>

 As the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, the Charity Commission is not subject to ministerial direction or control. The Commission's statutory objectives were recently reviewed and updated in the Charities Act 2006. This included increasing public confidence in charities, promoting compliance by charity trustees with their legal obligations in exercising control and management of the administration of their charities, promoting the effective use of charitable resources and enhancing the accountability of charities to donors, beneficiaries and the general public. The Commission has wide powers of intervention where there is evidence of misconduct or mismanagement. It operates a risk-based approach to the regulation of charities. This is set out in its published Risk and Proportionality Framework, and I have placed a copy in the House Library.</p>

1. Estimates for 2002 and earlier periods are based on SIC(92). Estimates for 2003 onwards are based on SIC(03).<br>
2. Estimates for 2005 and earlier periods are on a different basis to those from 2006 onwards. A preliminary assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests that the estimated total number of employees (for GB at the whole economy level) was reduced by around 1 per cent. Direct comparisons of employee estimates should therefore be treated with caution.<br>

 Short single journeys by helicopter are discouraged by the Royal Household and do not normally take place at a distance of 50 miles or less. However, use of the helicopter on official visits where several short journeys may take place, permits the maximum number of engagements to take place in a day. This makes best use of the Principal's time and minimises the disruption to the public when car journeys and a police escort may be used as an alternative.</p>

 BERR has had two recent reviews carried out by the Carbon Trust, on its headquarters estate. The second, run in April to May 2008, was a follow-on to previous work done under the energy efficiency accreditation scheme (EEAS) which closed in March 2008. As a result of the second review, BERR was given certification under the new Carbon Trust Standard; this was awarded to the Department on 2 July 2008.

 BERR are continuing to work towards achieving the energy efficiency targets expressed in the Sustainable Operation of the Government Estate (SOGE) framework. Our main strategy has been to gain efficiencies through a reduction in the physical size of its estate and the number of buildings occupied.

The campaign's purpose is to give clear information about how many units are in alcoholic drinks and to raise awareness of the risks to health of regularly drinking too much. Its messages are being released across television, press, outdoor, radio and on-line channels.</p>

 The 2009-10 and 2010-11 revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) were made on the basis of a new funding formula, recommended by the independent advisory committee on resource allocation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_978"><a name="90420w0106.htm_para3"><a name="09042240003296">The funding formula determines PCT target allocations. Actual allocations to PCTs depend also on the pace of change policy&#151;how additional funding is distributed to move PCTs towards their target allocations. It is therefore not possible to say what the allocations would have been in 2009-10 and 2010-11 if the previous funding formula had still applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_980"><a name="90420w0106.htm_para5"><a name="09042240003298">Enfield PCT moved from being 0.1 per cent. above target under the previous funding formula at the close of 2008-09 to opening 2009-10 under the new formula at 2.3 per cent. above target. This means that under the 2009-10 and 2010-11 pace of change policy, Enfield PCT received a 10.6 per cent. average increase in funding over the two years, equivalent to a cumulative cash increase of &#163;44.1 million.

 It is the responsibility of the board of the trust, with the new leadership in place, to ensure it fully implements the recommendations made within the Healthcare Commission's (HC) report.

the action plan. CQC, which replaced the HC on 1 April 2009, has informed us that they plan to take stock with the trust and Monitor at three months and perform a follow up review in approximately six months time to provide the necessary assurance that all the recommendations in the HC's report have been satisfactorily addressed.</p>

In addition, Monitor has written to all FTs making clear the expectation that their boards should consider the contents and recommendations of the HC report and implement any actions to ensure they do not breach their terms of authorisation. In his letter, the chief executive made clear that where senior NHS management and boards fail to act in the light of the HC recommendations to assure the ongoing quality and safety of the care they provide, they must and will be held accountable.</p>

Dr. David Colin-Thom&#233; is undertaking a rapid local review to identify what the people who commission NHS services and manage the performance of these services across England can learn from this case. The new National Quality Board (NQB) has been asked to look at how we can ensure that any early signs that something is going wrong with patient care are picked up immediately, that the right organisations are alerted, and that action is taken quickly. (The NQB is comprised of representatives from the Royal Colleges, patient groups, regulatory bodies and clinical experts, and has been set up to look at how organisations work together to improve the quality of patient care and patient experience.) Any recommendations arising from these reviews will be shared with the wider NHS for action as necessary.</p>

1. The NHS Information Centre have provided the number of finished consultant episodes and finished admission episodes for diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-10 J00 to J99). The data has been presented for England, and broken down by hospital provider for the years 2003-04 to 2007-08. From the term 'respiratory complaints' the NHS Information Centre are unable to provide a definitive list of respiratory conditions without specification of the conditions required. Clinical input would be required to confirm that the condition was a 'respiratory complaint'. The data provided is for 'diseases of the respiratory system'. As a result the figures provided may provide an under count of episodes and admissions.<br>
2.The NHS Information Centre are unable to provide data at individual hospital level and have therefore used the appropriate hospital providers of the requested hospitals:<br>

The Hillingdon Hospital NHS Trust - which includes Hillingdon Hospital<br>
West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust - which includes West Middlesex University Hospital<br>
Richmond and Twickenham PCT - which includes Teddington Memorial Hospital.<br>
3. There is a shortfall of data for West Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust in 2006. Six months of the year were effected by an error when submitting data.<br>

We will also continue to support research into new TB treatments. DFID recently made a new &#163;18 million funding package to the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.

Despite the Government of Nepal making repeated commitments to promoting respect for human rights, they have made limited progress. They have however taken steps towards the proportional inclusion of minorities in all organs and at all levels of the state. They have also increased the budget for the national human rights commission, and has discussed the introduction of a bill to establish a truth and reconciliation commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1102"><a name="90420w0118.htm_para4"><a name="09042249000575">The continuing impunity for past and ongoing human rights abuses remains a key concern. It has encouraged a lack of respect for the law which encourages people to turn to violence to resolve disputes. Poor public security, particularly in the Terai (plains), where there is a proliferation of armed groups, is a major obstacle to improving human rights in Nepal. We are also concerned at the increase in intimidation and violence against journalists which is leading to self-censorship by journalists. Political interference in police investigations is commonplace and we continue to receive reports of torture in police custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1103"><a name="90420w0118.htm_para5"><a name="09042249000576">Our embassy in Kathmandu closely monitors the human rights situation. During the past year we have raised our concerns, including at ministerial level, about attacks on the media, freedom of expression and movement, excessive use of force by the security forces, and the need to discharge minors from the Maoist people&#146;s liberation army. We will continue to engage with the government of Nepal both bi-laterally and in conjunction with the EU, other international partners, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to urge it to meet the commitments it has made to uphold and promote human rights. Our embassy is also supporting the efforts of civil society to combat impunity, through advocacy, training and work on legislative reform.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 April 2009]:</i> We are gravely concerned about the expulsion of 13 international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the closure of local organisations including the Sudan social development organisation. The EU statement issued on 10 March 2009 specifically mentions the local NGOs and calls on the government of Sudan to reconsider their decision.</p>

 Our ambassador in Tashkent makes a significant contribution to regular human rights reporting by EU Heads of Mission. These reports, supported as necessary by interventions by our representation in Brussels, play a key role in driving the agenda for the EU Human Rights Dialogue with Uzbekistan. We are preparing for the next round of that dialogue, which is due to take place on 10 June 2009 in Tashkent. Our aim is to contribute towards an EU approach that is both critical and constructive.</p>
