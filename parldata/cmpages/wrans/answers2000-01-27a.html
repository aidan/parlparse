<a name="00127w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he took, following his oral statement of 28 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 564-76, to ensure that contrary opinions to the official view of the HMS Glorious affair were fully taken into account in the latest revision of the official account; and if he will make a statement.  [104751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The circumstances surrounding the sinking of HMS Glorious have been most thoroughly researched within the MOD, during which opinions and interpretations from a wide variety of sources have been considered. In the course of these exhaustive investigations some new information has come to light which has enabled the MOD to make further minor revisions to the account already provided. This new information incudes the fact that it was the Commander in Chief Home Fleet who insisted that the Glorious should be diverted to Scapa Flow to conduct a court-martial, and not the captain of the carrier himself. In addition, since January 1999, the Naval Historical Branch has been able to track down the daily intelligence summaries which show that the late Sir Harry Hinsley's recollections, broadcast in the Channel 4 programme, were in error. These records, which in the original, are signed off by Sir Harry show that Bletchley Park did indeed report increased wireless signal traffic in the Western Baltic and the Kattegat during the relevant period, but that the assessment of experts at the time was that it was associated with U-boat activity, and not that of heavy German surface ships.
<P>

<a name="00127w01.html_para0">This extra information does not bring into question the conclusions arrived at in the MOD paper reviewed by my predecessor after the adjournment debate in this House in January last year. I shall arrange for a copy of the revised paper, incorporating these slight amendments to be placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his policy regarding equal opportunities for women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and those from social classes IIIM, IV and V in the armed forces.  [106573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Armed Forces Equal Opportunities goal, published in March 1999, is to achieve universal acceptance and application of a working environment free from harassment, intimidation and unlawful discrimination, in which all have equal opportunity, consistent with our legal obligations, to realise their full potential in contributing to the maintenance and enhancement of operational effectiveness. The armed forces respect and value every individual's unique contribution, irrespective of their race, ethnic origin, religion or gender and without reference to social background or sexual orientation.
<P>

<a name="00127w01.html_para3">Members of the armed forces are exempt from the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Disability or a history of disability is not compatible with the need for a combat effective fighting force, able to undertake a full range of military operations anywhere in the world. Service personnel disabled on duty are, depending on circumstances, allowed to continue to serve as long as such service will not undermine overall combat effectiveness. This approach reflects the Services' duty of care to the individual and allows them to benefit from the individual's experience and ensures a return on their training investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what information British forces in Kosovo have given to the Kosovar population about measures to reduce exposure to the insoluble radioactive alpha-particles given off by depleted uranium dust.  [106925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The health risks from DU have been assessed as low. It is unlikely that anyone other than those in an armoured vehicle penetrated by a DU projectile, or those spending prolonged periods within a few tens of metres of the point at which a DU penetrator had impacted with a hard target, would be exposed to large enough quantities of particulate material for them to receive a radiation dose greater than 20-30 millisieverts. For comparison purposes, the UK statutory annual dose limit 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2000 : Column: 226W</I><P>

 Reconstruction and remediation is primarily a matter for civil agencies within the international community rather than specifically for NATO or the MOD. However, British forces have played their part--particularly in the clearance of unexploded ordnance.

<a name="00127w01.html_para4">The UN report on the consequences for the environment of the Kosovo conflict was published on 5 October 1999. Preliminary radiation measures were taken from destroyed military vehicles and from around the heavily damaged Police Station and Post Office in Pristina. No indications of DU contamination were found, although the report acknowledges that this does not exclude the possibility of DU-contaminated areas elsewhere in Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Naval patrols in the Falkland Islands are undertaken by the Falkland Islands Guard Ship (currently HMS Somerset) and a Castle class Offshore Patrol Vessel (currently HMS Dumbarton Castle) supported by a Royal Fleet Auxiliary Vessel (currently RFA Grey Rover). The Guardship maintains a presence in the Falkland Islands area for most of the year, but can, on occasions, be held at longer notice to allow the ship to carry out other activities elsewhere. Other Naval assets also deploy to the area from time to time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his recent letter to the hon.

[107028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have not authorised any senior naval officer to make a statement on medical services in the Royal Navy, nor have I been asked to do so. This Government have long recognised the problems we inherited in the Defence Medical Services (DMS), the most significant of which is the shortage of manpower. We are committed to ensuring that our Armed Forces have the medical support they require and, following the Strategic Defence Review, we have made an additional &#163;140 million available for the DMS over the four years to 2001-02 for medical equipment and personnel. In December 1998, we announced a new strategy for the DMS, covering a range of measures, a key element of which is the creation of a Centre for Defence Medicine 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2000 : Column: 228W</I><P>
(CDM). The University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust has been selected as the host Trust for the Centre which we plan to open in April 2001. As well as being the professional focus for the DMS, and providing clinical services, the CDM will be an important centre for military training and research and we believe it will encourage recruitment and retention of DMS personnel.

<a name="00127w03.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will make a statement on Council Decision 1999/C 322/04 (C322 of 10 November 1999), with reference to the <i>(a)</i> manner of legislative implementation in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> consequences for extradition arrangements;  [106403]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact on UK law of the German initiative on increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting the euro, set out in document 11302/99 of 5 October 1999; what court of law would try UK cases; and what supreme court would take final appeals.  [106429]

<P>
<a name="00127w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 An amended version of Germany's initiative on increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting the Euro was "agreed in substance" at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in December. The text agreed was similar to that deposited for scrutiny with the House in November (reference: 12585/99). The text did not receive final approval at the Council because a number of member states, including the United Kingdom, held parliamentary scrutiny reservations, and because the European Parliament had not yet given its opinion. The Council hopes to adopt the Framework Decision in March.
<P>

<a name="00127w03.html_para0">The draft Framework Decision, as provisionally agreed in December, contains three main legislative implications for the United Kingdom. First, the United Kingdom would be required to ensure that pre-circulation Euro notes and coins are covered by United Kingdom legislation. This requirement would be met by Part I of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 in relation to pre-circulation Euro notes, and Part II of the 1981 Act in relation to pre- circulation Euro coins. The Forgery and Counterfeiting (Protected Coins) Order (1999) designates Euro coins as protected coins within the meaning of Section 27(1) of the 1981 Act. Second, the United Kingdom would be required to take jurisdiction over counterfeiting offences committed in whole or in part within the United Kingdom's jurisdiction. The Government intend to meet this requirement through an amendment to Part I of the Criminal Justice Act 1993. Finally, should the United Kingdom adopt the Euro, the United Kingdom would be required to take universal jurisdiction for cases of counterfeiting of the Euro (i.e. to empower United Kingdom courts to try offences of counterfeiting of the Euro which had been committed anywhere in the world).
<P>

<a name="00127w03.html_para1">Cases of counterfeiting of the Euro within the United Kingdom's jurisdiction, like all other criminal offences, would be tried by United Kingdom courts, and the normal avenues of appeal would apply. I do not expect the draft Framework Decision to have any consequences for the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements.

 It is not our practice to disclose the negotiating positions of member states. Following discussion at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December of the United Kingdom's application to participate in parts of the Schengen acquis, no objections remain to the United Kingdom's partial participation in the Schengen Information System.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria govern decisions by the Prison Service to make out-of-court settlements; and what changes there have been to these criteria in the last 10 years.  [106141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In deciding to settle out-of-court, the Prison Service will take professional advice as to the likelihood and financial implications of the claim succeeding, and will normally agree to settle out-of-court those cases where it considers the claim is likely to succeed and the proposed settlement figure is at or below the level a court is likely to award. Savings in costs are also taken into account, as are any wider operational or public policy implications of the case.
<P>

<a name="00127w03.html_para2">This approach has not changed over the last 10 years, but in handling claims the Prison Service has of course taken into account developments in the law and the civil justice system. The Woolf reforms to civil justice encourage out of court settlements.

 The average weekly cost per prisoner in each category of prison is listed in the tables in cash terms and at 1992-1993 prices, when the Prison Service became an Executive Agency. Data have been obtained from the Prison Service Annual Reports and Accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many incidents of self-harm were recorded by people held in <i>(a)</i> court cells and <i>(b)</i> on prison escort, in each of the last five years.  [106113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information systems used by the Prison Service do not allow a differentiation between incidents of self-harm committed by people in court cells and on prison escort. The information available on self-harm incidents of people while on prison escort undertaken by private sector companies acting under contract to the Prison Service is the total number reported to the incident management support unit (IMSU) in Prison Service headquarters. These figures are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="00127w04.html_para1">Care should be taken when interpreting the data because, although the majority of incidents of self-harm occur while in court, some incidents do take place in cellular vehicles. In addition, it should be noted that responsibility for the escorting of prisoners to and from court was progressively contracted out in England and Wales between April 1993 and August 1997. Consequently, the figures for 1995-96 and 1996-97 are low because incidents involving prisoners under escort by prison staff would have been recorded against the establishment involved, while those relating to prisoners in police custody would have been collected locally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the weekly cost of accommodating an inmate in each of the mother and baby units in the United Kingdom.  [106143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 At present no separate budget is allocated to the mother and baby units. The cost of running the unit is met from the individual establishment's central budget. Mother and baby units (MBUs), do not have a standard cost as the physical accommodation offered is different in each one. Additionally, the regimes offered differ from prison to prison depending on its security category and its function within the female estate. The information requested is given in the table.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The term employed by the Prison Service in England and Wales to refer to an apparent suicide is "self-inflicted death". This is broader than the term suicide and includes all those deaths where it is clear that the person has acted specifically to take his/her own life. It is not restricted to the official verdict from the Coroner's inquest, where verdicts of "suicide", "open" or "misadventure" may be recorded in cases where there was doubt about a person's intent to end their life.<P>

2. Self-inflicted deaths while on escort from prisons are included in the overall annual figures shown in the table. <P>

<a name="00127w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his policy on Article 18 of the Draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, between the member states of the European Union, with special reference to the legal status of UK amendments and declarations.  [106395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 On 2 December 1999 the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a legally-binding Declaration on the scope of Article 18 of the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the member states of the European Union. This makes clear that, in the United Kingdom, Article 18 will apply to interception warrants issued by the Secretary of State to the Police Service and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise for the purpose of the detection of serious crime. The Declaration also applies Article 18 to interception warrants issued to the Security Service for this purpose (in accordance with its remit under the Security Service Act 1996).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what number of intercepts his Department estimates will be requested annually, by member states, under the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters; and if he will break down that estimate by category of criminal activity.  [106397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the number or category of requests since this will be determined by the requirements of other member states once the draft Convention is agreed and ratified. However, any request for mutual legal assistance to intercept the communications of a person in the United Kingdom will need to meet the criteria for issuing a warrant for the purpose of the prevention or detection of serious crime under the United Kingdom's legislation on interception of communications.
<P>

<a name="00127w04.html_para2">Serious crime is defined in the Interception of Communications Act 1985 as conduct which, if it took place in the United Kingdom, would constitute one or more offences if, and only if:

 As indicated in the reply I gave to the hon.

When completed, the register will form part of the PHOENIX database and the principal stakeholders will be the police service and the Police National Computer Directorate. The success criteria will be the establishment of a computer system accessible on-line to all police forces and containing details of all persons who have applied for a firearm or shotgun certificate or to whom a firearm or shotgun certificate has been granted or whose certificate has been renewed. It is not possible at this stage to give a firm date but it is hoped that the system will be up and running by the summer of 2001.

 Apart from a presentation which was given by the Police National Computer Directorate at Hendon on 11 February 1997, no staff of the Operational Policing Policy Unit (OPPU) have attended specific meetings to discuss the proposed implementation of the database. The initial work to establish the database was undertaken by a working group set up under the auspices of the Association of Chief Police Officers Sub-Committee on the Administration of Firearms and Explosives Licensing, on which OPPU is not represented. We have no plans to place ephemeral papers considered by the group in the Library, but copies of final documents such as the user requirement and detailed impact assessment have been or will be made available in this way.

 Development of the national firearms database currently features in the Police Information Technology Organisation's business plan for 2000-01. Development could not have begun earlier because the resources available were required for projects of even higher priority. It has not been piloted and the next step is to carry out a detailed impact assessment which should be completed in April. It is not possible to give a firm implementation date at this stage but it is hoped that the system will be in place by the summer of 2001. I propose to monitor the situation carefully.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2000]:</i> There were no compassionate grounds in relation to Mr. Tyson which affected my decision to admit him. In reaching my decision one of the factors to which I gave particular weight was the lack of consistency in the effect of the Immigration Rules. I also considered the likely effect of cancellation of the fight on those who had already purchased tickets and smaller enterprises and individuals who were probably least able to bear any losses.
<P>

<a name="00127w05.html_para0">I weighted these factors against the nature and seriousness of Mr. Tyson's convictions and I decided on balance that the exceptional circumstances of this case were such that Mr. Tyson should be granted entry solely for the purpose of participating in the scheduled sporting event.

 The Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaties by the Treaty of Amsterdam, provides that the United Kingdom is bound by Community measures adopted under Title IV only where it opts in to any measure. The Government will decide whether to opt in to the draft Directive on family reunification within three months of the formal publication of the proposal and will inform Parliament accordingly. The Government's Explanatory Memorandum on the proposal, submitted for scrutiny on 10 January, provides an initial analysis of the impact of the draft Directive on United Kingdom law were the United Kingdom to opt in to this measure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w07.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the Government's policy is on indirect discrimination; and if he will make a statement.  [107345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government are committed to achieving a step change in race equality in this country. The Race Relations (Amendment) Bill is part of our programme to ensure that the public sector sets the pace in this drive towards equality. We want to send the clearest possible message that discrimination is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. The Government are, therefore, proposing two changes to strengthen the provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00127w07.html_para4">First, after very careful deliberation we have decided to extend the indirect discrimination provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976 to the functions of public authorities to be newly caught by the Act and we will bring forward an amendment to provide for that. The Government have always been in favour of this in principle, but were concerned to ensure that such a provision would be effective without leaving public bodies open to routine legal challenge in circumstances where their policies were entirely proper. Since the Bill was published, however, we have listened carefully to the arguments put forward about the issue and have concluded that, on balance, the risk of spurious challenge is outweighed by the principle of including indirect discrimination in respect of public sector functions in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="00127w07.html_para5">Direct and Indirect racial discrimination is already prohibited under the Race Relations Act 1976 in the fields of employment, training, education, housing and the provision of goods, facilities and services in respect of the public and private sector. The Act is already being extended by the Bill to new fields in the public sector which have previously been determined by case law not to be a "service" and to which prohibitions on direct or indirect discrimination did not, therefore, apply. The Act will now extend to areas such as the implementation of central and local government's regulatory, economic and social policies and law enforcement in respect of indirect discrimination as well.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2000 : Column: 248W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00127w07.html_para6">Secondly, the Government also see the promotion of equality as a positive way of eliminating unjustifiable indirect discrimination in these and other fields. Our setting of targets for ethnic minority recruitment, retention and promotion and our guidelines for mainstreaming race equality into policy development and implementation are examples. We are already committed to placing the promotion of equality by public bodies on a statutory footing. We will reinforce that commitment by bringing forward a Government amendment to the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill to enshrine the principle on the face of the Bill as a positive duty, leaving room for consultation on how the duty will operate in practice and how it will be enforced.
<P>

<a name="00127w07.html_para7">The amendments will be brought forward at Commons Committee stage. We are meanwhile considering whether there should be any procedural safeguards consistent with the principle of non-discrimination.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to reform attendance centres.  [107346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In January last year, we set up a small working group, including attendance centre representatives and other experts, to consider the centres' future operation. It made a number of useful proposals for reform of their management and operation, including developing more individual programmes to tackle offending problems.
<P>

<a name="00127w08.html_para0">For the 84 junior attendance centres, we have decided to combine reforms on these lines with organisational changes to match the philosophy of the youth justice reforms launched in the Government's November 1997 White Paper, "No More Excuses--A New Approach to Tackling Youth Crime in England and Wales".
<P>

<a name="00127w08.html_para1">From April 2000, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales will take over from the Home Office the central responsibility for commissioning and funding junior attendance centres. The Board will invite youth offending teams to start taking over as local agents for these centres from April, that is generally from chief officers of police. Close liaison with the police will continue, through police membership of youth offending teams. The local changes will be made first in a number of pilot areas. They will also be invited to develop the centres' programmes in line with the working group's principles, and liaise with the courts to ensure centres play an appropriate role in the new range of youth justice disposals.
<P>

<a name="00127w08.html_para2">Senior attendance centres, which cater mainly for offenders aged 18 to 24, will remain the responsibility of the Home Office nationally and the police locally. Their future operation will be reviewed in the context of the adult sentencing framework.

 Measures in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 which allow courts to impose a community service order, a curfew order or disqualification from driving on fine defaulters instead of sending them to prison are being piloted in Norfolk and Greater Manchester. A report on the findings from the pilots will be published soon and a decision taken over whether or not to make the provisions available nationally.

 The new appeal procedure would be fast and efficient with determination within forty-eight hours in most cases. Our estimate is that even if as many as a quarter of defendants who had been refused Crown Court trial were to appeal, the cost of the resulting hearings would be less than &#163;500,000. No additional delay would be caused by these appeals, since they would run concurrently with the progress of the case in the magistrates court.

<a name="00127w10.html_para3">Departments are working together to develop and implement the proposals in the Government White Paper, "Learning to Succeed", and the Social Exclusion Unit's report, "Bridging the Gap", which are aimed at supporting young people in making a successful transition from childhood to adult life.
<P>

<a name="00127w10.html_para4">The estimated cost of restoring full entitlement to Social Security benefits to 16 to 17-year-olds in Great Britain would be &#163;100 million per annum, at present rates for the under 18s. The equivalent cost for Scotland would be in the order of &#163;10 million per annum. These costs do not make any allowance for possible changes in labour market behaviour as a result of these changes.

 The Government have taken firm action to lock in economic stability and open the way to steady growth. Sound public finances and low and stable inflation have greatly enhanced the ability of the UK economy to withstand adverse external shocks. In particular, the Government's symmetrical inflation target ensures that policy can respond quickly to risks on the downside, such as from an unforseen fall in equity prices, as well as to risks on the upside. The Government have also played a leading role in promoting macroeconomic stability across the world, to help reduce the likelihood of future global shocks.

 Yes. The Treasury will set CAT standards for two types of mortgage: one charging variable interest rates, and one charging fixed or capped rates. Like the CAT standards for individual savings accounts, CAT standards for mortgages will define products with reasonable charges, easy access and decent terms and which can readily be understood.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para0">The standards will be voluntary and non-CAT standard mortgages may be appropriate for many borrowers. But because they will be simple, clear and fair, CAT standard mortgages will help customers to make better informed and more confident choices about mortgage loans. Subject to consultation, FSA's disclosure regime will help prospective borrowers understand how particular mortgage offers measure up to the CAT standards.

<a name="00127w12.html_wqn3"><B> Barbara Follett: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he has decided whether the Financial Services Authority should regulate mortgage lending.  [107385]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w12.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are determined that lenders should not take advantage of mortgage borrowers at a time when they are often vulnerable because their main priority is home purchase. In a modern competitive economy they should expect to be able to finance residential property purchases with confidence that they will understand the nature of the product they are buying and the risks.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para3">The Treasury carried out a consultation exercise in the second half of last year to examine the case for giving the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating mortgage business. This was the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Financial Services and Markets Bill (HC328/HL50) and of the Treasury Committee (HC 73). I am grateful to those in the mortgage industry, as well as borrowers and consumer representatives, for engaging in purposeful dialogue and contributing constructive feedback. The exercise showed that prospective borrowers' main need is better information about the many loans on offer in this competitive and sometimes confusing market.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para4">I have therefore decided that a statutory instrument under the Financial Services and Markets Bill, now before this House, will give the FSA statutory responsibility for regulating nearly all residential mortgages. This will mean that all mortgage lenders will have to be authorised by FSA with specific permission to lend on mortgage. It will not be necessary for mortgage brokers to be authorised unless they also carry out investment business such as advising on endowment policies, where authorisation is already required.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para5">This will make the mortgage market more transparent for borrowers. The new power will enable the FSA to regulate mortgage advertising and to require all mortgage lending activity to include specific disclosure of the main features of the loan. The FSA will consult on its policy approach and rules, including their regulatory impact, later this year, with a view to bringing the new regulatory regime for mortgages into effect next year. These rules will be designed to complement the voluntary Code operated by the Council of Mortgage Lenders. This has helped deliver welcome improvements, for instance in the competence and expertise of mortgage advisers.

<a name="00127w12.html_para6">The introduction of mortgage regulation and CAT standards, which I am announcing separately today, will take place in parallel with several other measures designed to help home buyers. Recent announcements include the proposed revision to the regulations on annual percentage rates (APRs), which my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry laid before the House on 26 November, the package of measures announced by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing on 11 October about improving the house-buying process, and the proposal, announced by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 17 December, to prevent lenders making a compulsory link between mortgages and home insurance deals.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para7">The approach to regulation of the mortgage market reflects the nature of mortgage loans. If information is clear mortgages are intrinsically easier to understand than, for instance, many retail investments, such as endowments. With the new safeguards, we expect there to be many fewer consumers who regret their choice and it will be much easier for mortgage borrowers who do then come to regret their choice to disengage and remortgage at reasonable cost. The FSA already regulates advice on investment products designed to repay mortgages, such as endowment policies.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para8">These complementary measures will improve the quality and coverage of the information available to prospective mortgage borrowers and house buyers. They will deliver the essential protections borrowers need without burdening them with requirements which could unnecessarily slow down the sales process.
<P>

<a name="00127w12.html_para9">I am today making available in the Library a summary of the evidence about detriment in the mortgage market collected in the course of the recent consultation exercise.

 The Government have put in place a number of incentives to ensure public sector assets are managed efficiently. The National Asset Register was published in November 1997, setting out for the first time the assets held by central Government. New incentives to dispose of surplus assets were introduced from 1 April 1998, which allow Departments to recycle receipts from disposals to be reinvested in public sector assets.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has for the budgets of the Greater London Authority, Transport for London, the London Development Agency, the Metropolitan Police Authority and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority for 2000-01 and for the Greater London Authority's precepts for that year.  [107724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I have today issued a consultation paper setting out my proposals to the London boroughs, the ALG, representatives of industry and commerce, predecessor bodies and other interested parties. Subject to consultation, it is proposed to set a consolidated budget requirement for the GLA and functional bodies for 2000-01 of &#163;2,179 million. We estimate that this will support total spending of some &#163;3,600 million. Of this only &#163;333 million will need to be raised from council taxpayers. For a Band D council taxpayer, this is equivalent to about &#163;123 a year in the London Boroughs and &#163;32 a year in the City.
<P>

<a name="00127w14.html_para3">Just &#163;1.70 of this is to fund the additional cost of the new GLA services: about 3 pence a week for a Band D council taxpayer as promised in the White Paper "A Mayor and Assembly for London" (March 1998, Cm 3897). Nearly three-quarters of the council tax goes to fund the Metropolitan police. Since the Metropolitan police district does not include the City, this accounts for the lower cost borne by City council taxpayers.
<P>

<a name="00127w14.html_para4">From 2001-02 onwards the consolidated budget for the GLA and functional bodies will be set by the Mayor.

 The Government have set a target for deciding called-in planning applications within 13 weeks of receipt of the Inspector's Report following the local inquiry. In this case the primary target for decision was 4 January 2000. Although the Secretary of State has not been able to complete his consideration of all the issues raised by this proposal within the primary target, the Government do fully recognise the importance of speedy decisions for the local economy. I therefore expect to be able to issue a decision within the secondary target of 22 February.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the report on signals passed at danger in December 1999 will be published.  [107469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library a copy of HSE's report on signals passed at danger (SPADs) for December. Future monthly reports will be placed in the Library as a matter of course.
<P>

<a name="00127w15.html_para1">In December there were 22 SPADs on the national railway. This figure is lower than for the same month in the last two years and half the December average for the last six years. Taken with the significant improvement in November, the December figure appears to indicate that the measures being taken by the industry to cut down on SPADs are beginning to have a positive effect, although it is of course too early to draw definitive conclusions.
<P>

<a name="00127w15.html_para2">As explained in the October report, Railtrack and the HSE use different criteria to assess the severity and significance of a SPAD. This has led to some confusion as to how to identify for non-specialist purposes a consistent and simple definition by which a SPAD could be considered serious, to the extent that it gives rise to a potential for damage to passengers, staff, or equipment.
<P>

<a name="00127w15.html_para3">Ministers have accepted a recommendation by Her Majesty's Railways Inspectorate to define as "serious" those SPADs which fall into Railtrack's severity categories 3-8. These categories cover those SPADs which lead to a train over-running by at least 200 yards (the normal safety overlap distance) and/or which cause damage or casualties. This definition gives three serious SPADs in December. On this definition there were 14 serious SPADs in October and 10 in November.

 The Government announced on 11 October 1999 a package of complementary measures aimed at making the home buying and selling process in England and Wales faster, more transparent and consumer-friendly. The announcement also highlighted the Government's intention to set up a study to pilot some aspects of the seller's information pack with approximately 250 home sellers in the Bristol area, covering properties in different price bands and in popular and less-popular local housing markets.

<a name="00127w15.html_para4">The pilot was launched on 10 December 1999, and will run for the first half of 2000, reporting in September 2000.

However, the pilot cannot entirely replicate the Government's proposals: there is no element of compulsion; transactions may still experience delays especially where there are chains involving people not in the scheme; and voluntary elements of the Government's proposals are not included, for example faster mortgage processing, and faster release of title deeds.

 Information about the use of Nabishi hand-held radios having caused problems for freight marshalling yards in the railway industry is not available. Problems involving hand-held radios are not statutorily reportable to the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate, unless they relate to a reportable accident or dangerous occurrence as defined by the 'Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995' (RIDDOR).

 Transatlantic air services between the UK and the US are governed by the provisions of an air services agreement, commonly referred to as Bermuda II. The Government will contemplate changes to Bermuda II only on terms which are no less advantageous to the generality of UK interests than to US interests. In determining this balance, the Government have regard not only to the interests of airlines but to the interests of airports (London and regional), the regions in which those airports are situated and the interests of consumers. This approach has guided the Government's consideration of a range of options for a possible mini-deal during the current round of talks.

 In June 1998 we offered to bilateral partners with whom we did not already have liberal agreements unrestricted third/fourth freedom access to all UK airports (except Heathrow and Gatwick) as long as UK airlines were also allowed to operate on the same routes. Fifth freedom rights were not included in the offer and remain subject to negotiation although in evaluating exchanges of rights we do take account of possible regional economic benefits. In the Department's response to the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and the Regions report on Access to Regional Airports we undertook to review this policy.

 The application by the Berkeley Festival Waterfront Company Ltd. for powers to construct the Millennium Tower is subject to the written representations procedure under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The applicants complied with the first stage of this procedure on 20 December by sending to the Department representations on each objection to their application. They did not, however, include in their representations information which had been sought by the Department concerning the proposed use of the Tower. We need to be satisfied that the essential purpose of the Tower would fall within the definition of an observation structure, in order to establish that it would be within the powers of the 1992 Act to make the proposed Order. It would not be appropriate to progress the application further until this fundamental issue has been addressed. We expect the applicants to respond shortly on this issue.

The Department has also been involved in the creation and promulgation of BS7799, the standard for Information Security Management, which is now recognised internationally as an important tool for business in securing their internet transactions. Finally the 1998 Data Protection Act, which will be implemented later this year, ensures that all those who process customer data have to adopt mechanisms to safeguard its privacy.

<P>
<a name="00127w19.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The European Commission's independent Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE) was consulted on the use of six phthalates in toys and child care articles intended to be mouthed. It concluded that these phthalates could be safely used, provided that any leaching from the toy or child care article did not exceed scientifically established tolerable daily intake (TDI) levels. The DTI, on the advice of the Department of Health, has supported the SCTEE conclusions with regard to DINP. As well as being subject to a very high safety margin for use, there is considerable evidence to indicate that humans are much less sensitive to the liver toxicity which rats exposed to extremely high doses demonstrate. Where the UK does consider there may be cause for greater EU-wide restrictions is in the use of another phthalate, DEHP, where scientific concerns have been raised. DEHP is not used in toys in the UK.

<P><I>27 Jan 2000 : Column: 289W</I><P>
does not exceed scientifically established levels, phthalates can be safely used. Testing has shown that products currently on UK shelves do not give any cause for concern. However, given public concern, and to try to bring in a harmonised EU approach, the Commission introduced a Decision, supported by all member states, to ban phthalates in items intended to be mouthed by small children. Phthalates leach only with difficulty, requiring very prolonged chewing before they are dislodged. When we consider the science and the risks, the ban reflects a very cautious approach. Had the science indicated otherwise, the Commission would have proposed a more stringent measure than the current ban.

 I refer the hon. Gentleman to a recent assessment of the potential for renewable energy, including photovoltaics, commissioned by my Department. This has been reported in "New and Renewable Energy: Prospects in the UK for the 21st Century". "Supporting analysis, March 1999--ETSUR-122", a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House shortly; this is also available on the Departmental website at www.dti.gov.uk/renew/condoc.

Several German cities and utilities are also offering premium rates--up to 2DM (70p) a unit--to householders exporting electricity to the grid from PV systems. These extra costs are spread over the remaining majority of electricity consumers in those areas.

 Financial assistance to industry outside England is a matter for the devolved administrations. In England, we have given advice that while discussions continue with the Commission over the new Assisted Areas map, Government Offices will, as a temporary measure, continue to receive applications for RSA from businesses located in the Assisted Areas proposed in July 1999. Government Offices will undertake a full appraisal of such cases but any offers of financial assistance will be conditional on confirmation from the Commission that the location is within the approved map and that the project complies with the appropriate aid ceilings for that area. Similar arrangements are in place in Wales and Scotland. Any area which is outside the Assisted Areas when the map is approved will not be eligible for RSA under Community law. However, in the English regions we have introduced new tier 3 areas which include areas of need outside the Assisted Areas proposed to the Commission. In tier 3, qualifying SMEs may apply for financial assistance from a new discretionary Enterprise Grant scheme.

 Although approval for the North Yorkshire Power Line was given in March 1998 there was an error in the consent documentation resulting in a gap in the line of approximately 160 metres. The filling of this gap had to be the subject of a lengthy legal process, including public consultation. Having considered the representations following that consultation, I have concluded, first, that there is no need to hold a public inquiry before making a decision in respect of this gap in the consents for the line, and second, that it is reasonable to grant the National Grid Company consent for the section of line which was not granted on initial consideration in 1998.

 The analysis underlying "UK competitiveness Indicators 1999" showed that, on average, we work more hours than our main European competitors and yet we achieve a lower national income per head. The analysis showed that, in comparison to France and Germany, both the proportion of population in employment in the UK and the number of hours worked per person employed are relatively high. Despite this, poor productivity means that GDP per head is some 18 per cent. below the average for the G7. The factors underlying this are assessed in "UK Competitiveness Indicators 1999". Closing the gap will require improvements in several areas, including innovation performance, management and work force skills, and entrepreneurship.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action his Department is taking to ensure that broadcasters comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in respect of subtitling on their <i>(a)</i> digital television channels and <i>(b)</i> videos.  [106138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w23.html_spnew9"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 It is for the broadcasters themselves to ensure that they are acting in accordance with the requirements of the Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which relates to access to goods, facilities and services. Broadcasting, like other services to the public is covered by the Act, while the manufacture and design of manufactured goods, such as videos, are not. Broadcasters are also subject to the "Code on Subtitling, Sign Language and Audio Description on Digital Terrestrial Television", drawn up by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) under Section 20 of the Broadcasting Act 1996. The Code is concerned with the access to digital terrestrial television services for people with hearing disabilities and visual impairments. The code requires digital terrestrial broadcasters to provide subtitles on at least 50 per cent. of their services within 10 years of the commencement of digital services. The Independent Television Commission will continue to monitor the performance of commercial DTT channels to ensure compliance with the code. The ITC are currently looking at the implications of the Disability Discrimination Act to ensure that their codes are consistent with it.

 Delivering efficient and modern public services is a key part of the Government's agenda for improving productivity. Greater efficiency is being sought therefore within the public sector to ensure that the most effective results are obtained from available resources. My Department is still in the process of establishing its full range of activities and is committed to delivering improvements in performance within approved running cost limits.

 Responsibility for the monitoring of training services provided under the New Deal for Young People in the London Borough of Waltham Forest rests with the local partnership in the Ilford unit of delivery. The Employment Service has worked with the Training Standards Council--the independent body set up by the Secretary of State to evaluate and report on Government funded work based training--to produce a framework to assess training provision. Part of this process is an annual self assessment that in Ilford's case will take place in February 2000. To inform the inspection process the New Deal Partnership collates details of New Deal participants and information on the achievement of those who have left New Deal options. This information is broken down by gender, ethnicity and disability status. Separate statistics are compiled for each contractor involved in the local delivery of New Deal options.

 Headteachers will be responsible for assessing teachers against national standards to move to the new upper pay spine proposed by the Government. DfEE has contracted Cambridge Education Associates Limited (CEA) to manage the appointment, deployment and quality assurance of external assessors who will verify, through sampling, headteachers' assessments.
<P>

<a name="00127w26.html_para0">The payment of external assessors is a matter for CEA, but it will be made on a pro rata basis dependent upon the number of applicants in each school.
<P>

<a name="00127w26.html_para1">The number of external assessors to be deployed will be dependent upon the number and distribution of teachers who apply to cross the Performance Threshold. This number will not be known until summer 2000. The total cost of administering the scheme will be dependent upon the number of assessments carried out and again this will not be known until later in 2000.

<a name="00127w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Serving judges and applicants for judicial appointment are not asked currently to declare whether they have a disability and no such records are held. Applicants for judicial appointment are no longer asked to give details of their secondary education. While such information was collected in the past, it is held on individual personal records and has not been collated. It could therefore be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Even if such information were available it would not be possible to provide a breakdown as requested because the status of a particular school may not be clear or might have changed over time. Historical information about gender and the ethnic origin of the judiciary is not available for all of the years requested.
<P>

<a name="00127w26.html_para2">The table shows the percentages of judges who were women and from ethnic minorities in 1992 (the first full year for which such information is available) and 1999. As the ethnic origin of candidates for judicial office was not sought before October 1991 the data may be incomplete. A second table also provides what limited information there is available about women in the judiciary in 1970, 1979 and 1987. No figures are readily available for 1989.

 The key humanitarian issues in Kosovo are warmth and shelter. Staff from our Field Office and Infrastructure Engineering Unit in Pristina have worked closely with United Nations Mission in Kosovo's (UNMIK) humanitarian pillar, headed by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and other donors over the past three months to implement power transmission and water programmes. These will complement the UNHCR-co-ordinated shelter programme, which has received generous support from the European Union.

 In 1997, my Department published its White Paper on International Development following an extensive consultation exercise. This committed us, among other things, to more open and collaborative ways of developing policy. In the following year, we launched a Development Policy Forum. A range of development issues were discussed with individuals and representatives of groups from across society in a series of nine regional forums, culminating in a national Forum. A second round of forums is now underway. The aims are to share thinking and ideas on key current development issues and to raise awareness. A copy of the report of the 1998 Forum and details of the 2000 Forum are available on the DFID website (under 'Working With Us').

Each of these papers will be produced following a consultation exercise with developing country governments, civil society at home and overseas, the private sector, international development agencies, other donors, academics, and others. Draft copies of each paper are being distributed and written comments invited. Seminars to discuss each draft are being arranged. These papers will be made publicly available when finalised. The analysis they contain of the strategies required to achieve the International Development Targets will be used to sharpen the focus of DFID policies and resource allocations. Further, we hope the analysis will be of value to all those involved in international development, the international agencies, the bilateral donors, civil society organisations and those in developing countries themselves.

 Information is not available on the form requested. My Department is responsible for most British Government assistance to Russia. DFID expects to spend around &#163;28 million on bilateral assistance to Russia in the current financial year. Between 1 December and 20 January, DFID approved a total of &#163;4.4 million for new projects; this includes a contribution of &#163;0.89 million to the UN for humanitarian assistance to those displaced by the conflict in Chechnya. Other Government Departments including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Trade and Industry have smaller programmes of co-operation with Russia. In addition, we provide significant assistance to Russia through the multilateral agencies, especially the EU Tacis programme.

 It is not possible to give an estimate of the number of people who have acquired literacy as a result of our contribution to education programmes. In Africa and Asia we are currently funding a large number of substantive primary education programmes, all of which will contribute to the eradication of illiteracy. We have committed over &#163;300 million to these programmes since May 1997. Millions of people will benefit from them.

 Since the current conflict began in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in August 1998, the UK has committed &#163;1.7 million in humanitarian assistance to help people affected by the conflict. This includes &#163;0.7 million to assist Congolese refugee populations in Zambia, Tanzania and Uganda.
<P>

<a name="00127w28.html_para0">Humanitarian assistance is provided to meet the needs of affected populations in the most effective way possible.

My Department is in regular contact with these and other organisations active in the DRC, and receives written reports to account for all the Department for International Development's humanitarian expenditure. Organisations are expected to identify the beneficiaries of any project supported by the UK to ensure that resources are targeted at the civilian populations in most need.

 Tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic must play a central part in helping to reduce poverty, and to work for peace, security and prosperity in Africa. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in South Africa in November 1999, the Prime Minister announced a new UK Government commitment of &#163;22.7 million for HIV/AIDS in Africa. This includes &#163;14 million to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) to help develop a safe and affordable vaccine.

 Globalisation is at a critical stage for developing countries. It is generating massive wealth and has the potential to help lift millions out of abject poverty. But it could also lead to increased inequality, with the risk that some countries remain marginalised and in poverty. My Department is analysing the issues surrounding globalisation and its impact on development, with a view to publishing a second White Paper in the autumn. This would also look at the experience of the three years since our first White Paper and provide the platform for the work of the Department over the next few years.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2000]:</i> Samples from every consignment of beef from the USA must be examined for residues of certain xenobiotic hormones, natural hormones and for stilbenes.
<P>

<a name="00127w29.html_para0">More generally, all meat imported into the EU must originate from approved third countries. Responsibility for approving third countries rests with the European Commission, who must take account of information on matters which include legislation on the use, authorisation, distribution and marketing of substances which might be administered to livestock. Inclusion and retention on the list of approved countries is subject to the submission of acceptable monitoring plans for residues, including hormonal growth promoters, in meat, which provide guarantees at least equivalent to those provided by EU member states.

 None. For a farmer to claim damages from the supplier of feed, he would have to show that the supplier either knew or ought to have known the feed was contaminated and would therefore cause damage to the farmer by way of introducing BSE into his herd. No general guidance can be given as each case would have to be determined on its own facts and circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w30.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We are committed to a substantial and wide-ranging programme to prevent stroke within the "Our Healthier Nation" strategy. We have set a target for reducing the death rate from stroke, heart disease and other circulatory diseases by at least 40 per cent. by 2010. To help to meet this challenging target we are implementing a series of measures to tackle the major risk factors for stroke including smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension and poor diet.
<P>

<a name="00127w30.html_para4">On smoking, for example, our tobacco control White Paper, "Smoking Kills", set out our plans for implementing a ban on tobacco advertising, a tobacco education campaign and smoking cessation services. This is worth &#163;100 million over three years. Our plans to tackle physical inactivity under the "Active for Life" strategy include a &#163;1.5 million programme in this year alone to promote active lifestyles. This follows up our &#163;9 million campaign that set the foundations for our physical activity strategy.
<P>

<a name="00127w30.html_para5">Alcohol misuse and high salt diets are two risk factors for high blood pressure, which increase the risk of stroke. In the case of the former, we are developing a strategy to tackle alcohol misuse in England as confirmed in "Our Healthier Nation", and we will publish it early in the New Year. As for the latter, we expect the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) to publish the findings of its survey of salt usage in manufactured foods early in 2000. Once the report is available we propose to explore with the FDF the scope for reducing the levels of salt in processed foods.
<P>

<a name="00127w30.html_para6">We are also promoting effective prevention within the community in collaboration with the Stroke Association under the Health Action Zone Innovation Fund programme. The 'Preventing Strokes and Saving Lives' innovation fund project in Hull and East Riding Health Action Zone is aimed at those prone to transient ischaemic attacks or mini-strokes to limit the risk of further strokes through providing a programme of lifestyle change, guidance and advice. The service will take a multi- disciplinary and patient led approach working at primary care level and involving patients' families.

 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) provides exposure guidelines that cover the spectrum of radiowave emissions including the microwave frequencies transmitted by mobile telephone base stations. The specific levels depend upon the frequencies used by the operator. The latest advice on exposure guidelines in the United Kingdom can be found in the "Documents of the NRPB," Vol. 10, No. 2 (1999), entitled "Advice on the 1998 ICNIRP Guidelines for Limiting Exposure to Time-varying Electric, Magnetic and Electromagnetic Fields (up to 300GHz)."

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> The aim of the influenza immunisation policy is to protect those at greatest risk of severe or complicated illness before flu viruses begin to circulate in the community. Ideally people who are in the risk groups recommended for vaccine should have been immunised by now. Flu immunisation delivery is through general practice and general practitioners who order the vaccine direct from the manufacturers. Flu immunisation was well-publicised last autumn and local and national campaigns were run to try and improve vaccination rates. The Chief Medical Officer held a press conference and wrote to GPs about flu immunisation. Circulars on winter planning stressed to health authorities the importance of promoting flu immunisation as part of this planning and as part of the winter 1999-2000 campaign the National Health Service Executive sent all health authorities an information pack to encourage local activity.

<a name="00127w31.html_para6">7.7 million doses of flu vaccine were distributed this season. This is the highest ever and manufacturers have advised that they have over half a million doses available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he plans to take to improve the recruitment and retention of physiotherapists in the NHS.  [105840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00127w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The national recruitment, retention and vacancy survey published in September 1999 gave us the latest authoritative data on staff vacancies from 98 per cent. of National Health Service trusts. It shows that only 3.3 per cent. of physiotherapist posts have been vacant for three months or more in England.
<P>

<a name="00127w32.html_para2">We are ensuring that effective recruitment and retention policies are in place to make the best use of trained staff and that training levels are sufficient to get a better match between supply and demand.
<P>

<a name="00127w32.html_para3">We are taking a number of steps which will help to address the issue of recruitment and retention of physiotherapists. These include the publication of the framework for the management of human resources for the whole of the NHS, "Working Together: securing a quality workforce for the NHS", which sets targets for local employers to improve recruitment and retention year on year. We have issued guidance to the service on improving working lives and we will shortly be issuing guidance on Lifelong Learning and Continuing Professional Development.
<P>

<a name="00127w32.html_para4">We are also modernising services and modernising employment practice in the NHS: developing more supportive, flexible and family friendly working practices; extending and improving investment in lifelong learning and professional development; tackling violence and racism in the workplace; involving staff in the way services are delivered and in the changes and developments that affect their working lives.
<P>

<a name="00127w32.html_para5">We have accepted in full the pay increases recommended by the Pay Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (including physiotherapist) for 2000-01. The Review Body has recommended an across the board increase of 3.4 per cent. for 2000-01 and for the second year running these increases will be paid in full without

staging. Taken together with last year's award, this means that physiotherapists will have received real-terms increases of over 5 per cent., the best settlement for over ten years. Some targeted key groups of staff have received substantially larger awards: last year, newly qualified basic grade physiotherapists received pay increases worth 8.4 per cent.; this year, about 4,500 experienced Senior II physiotherapists will receive increases worth between 8.1 per cent. and 8.4 per cent.

<a name="00127w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The development of strategies to reduce suicide and serious injury from accidents are a major part of the Government's programme outlined in the White Paper "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation". The National Service Framework for Mental Health sets a specific

<P>

<a name="00127w33.html_para0">A high level national Task Force on accidents, accountable to the Chief Medical Officer, will be appointed shortly to ensure that the essential groundwork is in place to targets on accident prevention set out in the White Paper. In addition, we are in the process of bringing together the necessary expertise to work across Government to drive forward a whole range of initiatives to make progress towards achieving the targets to reduce suicide. We also provide funding for voluntary groups to support specific initiatives in both areas.

 The information requested has been collected centrally only since 1998-99. The following are the numbers of 24 hour staffed beds for people with a mental illness in each health authority in England for 1998-99 and the first two quarters in 1999-2000. In those authorities where centrally collected data show no beds, developments are taking place locally to provide care in appropriate settings.

 Nurses wanting to apply to NHS Direct find that this is no different from applying for any job elsewhere in the National Health Service. Many of the jobs are advertised in the <i>Nursing Times</i> and <i>Nursing Standard</i> as well as local papers, job centres, NHS trust newsletters and bulletin boards. NHS Direct has deliberately recruited nurses from a wide range of different backgrounds. Some will be from a hospital background but others will be from primary care or will have been working outside the NHS. NHS Direct has also provided opportunities for disabled and work-injured nurses. Many staff who work for NHS Direct do so on a part time basis allowing them to combine working for NHS Direct with other clinical duties.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2000]:</i> There are some indications that the supply situation for generic drugs is easing.

 I met representatives of Southend borough council and hon. Members from Southend on 10 January where they outlined the local situation with regard to their SSA. The meeting mainly discussed the financial difficulties the local authority is facing particularly with regard to mental health and learning disability client groups. I am currently considering whether there is any underspend in this year's mental health care grant which may provide additional support to the borough council. I agreed to examine what extra assistance the social services inspectorate could provide to support the authority.

 All family doctors will have access to NHSnet by the end of 2002. NHSnet is a managed service and has no capital costs to public funds. The annual cost of access to NHSnet for health authorities and National Health Service trusts is &#163;3.8 million. The annual cost of access for general practitioners will be approximately &#163;19 million once they are all connected. This sum includes managed services such as routers and firewalls as well as costs for 24-hour/7 day network access.
