 All UK airports, whether civil or military, from which are operated flights regulated under the National Aviation Security Programme, must meet the requirements of the programme, and are subject to routine inspection, audits and tests by the Department for Transport. Incoming flights will need to have met the requirements of their airport of departure. Military airports are not deemed to have met the requirements of the National Aviation Security Programme simply by virtue of their military status.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what provisions he has in place to assess the level of adherence to the Highway Code by cyclists; and if he will make a statement.  [70198]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60515w01.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 We do not have any provisions in place to assess the level of adherence to the Highway Code by cyclists. Road traffic law and The Highway Code apply as much to cyclists as anyone else. Enforcement of the law is a matter for the police. They can prosecute cyclists who ride dangerously, carelessly, ignore traffic signs or signals, cycle on the pavement or commit any other road traffic offence. These offences carry maximum fines between &#163;500 and &#163;2,500. Also, &#163;30 fixed penalty notices can be issued for cycling on the pavement, by police and community wardens.

 The Government note that the Committee had some concerns with the Government&#039;s decision to accept the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Scheme (PEFC) as giving assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources. The Government&#039;s response to the Committee focused on the Committee&#039;s recommendation that the Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET):
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">should make clear to PEFC that it would be desirable for it clearly and simply to set out the minimum standards it expects all its national members to conform to if it wants continued approval of its scheme.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60515w02.html_para0">
The Government are generally satisfied that PEFC, having made changes to its scheme, now has a set of requirements that, if implemented by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC, will adequately assure compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber. However, this assessment was made prior to the process of implementation by national schemes being complete, and therefore a public commitment was made to assess the adoption of these changes by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_7">The assessment of changes made is under way but not complete. It has raised concerns with the interpretation some national schemes have made of the PEFC requirement for achieving consensus in the development and revision of standards. In particular, it is not clear that the voting procedures adopted by some of the schemes reviewed would ensure that decisions could be made only in &#039;the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests&#039;&#151;the definition of consensus adopted by PEFC. In the light of further discussions with interested parties the Government have decided that these interim findings merit further scrutiny before resolving the probationary status of PEFC. This will be done as part of a review of the five forest certification schemes first assessed by CPET in 2004. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to accept the PEFC scheme as assuring compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber.

DFID shares the concerns of the report and is convinced of the critical importance of hunger and malnutrition to achieving, not only the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for hunger (Goal 1), but also to achieving other MDGs.

They are less likely to attend school and, when they do, they perform poorly (Goal 2, Education). Women are often disproportionately affected by food shortages as in the family they often eat last and least. Educating girls and ensuring good nutrition empowers women and girls (Goal 3, Gender Equality). Child mortality (Goal 4) is dramatically affected by hunger, and malnutrition is implicated in two thirds of child deaths. A malnourished mother will give birth to a low weight child and is more likely 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 May 2006 : Column 628W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 There is no Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which specifically looks at child malnutrition. However, MDG 1 seeks to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and MDG 4 seeks to reduce child mortality.

 There is no international agreement on what constitutes state fragility. A common way of estimating fragility is derived from the World Bank&#039;s Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA).

The lowest two categories plus the unranked group are used by DFID and other donors as a list of fragile countries. Our understanding of fragility set out in our January 2005 policy paper &#039;Why we need to work more effectively in fragile states&#039; is therefore similar to that of the Failed State Index&quot; but not the same.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on progress in reducing benefit fraud.  [65080]</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60515w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 In 2004&#150;05 fraud across the benefit system was estimated to be less that 1 per cent. of total benefit expenditure at around &#163;900 million; which is less than &#163;1 billion for the first time since systematic measurement of fraud began.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_58">We have firm targets to reduce fraud and error in the benefits which are most vulnerable to fraud. The target for reducing fraud and error in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance for working age people was 33 per cent. by March 2004, and 50 per cent. by March 2006. National Statistics published in December 2005 show that by March 2005, we had reduced fraud and error in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance by 44 per cent. Looking at fraud alone, this has reduced by more than two thirds compared to the 1998 baseline figure of 10.4 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w07.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_59">We have set a challenging target to reduce levels of housing benefit fraud and error for working age claimants by 25 per cent. by 2006, and to maintain the 25 per cent. reduction by March 2008 against the 2002&#150;03 baseline year. National Statistics published in January 2006 shows that by March 2005, housing benefit fraud has fallen by around 30 per cent. over a two-year period. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 May 2006 : Column 632W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
However, over the same period there has been a 40 per cent. increase in customer error. The net effect of this is that fraud and error for working age claimants is now reported to be 2 per cent. above the baseline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_60">We are also taking steps to reduce customer error. We have an on-going programme of addressing complexity in benefits to make benefit rules easier and simpler for our customers to understand. Our processes and customer handling methods aim to make the claim making process straightforward thus lessening the opportunities for customers to make mistakes or leave out important information.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_61">This shows we are getting results in preventing, detecting and deterring fraud. We have achieved this by a variety of methods. In 2004&#150;05, through improved data matching, nearly 300,000 data anomalies were identified. The Targeting Fraud campaign has helped to increase public awareness of the problem of fraud. We now have a more appropriate sanctions regime. In 2004&#150;05, in partnership with local authorities, we imposed nearly 43,000 prosecutions and sanctions&#151;more than ever before and a fourfold increase since 1998. We have tightened our procedures to root out identity fraud. People are now required to verify their identity before they are allocated a national insurance number or have access to the benefits system. We have maintained the National Benefit Fraud Hotline, and for every &#163;1 spent on its running costs, we identify overpayments of over &#163;9 in defrauded benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_62">Despite these good results, we are not complacent and will maintain this hard work. Our efforts in the future will focus on using new technology available to us to stop fraud earlier before it enters the benefit system; increasing our ability to data match to include data from the private sector; exploring the use of new technologies, such as voice risk analysis; the proposed identity card, which will be a useful tool to combat identity and other frauds by verifying identity more effectively; continuing to warn fraudsters and potential fraudsters through the Targeting Benefit Fraud campaign and maintaining the National Benefit Fraud Hotline.

 Our Green Paper A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work&quot; sets out our proposals for extending the local housing allowance (LHA) across the private rented sector. The LHA scheme replaces the single room rent with a new shared room rate, which is based on a broader definition of shared properties. We will continue to look at the operation of the shared room rate as we move forward with housing benefit reform, but the underlying principles of the rate, that of encouraging work, remain.

The new works at Larne was completed in early 2006 and, in addition, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey are scheduled for completion in mid-2006.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">Water Service recognises that not all of its waste water treatment works are fully compliant with the effluent discharge standards set out in the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The nine locations which the Commission identified as having failed to meet the Directive requirements to have secondary treatment in place by 31 December 2000 are at Bangor, Donaghadee, Carrickfergus, Coleraine, Londonderry, Larne, Newtownabbey, Omagh and Portrush. A major capital investment programme is currently underway across Northern Ireland to address deficiencies in the sewerage infrastructure and to achieve compliance as quickly as possible. Since 2000/01, investment on improvements to waste water treatment works has increased tenfold, from approximately &#163;12 million per year to some &#163;122 million per year in 2005/06. Work has been completed at Londonderry, Omagh and Larne and significant levels of expenditure will continue to be invested as Water Service strives to meet the requirements as soon as possible.</p>

Such fines take into account the seriousness and duration of the breach of compliance, the ability of the Member State to pay, and the profile of the Member State within the European Union. They may comprise a lump sum and, or, a penalty.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations (NI) 2002 necessitate a thorough and extensive water sampling programme to be undertaken, to monitor water quality throughout the supply and distribution systems. The sampling locations and frequencies for the monitoring of drinking water quality are specified in the Regulations. The results and procedures are audited by the Drinking Water Inspectorate. The mandatory sampling programmes requires water samples to be collected regularly at water treatment works, at service reservoirs and water towers used to store treated water, and at customers&#039; taps in the water supply zone.</p>

 As at 31 March 2005 (the latest point for which figures are available) there were 28,994 registered sex offenders in the community across England and Wales. One of the requirements of registration is that offenders notify to the police a home address and any other address where more than seven days a year are spent, as well as any changes to this information. Moreover, if an offender claims to be homeless or otherwise of &#039;no fixed abode&#039; then they must provide the address or location of a place in the UK where they can

 We have reduced the period of time that registered sex offenders are allowed to spend overseas without notifying the police. Now, all registered sex offenders are required to notify the police of any foreign travel of three days duration or more. The police will use that information to decide whether it is necessary to take any action to prevent travel. That action can include applying for foreign travel orders, which we introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The orders can be sought where the police consider that the offender poses a risk of serious sexual harm to children under 16 in an overseas country.

Note:<br>

Coverage and recording practice affecting the statistics:<br>

(A) It is known that for some police force areas the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>

(B) Since 1990, due to the delays in implementing new counting procedures, corrective action on non-keying errors was reduced resulting in deterioration in the quality of data on summary motoring proceedings.<br>

 The Sentencing Guidelines Council promulgates guidelines to enable all criminal courts to approach the sentencing of offenders from a common starting point to promote consistency in sentencing. All courts are required to take the guidelines of the Sentencing Guidelines Council into account when sentencing offenders and have to give reasons for departing from them in any particular case. Discrepancies in sentencing in all criminal courts are therefore minimised through the use of these guidelines. Currently magistrates courts use the Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines issued in 2004 by the Magistrates Association but these are to be replaced by guidelines produced by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Appealing against sentence to the Crown court is another mechanism for ensuring consistency of sentencing in the magistrates courts. Consistency in sentencing is further promoted through the publication of judgments on appeals to the Court of Appeal from the Crown court.

More medicines may be prescribed, but those that are prescribed would be less likely to be wasted. Better management of a patient&#039;s condition may reduce the need for more specialist care, including admission to hospital. The provision of effective medication review processes would also have costs in terms of service delivery, for example through payments under the quality and outcomes framework for general medical services or fees to community pharmacists for medicine usage reviews.

 There was no average length of time in England for which patients requiring dialysis waited for treatment in 2005.

 The national service framework for renal services notes that the total number of people receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been taken as a proxy measure for the prevalence of established renal failure (ERF). However it is generally agreed that in addition there will be people in the general population with ERF which has not been diagnosed and whose need for RRT has not been recognised. People who have been identified as requiring dialysis receive it, on an emergency basis if necessary. Research shows that a third of people present less than a month before requiring RRT.

Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what child protection checks a teacher is expected to undergo; and what procedure is used for such checks in the case of an individual who is working <i>(a)</i> in a number of different schools, <i>(b)</i> in different local authorities, <i>(c)</i> in the private as well as public sector and <i>(d)</i> in another occupation or vocation with children or vulnerable adults.

<p><a name="st_272"><a name="60515w30.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dhanda: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s guidance, Child Protection: Preventing Unsuitable People from Working with Children and Young Persons&quot;, provides comprehensive advice on the pre-appointment checks employers should undertake on teachers and other prospective employees. This includes previous employment checks, criminal record bureau (CRB) checks, a List 99 check and, for people who are to be employed as teachers, checks to confirm their teaching status.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w30.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_244">For individuals working in a number of schools where the local authority is the same, and it is the local authority who is the employer, as long as checks were carried out at the time of the first appointment and there is no gap in employment, further checks should not be necessary. Where employers are different or a gap has occurred each employer must satisfy themselves of an individual&#039;s suitability by conducting new checks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w30.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_245">Under the new vetting and barring scheme, legislation for which is currently before Parliament in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, a person or organisation who employs a teacher will be required to check that the teacher is subject to monitoring in relation to their work with children by the scheme, and is not barred from working with children. The duty on the employer to check applies regardless of whether the teacher is working in an independent or maintained school and regardless of whether another employer has already made a check. An employer can fulfil their duty to check by obtaining written confirmation from a supply agency that the agency has made the check.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w30.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_246">For a non-teaching position, working with children or vulnerable adults in a registered setting, a CRB check is also required. As part of this the Protection of Children Act (PoCA) and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoVA) lists will be checked and it will record if an individual is barred from this type of work.

 On 8 December 2005, I announced the Government&#039;s plan to implement a fully operational information sharing index in all areas of England by the end of 2008. This will enable practitioners delivering services to children to identify and contact one anothereasily and quickly, so they can share relevant information about children who need services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_248">The estimated set-up costs are &#163;224 million over the next three years. This includes the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply the data to the index and ensuring that data is accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from those systems; introducing robust arrangements to ensure security, and training staff to use the index properly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_249">Estimated operating costs, thereafter, will be &#163;41 million per year. Most of this will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the ongoing security, accuracy and audit of the index.

 Many secondary schools support language learning in primary schools by sharing teacher expertise, resource and use of facilities. In April 2006 the Department provided additional funding of &#163;30,000 to every existing Specialist Language College and suggested a proportion of the funding be used to support the development and delivery of language learning programmes in primary schools. In addition &#163;49.5 million will be distributed among all local authorities during the financial years 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 to support the implementation of languages at Key Stage 2. The Department suggested part of this funding could be used to develop links between primary and secondary schools to support programmes. In October 2005 the Department launched the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages which contains guidance for schools on progression of language learning within Key Stage 2 and into Key Stage 3.

<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The number of teachers needed over time will vary from one area to another and schools and local authorities will need to decide how they manage numbers of teacher and support staff posts on the basis of anticipated local needs. In many cases there will be no need for redundancies because natural wastage and reduced numbers of newly-qualified teachers will play an important part in managing staff numbers.

<a name="60515w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_267">As far as teachers are concerned, the Department&#039;s supply modelling has allowed for falling rolls by reducing the number of teacher training places in 2005/06 for both primary and secondary teaching. However, overall judgments on the number of teachers required also depend on other factors such as those leaving and returning to the profession and this will vary from one area to another. Because of these factors and local variations teacher numbers have continued to rise. On a full time equivalent basis, their numbers rose by 3,500 to 435,400 in England in January 2006.

<a name="stpa_275">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &#163;700 million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;5.8 billion this year and will rise further to over &#163;6.3 billion by 2007&#150;08. Progress is being made year by year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary classrooms where they are considered to be unsuitable.

<sup>(38)</sup>Dormant students are those who are not actively following a course of study in the year in which they are awarded their qualification.<br>

<sup>(39)</sup>In 2002/03, the method used to allocate students to subject categories was changed, the main effect of which was to increase the number of students who were allocated to specific subject groups and decrease those who were allocated to the combined subject category. For 2002/03 and later years dormant students have been allocated to specific subjects rather than classified separately.<br>

 We estimate that around 6,000 EU nationals studying full-time in English institutions, who have not satisfied the existing provisions as migrant workers or self-employed persons, could in principle be eligible to claim maintenance support (consisting of loans and grants) in the 2006/07 academic year as a result of changes we have made following the ECJ ruling in the Bidar case. It is therefore expected that the majority of additional EU nationals who will be eligible to claim maintenance support in 2006/07 would have been eligible even if directive 2004/38 had not come into force. We anticipate the directive will add a small number of people to those who are already eligible to claim maintenance support.

Where a local authority transfers its housing to an RSL and the receipt it receives is not sufficient to repay the outstanding debt attributable to the housing, the Office will make a one-off payment where the debt is held with the Public Works Loans Board. The one-off payment is made to discharge the Office&#039;s continued liability, through the HRA, to pay subsidy on an authority&#039;s housing attributable debt that remains after transfer.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much income local authorities received from right-to-buy receipts in each year since 1997; what estimate he has made of income in future years; and how much was <i>(a)</i> retained by local authorities and <i>(b)</i> remitted to the Treasury in each year.

<a name="stpa_336">The following table shows both the total capital receipts the disposal of all housing assets and from right-to-buy sales of local authority dwellings in England in the years from 1997&#150;98 onwards, net of discount and as reported by local authorities. These are capital receipts and not income into the authority&#039;s Housing Revenue Account, which is generated by, for instance, rental income.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w41.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_337">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not estimate future right-to-buy receipts but does estimate future housing capital receipts. Estimates are subject to a number of volatile factors such as the state of the housing market, lending rates, amounts of disposable income and stock condition, and are kept under constant review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w41.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_338">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister collects data on total pooled receipts and total amounts set aside by housing authorities. These figures include the amounts arising from right-to-buy sales alongside amounts relating to other housing capital receipts, but the amounts relating to right-to-buy sales are not separately identified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w41.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_339">The amount of income received by local authorities from the sale of housing assets will not be quite equal to their housing capital receipts less the amount they are obliged to set-aside or pool. Rather, the housing capital receipt, such as a right-to-buy receipt, will first be reduced by, for instance, the administration costs associated with the disposal and any other deduction to the capital receipt the authority may make, such as clawing back the cost of improvement to the asset in previous years. It is the value of this reduced capital receipt that is then used as the basis for the calculation of the set-aside or pooling liability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60515w41.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_340">As can be seen from the following table, since 1997 the Government have consistently invested more in housing than was received in receipts. In 2004&#150;05 the amount paid to government from all housing receipts (not just right-to-buy) was &#163;1.7 billion. The amount invested in housing was &#163;4.1 billion i.e. almost 2&#189; times the amount received. The ratio of amount invested to amount received is expected to increase substantially in the future.

<a name="stpa_344">The information requested is not available, but surveys carried out by the Building Research Establishment have indicated that about 25 per cent. of the party walls and 40 per cent. of the party floors between dwellings failed to meet the standards expected by the 1992 edition of Part E of the Building Regulations, which deals with sound insulation. To improve this situation the ODPM revised Part E in 2003 and the evidence is that compliance rates are now much higher, in excess of 90 per cent.
