 The numbers of staff in each Department (including its agencies) are shown in tables, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The figures show the data at the 1 April each year, and are based on the full-time equivalent figures for the number of permanent staff in each Department, rounded to the nearest 10. Data are shown by Government Office Region, with columns giving the total number of staff in England and the UK.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission if he will make a statement on his plans for Westminster Hall.  [89869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew1"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Commission has no plans for Westminster Hall. It has, however, been aware of growing pressure for the better welcome and reception of constituents and other visitors to the Palace of Westminster and to give them a better understanding of the work of Parliament. The Commission agrees with the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons that a Visitor Centre would be desirable; such facilities are provided in many other Parliaments around the world. We therefore commissioned a feasibility study from the consultants Haley Sharpe and the conservation architects Purcell Miller Tritton. That study reviewed options for the siting of such a centre, and proposed a scheme consisting of a new security/reception building at the western end of the Jubilee Caf&#233; and elements of a Visitor Centre in the accommodation outside the west wall of Westminster Hall, with the option of providing further facilities in Victoria Tower Gardens.
<P>

<a name="30115w01.html_para0">The Commission considered the consultants' report, recognised the sensitivity of the Westminster Hall location, and asked the consultants to carry out further studies of possible sites outside the Parliamentary Estate. In due course the Commission will consider the results of these studies, together with the views of the Modernisation and Finance and Services Committees, the Domestic Committees, the Speaker's Advisory

To ask the hon.

[90123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew2"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 The main difference between the conditions of employment of doorkeepers recruited since March 1998 and those employed before that date is their substantive pay band. This followed the Staff Inspector's review of the doorkeepers (completed in April 1997). I have asked the Director of Finance and Administration to write to the hon. Member with more detail.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, what estimate he has made of the number of hon. Members whose constituents could gain access to the line of route, including the House of Commons, on a Wednesday <i>(a)</i> in 2002, and <i>(b)</i> in 2003, having travelled by public transport (i) without and (ii) with the use, where eligible, of railway Network cards.  [89777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew3"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 In 2002, 42 Wednesday mornings were available for tours and approximately 600 visitors a day were accommodated. In 2003, it is estimated that 41 Wednesday mornings will be available for tours and that 740 constituents a day could have access to the Line of Route, with a further 1,200 on Wednesday afternoons during Adjournments. This greater throughput is possible due to a more efficient operation following the creation of the Central Tours Office.
<P>

<a name="30115w01.html_para1">It is not possible to forecast the impact of railway network cards, but for guidance, groups would need to arrive at the Palace by 9.15 am on Wednesdays to complete a tour which includes the Chamber. Access to the Line of Route is available on tours booked with the Central Tours Office until 1200 on Wednesdays, although these tours exclude the House of Commons Chamber.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what protection there is for consumers against overcharging by water companies.  [89537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Director General of Water Services (Ofwat) regulates water and sewerage charges by setting a limit on the average increase in charges that a company can impose in any year. Companies may only charge households in accordance with charges schemes approved by Ofwat. In exercising his powers the Director General seeks to ensure that there is no undue preference or undue discrimination in the fixing of charges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Water companies must set out the basis on which they set their charges in charges schemes, which require annual approval by the Director General of Water Services (Ofwat). Charges schemes are available from companies free on request. Water companies have changed the presentation of customers' bills to meet comments from Ofwat and WaterVoice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to measure carbon emissions from the <i>(a)</i> farming and <i>(b)</i> food industries.  [87266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, the UK is required annually to compile an inventory of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.
<P>

<a name="30115w01.html_para3">The main greenhouse gases emitted from farming are methane from enteric fermentation in livestock and agricultural waste disposal, and nitrous oxide from fertiliser use. There are also emissions of carbon dioxide from agricultural energy use and liming of soils. Emissions are calculated from agricultural data including animal numbers and fertiliser usage produced by DEFRA, energy statistics from DTI, plus factors to relate these data to actual emissions. The data are recorded in the UK greenhouse gas inventory and show that overall emissions from agriculture fell by about 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2003 : Column 610W</I><P>
11.5 per cent. between 1990 and 2000. Agriculture also contributes to emissions from land use change, which fell by about 20 per cent. over the same period.
<P>

<a name="30115w01.html_para4">Greenhouse gas emissions for the food industry are not identified separately in the inventory, although they are included with other industrial emissions. Separate studies undertaken by my Department suggest that end user carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in the food industry fell by about 25 per cent. over the period 1990 to 2000. This includes the food industry's share of emissions at power stations due to electricity generation, and it is the fall in power station emissions due to fuel switching that is main reason for the decrease in emissions from this sector.

 The Department's expenditure on newspapers, periodicals and magazines in the financial year 2001&#150;02 was #127,470. This figure covers central purchasing through Defra's library services. This excludes the costs of newspapers, periodicals and newspapers purchased in Defra local offices and in the Department's Executive Agencies. These figures could be compiled only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what effect the operations of the Environment Agency have had on the levels of flooding in the Medmenham area and Marlow.  [89762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> Rainfall over the final days of December and the beginning of January was close to the average for the whole month of December. This fell on a saturated catchment in which rivers were already running bankfull. Under these circumstances, there is little that can be done by the Agency to alleviate flooding if defences are not already in place. Early indications are that this was the third most severe floods in this area since records began in 1882, being exceeded only by the floods of 1894 and 1947. In recent years, the Agency has conducted public awareness campaigns to make those at risk aware of that risk and to provide information and advice on how people can help themselves. In this instance, the Agency takes the view that their operations will have had no adverse effects on river levels either in Medmenham or Marlow.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]</i>: The Jubilee River provides flood relief for Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton and several smaller villages nearby. Extra flood defences in the form of flood banks were constructed in Cookham to reduce the risk to this village. Marlow is 5 km upstream of Cookham and Medmenham further upstream and, as such, the Environment Agency takes the view that the Jubilee River has no impact, adverse or otherwise, on either community.

<i>[holding answer 11 December 2002]:</i> The Government are committed to minimising the adverse environmental impact of pesticide use, consistent with adequate crop protection. A voluntary agreement on measures to reduce the environmental damage caused by pesticides was entered into by the industry and other stakeholders in April 2001. Provided the Voluntary Initiative is fully implemented, it should reduce the environmental impacts of pesticides and the Government remain committed to this approach. However, the Government are carrying out further work and analysis on a possible tax or other economic instrument, should the Voluntary Initiative fail to deliver its objectives within a reasonable timescale.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para0">The study referred to in the question has not yet been commissioned. Officials are in the process of commissioning work to develop a framework to enable subsequent assessment of the Voluntary Initiative. This will complement the indicators and targets put together by the Voluntary Initiative Steering Group and will, in particular, enable a comparison of the environmental benefits of the Voluntary Initiative and of a possible pesticides tax. The study is intended to be completed by the summer and will subsequently be published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The statutory bodies that are principally responsible for water quality, species, pollution, and flora & fauna protection are the Environment Agency, English Nature and the Lake District National Park Authority.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para1">The Environment Agency is responsible for enforcing statutory controls on the entry of pollutants to controlled waters, and has specific duties in relation to protecting aquatic species. It is also the co-ordinator for the Bassenthwaite Lake Restoration Project that was set up last year to ensure an integrated approach to tackling the complex, longstanding pressures on the lake.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para2">All public bodies have a statutory duty to to take reasonable steps, consistent with the exercise of their functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the features for which the lake has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Since the lake forms part of the River Derwent and Bassenthwaite Lake candidate Specal Area of Conservation, further duties on all statutory authorities in exercising their functions must have due regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para3">Given its central role in the restoration programme and its duties in relation to fisheries, the Environment Agency is best placed to report on the health, breeding and distribution of fish species. The Derwent Salmon Action Plan consultation document contains information on the salmon population status in the Derwent catchment for the period 1990 to 2000. For most years the population achieved a considerable surplus over its conservation target. The most recent reliable data (for 2000) shows that the population level was almost double the conservation limit, indicating the population to be in very good health.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para4">There is less information on the status of species in the lake but available evidence suggests that the Vendace population is low. This is thought to be due to siltation of their spawning grounds and competition and predation from alien species, probably introduced by anglers. Recent bye-laws regulating the use of dead and

live bait will control further introductions. The Environment Agency will be pleased to supply further information.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para5">The Agency can also supply details of permitted discharges. The condition of the lake is considered stable owing to improvements to Keswick sewage treatment works. Planned investment should deliver further improvements. The Environment Agency will consider what further improvements may be necessary for the investment period 2005&#150;2010 and is carrying out a study to assess the potential for removal of phospherus in the lakebed sediment. Discharges of untreated sewage are very dilute and not thought to add significantly to the overall nutrient load.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para6">Diffuse sources of phosphorus and sediment pollution need to be addressed. Action under the restoration programme will need to include research to identify sources and causes of erosion and siltation; physical improvements to infrastructure including sewerage systems, farmsteads and highways; and improvements to agricultural practice through education and awareness campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30115w03.html_para7">Occurrences of blue green algal blooms have been recorded on: 4 December 1998; 1 May 2000; 19 September 2000; and 20 September 2002. Controlling the total amount of phosphorus entering the lake will help to limit loads overall may reduce the frequency and extent of all types of algal bloom but will not eliminate them entirely sicne they are a natural feature of this type of lake and form as a result of the interaction of a number of variables including climatic conditions, lake chemistry, wind speed and hours of sunlight.

However, it would not be appropriate for the Government to exclusively support the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services, and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.

<a name="30115w05.html_para3">Pilot studies into the active management of road traffic and making better use of the existing road space are being undertaken by the Highways Agency. To help deliver the reduction in congestion, the Highways Agency is also developing its role as a traffic manager to help road users deal with congestion on motorways and other strategic routes. Actions to date include the delivery of more electronic Variable Message Signs, automatic hold up warning systems, website and public information improvements and the first stages of a new national Traffic Control Centre due to begin operating in 2004. The Traffic Control Centre will provide advice to road users about travel conditions on the trunk road network allowing them to plan their journeys more effectively to avoid congestion. In conjunction with the Police and other emergency services, the Agency is improving the way it deals with accidents and incidents on the network so that they are dealt with more effectively, reducing the time roads are disrupted to minimise congestion.

 Liability for pollution from cargo oil from tankers is governed by the 1992 Protocols to the 1969 Civil Liability Convention and the 1971 Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, to which the UK is a contracting party. The current limit under this regime is equivalent to #117 million.

The revised overall limits will enter into force on 1 November this year, and will increase the maximum available amount of compensation to approximately #176 million.
<P>

<a name="30115w05.html_para6">In addition, a Diplomatic Conference has been convened at the IMO in May this year to negotiate a proposed Supplementary Fund to the present regime.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions he has held with the United States on measures to fill the Royal Navy's air defence gap between the withdrawal of the Sea Harriers and the advent of the Joint Strikefighter; and what assessment he has made of the risk of aerial attack against Royal Navy ships between 2006 and 2012.

 It is our current assessment that the main threat to the Fleet in future would come from sea-skimming missiles. The Sea Harrier FA2 lacks utility in countering this threat. There have been no discussions with the United States of America on the Royal Navy's air defence capability for the period following the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft, although they were advised of the decision as part of the United Kingdom's annual submission to the NATO Defence Planning Questionnaire. Following the withdrawal of the Sea Harrier FA2, Royal Navy Task Groups will

typically include Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers and Type 22 and 23 Frigates also equipped with air defence capability. The Type 42 Destroyers systems are being enhanced to ensure that they remain effective in the air defence role.
<P>

<a name="30115w07.html_para1">The first upgraded Airborne Early Warning Sea King Flight has recently entered service providing a marked improvement in capability to detect airborne threats to the Task Group over both sea and land, and the introduction of the Type 45 Destroyers, equipped with the highly capable Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) will represent further improvement in our air defence capability. It is also highly unlikely that the Royal Navy will operate alone, but instead is more likely to be part of a coalition force with other Allied defence assets, as well as our own.

 The Defence Logistic Organisation has since its formation on 1 April 2000 continued to contribute to the overall Year on Year Departmental Efficiency Target set as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review of 1998 and reported annually via the Departmental Performance report. Prior to 1 April 2000 Efficiency reports against the Departmental Target were the responsibility of the individual logistic Commands, Naval Support Command, Quartermaster General and Air Member Logistics.
<P>

<a name="30115w07.html_para4">The individual DLO efficiency measures that contributed to the overall Departmental efficiency target for these years also contribute to the DLO's strategic goal, a 20 per cent. reduction in DLO output costs (as at March 2000) by 31 March 2006. Examples of the types of measure are contained within the latest Ministry of Defence Departmental Performance Report 2001&#150;02 paragraphs 75 and 110 (available at the MOD website at www.mod.uk). From March 2000 to March 2002 the DLO has made a 5.6 per cent. efficiency saving in resource terms against its strategic goal. We have now agreed with the Treasury how the efficiency achievement in financial year 2002&#150;03 will be measured, and we are currently discussing with them how performance against the remainder of the strategic goal (from 2003&#150;04 onwards) will be measured.

 Since my appointment as the Government's Minister for Veterans in March 2001, I have been taking steps to provide all veterans from Her Majesty's armed forces with a co-ordinated focus for dealing with their concerns. I have set out three main priorities for this work.

Second, that there will be appropriate research into veterans' illnesses and factors which might have a bearing on these. Third, the MOD will make available to the public any information it possesses which is of potential relevance to this issue.

 Regulations were introduced in January 2001 to extend the purposes for which human embryos may be used in research. The regulations enable the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to issue a licence for research for the purposes of increasing knowledge about the development of embryos and serious disease and to enable such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.
<P>

<a name="30115w10.html_para5">The Medical Research Council (MRC) has taken the lead, in collaboration with the UK regulatory authorities (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, Department of Health, Medicines Control Agency) and other funding agencies, in generating a co-ordinated national stem cell strategy. As part of this, MRC has appointed the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control to set up a UK Stem Cell Bank for the curation and distribution of ethically sourced, quality controlled human adult, foetal and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines.
<P>

<a name="30115w10.html_para6">MRC, HFEA, the Department of Health and the Medicines Control Agency are collaborating to generate a UK-wide framework that will include: provision for oversight of national activities in stem cell research, standard donor information and consent forms, and route maps for researchers wishing to develop, bank and use stem cell lines for research and therapeutic purposes. 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2003 : Column 643W</I><P>
The HFEA license will require that samples of all ES cell lines be deposited in the UK stem cell bank. This will reduce the number of embryos required as individual researchers will not need to generate their own stem cell lines.
<P>

<a name="30115w10.html_para7">In relation to the Call for Expressions of Interest in establishing consortia, applicants will be able to request pump priming support for up to three years. It is expected that more substantial support would be sought through conventional grant schemes. Examples for which funds might be sought through this call include:

<a name="30115w10.html_para8">The Polkinghorne guidelines refer to the use of foetal tissue. The House of Lords Select Committee report on Stem Cell Research (February 2002) recommends the separation of clinical and research roles to be standard practice for donation of eggs and embryos. MRC will adhere to this recommendation in funding stem cell research. The nurse co-ordinators mentioned in the Call will be employed by the IVF clinics and will ensure that the donor couple fully understands the aims of the research and that it might reveal information about their health. The nurse co-ordinators will never become engaged in the research, but will liaise with the researchers to inform them if embryos become available.
<P>

<a name="30115w10.html_para9">It is illegal in the UK for payment to be made for the donation of gametes (nominal expenses are provided however). MRC will not under any circumstances contribute to the costs of IVF treatment for those couples who choose to donate embryos for research. Donation will be entirely voluntary and by the free will of the couples involved. The decision to donate or not to donate will have no effect on their IVF treatment.
<P>

<a name="30115w10.html_para10">Additionally, as recommended by the Select Committee, a high level Oversight Body has been established, chaired by Lord Patel, that will be responsible for the custody of stem cell lines, ensuring their purity and provenance, monitoring their use, and for establishing codes of practice for the use of ES cells, whether obtained from the bank or imported from elsewhere. The committee will review on a case by case basis applications to deposit and access ES cell lines and will monitor the use of foetal and adult stem cell lines. The committee reports to MRC Council and will brief Ministers on request.

<a name="30115w10.html_para11">Clinics undertaking IVF treatment in the UK were asked whether they were interested in participating in the national stem cell initiative. A list of these clinics is available in the HFEA website (www.hfea.gov.uk). Those that expressed an interest were invited to attend a meeting at MRC Head Office and were subsequently sent an invitation to submit an expression of interest in establishing a consortium to develop collaborations.

<a name="30115w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2003]:</i> The nationwide reach of the post office network represents a valuable channel for delivery of Government and other services. Post offices are traditionally the place where customers go to transact a range of Government business.
<P>

<a name="30115w12.html_para0">As recommended by the PIU report on the future of the post office network published in June 2000, Government provided the necessary support to enable Post Office Ltd. to test the concept of post offices as Government General Practitioners. DTI contributed #25 million to the cost of running the Your Guide pilot in Leicestershire and Rutland between July 2001 and March 2002. The outcomes of the pilot were thoroughly evaluated and a report was published last July. Although this indicated that a publicly funded national Your Guide service on the lines of that piloted would not provide value for money, and we have therefore decided not to roll it out, Your Guide has highlighted the potential for Government Departments to deliver services through post offices in future. The Department has been encouraging contact between other Departments and the Post Office concerning such services and has drawn the Departments' attention to a commercial kiosk service, based on kiosks in retail outlets&#151;including some sub-post offices&#151;which is expected to be piloted in Cornwall later this year.
<P>

<a name="30115w12.html_para1">Ultimately it is for individual Departments and Post Office Ltd. to decide whether or not to pursue these initiatives. But we will ensure that Post Office Ltd. continues to work closely with other Government Departments to develop and promote the services of the network as appropriate.

economic benefits of Government expenditure on science <i>(a)</i> as a whole and <i>(b)</i> in respect of individual programmes.  [87843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w12.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> The Government believes that investment in science research generates substantial benefits for society and the economy. The main vehicle for Government investment in basic and strategic research is the Science Budget. The metrics that are used to measure the performance of the UK Science and Engineering Base as a whole at present are:-
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Quality: measured by the UK's ranking in terms of citations.
<P>
<BR>
(b) Relevance: the proportion of HEI funding from non governmental sources.
<P>
<BR>
(c) Cost-effectiveness: measured by the UK's ranking in terms of the number of papers published per #1 million of public expenditure on science.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30115w12.html_para2">One mechanism through which investment in the Science Base is translated into economic benefit is through the knowledge transfer activities of the Science and Engineering Base. Metrics in this area include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Trends in numbers of patents applied for
<P>
<BR>
(b) Trends in the number of licensing agreements
<P>
<BR>
(c) Trends in income from licensing Intellectual property rights
<P>
<BR>
(d) Metrics of spin-outs
<P>
<BR>
(e) Trends in RC income from the UK private sector
<P>
<BR>
(f) Trends in co-publication with industry
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30115w12.html_para3">In addition Government Departments, including DTI, fund scientific research programmes in support of their objectives. This type of research will be evaluated primarily in terms of its contribution to the achievement of the relevant departmental policy or regulatory goals, rather than its overall economic impact as such. The Government is keen however to see that any economic benefits flowing from such research are properly exploited. To that end the Government's science, engineering and technology strategy, XInvesting in Innovation" published in July 2002, made recommendations for strengthening departmental mechanisms for ensuring appropriate knowledge transfer.

Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug.

Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Filkin) for Race Equality, Community Policy and European and International Policy represents the Home Office on the Ministers' Committee ENV(G). It is not the policy of Government Departments to disclose details of Ministers' attendance of meetings.

<a name="30115w14.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with road haulage companies regarding the security of vehicles against illegal immigrants.  [90324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w14.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There was widespread consultation with the transport industry prior to the introduction, in April 2000, of the regime under which road hauliers and others may receive penalties for the carriage of clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom. That consultation included how road hauliers could secure their vehicles against unauthorised entry.
<P>

<a name="30115w14.html_para2">Since the regime was introduced, and during the recent passage through Parliament of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, which brought in an amended regime from 8 December 2002, there has been frequent correspondence and meetings with the industry, both at ministerial and official level.
<P>

<a name="30115w14.html_para3">Responsibility for securing vehicles against unauthorised entry lies with transport operators. Those who take the measures described in the XPrevention of Clandestine Entry Code of Practice" will greatly reduce both the risk of carrying clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom and of receiving a penalty should they do so. Compliance with the Code is promoted strongly in all our dealings with the industry and this message was reinforced more recently in the awareness raising campaign that took place in the weeks leading to the implementation of the amended penalty regime.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2003 : Column 657W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30115w14.html_para4">During the course of administering the penalty provisions, officials often give advice on an individual basis to companies about the level of vehicle security expected, and about compliance with the Code of Practice. The Code is available on the Home Office Website as well as on request from the Civil Penalty Central Administration Unit by telephoning 020 8745 6006.

proceed in accordance with the previous standards. All planned new buildings notified to the local authority under the Building Act on or after 1 April 2002 must comply with the new requirements. Between July and September 2002, there will thus have been some buildings being constructed to the old standards and some to the new standards. There is no centrally collected information on the proportions of new buildings in each category.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what progress has been made in the procurement of a national radio network for the fire service; and when he expects the budget to be complete.  [90434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A notice announcing the procurement was published in the official journal of the European Communities on 24 October 2002, approximately three months ahead of schedule. As a result 45 companies requested pre-qualification documentation. Subsequently 33 companies submitted a response; of these 17 wished to be considered as the main contractor and 13 as possible subcontractors. The evaluation of these responses is continuing and due to be completed during February 2003. Invitations to submit formal proposals will be issued to the pre-qualified organisations in May 2003.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para0">The budget for the ongoing costs of the project team is complete already: it is being funded from within the office of the Deputy Prime Minister resources. The budget for the main project investment will be in place before contracts fall to be signed, in financial year 2004&#150;05.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Fire service redeployments are arranged at local level and are not recorded by Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate. In a number of fire brigades responsibility rests at station level to arrange short term redeployments to maintain crewing on a day by day basis. In such cases the overall crewing level for the brigade would be recorded, but individual movements would not be directly measured. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not aware of any significant movement between rural or urban areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Homeless children under the age of 16, are the responsibility of social services. Under the homelessness legislation, as amended by the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 and the Homelessness Act 2002 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2003 : Column 667W</I><P>
which both came into force on 31 July 2002, local housing authorities in England must ensure that suitable accommodation is available for children aged 16 or 17 who are homeless through no fault of their own (unless they are a relevant child for the purposes of the Children Act 1989 and the responsibility of social services).
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para2">In terms of supporting families with children, in March 2002 the Government announced a commitment that by March 2004 local authorities shall ensure that no homeless family with children is in a Bed and Breakfast hotel (B&B) other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para3">High B&B using councils have been required to submit action plans on how they intend to meet this commitment. The Homelessness Directorate is working closely with these and other lower using councils on delivery of these action plans. This has been supported by a #35 million grant programme in 2002&#150;03 together with changes to housing benefit subsidy implemented by the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para4">For 2003&#150;04 the Homelessness Directorate will allocate up to a further #15 million to help authorities meet the March 2004 B&B commitment.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para5">On 3 December, I announced that the Government intends to outlaw the use of B&Bs for homeless families except in an emergency. The Government will be consulting in due course on options for strengthening the homelessness legislation by Order and through statutory guidance to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>end the use of privately owned B&B establishments as temporary accommodation for homeless families with children except in emergencies and even then for no more than six weeks;
<P>
<BR>
set minimum accommodation fitness and proposed management standards in all temporary accommodation used by local authorities to house homeless households;
<P>
<BR>
set additional fitness standards for shared facility (B&B) type privately owned temporary accommodation used by local authorities to house homeless households.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30115w17.html_para6">The Government has set a target to bring all social housing up to a decent standard and to increase the proportion of private housing occupied by vulnerable groups that is in a decent condition by 2010.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para7">The Government has also announced a new house-building programme worth more than #1.2 billion, up #365 million on the current year. The extra funds have been allocated to the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP) and should deliver up to 21,000 affordable homes in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 A specific Planning Policy Guidance Note on light pollution has not been issued. However, in 1997, the Government issued XLighting in the Countryside: Towards Good Practice". This document gives advice on the adverse effects of lighting schemes associated with development, both in the countryside and in the urban context.

<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made no estimate of the cost of re-organising local government in the English regions as this will vary significantly, dependent on which regions opt for elected Regional Assemblies, the extent of two tier authorities in these regions, the changes recommended by the Boundary Committee for England and subsequent decisions made by the newly created authorities about their organisational structure and levels of service provision. As indicated in the draft guidance to the Boundary Committee on which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently consulting. A model is being developed to be available to the Boundary Committee, or those making proposals to the Committee, to assess the relative cost differentials of different unitary structures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For the purpose of distribution of the Deprived Urban Post Office Fund, an urban area is a ward in a community of over 10,000 people, while a deprived area is a ward in the 20 per cent. most deprived wards in England, as measured by the indices of Deprivation 2000.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para8">The Indices of Deprivation 2000 are measures of deprivation for every ward and local authority area in England. They combine a number of indicators which cover a range of domains (Income, Employment, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education, Skills and Training, Housing and Geographical Access to Services) into a single deprivation score for each area.
<P>

<a name="30115w17.html_para9">The Deprived Urban Post Office Fund is only available to sub-post offices located in the 20 per cent. most deprived urban wards, with priority given to those located in the 10 per cent. most deprived urban wards.

<a name="30115w18.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether there is scientific evidence to suggest that the presence of amnesic shellfish poisoning toxins in scallops represent a threat to human health; what scientific investigations have been carried out by the Government in relation to the impact of ASP on human health; and what scientific evidence was used to determine this level.  [89453]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w18.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The most recent significant outbreak of amnesic shellfish poisoning affecting humans was recorded in Canada in 1987. Approximately 150 people became ill; there were 19 people hospitalised and four deaths. Following the outbreak, the Canadian authorities imposed an action limit in mussels of 20mg/kg domoic acid per gram of tissue, above which harvesting was suspended. This was based on observations of those who became ill, including estimates of levels of toxins actually ingested.
<P>

<a name="30115w18.html_para0">The European Union adopted this action limit for mussels and other bivalve molluscs including scallops in 1997 (Directive 97/61/EC). The Food Standards Agency has recently written to the European Commission asking them to consider the case for a scientific review of the current internationally accepted action level of 20 mg/kg in scallops, and how such a review may be taken forward.

<P>
<a name="30115w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the level of amnesic shellfish poisoning may vary from scallop to scallop; and on what basis the whole Irish Sea scallop fishery is closed when one particular scallop is detected with levels of AMP above that of the safety level.  [89454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30115w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the level of domoic acid, which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning, may vary from scallop to scallop. Closures of scallop fisheries are not based on the analysis performed on one scallop, but an homogenate sample of a number of scallops.

<i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> The Food Standards Agency has published an initial regulatory impact assessment on its website as part of its stakeholder consultation on the Commission's proposed Regulation COM (2002) 377. That Regulation will provide rules for official controls on abattoirs. The Agency estimates the costs to the meat sector would be approximately neutral, although some abattoirs would benefit from reduced levels of veterinary supervision. How costs fall between industry and government will be dependent on a proposal for a further Regulation on official feed and food controls expected to be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="30115w18.html_para3">The Agency's consultations on the Commission's official controls proposals have elicited a number of responses, many expressing concern should the proposals result in new unjustified burdens and costs on the abattoir sector.

 The Howard League for Penal Reform took the Home Office to judicial review over a statement in Prison Service guidance that the Children Act 1989 did not apply to children under the age of eighteen in prison establishments. Mr. Justice Munby's judgment, handed down on 29 November, ruled that the Children Act 1989 applied to children in prison, subject to the requirements of imprisonment. The judgment upheld the Prison Service's policy in relation to juveniles in custody. One sentence in its policy, which was to be changed regardless of the outcome of the judgment, has been found to be wrong. This will now be changed by the Home Office in the context of the judgment.

These include sexual health leaflets, the Sexual Health and National AIDS Helpline and the website which supports the Department's new safer sex campaign. In addition, Terrence Higgins Trust are funded by the Department to produce health promotion materials for gay men. These include leaflets (specifically 'The Manual' and 'Man[sex]Man') with messages around oral sex. The advice is consistent with the statement of risk issued in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30115w20.html_para2">Oral sex is common in both homosexual and heterosexual relationships, but its frequency among men who have sex with men has highlighted its potential contribution to HIV transmission. Recent information collected by the Public Health Laboratory Service found that, in 2 per cent. of new HIV cases in men reported as infected through sex between men, they believed themselves to have been infected through oral sex. On following up these reports, more probable routes of infection than oral sex were found in some men. Hence the true proportion of new HIV cases that can be attributed to oral sex will be less than 2 per cent..

One of these measures was to develop the 'Sitefinder'mobile phone base station database, which is a national database of mobile phone base stations and their emissions. The database is managed by the RA, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, on behalf of the Government. The database provides information on all operational, externally sited, cellular radio transmitters in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and is updated every three months.

 We believe that determining the appropriateness of specific measures for surveillance in care homes is best done locally, on a home by home basis. National Care Standards Commission area offices are best placed to assess the need for such measures in a particular care home within the broad statutory guidelines. In doing so they should take into account such things as the perceived needs of residents; the prevention of abuse; residents' right to privacy; staff training, numbers, and supervisory arrangements.

 My Department complies with the Six Service Standards for General Government. To meet the key standard of answering letters quickly and clearly, the Department has set itself a target of responding, in full, within 15 working days of receipt. This is in regard to general correspondence and would include any responses to local authorities.

 The Government believe it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of 'ethical' products. However, it would not be appropriate for the Government to exclusively support the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.

 Recurrent grant aid to the Northern Ireland universities for 2002&#150;03 from the Department for Employment and Learning, based on the 2001 Census figures, amounts to #16.41 per head of population. Additionally, #4.09 per head is profiled to be spent through the Support Programme for University Research and #1.74 through the Science Research Investment Fund. These figures disregard capital funding not specifically for research initiatives and research funded by other Departments.
