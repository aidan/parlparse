 The available information is provided in the following table. In service aircraft includes those undergoing planned depth maintenance but excludes those which are redundant, declared as surplus or awaiting disposal. The forward fleet (FF) comprises aircraft which are serviceable or short-term unserviceable. Fit for purpose (FFP) aircraft include only serviceable aircraft available to the front-line commands for operational and training purposes. The number of aircraft available in each category varies according to normal fleet management activities including requirements for mandated maintenance and upgrade programmes.

 On 15 November 2010, the Government published proposals for reform of legal aid including social welfare law. We propose that legal aid be retained in the highest priority cases-in debt and housing when someone's home is at immediate risk, for homelessness case, and disrepair cases where health or life is at serious risk. We will retain legal aid in Community Care cases. Legal aid will also continue to be available where it is now for unlawful discrimination employment cases.

 Neither my Department nor the Legal Services Commission has made any such assessment. Cases granted legal aid funding will have satisfied the current merits test (for civil legal aid) or the interests of justice test (for criminal legal aid). The proposals set within the recent legal aid consultation are designed to encourage people to explore alternative methods of dispute resolution and, where possible, to resolve their problems without recourse to the courts. The aim is to create a stable and sustainable system that ensures access to public funding in those cases that really require it, the protection of the most vulnerable in our society and the efficient performance of our justice system.</p>

 We receive occasional correspondence on stigma in relation to claiming free school meals. It is an issue that we take very seriously-there are clear financial and nutritional benefits for pupils from poorer families taking a free school lunch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="110203w0004.htm_para56"><a name="11020337004196">Cashless catering or 'swipe card' arrangements, integrated dining/queuing and pricing meals so that the cost of a meal is the same for those on free lunches as it is for others, are some of the helpful ways schools can minimise the easy identification and stigmatisation of pupils on free meals. Many schools have chosen to invest their targeted kitchen capital funding in cashless systems for this reason.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="110203w0004.htm_para57"><a name="11020337004197">The Department has worked closely with other Government Departments to develop a Free School Meals Eligibility Checking System, known as "the ECS". The ECS enables local authorities to check data from the Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in order to find out if a family qualifies for free school meals. It represents a significant achievement in reducing bureaucracy and cost for local authorities and encouraging more parents to sign up their children for a free school lunch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="110203w0004.htm_para58"><a name="11020337004198">Bullying or victimisation of pupils claiming free school meals is totally unacceptable.

 The Department receives a number of complaints from parents on a variety of school attendance related matters. These are usually considered under section 496/7 of the Education Act 1996. The decision whether or not to authorise individual pupil absences rests with the person who has responsibility for the school register (normally the head teacher) and the governing body of the school which has overall responsibility for the register. Where a governing body has followed the relevant attendance regulations it is unlikely that there will be grounds for the Secretary of State to intervene.</p>

There is provision within the school attendance order framework for parents to complain to the Secretary of State if they feel that the local authority has acted unreasonably in continuing to enforce a school attendance order.

<i> [holding answer 25 January 2011]:</i> The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census, PRU and AP census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract £430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or Young People's Learning Agency if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

In 2011-12, each pupil will attract £430 of funding which will go to the responsible local authority who will pass it to maintained schools for pupils who have been in care for six months or more in the year to 31 March 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="110203w0004.htm_para71"><a name="11020337004238">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In Coventry in January 2010 there were 10,395 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of £4,469,850. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower.</p>

 Religious education holds a unique position as a statutory subject in the basic curriculum for all pupils in maintained schools in England. It is not a part of the National Curriculum, which means that there are no statutory national programmes of study, attainment targets or assessment arrangements. The nature of RE is such that local authorities and schools, who know their communities, are best positioned to design a syllabus which reflects local traditions and needs. The locally agreed syllabus, which is designed by Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education SACRE and adopted by the local authority, is statutory, and that means that local authorities must provide such a syllabus and that maintained schools must follow it. Schools with a religious character can either follow the locally agreed syllabus, or use a syllabus which has been agreed by their governing body. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governors and local authorities (LAs) to make the necessary provisions for RE in all maintained schools.</p>

 Religious education (RE) is a statutory part of the basic curriculum of maintained schools in England, but not a part of the national curriculum. There are a number of important components of a broad and balanced school curriculum for which, as is currently the case, it would be inappropriate to prescribe national programmes of study. RE falls into this category, and therefore, falls outside the scope of a review of the national curriculum.</p>

 For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"><a name="110203w0004.htm_para81"><a name="11020337004370">However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>
