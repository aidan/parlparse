<p><a name="40616w01.html_wqn0"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what resources will be available to National Air Traffic Services to ensure that it is able to carry out the airspace work in time to meet the Aviation White Paper&#039;s timetable for new runways at <i>(a)</i> Stansted, <i>(b)</i> Heathrow and <i>(c)</i> Birmingham; and what reports he has received of difficulties with National Air Traffic Services which might hinder this work; [178481]




</p>



<p>(2) what further steps he will take to ensure the robustness of the air traffic control system in the light of the construction of the new runways envisaged by the Aviation White Paper.  [178482]</p>








<p><a name="40616w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Government are satisfied&#151;and the National Audit Office has confirmed&#151;that last year&#039;s re-financing of NATS has put the company on a robust financial footing and that it is able to make further vital investment to expand capacity to meet future growth. Work on the investment programme has re-started and NATS will invest some &#163;1 billion in the national air traffic control system over the next 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w01.html_para0">
I have received no reports of difficulties within the company that might hinder NATS in carrying out the airspace work envisaged for it in the Aviation White Paper. The skills and experience necessary to carry forward airspace and procedure design work in support of such initiatives are, however, highly specialised, and NATS and the BAA are currently scoping the extent of the additional work required. This will identify the specific expertise and resources required, and whether NATS will need to seek additional skills as a result of this work.

<p><a name="40616w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The most recent is a Government commissioned report, by the Transport Research Laboratory, published in October 1988, which concluded that if the UK adopted Central European Time (CET) i.e. GMT + one hour in the winter from October to March and GMT + two hours in the summer from March to October, thereby making the evenings lighter, there could be a saving of over 100 deaths per year, and taken together with serious injuries, save well over 400 such casualties.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many thefts were committed on <i>(a)</i> the railways and <i>(b)</i> buses in each year since 1997.  [175453]</p>








<p><a name="40616w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The British Transport Police (BTP) have provided the following information on the number of recorded thefts on the railways within Great Britain since 1998; information is not readily available for earlier than 1998.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w01.html_para1">
The offence of theft on the railway includes theft from the person, theft of personal property and theft of luggage. In April 2002 BTP adopted the National Crime Recording standard, which makes the reporting of crime more victim focused, and crime is assessed on the probability of such offences having taken place. A crime will be recorded if on the balance of probability: <i>(a)</i> the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law and <i>(b)</i> there is no credible evidence to the contrary. The introduction of this standard accounts for a proportion of the rise between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03.

No data is held centrally regarding the number of thefts committed on buses. However, it is known that there were 254 robberies from bus crews in 2001 and 294 in 2002. The Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel (STOP) has been established to look at ways to combat assaults, anti-social behaviour and vandalism at stops and stations and on vehicles and property. The Panel brings together those involved in dealing with the issue of safety and security, and includes operators, local authorities, police and unions. It is charged with the important task of facilitating the exchange of ideas and spreading best practice and is considering how the collection of accurate bus and coach crime data can be improved.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many people were informed by the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency that they are required to resit their driving test because they failed to apply for a full licence within two years of passing their original test in each year since 1997.  [177491]</p>








<p><a name="40616w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Information is not collected showing the number of drivers who have failed to claim their full entitlement within two years and have needed to retake their driving test. The Agency has tackled this in varying ways, including the issuing of reminders to drivers with unclaimed entitlement and more recently by adjusting the fee structure to allow updated licences to be issued free of charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w01.html_para3">
DVLA and DSA will introduce a scheme later this year to streamline the process and remove the problem of unclaimed test passes. In most cases, the system will allow the updated licence to be issued automatically following a successful test, without the need for a separate application.

An advanced digital map supporting the on-road ISA trials is funded by a separate contract at a cost of &#163;158,383.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w01.html_para5">
The main aim of the current project is to study drivers&#039; behavioural adaptation over time. A trial of 20 ISA equipped cars is currently under way in Leeds.

<p>
<a name="40616w02.html_para2">
We have not undertaken specific research on the problems caused by cyclists using footpaths and pavements, or the related concerns of older people. The existence of such activity demonstrates a need to accommodate cyclists wishing to gain access to destinations currently served by pedestrian-only routes and we advise local authorities that they should first attempt to satisfy this demand by improving conditions for cyclists on the road network. Where this is impracticable, the solution is to formally change the status of footpaths or footways so that cyclists can legally use them. This decision is not taken lightly and such conversions often require physical changes to ensure the routes can operate safely. To this end, we have commissioned research which investigated the operation of routes formally intended for use by both cyclists and pedestrians. The purpose of this was to inform the preparation of updated advice to local authorities on this issue in the form of a revised Local Transport Note (LTN). We have also contributed to research conducted on behalf of the Countryside Agency which examined the level of interaction between these user groups on off-road routes. The latter showed that while the perception of conflict on these routes was significant, actual conflict was not. In producing the revised LTN, we are aiming to improve physical conditions on these routes and hence reduce the perceived level of conflict.

The provisional outturn for FY 2003&#150;04 is &#163;7.99 million. Expenditure on entertainment and hospitality will vary for a number of reasons, but has been rising in line with the Strategic Defence Review intention to increase engagement with other countries through defence diplomacy, aimed at preventing conflict and increasing international stability. Planned expenditure for this financial year, after allowing for the effect of inflation, is expected to be the same, or lower, than the outturn in FY 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="40616w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Comprehensive arrangements, which comply fully with legal requirements and have been approved by the Health and Safety Executive&#039;s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, are in place to ensure the safety of all personnel working on nuclear submarines. Personnel exiting the reactor compartments must be monitored before they are permitted to leave the submarine (by suitably qualified and experienced workers) using hand-held instrumentation capable of detecting very low levels of radioactive contamination. This monitoring is precautionary as work procedures and protective clothing are designed to minimise the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2004 : Column 939W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
chance of becoming contaminated. Secondary monitoring (using a walk-through monitor), which takes place after the worker has completed primary monitoring and removed his protective clothing, is compulsory when contamination is suspected or found.

Each farm wishing to bring stock on as part of a multiple drop-off or to move stock off as part of a multiple pick-up is required to do so only from an approved point on the farm premises. The approved point has to meet standards designed to minimise the spread of disease.

<p><a name="40616w05.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 June 2004]:</i> Following a post-mortem examination of a suspect case of botulism in a Holstein yearling heifer in September 2003 on a farm in Cumbria, the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VA) identified a viral-type encephalomyelitis on histological examination. Examination for the most common neurotropic viruses in the UK proved negative. It was decided that veterinary practitioners 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2004 : Column 947W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
should be informed by a letter to the Veterinary Record that suspect botulism cases in cattle might be viral in origin. As background for the letter an examination of VLA records with similar histological findings was carried out. This revealed 21 similar cases of polioencephalomyelitis in cattle and sheep (20 ovine 1 bovine) but with different clinical presentations from 13 premises in England over the past 10 years. The Cumbrian case was reported to the UK Zoonoses Group (UKZG) which considers possible public health action with regard to existing and emerging zoonotic infections. The UKZG suggested that the Health Protection Agency (HPA) be asked to use its recently developed risk assessment algorithm to assess public health implications once more information on the case has been collated.

 Many hunt kennels traditionally dispose of calves, which are the most suitable livestock for feeding to hounds, although some may take small numbers of horses, sheep and other livestock. As hunt kennels do not operate in all areas of the UK and calves are estimated to form only a small percentage of the overall quantity of fallen stock that requires disposal the role of hunt kennels in collecting and disposing of fallen stock under the National Scheme is likely to be small.

[178082]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2004 : Column 953W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40616w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 June 2004]:</i> The first documented release of grey squirrels into the UK was in 1876 in Cheshire, with subsequent introduction to sites ranging from Glamorgan to Kent totalling more than 350 individuals. Grey squirrels are now present in every English county and absent only from parts of Cumbria and Northumberland, a small area of the Sefton coast, the Isle of Wight and Poole harbour islands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w07.html_para5">
Numbers of grey squirrels fluctuate considerably between years. However, the population was estimated at 2.5 million in the 1990s and it is likely to have increased since then as their range has expanded. Through the Tracking Mammals Partnership, funding has been secured from both Joint Nature Conservation Committee and Peoples&#039; Trust for Endangered Species for a scoping study to investigate monitoring strategies for squirrels to address these issues.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of grey squirrels on indigenous flora and fauna; and what recent research studies into the ecological effects of grey squirrels her Department has carried out.  [178083]</p>








<p><a name="40616w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 June 2004]:</i> The impact of the introduced grey squirrel on the native red squirrel is well known. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the spread of the grey has been closely linked with the decline and disappearance of the red squirrel from most of England. Although the two species may co-exist in some areas for many years, it seems that sooner or later the greys will dominate and the reds disappear. The exact mechanism for this replacement is not entirely clear; some recent work confirms the importance of interspecific competition, but a disease, parapox virus, which is harmless to greys but fatal to reds, may also be involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w07.html_para6">
Squirrel presence surveys carried out by the Forestry Commission since the 1950s recorded the presence of bark stripping damage to individual tree species in woodlands. During 2000 a survey of private and state owned woodlands within the distribution range of grey squirrels in Great Britain further investigated damage levels by recording damage severity. Current studies are investigating the effect of grey squirrel bark stripping damage to oak in terms of tree growth rates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w07.html_para7">
The review &quot;Possible effects of grey squirrels on birds and other wildlife&quot;, published in <i>British Wildlife</i> in February 2004, reviewed evidence of predation by squirrels on birds&#039; eggs and nestlings, potential competition with birds for nest sites and food and competition with native mammals. Possible effects on woodland structure through their bark stripping activities and as a predator of tree seeds and bulbs were also considered.

<i>[holding answer 10 June 2004]:</i> Historical data show red squirrels to have been ubiquitous throughout England until the 1920s. Since 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2004 : Column 954W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the grey squirrel was released in the late 19th and early 20th century and their subsequent spread, the red squirrel has suffered a concurrent range contraction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w07.html_para8">
The red squirrel seems to have made some small gains in the Yorkshire Dales, where it has been able to expand into plantations that are now maturing and producing good crops of the pine cones that it needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w07.html_para9">
The continuing expansion of the grey squirrel is to be expected and red squirrel conservation is focused on limiting that expansion in areas where the two species overlap. Some significant progress has been made in developing more effective and targeted ways of defending healthy populations of red squirrels against replacement by the grey squirrel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w12.html_para1">
The Strategy seeks to improve travel opportunities for people living in deep rural areas, villages and small settlements. The initiatives in the RTS, when fully implemented, will reduce inequalities in society by improving accessibility for, amongst others, people with disabilities, people without access to a car, older people and people living in rural areas. The pace of implementation of the Strategy will depend on the level of public funding, which will be determined through the annual Budgetary processes.

The Department is seeking to improve transport opportunities for older people living in rural communities through a range of initiatives.

Older people are able to get free concessionary travel on these rural services.

In 2003&#150;04 the Department for Regional Development initiated a public tendering exercise (Bus Challenge) to attract new stage carriage routes across Northern Ireland.

<a name="40616w12.html_para5">
Later this year the Department intends to initiate several Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) pilots in deep rural areas. It is hoped that these types of services will offer greater independence and new travel opportunities for older people living in those areas. DRT services may, for example, divert off certain sections of their route if requested and provide bookable door-to-door services for older people and people with disabilities.

they will prove useful as I consider ways in which we can deal with the past in Northern Ireland. There are many interesting lessons to be learned from the South African experience, and I will be reflecting on these. But any solution must be tailored to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland and must command widespread support.

 Breach of an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is a criminal offence. The usual range of sentencing options for juveniles up to the maximum is available, with the exception of a conditional discharge which is not available for breach of an ASBO. The maximum penalty for breach of ASBO for 12 to 17-year-olds is a 24-month Detention and Training Order. 10 to 11-year-olds can be given community orders for ASBO breaches (these are not custodial).

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 10 March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1567&#150;68W, on asylum and immigration, for what reasons people are referred to medical inspectors; and what assessment he has made of the reasons for the increase in referrals seen at Heathrow.  [162221]</p>








<p><a name="40616w13.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Under Schedule 2 paragraph 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 (c.77), immigration officers have the power to refer any individual who is subject to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2004 : Column 974W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
immigration control to a doctor for a medical examination at the port of entry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w13.html_para0">
Under paragraph 36 of the Immigration Rules (HC395 as amended)

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A person who intends to remain in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally be referred to the Medical Inspector for examination. If he produces a medical certificate he should be advised to hand it to the Medical Inspector. Any person seeking entry who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit, or who appears not to be in good mental or physical health, should also be referred to the Medical Inspector; and the Immigration Officer has discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to refer for examination in any other case.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w13.html_para1">
However, the long-standing policy (formalised by the 1992 Department of Health publication &quot;Medical Examination under the Immigration Act 1971: Instructions to Medical Inspectors&quot;) is that normally only those who:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(i) are seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom for 6 months or more and have come from countries where there is a high risk of having been exposed to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis; or</p>

<p>
<a name="40616w13.html_para2">
Only Heathrow and Gatwick have a permanent medical inspector. At other UK ports where there is no permanent medical inspector doctors are available on-call.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w13.html_para3">
There has been no change in the policy for referral of passengers to the medical inspector. It is not possible to provide reasons for the increase in the numbers referred without conducting a full and detailed analysis which would be at disproportionate cost.

 The identity cards scheme is still in the early design stage but we are planning for it to be flexible in offering different levels of card checks to suit the particular transactions. For example, retailers wanting to check proof of age might just check the person against the photograph on the card and the date of birth. In comparison, public or private sector organisations might check a person&#039;s biometric using a reader and verify this against the National Identity Register before providing a service.

It is too soon to finalise how exactly the more sophisticated types of verification check will be made and the type of technology which will be used.

The draft Identity Cards Bill also makes clear that these

Examples of who could be included under Clause 2(4) include failed asylum seekers, illegal immigrants who are removed and third country nationals intending to stay in the country for less than three months but whose passport has been surrendered for bail purposes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 24 May 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1419W, on identity cards, whether failure to produce an identity card as proposed by the draft Identity Cards Bill will provide grounds for arrest in circumstances where a non-arrestable offence is suspected.  [176454]</p>








<p><a name="40616w14.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Government have made it clear that it will not be a requirement to carry an identity card or to produce a card to a police officer on demand and, as such, it will not be an offence for a person to fail to produce an identity card to a police constable. The police will not have power to arrest for failure to provide an identity card.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40616w14.html_para5">
Police powers in England and Wales to identify a person arrested for a recordable offence are contained in section 25 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984. This section states that where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any offence which is not an arrestable offence has been committed or attempted, or is being committed or attempted, he may arrest the relevant person if it appears to him that the service of a summons is impractical or inappropriate because any of the general arrest conditions is satisfied. The general arrest conditions include where the name or address of the relevant person is unknown to, and cannot be readily ascertained by, the constable, or that the constable has reasonable grounds for doubting whether a name or address furnished by the relevant person is his real name. Similar provisions under different statutes apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

These powers will be unaffected by the introduction of an identity card.

The Department recommends breastfeeding as the best form of nutrition for infants as it provides all the nutrients a baby needs for the first six months of life and has positive health benefits for both mother and baby in the short and longer term. Breastfed infants are five times less likely to be admitted to hospital with infections such as gastro-enteritis in the first year of life and may be less likely to become obese in later childhood.

 Lungs have already been successfully transplanted from non-heart beating donors in Sweden, Spain, the United States of America and the United Kingdom.

<p><a name="40616w22.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The initial phase of recruitment of forum members in the three months to 1 December 2003 provided each of the 571 forums with their statutory minimum of seven members. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) calculated that membership could increase to an average of 10 per forum within its existing budget and continued to recruit volunteers with this target in mind.

Increasing forum membership was raised as a key issue at a series of 31 regional meetings in May 2004, attended by around 1,200 forum members. In particular, forums which covered a large geographical area, for example, ambulance and mental health trusts and specialist and national hospitals, felt they needed flexibility to recruit more than 10 members.

In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. These report information reaching back to 1995&#150;06. Information for earlier years could be obtained only at disproportionate cost and in some cases will no longer be held. Information for 2003&#150;04 will be published in due course.

<p><a name="40616w26.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Tynan: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many employees in the Department have <i>(a)</i> signed a formal opt out from and <i>(b)</i> are exempt from the Working Time Directive; and how many employees in his Department have recorded hours, including any accruing on a flexitime basis, in excess of the maximum allowed under the Working Time Directive in the last month for which figures are available.

<p><a name="40616w26.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 Managers in my Department are required to obtain a written agreement if an employee chooses to work more than the 48 hour average weekly limit. This information is held locally and is not readily available. I will write to the hon. member as soon as the information is available. There are currently no staff employed who are exempt from the Working Time Directive. Working hours, including those accruing on a flexitime basis, are monitored by line managers locally and no central figures are available. Managers are instructed to monitor hours closely if staff work close to or over 48 hours per week to ensure compliance with the Regulations. The Department is fully committed to reducing the number of employees required to work in excess of 48 hours per week commensurate with operational needs. It does so by adjusting working hours and redesigning jobs in order to keep such posts to an absolute minimum and the policy is kept under regular review.
