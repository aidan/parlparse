<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much has been spent by his Department on asbestos surveys since 1 January 2001; how much has been spent on the management and removal of asbestos for each building in which asbestos has been identified; and what budget is available for the Department and its agencies to <i>(a)</i> commission asbestos surveys and <i>(b)</i> manage and remove asbestos from buildings in (i) 2003 and (ii) 2004.  [130911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Detailed costings have not been undertaken in the case of all the Chancellor's Departments, and where this is the case, the data requested can be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. Available data are as follows:
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para0">Customs and Excise and the Valuation Office Agency both recorded nil expenditure for asbestos surveys or the removal of asbestos between 1 January 2001 and 1 April 2001. Further information in both cases could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para1">The Government Actuary's Department and the Debt Management Office both recorded nil expenditure for asbestos surveys and removal of asbestos since 1 January 2001.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para2">Work is currently under way on the National Savings and Investments' Glasgow site. Estimated cost of the remedial work to date is &#163;500,000, and estimated costs to the end of the financial year are &#163;750,000 (excluding VAT).
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para3">Since 1 January 2001, the Royal Mint has spent &#163;6,802 on asbestos surveys. Expenditure incurred in removing asbestos was &#163;1,380 in 2001; &#163;20,120 in 2002; and &#163;2,980 in 2003.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para4">The Office of National Statistics is currently in the process of conducting a new asbestos survey at a cost of &#163;78,000. Expenditure on remedial work since 1 January 2001 is &#163;154,000.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para5">Expenditure by the Office of Government Commerce on asbestos surveys since January 2001 is approximately &#163;27,000. The cost of remedial work since January 2001 is &#163;279,000.

 Government grant to local authorities has increased over the period since 1997. Overall there has been a 25 per cent. real increase in total grants since 1997, compared with a 7 per cent. cut in real terms in the four years previously. Most recently, the Local Government Financial Settlement for 2003&#150;04 increased local authority funding through Formula Grant by 5.9 per cent. in real terms. Including other grants, the increase is over 8 per cent. For the first time, every local authority has generated above inflation increases this year.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para6">It is in this context that local authorities have made their decisions about the level of council tax they wish to set in their areas.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many customs officers there are stationed west of the line from Bristol to Southampton.  [131172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I refer my hon. friend to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) on 8 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 99W.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para8">This information is not available in the format requested. Figures for the number of Customs and Excise Officers by Government Office region are published on an annual basis in the Civil Service Statistics, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House, and from the Cabinet Office website.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para9">The Customs figures are based on the number of officers whose office address falls within the defined area. However, Customs are a flexible resource and are frequently called upon to work across regions. In addition, regional staff are supplemented by the National Strike Force, a mobile brigade which is deployed on a national basis according to risk. Staff in these teams are allocated an office address for administrative purposes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list all the documentation issued by his Department that an employer must complete when he or she takes on his or her first employee, in order to be fully compliant; and if he will make a statement.  [128689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 If the employee provides a form P45 showing past pay and tax details, the employer should complete its Part 3 and send it to the Inland Revenue. If there is no form P45, employer and employee should complete a form P46 and send it to the Inland Revenue.



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 3W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para10">A new employer also needs to set up a PAYE scheme with the Inland Revenue. He or she does this by supplying the necessary details to a dedicated telephone helpline. The Inland Revenue then issue the employer with a "New Employer's Starter Pack". This contains guidance and documentation that the employer may need to operate PAYE throughout the year. The contents and format of this guidance have been developed in consultation with representatives of employers. The CD-ROM version has been particularly well received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Richard Lambert published an interim report of his review of higher education-business links on 14 July. This set out a summary of the consultation responses and emerging issues. The Government welcome the emerging findings and expect to receive the final report of the review in the autumn, to which we will respond in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the cost was to his Department of media and voice training for ministers and officials in each year since 1997.  [123133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Treasury Ministers and officials have not received voice coaching.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para11">Media training for Ministers cost &#163;1,199 in 2002&#150;03. No expenditure was incurred in earlier years.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para12">Officials can attend courses run by CMPS or GIGS which include media training, but these costs are not identified separately in the Department's records.

 The Government publish the overall costs of all ministerial overseas travel and a list of all visits overseas by Cabinet Ministers costing in excess of &#163;500 on an annual basis. For the period up to 31 March 2003, I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the answer given by the Prime Minister to the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) on 16 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 327W. The next list for the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 will be published at the end of the financial year.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para13">In respect of gifts received, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 17 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 445W.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para14">In the UK, the Chancellor visited Aberdeen University in April to receive an honorary degree at a cost of &#163;192, the Carnegie Foundation in Edinburgh in May at no cost, the AMICUS conference in Blackpool in June at a cost of &#163;306, the TGWU conference in Brighton in July at a cost of &#163;42, the Local Government

<a name="31014w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Public Sector Pensions</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the latest estimate is of the present value of the liability for payment of pensions to the beneficiaries of unfunded public sector schemes; and what the value would be if the real rate of discount was <i>(a)</i> 3.0 per cent., <i>(b)</i> 2.5 per cent., <i>(c)</i> 2.0 per cent. and <i>(d)</i> the real rate of return on an index-linked stock of similar duration to maturity.  [130882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government Actuary's Department estimate that the liabilities of unfunded public service pension schemes were approximately &#163;380 billion as at 31 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para16">It is not possible to update that figure before the 2002&#150;03 Resource Accounts for public service pension schemes are published. Revaluation of public service pension liabilities using different discount rates could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer in relation to the estimation of the cost of pensions under the Whole of Government Accounts, why it has been decided <i>(a)</i> to issue figures without explanatory notes, and <i>(b)</i> to publish copies of guidance issued to Departments about the estimation of the cost of pensions.  [130883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Central Government Accounts will be published for the first time for 2003&#150;04, as part of the phased introduction of Whole of Government Accounts. Central Government Accounts will include the consolidation of the transactions and balances of those public sector pension schemes covered by the Resource Accounting Manual and other central Government accounting guidance. Central Government Accounts will provide a full explanation of the pension figures in both the income and expenditure account and balance sheet.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para17">The liabilities of the main unfunded public service pension schemes are estimated by the scheme's actuary using assumptions published with the pension scheme accounts, as required by FRS17 and in accordance with the Resource Accounting Manual. Any Departments operating their own unfunded schemes are advised to seek guidance from the Government Actuary's Department on the calculation of the liabilities that should appear in their accounts.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para18">The Resource Accounting Manual, which contains accounting guidance for Departments on all accounting matters, is publicly available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer in relation to the estimation of the cost of pensions under the Whole of Government Accounts, what excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation has been 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 5W</I><P>
applied to future liabilities; and what the typical corresponding rate is that is used by the private sector under FRS17.  [130884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Central Government Accounts will be published for the first time for 2003&#150;04, as part of the phased introduction of Whole of Government Accounts. Pension liabilities relating to Government employees reported in Central Government Accounts, which will be published for the first time for 2003&#150;04, are a consolidation of the liabilities reported in the underlying scheme accounts. The real discount rate to be used in these accounts is 3.5 per cent., as advised by the Government Actuary's Department and based on the expected yield on long-term gilts.
<P>

<a name="31014w01.html_para19">Private sector schemes reporting under FRS17 are required to use a discount rate equal to the yield on an AA-rated bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities, if available. One study (by Lane, Clark and Peacock&#151;"Accounting for pensions: annual survey 2003") has found considerable variation in the discount rate adopted&#151;from under 5.4 per cent. to over 6 per cent. with the majority clustered around 5.6 per cent. real. The value of the liabilities increases as the discount rate decreases.

<P>
<a name="31014w02.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Under long-standing EU VAT agreements, sea-going vessels used for: navigation on the high seas; for the purpose of commercial, industrial or fishing activities; for rescue or assistance at sea; and commercial aircraft used chiefly on international routes are relieved of tax.
<P>

<a name="31014w02.html_para0">The UK has implemented this by relieving ships and aircraft, not used for recreation or pleasure, from VAT according to their weight. This simple rule provides clarity and certainty for businesses.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the limits are on the importation of cigarettes into Britain by individuals who have bought them within the European Union <i>(a)</i> paying the duty levied in the country of purchase and <i>(b)</i> from a duty-free outlet.  [132147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w03.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Since the introduction of the Single Market in 1993, travellers making journeys within the EU have been able to bring back as many duty and tax paid cigarettes as they like, providing they are for their own use. Cigarettes may not be brought into the UK for any form of sale or reimbursement without payment of UK taxes. There are no limits on importations of this kind.
<P>

<a name="31014w03.html_para0">Travellers bringing back excise goods into the UK may be required to explain to Customs the purposes for which they are holding those goods. EU agreements establish guidelines to help Member States determine whether goods are imported for 'own use' or for commercial purposes, including provision for a minimum indicative level of 800 cigarettes. The UK applies an indicative level of 3200 cigarettes, which is one of the factors Customs will use in assessing travellers' explanations of the purposes for which they are holding excise goods.
<P>

<a name="31014w03.html_para1">On 1 July 1999, duty and VAT-free sales of goods to intra-EU travellers were abolished, and travellers cannot now make duty-free purchases when travelling between EU Member States.

 The Finance Act 2000 made capital allowances available specifically for spending on equipment for leasing under an approved affordable warmth programme, a Government administered scheme which aims to support the installation of efficient central heating systems in up to 1 million low income homes over five years. Finance for the programme is provided by commercial leasing packages, administered

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy to create fiscal incentives for cleaner vehicles by co-ordinating rates of taxation on benefits-in-kind with the Government's Air Quality policies.  [131687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w03.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 It has been a long-standing policy of the Governments to introduce cost-effective measures to help reduce the impact that transport has on the environment.
<P>

<a name="31014w03.html_para4">To incentivise cleaner cars, the Government have introduced emission-based reforms for graduated company car tax and fuel scale charges&#151;the charge on free fuel provided for employees. These CO2-based benefit-in-kind taxes have helped reward the purchase of cleaner cars and the progress made is reflected in the 3.75 per cent. fall in average CO2 emissions of new cars between 2000 and 2002.
<P>

<a name="31014w03.html_para5">In addition to progress on CO2, local air pollution has improved dramatically with falls in emissions of particulates and NOx from new vehicles, for example new cars now produce in the region of 90 per cent. less pollutants than those manufactured 20 years ago. This has been driven by successively tougher emissions standards for new cars and given that company cars are generally less than two years old, means they are delivering air quality improvements. To help facilitate this progress, the Government have incorporated air quality incentives into the company car tax regime. There are discounts for cars that use alternative fuels and technologies, for example road fuel gases, and supplements for diesel cars in recognition of their higher emissions of pollutants that damage local air quality. This approach helps ensure there are benefits for the drivers of the very cleanest cars along with benefits for the environment.
<P>

<a name="31014w03.html_para6">Furthermore, to provide incentives for the use of alternatives to the car, in 1998 the Government announced a package of measures, which included removal of benefits-in-kind charges on employer-provided works buses and on public bus subsidies, and new reliefs for commuter and business cycling.

 Trading funds prepare their accounts in accordance with the requirements of "Trading Funds: Accounts Guidance issued by HM Treasury". These requirements comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP) to the extent that this is meaningful and appropriate in the public sector context. UK GAAP includes pronouncements by the Accounting Standards Board, one of which (Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 25) requires the disclosure of turnover by class of business or geographical segment where the body operates in more than one class of business or geographical segment. In line with the provisions of SSAP 25, it is for the management of the trading fund to define the appropriate class of business or geographical segments. In addition, where a trading fund provides different services as defined in the "Fees and Charges Guide" (also issued by HM Treasury), the Guide requires information about the performance of each service&#151;including details of the turnover&#151;to be disclosed.
<P>

<a name="31014w06.html_para0">There are currently no plans to extend the disclosure requirements for trading funds (either in general or in specific cases) beyond those of SSAP 25 and the "Fees and Charges Guide".

 The total expenditure on Microsoft licensing fees is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost; however the Defence Communication Services Agency holds some information on expenditure and this is set out as follows. As the DCSA has steadily taken on responsibility for more of the MOD's IT over the last three years, the early figures should be viewed as representing only a share of MOD's total expenditure. The later figures encompass an increasingly high proportion of it (though still not all).

<P>
<a name="31014w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We take non-combatant deaths, which can occur in a range of circumstances, very seriously. Road Traffic Accidents account for the majority of non-combat deaths, and the Ministry of Defence operates a number of road safety campaigns to increase awareness of risks on the road.
<P>

<a name="31014w07.html_para0">Another significant contributor to non-combat deaths is disease, to which members of the Armed Forces are as susceptible as the general public. But as part of the Defence Health Programme we are creating a health promotion strategy to co-ordinate work already in hand within each of the three Services. Through an emphasis on fitness and proper nutrition, together with increased availability of health advice and access to treatment, we aim to reduce the instance of disease-related deaths. Fewer than one in 20 non-combat deaths throughout the armed forces last year were ruled by the coroner as suicides or open verdicts. Through a tri-Service Suicide and Self-harm Prevention Working Group we are developing a more cohesive Armed Forces suicide and deliberate self-harm prevention policy. Other measures include the bench-marking of prevention measures with the NHS, HM Prison Service and other nations, and the development of a Stress Policy. Moreover, personnel are trained to be on the alert for signs of depression, altered behaviour and other possible indicators of self-harm. Further studies are planned into the identification of factors which may indicate greater risk of self-harm and suicide.

 Yes. Following a visit by the Director General of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in autumn 2002 it was agreed with the Lord Mayor of Belfast and City officials to re-erect the headstones. To date some 30 headstones have been re-erected and a further 180 replacements are on order and should be replaced on the graves this autumn. The remaining undamaged original headstones, which have been kept in storage, are currently being examined with a view to their reuse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w08.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if the Government will adopt the Home Affairs Committee's recommendation that the prosecution of offences relating to child abuse, which is alleged to have occurred over 10 years since the date of the offence, should only proceed with the court's permission, and that the time period does not begin until the complainant has reached age 21 years;  [128356]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether there is a time limit on the number of years after the alleged offence that a child abuser can be prosecuted.  [128399]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w08.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 There is in general no restriction on the time that may elapse between the commission of an offence and commencement of prosecution. Either way offences, which can be tried either in a magistrates court or in the Crown Court, and indictable only offences, which must be tried in the Crown Court, can normally be prosecuted at any time. There are statutory 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 29W</I><P>
provisions prohibiting proceedings in respect of certain such offences once a specified time has elapsed. An example is contained in the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which provides that prosecutions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 must be commenced within 12 months of the offence. If no time limit is set out in legislation in respect of any either way or indictable-only offence, then the general rule applies, and prosecutions may be commenced however long ago the relevant events occurred.
<P>

<a name="31014w08.html_para7">In their October 2002 report on the investigation of historical abuse cases, the Home Affairs Committee agreed that the prosecution of offences relating to child abuse should not be time-barred.
<P>

<a name="31014w08.html_para8">The Government do not support the Committee's recommendation that the prosecution of offences relating to child abuse, which is alleged to have occurred over 10 years since the date of the offence, should only proceed with the court's permission, and that the time period should not begin until the complainant has reached age 21 years. It is the role of the Crown Prosecution Service to consider each individual case, and whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. One of the factors to be considered is any delay in reporting a crime and the reasons for that delay. We cannot see a good reason to change the current system.

<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 30W</I><P>

 The Government's publication "Complex Child Abuse Investigations: Inter-Agency Issues" and the Association of Chief Police Officers' Senior Investigating Officers Handbook both cover the conduct of police investigations into complex historical abuse cases. This is in addition to more general guidelines in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and accompanying code and the Crown Prosecution Service code for Crown prosecutors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w08.html_spnew11"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 These steps have already been taken. The Government issued inter-agency guidance on complex child abuse investigations in June 2002. The guidance stresses the need to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service are involved at an early stage as appropriate, while noting that they should not be involved in operational decisions about the conduct of an investigation.

 I understand from the Director of the Assets Recovery Agency that, since the agency became operational on 24 February 2003, it has not yet recovered any criminal assets. However, the total value of assets under investigation exceeds &#163;17 million in 33 cases, of which some &#163;10 million is currently frozen under court orders in nine cases pending hearings for recovery orders. In addition, one tax assessment has been issued under Part 6 of the Proceeds of Crime Act for tax in excess of &#163;250,000. The agency has also provided assistance to law enforcement agencies in 11 confiscation order cases raised under the previous legislation with a total value of &#163;3.25 million.
<P>

<a name="31014w09.html_para0">The confiscation powers in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are triggered by offences committed after the provisions were brought into force on 24 March 2003, so it will be a while before cases are dealt with by the Crown court in numbers. As of 31 August, six confiscation orders with a value of just under &#163;120,000 have been made against convicted offenders in England and Wales. The value of cash seizures made under the new powers in the Act which came into effect on 30 December 2002 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 31W</I><P>
is over &#163;34 million. 18 restraint orders have also been made on assets with a value of over &#163;4 million. The Enforcement Task Force, in operation since last December, has enforced 248 confiscation orders made under the old legislation with a total value of &#163;14.6million.

 The data have been obtained from the homicide index as it stood on 8 October 2002. Figures are subject to revision as cases are dealt with by the police and the courts, or as further information becomes available. Revisions to the data will particularly affect the numbers detected in the most recent years as longer cases are solved.
<P>

<a name="31014w09.html_para2">Information is held centrally in the form of homicide (ie murder, manslaughter and infanticide) by police force area. Therefore, figures can be provided only for Merseyside Police Force Area as a whole.

 The aim of the Criminal Justice Bill is to create a fair and balanced criminal justice system that convicts the guilty, acquits the innocent and reduces offending and re-offending. The Government do not believe any of the provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will result in an increase in miscarriages of justice and will not therefore impact on the work of the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Commission received &#163;82,545 from the Invest to Save initiative in 2002&#150;03 to establish electronic file interchange facilities with the Court of Appeal. Considerable progress was made during 2002&#150;03, with accreditation of the necessary secure x.GSI connection on 1 April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins: </B>

<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Commission made 911 eligibility decisions at Stage 1 during the period 31 March 2002 to 31 March 2003. The intake in this period was 932. The difference is due to the fact that some eligibility decisions take 30 working days to complete.

[128836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Commission started its work with 279 cases (248 of which had been transferred from the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office and 31 had been received by the Commission prior to its official start). There were over a thousand applications in each of the first two years. In 1999&#150;2000 the case intake reduced to 777 since when it has been steadily building to 932 in 2002&#150;03. Against this, 310 cases were completed in 1997&#150;98, 492 in 1998&#150;99, and about a thousand in each of the four years since.
<P>

<a name="31014w10.html_para0">Initial staffing levels proved insufficient to cope with the demand resulting in a rising number of accumulated cases, which peaked at about 1,600 in mid-1999. The Home Office provided extra resources in 1990&#150;2000, a further increase in 2000&#150;01 and, following the 2000 Spending Review, for each of the three subsequent years. At March 2003 there were 282 cases awaiting review and 365 under review. The Home Office is working with the Commission to ensure that it has sufficient funding to allow the accumulated cases to be minimised whilst coping with its increased case intake. The Commission is endeavouring to balance this achievement with the need to avoid having too many or too few staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many referrals by the CCRC have taken advantage of <i>(a)</i> forensic science techniques, <i>(b)</i> advances in psychiatry and <i>(c)</i> advances in linguistics that have been developed or enhanced since the original proceedings.  [128847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w10.html_spnew24"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 It would require disproportionate resources to determine exactly how many of the 196 referrals to March 2003 made any use of some form of advance in the fields of forensic science techniques, psychiatry, or linguistics. This is particularly the case given that such use may not have formed a key element of the referral. In some referrals the Commission has taken direct advantage of these techniques, including the use of DNA and ESDA techniques. For example, in one case in which the defence had advanced a seemingly implausible argument at trial, modern DNA techniques supported it and the conviction was quashed. In another referral, ESDA tests cast doubt on prosecution documents and the conviction was quashed. Advances in forensic psychiatry and linguistics have been applied in several referrals, particularly in relation to the reliability of confessions and other evidence.

 The purpose of clause 9 (formerly clause 7) is to enable the Codes issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to be updated and reviewed on a more frequent basis to maintain their relevance and accuracy.

 The purpose of the new arrangements is to enable the police and Crown Prosecution Service to develop a common approach to case preparation, increasing the likelihood that charges will be correct from the outset and facilitating a more efficient and effective court process.

 The Government have considered the Home Affairs Committee's recommendation that there should be a limit on the duration of pre-charge police bail in cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision as to charge. The Government accept that bail granted to suspects in these circumstances (whether subject to conditions or not) should be for a reasonable period only, but it has decided that it would be appropriate to make this clear in guidance, rather than to include a time limit on the face of the Bill. No statutory restrictions on the duration of police bail exist at present, and the final evaluation report of the charging pilot recommended against imposing such a limit in these cases.

 Government amendments tabled during debate in the Lords Committee provide for any entirely new PACE Code to be subject to affirmative procedure. We also accept that significant changes to existing Codes may be subject to the same process but that there should be scope to consider the most appropriate procedure to be followed in each case. That is why we have given an undertaking to consult the Home Affairs Select Committee in every case on which procedure should be followed and to be bound by the Committee's advice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w12.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 It is extremely difficult to measure the deterrent effect of sentencing separately from its other effects. Apart from serving as punishment, sentences can impact on crime in a number of ways, through incapacitation, reform and rehabilitation, as well as the deterrent effect. Reconviction rates, for example, are lower for those who serve longer terms of imprisonment than those who serve shorter terms, but this reflects a number of factors and the contribution of deterrence cannot be readily isolated.
<P>

<a name="31014w12.html_para2">In 1999, the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics Directorate commissioned the University of Cambridge to review all the recent research looking at the impact of sentence severity on deterrence. That study <sup>1</sup>  concluded that the limited available evidence in this area suggests that generally the connection between variations in sentence severity and deterrent effect is not direct or strong. Nevertheless the availability (and 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 44W</I><P>
severity) of punishment does appear to have a general deterrent effect for some classes of potential offenders, whose choice of whether to offend is influenced by their perception of the risks of being apprehended and punished. This suggests that known penal threats can have a deterrent effect.

 The Crown Prosecution Service and Court Service do not maintain records of the numbers of cases in which jury interference occurs. However, each year there are instances of actual or feared jury interference which necessitate both a range of jury protection measures and the termination of trials before the jury has been able to reach a verdict. In a small number of cases which present a very serious risk of intimidation, the court will order 24-hour police protection for the jury. In 2000, the cost to the Metropolitan Police of such protection was &#163;4.3 million; in 2001, &#163;5.1 million.

 The pay negotiations for the National Probation Service (NPS) were not concluded by 1 April 2003 because of the need to obtain agreement to the pay remit by my right hon.

 When the National Probation Service (NPS) was established in April 2001 the Probation Service moved from being part funded by the local authorities and the Home Office to being solely funded by the Home Office. This change in funding made it appropriate, as with other public services, that the NPS was required to submit its pay remit for approval by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. This arrangement became fully operative for the first time for the 2003&#150;04 pay settlement. Treasury rules require that employers cannot begin pay negotiations with the Trade Unions until the Treasury has approved the remit.

<P>

<a name="31014w12.html_para9">The reason why the negotiations on the NPS pay settlement did not begin until July relates to the extended timetable for clearance of remits through Ministers and the Treasury. Coupled with this is a complex process of ensuring that the proposed settlement is affordable by the NPS and conforms to public sector pay policy. These factors meant that it was not possible for the NPS to meet the 1 April settlement date. It should be borne in mind that a settlement, once agreed, is backdated to the relevant settlement date.

 It is for the trial judge to decide whether a particular piece of evidence should be admitted and in making that decision he must adhere to the requirements of the law. In England and Wales, criminal courts have a range of powers to prevent the admission of improperly obtained evidence. In particular:
<P>

<a name="31014w13.html_para3">Section 76(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) prevents the prosecution relying on confession evidence where it may have been obtained by oppression of the person who made it or in consequence of anything said or done which, in the circumstances, was likely to render a resulting confession unreliable. Where the defence contends that this may be the case it is up to the prosecution to show beyond reasonable doubt that this is not the case.

 The Policy Research Bureau's evaluation of the parenting programme sponsored by the Youth Justice Board was published in September 2002. It found a very positive response from parents on Parenting Orders as well as voluntary participants, and improved parenting skills. In the year following counselling and guidance, offences by their children fell by 50 per cent.

 A mentally vulnerable detainee is defined for the purposes of the Codes of Practice under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) as "any detainee who, because of their mental state or capacity may not understand the significance of what is said, of questions or of their replies". (Code C, Guidance Note 1G). The PACE Codes make specific provision for detainees who are mentally disordered or mentally vulnerable to receive the support of an appropriate adult during their time in police custody (Code C 1.7). Appropriate adults have an important role to play in the custody environment by ensuring that the detained person whom they are assisting understands what is happening to them and why.
<P>

<a name="31014w14.html_para0">Although the term vulnerable is not explicitly applied to juvenile detainees, they are nevertheless regarded as a vulnerable group and PACE Code C requires that they similarly receive the support of an appropriate adult (Code C 1.7).

 In the financial year 2002&#150;03, a total of 37,898 persons were made subject to electronic monitoring at a total cost of &#163;63,448,638, resulting in an average cost of &#163;1,674 each. Total and average cost figures are not available for those aged under or over the age of 18 separately. This is because the pricing regime for electronic monitoring is based on the type of scheme rather than the age of the person subject to electronic monitoring, and the different schemes have different age boundaries.

 Local authority environmental health and trading standards services, in partnership with officers from the Meat Hygiene Service and the State Veterinary Service, are responsible for investigating fraudulent trade in unfit food. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) provides help and advice to local authorities and has appointed 26 local authority enforcement officers to provide regional advice on investigating unfit food. Each advisor will contribute 10 working days per year to this work on behalf of the FSA. In addition, there is a team of five investigators based at the FSA to assist with this work and two further investigators are being recruited.

 An indicative cost of creating a new-build hospital bed is approximately &#163;380,000, excluding value added tax, which reflects the current business case approval level. The cost includes the capital construction cost, equipment costs and professional fees incurred, as well as a proportion of the costs of the supporting services within the new hospital, such as operating theatres, out-patient departments, accident and emergency services, catering, office accommodation, public areas, pharmacy, pathology and radiology. It does not include the running costs to make the bed operational, such as staffing, linen or cleaning.

 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the independent advisory committee the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) is responsible for ensuring that medicines and vaccines on the United Kingdom market meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy.
<P>

<a name="31014w18.html_para4">MMR (combined measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and some single component measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are licensed in the UK. Licensed vaccines are assessed for safety prior to the licence being granted. Information on side-effects known to be associated with these vaccines is included in the relevant product information. As with all vaccines and medicines, after licensing, the MHRA and CSM keep the safety of MMR vaccine and single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines under continual review. The MHRA uses a number of data sources to monitor the safety of medicines and vaccines. These include reports of suspected adverse drug reactions spontaneously provided by health professionals through the 'Yellow Card' scheme. This voluntary scheme has been in existence since 1964 and has a proven track record in identifying important new safety concerns with medicines. Other data sources include periodic reviews

The CSM has considered these studies and the general safety of MMR vaccines on several occasions in recent years and its advice remains that MMR vaccine is the safest way to protect children from three potentially serious infections. This advice is consistent with the advice of expert bodies around the world. No studies are available that have examined the effects of giving single vaccines separately on a population.

In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:The health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund, training on behalf of other health bodies.Asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities.For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities.3. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.4. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within the health authority and region area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.5. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&#150;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. This element cannot be identified in 2000&#150;01.6. The North East has been taken to include the geographical areas covered by the following Health Authorities:County Durham and Darlington Health Authority.Gateshead and South Tyneside Health Authority.Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority.Northumberland Health Authority.Sunderland Health Authority.Tees Health Authority. <P>

<a name="31014w19.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Fox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on how the NHS Direct service has developed since March 2000.  [130321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w19.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 NHS Direct has developed since March 2000 to become the world's largest e-health service, supporting over a million patients every month 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 72W</I><P>
through its telephone advice and information service and associated website. In this time, NHS Direct has symbolised the changing relationship between the national health service and patients, supporting patients to become more empowered, better informed and more able to exercise choices over their own health and health care.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para0">NHS Direct has been available to callers throughout England since the end of October 2000. Call volumes have grown by 49 per cent. since March 2000. Independent evaluation highlights a service that is safe, popular and increases access to advice and information without increasing demands on other parts of the NHS. Caller satisfaction rates have continued at over 95 per cent. and 45 per cent. of calls to the service are completed without referral to another service. The roll-out of NHS Direct was commended in a report by the National Audit Office, published in January 2002, which estimated that the service covered 50 per cent. of its running costs by reducing demands on other services in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para1">In November 2001, NHS Direct Online was re-launched to include an interactive inquiry service, which is able to provide patients with detailed information about topics not covered on the website. NHS Direct Online receives half a million on-line transactions every month. NHS Direct Online has been awarded one of the first ever eEurope awards for eHealth by the European Commission. 200 applications were received from 22 countries. At a conference and award ceremony in Brussels in May this year, attended by European Commissioners and 33 Ministers from across the member states, Bob Gann, Director of NHS Direct Online, received the award for "Empowering Citizens in Management of Health and Wellbeing". The panel judged entries against criteria including economic benefit, accessibility, quality assurance, technical standards and European applicability.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para2">NHS Direct achieved the Prime Minister's pledge that, by the end of September 2001, patients who wished to would be able to obtain advice on dental issues and details of NHS dentists simply by phoning NHS Direct.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para3">NHS Direct introduced a dedicated textphone service in November 2001.The service connects callers to NHS Direct nurses, who have had specialist training to help them meet the needs of textphone users.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para4">Since March 2002, access to out-of-hours care through NHS Direct has been available to 10 million patients. By December 2004, technical and operational links will be in place to allow NHS Direct to transfer calls to any out-of-hours provider in the country. Full clinical integration of services will follow as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para5">The first version of the NHS Direct performance framework was launched in March 2002. The framework is based on the principle of continuous quality improvement and outlines responsibilities and tools for service delivery and the monitoring of performance and improvement at all levels of the organisation&#151;from the individual to the national service. The framework also outlines a set of key performance targets for NHS Direct, areas for the development of clinical indicators and areas for the 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 73W</I><P>
development of internal management measures. NHS Direct has embarked on a major programme for improving its productivity. This delivered a 15 per cent. increase in call volumes in 2002&#150;03, without any increase in staff numbers.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para6">NHS Direct aims to support the NHS in many areas, including contributing to a responsible and coherent response to public health. NHS Direct has worked with the Department and other stakeholders to provide a public helpline in the event of health alerts. These have ranged from local incidents, for example, chemical spills, to handling calls during a multi-regional hepatitis C look-back exercise, as well as the Alder Hey independent inquiry. Since March 2000, it has handled a total of 631 health alerts.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para7">Since April 2002, NHS Direct has been able to directly refer patients to pharmacists, where appropriate, for advice about medication or minor ailments or injuries. This has helped many patients receive a quicker and more appropriate response to their problems. It also makes better use of the skills of pharmacists and helps relieve some pressure on general practitioners.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para8">The strategy document for developing NHS Direct, published in April 2003, sets out the continued commitment to this popular and innovative service. The impact of new financial investment will further support plans to use technology and new ways of working to boost productivity and increase capacity. In total, NHS Direct will aim to expand its call taking capacity three fold in the next three years, while at the same time, developing the various channels through which patients can access the service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) whether his Department met their target in the NHS plan of ensuring that 90 per cent. of the NHS estate was health and safety compliant by March 2002; what percentage of the estate did not comply with health and safety regulations in March 2002; and what new deadlines have been set on health and safety in the NHS estate;  [123928]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether his Department met their target in the NHS Plan to eliminate the fire safety backlog in the NHS Estate by March 2003.  [124004]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Trusts that did not report full compliance will cover a wide variety of conditions, including that which is only just below standard. At 31 March 2002, 10.55 per cent, of patient-occupied floor area was below health and safety compliance and 8.57 per cent. below statutory fire safety standards.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para9">Trusts generally manage high-risk deficiencies as a priority in order to ensure that premises are intrinsically safe and not of concern to local enforcement bodies.
<P>

<a name="31014w19.html_para10">Further improvements to health and safety and fire safety will result from the current priorities and planning framework targets for reducing the backlog of maintenance by 25 per cent. by 2004.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his Department's policy is on patients being <i>(a)</i> offered a choice and <i>(b)</i> consulted on the gender of the nurses and careworkers who treat them; and if he will make a statement.  [126687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department is committed to increasing patient choice in the national health service to ensure that its services are more responsive to the needs of individual patients. The first step in increasing patient choice is to provide patients waiting for elective surgery with choice over the hospital in which they are treated. By the summer of 2004, all patients waiting six months for surgery will be offered the choice to move to another hospital. From December 2005, patients who may require elective surgery will be offered a choice of four or five hospitals or providers when their general practitioner refers them. We have also launched a national consultation exercise&#151;'Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS and social care'&#151;to get the views of patients and NHS staff on extending patient choice within the NHS beyond elective surgery. Fundamental to increasing the responsiveness of services is ensuring that patients are afforded privacy and dignity, including taking into account their views as to the gender of their nurses and care workers.

<i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> There are indications that some children in their teens may benefit from precision-tinted lenses.
<P>

<a name="31014w20.html_para2">However, unless precision-tinted lenses are provided as part of a proper scheme of assessment and treatment, many children may receive them unnecessarily. There is a risk that more appropriate responses to their needs will be delayed while time is taken up investigating tinted lenses. Without proper evaluation of the therapy for each individual, which is less likely if provided outside the education network, there is no proper indication of its effectiveness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether he plans to extend the present remission for student nurses from higher education tuition fees to top-up fees incurred after 2006.  [129701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 While the proposals contained in the Department for Education and Skills' White Paper include allowing universities to increase tuition fees, there is as yet no clear indication from the higher education sector of the scope or scale of any increased charges. The Department will take measures to ensure that any increase in the cost of university courses will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students undertaking nurse training.

<P>
<a name="31014w21.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department has not had any meetings with the Thalidomide Trust over the past 12 months. The Government paid &#163;5 million to the Trust in 1974 and &#163;0.8 million in 1978, following misunderstandings about the tax treatment of the fund. In 1996, we made a further payment to the Trust of &#163;7 million in recognition of the unique and tragic circumstances which surround the thalidomide disaster. The Department would always be happy to meet with the Trust if it so wishes.

<P>
<a name="31014w21.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The level of support each individual child receives upon discharge from hospital is a matter for local decision. This will be based upon the child's degree of dependency and will involve the hospital concerned working in close liaison with local primary health care staff and the community nursing team.

 While there are no targets for waiting times for audiology services, we are taking action to tackle the causes of longer waits as part of our programme to modernise hearing aid services in England. These are increased demand arising from public awareness of digital hearing aids and a recognised national shortage of audiologists.
<P>

We are introducing a new, more streamlined patient process in modernised sites.

 The Government have no plans to seek an amendment to the law on abortion. All abortions in England are currently carried out under Section 1(3) of the Abortion Act which states that any treatment for the termination of pregnancy must be carried out in an NHS hospital or an approved independent sector place. There is provision under Section l(3a) for medical abortion to be carried out in an approved class of place but we have not yet determined what a "class of place" should be. No "class of place" will be approved unless we are content that a woman's safety is not at risk.
<P>

<a name="31014w21.html_para3">The safety of mifepristone was fully evaluated on behalf of the Government at the time of granting a marketing authorisation in 1991 by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). The use of mifepristone is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (formerly the MCA) using spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, periodic safety reviews and all other available safety data to ensure its continued safe use. Also, there have been a number of studies and reviews of the safety of mifepristone published in the scientific literatures since 1991.

 Thanks to major additional investment and the hard work of those working in the national health service we are making real progress in implementing the NHS Cancer Plan. Patients are benefiting from improvements across all aspects of cancer care.
<P>

<a name="31014w22.html_para1">For example there are an extra 1,000 cancer consultants compared with 1997; nearly 99 per cent. of people with suspected cancer are now seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred by their general practitioner; we have improved the quality of breast screening by the introduction of two view mammography and have extended the breast screening service to include women aged 65 to 70 resulting in nearly 200,000 extra women being invited since April 2001. The introduction of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has meant that over 31,000 extra patients can benefit from new cancer drugs. We have increased the NHS funding of specialist palliative care by &#163;50 million a year, an increase of nearly 40 per cent. and latest figures show a reduction of 9 per cent. in the death rate from cancer.

 The Department does not set individual councils or primary care trusts targets for reductions in delayed discharges.

 The Department keeps its priorities for research under review. Priorities for departmental research and development support for the development of policy are determined through discussion with policy colleagues and Ministers. In the national health service, priorities are identified through widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services.

<a name="31014w22.html_para9">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is not currently funding any research into Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, though it does fund a number of research projects into connective tissue and also into collagen physiology.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will take steps to encourage more regular and thorough eye tests for children to check for cancers, with particular reference to retinoblastoma.  [131224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w23.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Doctors and opticians who test sight have a duty to undertake an examination of the eye and perform whatever tests they feel are necessary at the time. The examination undertaken has the purpose of detecting signs of injury, disease or abnormality in the eye and the doctors or opticians carrying them out will be aware of retinoblastoma and the signs to look for on the retina.
<P>

<a name="31014w23.html_para4">Free sight tests are available under the National Health Service to large parts of the population, including all children and those aged 16&#150;18 in full-time education. Sight tests are the ideal opportunity to review all aspects of eye health, including investigations for signs of disease. In 2001&#150;02, 9.8 million NHS sight tests were paid for by health authorities. 2.4 million of those were for children.
<P>

<a name="31014w23.html_para5">We have promoted a system of child health and development checks. The programme of home visiting and community development makes an important contribution to many areas of health education and fosters the early detection of problems, including those associated with eye sight in young pre-school children. The programme also provides the opportunity to develop closer relationships between the family and the primary care team. Work on developing the children's national service framework continues and the healthy child module will take into account the views expressed by the National Screening Committee (Children's Sub-Group) on the need for child eye screening.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the cost of <i>(a)</i> providing fluoride to children through milk and <i>(b)</i> disbursing fluoride via the water supply.  [131472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w23.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The cost of implementing the seven trial milk fluoridation schemes under way in the United Kingdom has been relatively modest, due to the fact that existing school milk programmes have been utilised. The actual cost of fluoridating milk is minimal and in most schemes has been absorbed by the dairy. About one half day a week of an oral health promotion officer's time is required to administer each scheme. Information is not yet available to make any reliable estimates of the costs and cost effectiveness of any national scheme using fluoridated milk to tackle oral health inequalities.
<P>

<a name="31014w23.html_para6">The cost of fluoridating water varies depending on the scale of schemes. Experience from current schemes indicates running costs, which are borne by health authorities, of about 40 pence per head of population per year.

<a name="31014w23.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Following successful small-scale pilots in 2000 and 2001, the national school fruit scheme has been introduced over the last 18 months in four whole regions in England: the West Midlands, London, the North West and the East Midlands. The next region due to join will be the North East, starting in spring 2004. These region-wide pilots, which have been supported by &#163;42 million from the lottery-funded New Opportunities Fund, will be evaluated to establish the impact on children's diets and the practicalities of the scheme, before rolling out nationally later in 2004.

 The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) makes recommendations to Ministers on all aspects of screening programmes. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that routine screening of all pregnant women in the United Kingdom and the treating of those carrying group B streptococcus with intravenous antibiotics during labour would be beneficial. The NSC has commissioned a further assessment of the existing evidence on screening against the criteria used to assess potential screening programmes. At the adjournment debate on this issue on 9 July 2003, Ministers asked the NSC to review the position thoroughly as quickly as possible and to consider recommendations at its meeting in December 2003.

 Subject to legislation, a national health service foundation trust will be able to enter into joint arrangements with local authorities social services departments where such arrangements are consistent with its primary purpose and terms of authorisation. This will allow for the organisation concerned to determine locally what the arrangements should be and is consistent with the Government's policy of decentralisation.

<a name="31014w24.html_para2">Under current arrangements, NHS trusts can only enter into joint arrangements with private bodies in circumstances specified in directions given by the Secretary of State, and with his consent. While NHS foundation trusts are not subject to directions given by the Secretary of State, and do not require his consent before entering into joint ventures (including the setting up of companies), they have no greater powers to do so than current NHS trusts.

 There are no plans for a national service framework (NSF). We are, however, taking steps to improve services for people with lung disease. The children's NSF will include childhood asthma as an exemplar condition. The NSF for chronic heart disease already has a reduction in cigarette smoking as one of its major targets. We have also banned tobacco advertising and made smoking reduction aids available on national health service prescription.

We expect this guidance to be produced in 2004. Also, phase three of the national primary care collaborative (NPCC) focuses on chronic disease management, in particular COPD and diabetic care. The programme, which will be rolled out to every primary care trust (PCT) in the country by April 2004, will support frontline NHS staff and primary care trust managers and will involve 20 PCTs and more than 100 general practitioner practices.

<P>

<a name="31014w24.html_para5">As with all medicines the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) have continued to closely monitor the safe use of methotrexate.

To date the MHRA/CSM have received 876 UK ADR reports associated with methotrexate. The most common side effects of methotrexate include nausea, abdominal pain, a reduced number of white blood cells and soreness of the mouth and lips. Other rare but more serious side effects include fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver, bone marrow suppression and pneumonitis.

<a name="31014w24.html_para7">In September 2000 health professionals were advised, via another article in "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" (Vol. 26 September 2000), to exercise caution when prescribing and dispensing methotrexate. In 2001 the CSM established a working group to review medicines labelling in order to reduce the likelihood of medication error occurring and within the review advised that all oral dose preparations should prominently display a warning to check the dose and frequency of methotrexate on the front face of the carton.
<P>

<a name="31014w24.html_para8">In September 2002 the CSM reviewed the increasing number of UK reports of pneumonitis which had been received by the MHRA in association with methotrexate. The CSM recommended updating the product information to provide clearer guidance to prescribers and patients, recognising that the increase was probably a direct consequence of the recent dramatic increase in methotrexate use in patients with early RA. The MHRA is continuing to work closely with the National Patient Safety Agency to reduce the risk of medication errors associated with methotrexate.

 The current contract for NHSnet is due to expire next year. It would be inappropriate to negotiate any amendment to this at the present time to enable community pharmacies to gain connectivity. The model of connectivity needs to take into account future requirements that may arise out of our wish to see community pharmacists as a more integrated part of the national health service, services that they may provide under the new community pharmacy contract currently under discussion and delivery of the national prescription service target outlined in "Delivering 21st Century IT Support for the NHS". The N3 networking project, which is responsible for procuring a successor network to NHSnet, is currently considering which N3 services could help meet these community pharmacy connectivity requirements.

 The Department has not set any criteria centrally to be used when referring national health service patients for treatment to private healthcare providers. Such decisions are taken locally by primary care trusts (PCTs). In such circumstances, the criteria applied by PCTs and under centrally funded choice pilots would usually include the length of time patients have waited, their clinical appropriateness and fitness for referral to an independent provider and value for money (taking into account the availability of alternative capacity). These criteria would also apply to referrals to the new independent sector treatment centres which we are procuring currently but in addition, these will be supplemented by clear clinical pathways, building on those developed as part of the London patient choice project.

A budget has been agreed for 2003, Iraqi Ministries are planning their budgets for 2004, new bank notes are being distributed to replace the discredited Saddam Dinar, and a legal framework for commercial activity is being created.

 A new EU treaty would need to be ratified according to the individual political and constitutional traditions of each of the member states.

Four member states have formally declared that they will hold a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC): Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain. Most countries have yet to make a decision. In the UK, EU treaties are only ratified after scrutiny and approval by Parliament, as has been the case with all previous treaties modifying the founding treaties of the EU.

 Refugees from Liberia have been entering Guinea for many years, fleeing hostilities and hardship. UNHCR report a new influx since 13 September of 4,500 arrivals into south-east Guinea. This brings the total number of Liberian refugees in Guinea to 116,000 refugees. The most recent refugees are temporarily housed in clinics and public buildings at the border, but UNHCR is transferring them away from the border to established refugee camps where they receive all basic services. So far, 1,500 have been transferred.
<P>

<a name="31014w29.html_para0">The total number of refugees in Guinea is significantly reduced from 390,000 at the end of 2000 to 180,000 at the end of 2002 as a result of the improved security situation in Sierra Leone. UNHCR are managing to respond to the needs of the new Liberian refugees although the situation will be closely monitored.

 The aim of reproductive health programmes in Malawi is to improve sexual and reproductive health for all men, women and children especially among the poor and vulnerable groups; and to reduce death and chronic ill health of women as a result of childbirth. DFID's total financial commitment to reproductive health in Malawi is &#163;59.7 million for

<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 110W</I><P>
programmes that are currently being implemented. Of this, &#163;6.7 million was spent in fiscal year 2002&#150;03 and another &#163;5.3 million in the first five months of the current fiscal year.
<P>

<a name="31014w29.html_para1">The Malawi Ministry of Health and Population conducted a joint review in November 2002 with DFID and other development partners of the programmes that they support. The review reported some progress in all activities, but also noted that there were factors beyond the control of the programmes that inhibited progress. These included critical shortage of health personnel, under-resourced working environment, and the rising impact of HIV/AIDS. The international financial institutions and donors including DFID are working with the Malawi Government to address the underlying issues, such as wage policy and macro economic management, that cause the problems affecting the health sector.

 DFID has given no money in support of the Russian Family Planning Association (RFPA) in 2003; its last project with the RFPA finished in June 2002 and no further assistance is planned. This therefore represents 0 per cent. of total expenditure for population reproductive health services. The RFPA supports a range of activities on advocacy for reproductive health and rights, including training for health personnel, social workers and teachers and the provision of information and education, particularly for young people, through the development of its network of regional branches.

<a name="31014w29.html_para4">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. DFID's total expenditure for 2002&#150;03 cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and Family Planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).

Annual DFID internal assessments of the Reproductive Health Support Project have been made and these, and other external reports and surveys, reveal an encouraging increase in accessing reproductive health facilities and commodities.

<a name="31014w29.html_para16">DFID spent over &#163;270 million on reproductive health and HIV/AIDS programmes in financial year 2002&#150;03. We regard reproductive health as an essential and inseparable element of good health. We believe that the best way to deliver this is for people to be given the right, freedom and support necessary to enable them to take full individual and personal control of their own fertility and reproductive health. Reproductive health continues to be a key priority for DFID and we remain firmly committed to the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) target of achieving access to reproductive health for all by 2015.
<P>

<a name="31014w29.html_para17">DFID support for reproductive health is wide ranging. It covers HIV/AIDS programmes, prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and maternal and adolescent health. Reproductive health also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health, and in particular, to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. DFID's total expenditure for 2003&#150;03 cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and family planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example, through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).

<P>

<a name="31014w30.html_para2">DFID has provided support for de-mining operations since the ceasefire between the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka came into effect last year. DFID has a two-year agreement with UNDP until the end of 2004 for support to de-mining operations. Under this, &#163;697,000 from the allocated &#163;2.6 million for quick impact activities in the North and East of Sri Lanka will be used to fund the early part of UNDP's 2003&#150;06 mine action programme. This funding was approved in 2002. Further needs assessments are under way and we stand ready to make further commitments if necessary. DFID does not directly run any de-mining projects in Sri Lanka and has therefore not sought technical advice from the Ministry of Defence. However, DFID liaises closely with the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on our development programme to Sri Lanka.

 In May 2001, the Government prepared a preliminary partial regulatory impact assessment of the proposals in the European Commission's White Paper. A revised partial Assessment will be required when proposals for the European Commission's legislation are available and my Department is working closely with other interested Departments, the Devolved Administrations and concerned stakeholders to develop its scope and content. As set out in the guidance on conducting such an Assessment, consideration of the impacts on small to medium sized businesses will form a key part of this.
<P>

<a name="31014w30.html_para3">As well as considering the benefits and costs of the proposals, the Assessment will include an analysis of the implications of the proposed legislation for the international competitiveness of the UK chemicals industry and other manufacturing sectors that use chemicals in their processes and products. In addition the Government will consider what further analysis may be needed, particularly for small to medium sized businesses to meet the demands of any new legislation. We have noted the results of other work undertaken for instance by the Commission and the Federation of German Industry (BDI) and this will be taken into account when carrying out our assessment. Getting these aspects right is a key element to achieve the Government's first objective for the new EU chemicals strategy of a fast, efficient and workable process.

 Section 63 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced new powers that will enable members of the public to oblige local highway authorities to secure the removal of certain types of obstruction, unless it can show that there are good reasons for not doing so. Defra aims to make regulations implementing these powers later this year. In addition, the introduction of 'Best Value' from 1 April 2000, requires local authorities to seek continuous improvement in the way they carry out their functions. The Best Value performance indicator for rights of way includes a specific measure for ease of use of rights of way.

 Defra measures approximately 180 air pollutants in the national networks, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, PMio particulate matter, PIVb.s particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, black smoke, 26 volatile organic compounds, 17 metals and trace elements (for example, lead, arsenic and chromium), 52 transboundary pollutants (for example, ammonium nitrate and sulphate), 42 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (for example, benzo[a]pyrene), 17 of the most toxic dioxins including tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) and 7 polychlorobiphenyls. The number of sites measuring each pollutant and their sampling frequency varies from just a few sites sampling on a weekly or monthly basis (for example, dioxins) to dozens of sites monitoring continuously (for example, nitrogen dioxide) depending on the characteristics of each pollutant. Monitoring data for each air pollutant can be found on the National Air Quality Information Archive (www.airqualitv.co.uk).

<a name="31014w32.html_wqn0"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proposals she will make to the European Union for further reductions in agricultural <i>(a)</i> export and <i>(b)</i> trade distorting subsidies; whether the Government will press the European Union substantially to reduce expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy; and if she will make a statement on the Common Agricultural Policy and the World Trade Organisation trade round.  [131491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The agreement on CAP reform which was reached by the Agriculture Council in June enabled the European Union to take a credible and constructive position on agriculture in the WTO negotiations at Cancun. Unfortunately the negotiations broke down before detailed discussion of agriculture was begun. However, in the forthcoming EU reviews of sugar, cotton, tobacco, olive oil and hops we shall be seeking decisions which further assist in reaching a satisfactory outcome to the Doha Development Agenda.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w32.html_wqn1"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals on <i>(a)</i> smaller and more economically marginal full-time farm holdings and <i>(b)</i> tenant farms in the UK.  [131888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No specific assessment has been undertaken of the impact of the CAP reform proposals on smaller, economically marginal or tenant farmers. However, we have assessed the impacts of the proposals on farming and other businesses generally, including an analysis by farm activity, and a summary of these is included in the Regulatory Impact Assessments which have been lodged in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="31014w32.html_para0">For the first time, the bulk of farm subsidy will not be dependent on what or how much farmers produce. They will instead be free to produce what they judge the market wants and so be better able to cut costs and increase profits. Our analysis suggests that those farmers who are economically marginal at present are likely to be more disposed to take advantage of this freedom to alter their activity and thereby increase their income. Farmers will also be freed from some of the bureaucracy associated with the subsidy schemes which are being replaced by this new decoupled subsidy. The historic recipient, whether owner or tenant, will continue to hold the subsidy entitlement.
<P>

<a name="31014w32.html_para1">Farmers whose subsidy is less than Euro5,000, which is likely to include many of the smallest holdings, will be exempt from the reduction in subsidies to fund rural development and environmental measures. This exemption applies to tenants as well as farmers who own the land.
<P>

<a name="31014w32.html_para2">The UK also has the option to retain 10 per cent. of payments to establish a national envelope to address potential negative impacts of decoupling for specific types of farming. The detailed rules of how this will apply have yet to be developed by the European Commission.

The Scottish Executive was informed as soon as dates of meetings were known, they did not ask to attend any Management Committee. The subjects discussed at fresh and processed fruit and vegetables Management Committees included the setting of export refunds, aid for certain products grown for processing and arrangements for assisting Producer Organisations.<P>

<i>Management Committee for (m) Hops</i><P>

There were no meetings of the Management Committee for hops during this period.<P>

<i>Management Committee for (n) Seeds</i><P>

The Seeds Management Committee met jointly with the Sugar Management Committee on 19 December 2002, and jointly with the Cereals Management Committee on 9 January 2003, to discuss a draft Regulation setting the minimum aid rate for certain agricultural products for the Outermost Regions (Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores). The Scottish Executive receives the agenda for each meeting at the same time as Defra, normally a week prior to the meeting taking place.<P>

<P>
<a name="31014w33.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans the Department has to encourage people to increase the installation of household energy-saving appliances.  [131394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Energy White Paper details the steps being taken to encourage greater energy efficiency in the UK, and sets out an ambitious strategy for energy efficiency up to 2010 and beyond. Energy efficiency is expected to deliver about half the carbon savings needed to meet our goals for 2020. This will mean roughly doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement of recent decades.
<P>

<a name="31014w33.html_para0">Key measures proposed in the White Paper include extension of the Energy Efficiency Commitment beyond 2005 at possibly twice its current level of activity; revisions to the Building Regulations; faster improvements in the 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 132W</I><P>
standards of new household appliances; and consultation on economic instruments to improve household energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="31014w33.html_para1">Tighter building regulations will have an impact on new homes, alterations to existing stock and all replacement windows and boilers. We have already begun work on the next major revision of the building regulations, which we will aim to bring into effect in 2005. Tighter building regulations will also encourage developers to use low carbon solutions such as solar water heating and photovoltaics.
<P>

<a name="31014w33.html_para2">As announced in Budget 2003, following the initial consultation last year the Government are consulting in more detail on specific economic instruments to encourage greater energy efficiency by households, including the use of measures to change the price differential between efficient and inefficient products.
<P>

<a name="31014w33.html_para3">Micro-CHP could also in due course provide a useful contribution towards improving household energy efficiency. An estimated 250&#150;500MW could be generated from micro-CHP by 2010, although the Government do not have a specific target for the amount of electricity to be generated by micro-CHP technology.
<P>

<a name="31014w33.html_para4">The Government intend to publish an Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan within a year of the White Paper's publication, which will provide further detail on all of these policies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the cost of energy wasted by UK households each year;  [131395]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate has been made of the average potential financial saving to UK households through the implementation of energy-saving home improvements.  [131396]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government estimates the potential for cost-effective improvements in energy use in homes at almost &#163; 3 billion a year or around 20 per cent. of current total expenditure. This is almost &#163;120 per household. These figures are based on the installation of cost-effective insulation and the replacement, at the end of their useful lives, of boilers, lights and domestic appliances by the most efficient equivalent models available. Precise estimates vary, since new products reach the market and existing measures are installed but there is broad agreement on the 20 per cent. estimate.

<a name="31014w33.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much energy was produced per person in 2002; and what estimate she has made of production levels in EU countries.  [131077]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the number of tonnes of particulates saved from emission to the atmosphere in the UK as a result of accumulated switching from conventional automotive fuels to <i>(a)</i> LPG, <i>(b)</i> CNG, <i>(c)</i> LNG and <i>(d)</i> hydrogen.  [131715]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Industry sources suggest there are around 100,000 vehicles currently running on LPG. It is not possible to precisely estimate the particulate matter emissions savings <i>(a)</i> because there are no measurements of particulate matter emissions from LPG fuelled vehicles and <i>(b)</i> there are no records of which fuel, petrol or diesel, was replaced. It is however estimated that around one third of LPG fuelled vehicles were converted from diesel. In this case, there would be savings of particulate matter emissions of around 130 tonnes per year. This is out of a total of 30,000 tonnes of PM emitted from UK road transport in 2001.
<P>

<a name="31014w34.html_para0">Industry sources suggest approximately 850 vehicles currently run on CNG/LNG. These are mainly heavy-duty vehicles that would otherwise be running on diesel. On the basis of this figure, it is estimated that 13 tonnes of PM have been saved in the UK by these conversions to CNG.
<P>

<a name="31014w34.html_para1">While comparatively small, these emissions savings contribute to improved air quality and help the UK move towards meeting its air quality objectives.
<P>

<a name="31014w34.html_para2">There are presently only a few prototype/demonstration vehicles in the whole of the UK running on hydrogen. Therefore, the particulate matter emission savings from converting to hydrogen are currently negligible. There is, however, long-term potential for significant particulate matter emissions savings by replacing conventional fuelled vehicles with hydrogen fuelled vehicles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The external costs of air pollution is a subject where considerable research work is being undertaken to improve our scientific and economic understanding of the health and environmental damages of air pollution.

<a name="31014w34.html_para3">The framework for estimating the external costs of one tonne of particulates to the atmosphere requires a detailed step-by-step analysis to assess the effect of emissions on local and regional air concentrations; quantify the health and environmental impacts using dose response functions and data on population exposed and value these health and environmental impacts in monetary terms where appropriate. Many factors including location of emissions will determine the extent of damages from a tonne of particulates.
<P>

<a name="31014w34.html_para4">In September 2001, the Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits published "An Economic Analysis to Inform the Review of the Air Quality Strategy Objectives for Particles". This quantified a range of environmental and health effects arising from particulate emissions. Direct environmental effects of particles include damages from soiling of buildings. Evidence on the health effects of particles has been accumulating. Day to day variations in concentration of airborne particles are associated with day to day variations in a range of health end points. These include daily deaths, admissions to hospital for the treatment of both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and symptoms among patients suffering from asthma. In addition, there is evidence from the United States that long-term exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with a decrease in life expectancy. In 2001, COMEAP (Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants) reviewed the evidence on the long-term effects of particles on mortality and concluded that it was more likely than not that a causal association existed between long-term exposure to particles and mortality. The IGCB Report took on board this advice in quantifying the long-term mortality effects of particles. However, the health benefits were not presented in monetary terms due to the uncertainties over valuation in the air pollution context where empirical studies are not yet available.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she has made an assessment of the health benefits of reducing mercury emission from crematoria, using the methodology developed for assessing the health benefits of the National Air Quality Strategy.  [131760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w35.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The methodology for the Air Quality Strategy is aimed at assessing the health impacts for pollutants where inhalation is the main route of exposure. It is not appropriate to use this methodology in this case because exposure through inhalation is negligable.
<P>

<a name="31014w35.html_para2">Crematoria are a source of inorganic mercury. This is associated with tremors, gingivitis and/or minor psychological changes, together with spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation.
<P>

<a name="31014w35.html_para3">Concern arises from the fact that this inorganic mercury can be transported over long distances and be transformed to methyl mercury in the bottom sediments of aquatic ecosystems. Methyl mercury can cause damage to the brain, kidneys and the central nervous system; as it readily crosses the placental barrier, foetal brain levels are approximately 5&#150;7 times higher than in maternal blood. Foetal and postnatal exposures have given rise to abortion, congenital malformation and development changes in young children, with toxic effects in infants even when absent in the mother.
<P>

<a name="31014w35.html_para4">The UK's long-standing policy approach is therefore to minimise, wherever practicable, the amounts of mercury entering the environment from all human activities. We have been discussing with the crematoria sector how they might mitigate any impacts.

 The Crown Estate owns the seabed around the United Kingdom to the limit of the territorial sea. The Crown Estates Act 1961 requires The Crown Estate Commissioners to maintain and enhance the value of the Estate and the return obtained from it, with due regard to the requirements of good estate management. Companies entering into lease agreements for wind farm developments with the Crown Estate will be charged an appropriate rental for the site. Following discussion with industry and the British Wind Energy Association, The Crown Estate has indicated that, up to 2010, the basis for calculating rentals for new wind farm site leases will be unchanged from the current 2 per cent. of gross revenue, with a rent review after 20 years.
<P>

<a name="31014w38.html_para0">The Government have committed themselves to bringing forward legislation as soon as the Parliamentary timetable allows to facilitate the construction of wind farms beyond territorial waters in a Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).

 The major power failure affecting London and parts of Kent on the 28 August 2003 occurred at 18:20 and lasted 41 minutes. Due to the timing and duration of the interruption there was transport disruption that affected a large number of people travelling home at the end of the working day, however the Department of Trade and Industry has not conducted a formal assessment of the impact of the event on the UK economy.
<P>

<a name="31014w38.html_para2">According to National Grid Transco, the cause of the failure was the incorrect operation of a protective device at Wimbledon substation.

[132261]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w38.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The National Grid Company (NGT) has indicated that losses from overhead lines are approximately 50 per cent. greater than for underground cables for power flows at the same voltage.
<P>

<a name="31014w38.html_para3">The cost of losses is not separately available for overhead lines and underground cables. However, NGT advise that total transmission losses (including overhead lines, underground cables and transformers) account for about 1.5 per cent. of energy transferred on the England and Wales transmission network or a cost of around &#163;90 million p.a. (This compares with average losses on the distribution system of approximately 7 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="31014w38.html_para4">The available data indicate that replacing overhead lines with underground cables could not be justified by gains in efficiency, due to the significantly higher capital cost of underground cables.

 Maintaining the reliability of energy supplies is one of four key goals set out in the Government's Energy White Paper.
<P>

<a name="31014w38.html_para5">It is not Government's role to second-guess the electricity market.

 Accounts for the World Trade Organisation ministerial are not currently available and can be produced only at disproportionate cost. The costs will be spilt over a number of different Departments. Each Department publishes its financial accounts after the end of the relevant financial year.

<a name="31014w39.html_para0">This incident was subject to a Royal Navy Board of Inquiry (BOI). A BOI is an internal fact-finding investigation into the circumstances surrounding a particular incident, undertaken by the Services for internal use. The main purpose is to establish the facts concerning an incident as quickly as possible and to make recommendations aimed at preventing a recurrence. The Board found no grounds for any disciplinary action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Alvis Vickers personnel were dispatched to Kuwait in the period immediately preceding the invasion of Iraq to upgrade British Army vehicles; what assessment he has made of the contribution of the upgrades provided by Alvis Vickers to the performance of the British Army on Operation Telic; and what weight will be given to a proven ability to provide operational support and upgrade work when choosing a contractor for the Future Rapid Effect System.  [130409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w39.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Some 60 AVL personnel went to Kuwait to support British troops on Operation Telic. Equipment availability is a key factor in any military operation, and we greatly value the contribution made by civilian contractors. The capacity to support equipment effectively when it enters service is a consideration for acquisition programmes, and this will be the case with FRES.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The ranges at Tipner are vital to maintaining military training for the Royal Navy in the Portsmouth area, and will remain in use for the foreseeable future.

<a name="31014w40.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There has been no Ministry of Defence sponsored study into the use of Tipner ranges by Brent Geese. However, the MOD is aware of two recent studies, by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and Ecological Planning and Research.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his Department's planned expenditure on (i) the Future Rapid Effects System and (ii) all other armoured vehicle projects is over the next 15 years.  [130620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's financial planning processes focus on ten years ahead for equipment acquisition costs and four years ahead for other areas of expenditure. It is not therefore possible to provide the detailed cost information sought over a 15 year period.
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para2">The Future Rapid Effects System project is still in its concept phase. We are therefore yet to endorse the acquisition cost of the project, although it could be in the region of &#163;6 billion.
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para3">Other armoured vehicle projects (which have passed their Main Gate investment decision point) are shown below, together with their post Main Gate expected acquisition costs:
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para4">Future Beach Recovery Vehicle (&#163;13 million);
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para5">Viking (&#163;73 million);
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para6">Terrier (&#163;365 million);

<a name="31014w40.html_para8">Future Command and Liaison Vehicle (&#163;238 million).
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para9">In addition, two other armoured vehicle projects&#151;the Armoured Battlegroup Support Vehicle (ABSV) and the Warrior Mid Life Improvement&#151;are still in their concept phases. Consequently, costs have yet to be agreed for these programmes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether funding for other armoured vehicle projects has been changed as a consequence of the funding arrangements for the Future Rapid Effects System.  [130621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's annual planning round is used to balance levels of investment across capabilities to ensure that our acquisition plans are, in aggregate, affordable within the resources allocated to the future equipment programme. At the individual project level, there is therefore no direct or specific linkage between increased funding in one area and reductions in another.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he expects to make an announcement on the Future Rapid Effects System; and if he will make a statement on its role in the future capability of the Army.  [130623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 FRES will be at the forefront of the Army's rapid intervention capability, across the spectrum of missions from warfighting to peace-keeping. It is expected that the capability will be provided by a system of air-transportable medium weight armoured vehicles and that it will operate as an integral part of future network-enabled forces.

<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para10">As part of the current concept phase of the FRES project, the MOD has been undertaking planning work in order to inform decisions on how best to take the programme forward. The MOD is now considering procurement options and we expect to make an announcement later this year on the way ahead for the project.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether he estimates that the number of variants for the proposed Future Rapid Effects System will fall below 15.  [130782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Future Rapid Effects System (FRES) project is in its concept phase. The optimum make up of the FRES fleet will be determined by studies planned for the subsequent assessment phase of the programme. Only when these studies have been completed will we be able to finalise the number of variants required.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) when he expects the A400M to be compatible with the requirements of the proposed Future Rapid Effects System; and how this has been affected by the delays in the assessment phase for the Future Rapid Effects System;  [130783]
<P>
<UL>(2) what extra costs he expects to incur to the A400M programme to make it compatible with the requirements of the proposed Future Rapid Effects System.  [130775]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The requirements for the Future Rapid Effects System (FRES) are still being developed as part of the project's concept phase. Studies are planned for the next phase of the FRES programme to examine coherence with associated programmes including A400M. These studies will ensure that the FRES requirements take into account the need for air portability. The contract for the A400M programme has now been signed. It is not currently expected that there will be any consequent adjustments to it, and therefore no additional costs have been identified.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the effects of the timescales for <i>(a)</i> the A400M and the development of a strategic lift capability and <i>(b)</i> the awarding of the contract for the Future Rapid Effects System on (i) the development of a rapidly deployable medium force capability and (ii) the projected in-service date of the Future Rapid Effects System.  [130804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In seeking a better balance in our deployable land forces, we plan to shift from the current mix of light and heavy forces representing the two extremes of deployability and combat power to a more graduated and balanced structure of light, medium and heavy forces, together with a greater emphasis on enabling capabilities such as logistics, engineers and intelligence. The introduction of the air-transportable, medium-weight Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles is one part of this re-balancing. The ISD for FRES will be formally set at the Main Gate investment decision, however the planning assumption for its ISD remains around the end of this decade. A400M enters service in a comparable timeframe&#151;its ISD is 2011.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether he plans to purchase or lease further C-17s to provide a strategic lift capability for the proposed Future Rapid Effects System.  [130781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The MOD is currently considering the retention in service of a small fleet of C17 aircraft. This is not specifically linked to the introduction of the Future Rapid Effects System (FRES), although C17s could have utility in this role alongside other airlift assets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what contribution the Government has made to ensure that an accurate central list of Iraqi detainees in coalition-run prisons in Iraq, with names in Arabic, is kept.  [130354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
<i> [holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> The names of all Iraqis held at the Theatre Internment Facility are held on a database which includes Arabic names that have been transliterated into English by an interpreter. A list of names of all UK detained Iraqis held in the Theatre Internment Facility, and for which the UK Military is therefore responsible, is passed onto the International Committee of the Red Cross every two weeks.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Flook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the estimated monthly cost of keeping British military personnel and equipment in Iraq and the surrounding region is, following the recent deployment of extra troops;  [131510]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the estimated total cost to date is of deploying British military personnel and kit to Iraq.  [131520]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w40.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs which the Department would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises, for example&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para11">Calculating all the costs of military action will take some time since they will include the cost of ammunition, bombs and guided weapons consumed in excess of peacetime levels and the cost of repairing and replacing equipment destroyed and damaged. We do however estimate the cost of preparatory activities in 2002&#150;03 at around &#163;700 million, less than the &#163;1 billion set aside at Spring Supplementary Estimates 2002&#150;03. This estimate includes the procurement or modification of equipment, increased maintenance and stock consumption, civil sea and air charter and provision of infrastructure in-theatre. A figure for total costs in 2002&#150;03 including the cost of operations up to 31 March 2003 will be published in the Department's Resource Accounts at the end of October 2003.
<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para12">It is too early to estimate the costs likely to arise in 2003&#150;04. Once these are known, additional funding will be sought in the normal way through Supplementary Estimates.




<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 163W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31014w40.html_para13">Costs are not incurred on a regular monthly basis and force levels have fluctuated considerably during 2003&#150;04. As a result, to attempt to provide monthly average costs would be misleading.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w41.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) when he plans to issue qualification criteria for the medal for service in the Suez Canal Zone; how long the distribution of medals will take; and what factors underlie this timetable;  [131437]
<P>
<UL>(2) what measures he is taking to try to ensure that Suez Canal Zone veterans receive their medals before this year's Remembrance Day service;  [131438]
<P>
(3) what measures he will take to minimise the number of veterans who lose their eligibility to the Suez Canal Zone medal because of the lack of detail in service records of the 1950s.  [131439]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w41.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Final approval of the Suez Medal is now awaited. As soon as that occurs I will make a statement to the House. Prior to that officials are carrying out preparatory work on the applications already received, and aim to issue medals to eligible veterans as soon as practicable.
<P>

<a name="31014w41.html_para0">It is hoped that everyone who served in the Suez Canal Zone for the requisite number of days, within the designated dates and geographical boundaries which are in the process of being agreed, will receive a medal and/or clasp. However, on some individual Service records it might be more difficult to confirm eligibility from the limited information. In such cases, the files will be cross-referenced against the detailed Service records and maps that have been prepared by officials from contemporary historical documents. These will help to determine which Units, ships, regiments, squadrons etc. were deployed in the Canal Zone during the period specified in the White Paper. In rare cases where the evidence is insufficient to confirm eligibility for the medal, the medal offices may have to invite veterans to supply additional proof of entitlement in the form of contemporary official documentation, but it is hoped that this will not be necessary, I expect most veterans to receive their medals during the course of next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the pilot schemes for greater flexibility in the 14 to 19 curriculum.  [131814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w41.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The 14 to 19 pathfinders, which are testing, among other things, greater curriculum flexibility and choice, are currently being evaluated. We plan to publish the outcomes in January 2004. In addition, the 'Increased Flexibility for 14 to 16 year olds' Programme has provided new vocational and work-related learning opportunities for this age group, including provision of the new GCSEs in vocational subjects. This Programme too is being evaluated and the findings are due to be published early in 2004.
<P>

<a name="31014w41.html_para1">In the meantime, we intend to amend the National Curriculum at Key Stage 4 to give schools greater flexibility in responding to the needs of their pupils. The Working Group on 14 to 19 Reform has been asked to consider how there might be greater coherence in learning programmes for young people throughout their 14 to 19 education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what funds were allocated to <i>(a)</i> schools, <i>(b)</i> futher education colleges and <i>(c)</i> other providers in connection with pilot schemes for greater flexibility in the 14 to 19 curriculum in 2003&#150;04.  [131813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. In the academic year 2003/04, &#163;16 million has been allocated to the 14&#150;19 pathfinders which are testing, among other things, greater curriculum flexibility and choice.
<P>

<a name="31014w41.html_para2">All the 14&#150;19 pathfinders involve partnership and collaboration among a variety of different institutions and providers including schools, colleges, training providers, employers and higher education institutions. Funding is allocated and monitored at partnership level through the pathfinder lead body, which may be, for example, the local education authority, Local Learning and Skills Council, a school or an FE college.
<P>

<a name="31014w41.html_para3">The 'Increased Flexibility for 14&#150;16 year olds' Programme is also providing new vocational and work-related learning opportunities for this age group, including provision of the new vocational GCSEs. During 2003&#150;04, this Programme is providing &#163;38.3 million via the Learning and Skills Council to the lead partners, which are mainly FE colleges, to support provision in schools and colleges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w41.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We expect the Office for Fair Access to approve access agreements in time for universities to inform prospective students' applications to higher education. We therefore expect agreements to be in place before students are accepted for places and would not expect the agreement to change in respect of a students already committed to a course once it has been approved.

 School governing bodies will continue to set school opening hours to suit the circumstances of parents and pupils at their school. The recent publication "Travelling to School: an action plan" encourages school to work with their local authority and transport providers to consider whether staggered school opening hours can allow pupils to access a wider range of school based activities, cut costs and improve services by allowing the same number of buses to provide a service to many more pupils. Decisions on school session times are and will remain a matter for individual schools. If schools in their local area adopt different times, parents with reasons to prefer one school's opening hours to another's will no doubt take this into account in choosing a school.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport recognises the particular contribution of folk arts to rural life regeneration and cultural tourism. In March 2003, Arts Council England announced increases in core funding to contemporary music, including folk music, of &#163;1.7 million. This included an 



<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 173W</I><P>
increase of over &#163;100,000 to Folk Arts England to support the development of a dynamic English folk music sector.
<P>

<a name="31014w43.html_para3">Arts Council funding for the Colchester Arts Centre, which provides a diverse programme of folk music will also rise over the next three years by 16.5 per cent. to &#163;104,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made as to the safety implications of introducing small sections of standing areas at football grounds.  [132402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w43.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government's position on standing at football grounds has not changed. Whatever their size, standing terraces are implicitly more dangerous to spectators than seated areas. As such, there are no plans to revise the all seater policy, which applies to all Premier and First Division grounds.
<P>

<a name="31014w43.html_para4">I have made it clear to those who seek changes to that policy that it will remain in place unless or until compelling technical evidence is produced that it is no longer necessary. My officials regularly discuss the Government's position on this issue with the Football Supporters' Federation and other interested parties. No technical evidence in favour of the re-introduction of standing areas has been produced to date.

 The Government are committed to supporting the Iraqi people in securing the long-term well being of Iraqi collections and antiquities. We believe that the most sustainable way of achieving this is to ensure that the museums have Iraqi conservators, curators and restorers who have the necessary and up-to-date skills to look after the collections. The British Museum, English Heritage and other organisations funded through my Department are consequently providing initially six secondment scholarships to help train Iraqi Board of Antiquities staff in the skills which the board most urgently needs. A number of staff have already been identified who will come to the UK to undertake secondments in the British Museum as soon as possible. In addition, my Department has compiled a 



<P>

database of offers for help and support by a number of UK-based heritage bodies and will match these offers with future needs identified by the Board of Antiquities.

Each will submit a strategy document before the end of October 2003, detailing how the money will be used, and building work on new and improved facilities is expected to begin in April 2004.

 Estimates of terrestrial television coverage are not available in the requested form. The estimated coverage of analogue terrestrial television services is 99.4 per cent. of the UK and currently 73.1 per cent. of UK households can receive Freeview's services via digital terrestrial television. Information about analogue coverage and digital terrestrial coverage based on post code, can be obtained from the BBC and the Independent Television Commission. BBC services on digital satellite can be viewed free-to-air without the need for a viewing card. ITV, Channel 4 and Five are now considering a scheme to enable viewers to continue receiving these services, with a viewing card.

 My Department liaised closely with the US Embassy throughout the organisation of this event and access to the Embassy was available on 11 September 2003. The opening of the garden was a ticket-only event for the families of the UK victims. It would not have been appropriate to allow other members of the public to participate in this very private moment. Furthermore, permitting members of the public to access the site on the day of the event would have compromised the extremely tight security which was required for such a high profile event.

<P>
<a name="31014w45.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Information on local authorities' activities under homelessness provisions in England is published in a quarterly Statistical Release, "Statutory Homelessness: England". Table 3 of the Statistical Release presents a summary of those households accepted as unintentionally homeless and in priority need under the homelessness provisions of the 1996 Housing Act. Tables 6 and 7 summarise the number of homeless households in accommodation arranged by local authorities on the last day of the quarter.
<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para6">Copies of the Statistical Release are available in the Library of the House and the latest edition, published on 10 September, presents statistics up to and including the second quarter of 2003. In the period April to June 2003, local authorities accepted 36,230 households as homelessness, and as at 30 June 2003 there were 93,480

<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para8">The March 2002 report, 'More than a roof', set out the Government's approach to tackling and preventing homelessness. Specific measures included investment of &#163;125 million in 2002&#150;03 to support local authorities and voluntary agencies working with them to support new approaches to tackling and preventing homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has a revenue budget of &#163;70 million and a &#163;23.5 million capital budget for 2003&#150;04. These resources will help to support the Government's commitment that by March 2004 no homeless family with children should be placed in a bed and breakfast hotel other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks.
<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para9">Funding will also support new approaches that help people tackle the problems that are making and keeping them homeless and help to sustain the Prime Minister's target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds of 1998 levels.
<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para10">While the latest quarterly statistics show increases in homelessness acceptances and the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation, there has been a significant reduction in the number of homeless families with children placed in bed and breakfast accommodation. The number of such families has fallen by 22 per cent. over the last quarter and 44 per cent. compared with a year ago. In addition, the latest rough sleeping figures for England, also published on 10 September, estimate that 504 people were sleeping rough on any one night&#151;the lowest ever recorded level.
<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para11">The rising trend in homelessness is the result of numerous complex factors, many of which are outlined in "More than a roof". In addition, the Priority Needs Order has extended the criteria by which people are assessed to have a priority need if they are homeless.
<P>

<a name="31014w45.html_para12">The Homelessness Act 2002 placed a duty on local authorities to have a strategy in place by the end of July 2003 to tackle and prevent homelessness, based on a review of homelessness in their district. While the number of homelessness acceptances is likely to continue to increase in the short term, improved housing supply and increased investment in prevention should lead to reductions in the longer term.

 There are no plans to give local authorities additional powers to seize the assets of illegally camped Gypsies and Travellers in order to recoup the cost of clearing sites.

 Customers purchasing package travel including a flight are protected financially in the event of failure of the travel organiser concerned. Customers abroad at the time of failure will be repatriated at the end of their holiday, and those who have yet to travel will be fully reimbursed for what they have paid. Under the terms of the Civil Aviation (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing) Regulations 1995, in the event of failure of a licensed travel organiser the bond established with the Civil Aviation Authority would be used to cover the repatriation and reimbursement costs. If the bond is insufficient to meet these costs the Air Travel Trust Fund would be used to make up the difference.

 A company offering both air travel and accommodation on the same website is obliged to have an ATOL licence, thereby financially protecting customers who buy a package. If flight and accommodation were booked separately there would be no financial protection for the accommodation; the flight, however, would be financially protected unless the vendor issued the ticket within 24 hours of payment being made. If the flight and accommodation were linked, albeit booked separately, the vendor might recognise the linkage and issue a single invoice, thereby conferring financial protection on the resulting package.

 The Department is aware that the French authorities place a restriction on coach travel during a weekend in late July or early August, annually. The date of the ban changes year-to-year, but during the 24-hour period of application, coach groups of more than 15 children under the age of 16 years are prohibited from travelling. The restrictions were originally put in place due to a number of serious coach accidents occurring at this time of year, which is traditionally the busiest weekend for transporting French children and heavy holiday traffic.

 The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East consultation closed on 30 June 2003. We are currently analysing over 400,000 responses to the consultation. It would not be appropriate to comment on any of the responses while the analysis is being undertaken. However, I can confirm that all options considered in the South East and East of England Regional Air Services Study (SERAS), including the option for a third runway at Heathrow, were appraised for potential impacts on the water environment including any contributory risk to flooding.
<P>

<a name="31014w48.html_para11">The appraisal system took account of national guidance including the Environment Agency's 1 in 100 year flood plain mapping and the Flood Estimation Handbook. The option for a third runway at Heathrow Airport was assessed as having a Low Adverse impact on flooding.

 We do not hold the information in the form requested in respect of the costs of providing aids to navigation for vessels using Republic of Ireland ports. Once a merchant vessel has paid light dues, there is no further liability for a period of one month from that date. Furthermore, no more than seven payments are required in any fiscal year. We therefore do not hold information on merchant vessel movements beyond the seven voyage limit. Neither do we hold records on fishing vessel or tug activity.

 The Secretaries of State for Transport and for Education and Skills have discussed staggered school opening hours on a number of occasions.

But this is a matter for individual schools and local authorities to take a view on, in developing comprehensive school travel plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what is the minimum strength standard that British ships are built to for <i>(a)</i> the hull and <i>(b)</i> the aft.  [132289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w49.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The detailed designs of structural elements of British ships are to standards which are maintained and published by those classification societies to which this responsibility has been delegated under the Merchant Shipping Acts. Such standards govern the hull and fittings, superstructures and machinery of ships and take into account hull form, speed, operational restraints and geographic area of operation. Minimum strength standards are dependent on the role of the specific vessel.
<P>

<a name="31014w49.html_para2">The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) exists as a forum for the unification of such standards. IACS publishes a number of unified requirements related to ship's structures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w49.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 British vessels are designed to meet the worst waves reasonably expected in service. The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) has tables showing what wave loadings are to be used for differing service requirements. Standards for ship's structures are based on known wave environments expressed statistically and incorporate appropriate safety margins. Freak waves by definition are in excess of these expectations and therefore no ship is specifically designed to meet them.

 The Department recognises the importance of the need for high quality care and early detection for people with diabetes and the need for prevention, and welcomes the publication of the CREST report. The report contains a wide range of recommendations covering the full spectrum of the condition from screening for people with a higher risk of developing diabetes to the prevention and treatment of the disease.
<P>

<a name="31014w51.html_para4">The prevention of diabetes through the health promotion message of healthy eating, physical activity, not smoking and greater public awareness of diabetes, its symptoms and associated health risks is extremely important. I am confident that existing health strategies such as Investing for Health, the Physical Activity Strategy and Nutrition Strategy will contribute significantly to this. I have also emphasised the need to secure improvements in the management of chronic disease and I have asked local health and social care groups to develop projects within their locality to secure improvements in conditions such as diabetes. I have also made resources available to improve the detection and treatment of diabetes-related eye disease and this is being taken forward by a regional working group. These significant steps underline my desire to improve services for people with diabetes.

 One of the key actions set out in Priorities for Action 2003&#150;04 was a requirement for each of the 15 local health and social care groups to develop at least one project to increase the capacity of primary care to address chronic diseases such as asthma or diabetes in the primary care setting and reduce pressures in the hospital sector. It is a matter for each group to decide which area of chronic disease management should be targeted in the light of local priorities. In the event, 14 groups are taking forward projects which focus on diabetes. The exact nature of the projects varies from group to group and they are at different stages of development.

 Preparatory work for the provision of Digital Hearing Aids (DHAs) is at an advanced stage and introduction, on a phased basis, will commence in early November. An additional &#163;1 million has been allocated for this purpose, to cover the revenue costs of recruiting additional audiologists, training in fitting DHAs, purchasing the new aids and the capital costs of installing computer based testing equipment necessary to support introduction.
<P>

<a name="31014w51.html_para7">It is estimated that there are over 100,000 hearing aid users in Northern Ireland. Evidence based research suggests that DHAs may benefit 80 per cent. of users. It is not possible at this stage to say what numbers of new and existing users might be assessed for DHAs per year. Given that introduction is on a phased basis, it will take a number of years for the entire hearing aid user population to be assessed for digital aids.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w51.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The principal cause of the present difficulties is a significant increase in demand: applications are up by around 11 per cent. over the previous year. Allied to this is the fact that the Agency's test centres have been closed on a phased basis for the installation of much needed new vehicle test equipment. I regret that despite careful planning it has not been possible to cope as effectively as I would have liked with this additional demand in recent months.
<P>

<a name="31014w51.html_para8">The Agency has taken a number of measures to reduce waiting times. These include increasing productivity, introducing a more efficient booking programme, making maximum possible use of overtime, redeploying staff from non-urgent duties to testing, introducing extended working at a number of

This level of saving was achieved from a broad range of schemes, such as the Warm Homes Scheme, the Housing Executive's heating replacement programme and renewable energy pilot schemes. The energy efficiency levy, which was increased by the Northern Ireland Assembly to &#163;5 per electricity consumer was used to further underpin household energy efficiency with over 80 per cent. of this benefit being specifically targeted towards disadvantaged householders likely to be at risk of fuel poverty.

<P>
<a name="31014w53.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how much was spent on food by his Department and by each agency for which it is responsible in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; what proportion of that food by value was produced in the United Kingdom; what guidance he has issued to encourage the procurement of home-grown food; and if he will make a statement.  [129379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w53.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Expenditure on food in NICS Departments is generally limited to official hospitality and staff catering subsidies of approximately &#163;700,000 per annum in both 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. Staff catering services have been contracted out since the early '90s and the purchase of food is therefore the responsibility of the private sector catering service providers.
<P>

<a name="31014w53.html_para0">Departments do not have detailed information to identify what proportion of that food by value was produced in the Untied Kingdom other than statements from catering service providers that, where possible, the majority of fresh food would be sourced in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<a name="31014w53.html_para1">No guidance has been issued encouraging the procurement of home produced food; however, my Department is liasing with the Departments of Environment and Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and nationally with the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in developing policy and best practice guidance on food procurement to ensure quality standards and value for money. This process has also involved consultation with stakeholders including the World Wildlife Fund, Livestock Marketing Commission and Ulster Farmers Union.

 In Northern Ireland, Health and Social Services (HSS) trusts pay fostering allowances, which are agreed each year in consultation with the four HSS boards. The standard rates known as the 'Model Scheme' in Northern Ireland are currently lower than the average amount paid by local authorities in England. However, boards and trusts have increased allowances within the Model Scheme by 5.5 per cent. for 2003&#150;04. Different rates are payable for children of different ages ranging from &#163;285.88 per four weeks for children aged 0&#150;4 to &#163;513.52 per four weeks for children aged 16+ . The scale of foster care allowances is set out in the following table. Enhanced allowances are also available to cover, for example, expenses incurred at Christmas and birthdays and the cost of school uniforms and educational holidays.

 The routine collection of data by my Department on the numbers of registered foster carers in Northern Ireland commenced in 2001 and the returns from that date are presented in the following table. In addition a figure is available for 1997 from a fostering inspection report published by the Social Services Inspectorate. This, too, is presented in following table.
<P>

<a name="31014w53.html_para4">There are difficulties with the recruitment and retention of foster carers. Despite numerous recruitment campaigns by Health and Social Services (HSS) Boards and Trusts, problems with the recruitment of foster carers continue to exist.
<P>

<a name="31014w53.html_para5">The success in recruitment and retention of foster carers is dependent on many factors including remuneration, training, the status that foster carers receive and support, particularly in times of crisis. My Department is currently in the process of developing a strategy for all children in need including those in foster care. It is intended that, as part of that strategy, the Department will work in liaison with HSS Boards and Trusts and the Fostering Network to develop a three year costed fostering plan. The plan will, of course, take account of the issues raised in the Strategy for Foster Care Services developed by the four HSS Boards in conjunction with the Fostering Network, which I understand will be published soon.

<P>

 The information is not readily available in the format requested. However the following table contains information, which Trusts were able to provide. The entitlement for paid sick leave for any employee is a maximum of 12 months, six months full pay and six months half pay. Employees can remain on the Trust payroll for a number of reasons; these include applications for ill health retirement, where the recovery period is longer or where a member of staff is terminally ill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many general practitioners in Northern Ireland are on sick leave; and for what length of time each has been on sick leave.  [130864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w53.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 As a general practitioner is entitled to his or her full normal remuneration during absence on account of illness, not all GPs report when they are unable to attend work due to sickness. The total number of GPs on sick absence is therefore not known. However it is known that at 31 August 2003, 31 general practitioners have reported absent from their practice on account of sickness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what criteria is used by the NHS in Northern Ireland to decide when to refer a patient to a private healthcare provider for treatment.  [131745]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w55.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The decision to refer a patient to a private healthcare provider for treatment is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of the treatment on the health and social services in Northern Ireland or on the NHS in Great Britain and how long the patient may have to wait for such treatment, as well as the cost. Private health care providers also have to satisfy the appropriate Health and Social Services Board as to the quality of care that will be provided, including arrangements for the provision of any necessary aftercare.

 As the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made clear to the House in the debate on the Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission etc.) Bill, 17 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 901, we are working hard to rebuild trust and confidence necessary for elections to the Assembly, and the restoration of devolved institutions, as soon as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many Pre-school Education Advisory Group's places have been allocated to each nursery school and playschool in the South Eastern Education and Library Board for 2003&#150;04.  [129899]<P>

 I understand from the Chief Executive of the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the following allocations of PEAG places have been made to voluntary and private sector pre-school centres in the Board area. The process of the PEAG reallocating unused places is still under way. The figures shown below may not, therefore, represent any individual centre's final allocation for the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what provision there is for respite care for adults with special needs in the Northern Health and Social Services Board Area; and what plans there are to increase provision in the constituency of East Antrim.  [131038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w56.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Northern Health and Social Services Board advises that the provision of respite services to support adults with special needs differs between the two Community Health and Social Services Trusts in its area.
<P>

<a name="31014w56.html_para1">In Causeway Health and Social Services Trust service provision is almost exclusively through the Trust's own family based respite care scheme. In Homefirst Health and Social Services Trust the model of provision is slightly different, drawing mainly on services provided through a family based scheme run by the voluntary sector, while also using a limited amount of statutory sector provision. This year the Northern Health and Social Services Board provided additional resources to increase family based respite, in conjunction with the voluntary sector, in the East Antrim area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w56.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what measures are in place to support Northern Ireland's existing and new high technology and telecommunications industry and entrepreneurs; and if he will make a statement.  [131525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w56.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Invest NI employs a broad range of measures to assist existing companies and entrepreneurs in the hi-technology and telecommunications sectors. The principal form of support available to assist significant new investment proposals (by new or existing businesses) is Selective Financial Assistance, which may contain elements covering capital and revenue grants in addition to loans and equity participation. Invest NI also operates a comprehensive series of schemes and programmes aimed at providing support which can be tailored to the needs of individual companies or entrepreneurs.
<P>

<a name="31014w56.html_para4">These measures assist Invest NI to achieve the objectives set out in its Corporate Plan 2002&#150;05. They therefore focus on promoting innovation and stimulating higher levels of R&D and knowledge transfer; helping companies to achieve higher levels of growth; promoting a more enterprising culture; raising the number of business starts; and attracting new inward investment.




<P>
<P><I>14 Oct 2003 : Column 224W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31014w56.html_para5">Invest NI has achieved a highly credible performance in its first year of operation. Key Innovation targets have been met or exceeded; Growing Existing Businesses and Business Start-up targets have been substantially achieved; and performance in attracting new inward investment has been encouraging, despite the continuing global downturn in foreign direct investment. In particular, Invest NI has assisted the setting up of 74 new, potentially high growth companies in the hi-tech and telecommunications sectors. Its offer of &#163;14.3 million support towards business proposals by companies in these sectors represents a total investment of &#163;109 million.
<P>

<a name="31014w56.html_para6">Invest NI has also played a key role in establishing the Northern Ireland Science Park and has provided &#163;26 million to support the establishment of 17 Centres of Research Excellence, the majority of which are focused on high technology sectors. In addition, Invest NI has been highly active in drawing up a series of sector strategies aimed at maximising the economic development potential for a range of sectors including hi-technology and telecommunications.
<P>

<a name="31014w56.html_para7">These excellent first year achievements offer a very sound platform on which Invest NI can build in the future. They demonstrate the success of the measures which Invest NI has developed to provide support schemes and programmes which are both comprehensive and sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of existing businesses and entrepreneurs in a wide range of industrial sectors, including hi-technology and telecommunications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31014w56.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Department for Employment and Learning's North Belfast JobCentre contacted TeleTech immediately after the company's announcement on 3 September that approximately 60 workers would be made redundant. An offer of assistance to help find alternative employment for those workers facing redundancy was made. The company decided not to take up this offer at this time as it is hoping to reduce the numbers to be made redundant by redeploying some of those affected to other contracts within TeleTech.

But I also stressed that while I will listen to proposals, I do not wish to provide people with false hope that the Government will step in to help members of defined-benefit pension schemes which have already started to wind-up.

<a name="31014w58.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Successive Lord Chancellors have warned magistrates of the risks of participating in activities which might appear to undermine the independence of the bench. However, one of the strengths of the magistracy is that its members will have a wide range of experience of their local communities. Magistrates are encouraged to keep their knowledge up to date, and visits to areas with particular problems can do much to help. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State does not wish to discourage magistrates from seeing at first hand how the police work within the local community. This must, however, be achieved in ways which minimise the risks of their impartiality being called into question.
