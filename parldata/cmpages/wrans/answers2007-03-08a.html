Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias. Sample sizes are provided to help readers judge the robustness of the information.<br>
9. Data are not provided for certain cells in the table because the sample sizes are too small to support reliable estimates of the statistics in question. (Represented with an *)<br>
10. Evidence suggests that some items of income may be under reported in the survey, particularly self-employment and investment income; and estimates of average income are vulnerable to variations in the number of very high income households responding in each region; these figures should therefore be treated with caution.<br>

Non-Olympic distributors may lose an average of 5 per cent. of their income because of sales diversion to Olympic Lottery games over the period 2005-06 to 2012-13. In addition, we have already announced that &#163;410 million will be taken from non-Olympic Lottery proceeds between 2009 and 2012.

 Details of monthly and annual biofuel sales are available via http://www.uktradeinfo.com/ index.cfm?task=bullhydro. Biofuel sales have increased steadily in the UK since the introduction of the 20p per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel and bioethanol, and in January 2007 accounted for some 0.8 per cent. of total transport fuel sales. During the calendar year 2005, biofuel sales made up some 0.25 per cent. of total transport fuel sales against the target of 0.3 per cent. which the UK set under the European Union&#146;s Biofuels Directive (2003/30/EC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="70308w0004.htm_para9"><a name="07030867000507">The Government have announced that they will introduce a renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) in April 2008, which will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a certain percentage of their total transport fuel sale comes from biofuels. The level of the RTFO will be 2.5 per cent. in the financial year 2008-09, rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11. The Government are currently consulting on both the detailed design of the RTFO and how it might evolve over time.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the <i> (a)</i> one-off and <i> (b)</i> recurring cost of implementing the Excise Duty (Reduced Pollution) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (EU Pollution Directive 98/69/EC) to (i) businesses and (ii) the regulators.

 The Reduced Pollution Certificate (RPC) scheme offers reduced rates of vehicle excise duty to heavy goods vehicle and public service vehicle operators who take action, generally by fitting a particulate trap, to reduce the particulate emissions of their vehicles to a target level below what would be required for a vehicle constructed to the Euro standard of that vehicle.</p>

The principal purpose was to replace what had been the anticipated particulate standard for Euro 4 and 5 vehicles (the level that Euro 2 and 3 vehicles respectively had to reach to obtain an RPC) with the more stringent level actually agreed by the EU. This closed a loophole that had enabled a number of operators to obtain RPCs while taking little, if any, positive action to retrofit their vehicles.</p>

 The Independent Audit of Spectrum Holdings and the subsequent Government response, agreeing with the audit, found that there is scope for more effective use of public sector radio spectrum.

In its response to the audit, the MCA stressed that the safety case is paramount in any proposals to introduce pricing and bandsharing.

 As part of the guarantee arrangements for these schemes the Government receives 50 per cent. of any surplus declared in the triennial actuarial valuations undertaken by the Government Actuary. The Government&#146;s share of each surplus, if any, is paid out over 10 years. The other 50 per cent. is used to enhance members&#146; benefits. Between October 1994 and December 2006 the Government received &#163;1,785 million in respect of such payments from the Mineworkers&#146; Pension Scheme (MPS) and &#163;1,470 million from the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme (BCSSS). A further receipt of &#163;242 million is expected from the BCSSS this month. In addition, the Government have used just over &#163;68 million from the MPS Investment Reserve to fond lump-sum payments to members of the MPS on low pensions, and received &#163;154 million from the BCSSS Investment Reserve, of which over &#163;90 million has been used to fond pension liabilities inherited from British Coal.

 Since April 2001, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) at University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT) has been the main centre for the receipt of UK armed forces casualties aeromedically evacuated from all over the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan. UHBFT runs the Selly Oak and Queen Elizabeth hospital sites. In a few individual cases, operational casualties have been placed initially for clinical reasons in other hospitals in the Birmingham area and elsewhere, but UHBFT has the capacity to cope with surges in the number of military casualties. In the event of a significant casualty surge, the MOD and UHBFT would jointly manage the receipt under the existing reception arrangements for military patients (RAMP) plan.</p>

The method chosen was considered to be simple, transparent and fair to all authorities. The only exceptions to this were to applications from two authorities where the Government have used its intervention or engagement powers, and whose applications were agreed earlier in the year as part of a wide ranging package of measures aimed at rebuilding the capacity of the authorities to deliver effective services.

 The Home Office monitors and evaluates neighbourhood policing nationally through a strategic research programme rather than measuring the performance of individual teams, such as those based in Rotherham.

 The knife amnesty was held from 24 May to the end of June 2006. Over that period, almost 90,000 items were handed in to police in England and Wales. This constitutes a substantial quantity of potentially lethal items taken off the streets. However, the amnesty was just one facet of our knife crime strategy, which focuses on tough enforcement through targeted operations such as Operation Shield run by the British Transport Police, education programmes, including the Be Safe programme which teaches young people of the dangers and consequences of carrying knives, and support for wider prevention work. We also support community-based initiatives and projects through the Connected Fund, which was established in May 2004 and has supported 300 groups so far.

 According to work completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers last year as part of the Home Office Simplification Plan, which was published on 11 December 2006, the estimated administrative burden on business of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 was &#163;1.44 million. This excludes policy costs (i.e. those costs which arise as a direct result of the policy, for example updating an IT system) and also those costs a business would choose to incur anyway (e.g. maintaining records for their own business purposes).

The NCVO reports that charities' financial accounts show total donations received from individuals of around &#163;4 billion in 2004/05, whereas the estimate of donations based on the EFS in that year, was &#163;2.9 billion. The estimates of charitable giving produced by the NCVO from the Omnibus Survey data, are actually higher than would be implied by the charities&#146; financial accounts. It reports that 57% of adults gave to charity in a typical month during 2004/05, and that total donations for the year amounted to &#163;8.2 billion. The NCVO report discusses some of the reasons why their estimates are higher. They may include an element of &#145;purchase giving&#146;&#151;the purchase of goods or services from charities, that is still regarded by the respondent as charitable giving. In addition, whereas the EFS collects information on charitable giving merely as one component of expenditure amongst many, the Omnibus Survey questions addressed charitable giving much more directly, and the social desirability of charitable giving may have lead respondents to over-report the size and number of gifts.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 February 2007]:</i> Between 1997-98 and 2005-06 we increased investment in FE by 48 per cent. in real terms and between 2005-06 and 2007-08 the overall Learning and Skills Council (LSC) budget will increase further from &#163;9.9 billion to &#163;11.2 billion. However, in order to meet the skills challenges that we face, clearly identified by the Leitch Report &#147;Prosperity for all in the Global Economy &#151; world class skills&#148; (December 2006), it is important that we increasingly focus available funding on our priorities.</p>

Investment in adult education continues to grow and as a result of this strategy, we have more adults than ever successfully completing longer and higher priority courses such as Skills for Life and full level 2 qualifications. The strategy has allowed us to exceed our interim Skills for Life target, set in 2001, of 1.5 million achievements with more than 1.6 million people having gained basic skills qualifications. The significant growth in full level 2 provision also supports our assessment that we will achieve our one million interim milestone for the 2006 adult level 2 target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="70308w0027.htm_para0"><a name="07030887000414">Even though there were still nearly four million publicly funded adult learning places available in 2005/06, the realignment of funding to meet our priorities has resulted in a reduction of publicly funded adult places. The majority of the loss in funded adult learner places was in non-priority learning with much of it being for short, non-accredited provision, which does not offer sufficient opportunities for progression to further learning or the necessary skills for employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="70308w0027.htm_para1"><a name="07030887000415">However, the reduction in publicly funded adult learner places needs to be considered in the wider context of total adult provision where we expect to see over 350,000 learners in the Train to Gain programme in 2007/08. Along with increases in adult apprenticeships, these will partially offset reductions in publicly funded places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="70308w0027.htm_para2"><a name="07030887000416">Recent surveys also indicate that colleges are responding positively to the changes in fees where it is reported that most colleges expected growth in full cost activity in 2006/07, following growth for most in 2005/06. These increases in full cost provision could further offset the reduction in publicly funded places and we are encouraging further growth in full costs provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="70308w0027.htm_para3"><a name="07030887000417">Finally, just as the LSC does not fund all available learning, so its report on learner numbers does not offer a full picture. Opportunities are no longer confined mainly to publicly funded or publicly available courses, with ever more learning opportunities through the private sector, the internet and broadcasting. Partly as a result, more adults are learning than ever before. The National Adult Learning survey (NALS) published on 30 November, showed 80 per cent. of adults had participated in some form of learning over the previous three years, an increase from 76 per cent. in 2002.</p>

 There is no basis for comparison between figures set out in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and funding provided by local authorities for delivery of the free entitlement. Free entitlement funding is intended to deliver high-quality provision for three and four-year-olds, based on the core foundation stage curriculum, and in accordance with the day care standards. The figure quoted in the report is based on a small sample of local authorities. It refers to an hourly per head rate in children&#146;s centres and represents the cost of delivering child care for children aged between birth and five. For under-threes, the child: staff ratio is necessarily lower, and the cost of provision therefore higher.</p>

All areas have been asked to review their strategies against this guidance, with a view to raising all areas&#146; performance to the levels of the best&#151;if all areas had performed as well as the top quartile, the national reduction would be 26 per cent.&#151;more than twice the 11.8 per cent. reduction that has actually been achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="70308w0031.htm_para1"><a name="07030887001081">The funding available to each area for delivery of their local strategies is calculated using a formula that takes account of: the area&#146;s under-18 conception rate; the total size of the female population aged 15-17; and the number of prevented conceptions needed in order for the area to meet its under-18 conception rate reduction target (of between 40 and 60 per cent.). We have no plans to change the basis of the formula. Areas with declining rates have achieved this within current funding arrangements, through joint planning and commissioning and we do not believe that effective delivery of local strategies requires more resources. However, areas which have made least progress will receive additional support to strengthen their strategies from their Government office, which is charged with performance managing local areas. For high and increasing rate areas, this will include additional support provided by the Department of Health&#146;s &#145;National Support Team&#146;.</p>
