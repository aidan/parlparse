 The price of a home information pack will be set by the market, not by Government. The main components affecting costs are the searches and the energy performance certificate. Searches are already paid for in housing transactions at the moment and their cost varies substantially from area to area. Energy performance certificates are the only new element and could save buyers hundreds of pounds in fuel bills as well as having the potential to help them get access to green mortgages or grants from utility companies for energy saving improvements.</p>

Voluntary departures schemes are one of thetools it uses, as an alternative to redundancy, to reduce headcount, to refresh skills and to tackle staff surpluses. The criteria for such schemes are governed by the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, which provides compensation to civil servants who leave via an exit scheme before their pension age.</p>

 I have regular discussions with all my ministerial colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills (DFES).

 Local authorities have been issued with planning guidance that sets out the criteria for the location of children's centres.

1. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of section 52 for financial year 1999-2000. School based expenditure in local authority maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>
2. School-based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. Central local authority expenditure cannot, in all cases, be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently is excluded from the tables.<br>
3. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br>
4. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. In 2001-02, this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil. From 2002-03 onwards, only the schools element of these categories is included and this accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the 2002-03 total. Also, for some local authorities, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the central local authority part of the form from 2002-03, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
5. Local government reorganisation (LGR) prior to the 1996-97 financial year in the county of Cleveland resulted in the creation of four new unitary local authorities (Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees). Consequently figures for Hartlepool LA are not available prior to 1996-97.<br>
6. The Tees Valley sub-region comprises of the four unitary authorities created by the local government reorganisation of the county of Cleveland in 1996 (namely Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees LAs) along with the borough of Darlington which became a unitary authority in 1997. Consequently figures for the Tees Valley sub-region are not available prior to the 1997-98 financial year.<br>
7. Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
8. The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
9. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 2 April 2007.<br>

 The DfES does not hold information on academy teaching staff, school leader or principals&#146; salaries as these are matters for academy governors to resolve as independent schools with their principals. We are aware that head teachers&#146; salaries in academies tend to be higher as they expect to recruit experienced head teachers and the challenges they can face are often immense. Sometimes, academy principal salaries are identified in advertisements and in March 2007 there were two academy principal posts currently advertised with identified salaries. These were in Sheffield, which offered a salary of &#163;80,000 and in Darlington, which offered a salary &#147;circa &#163;85,000&#148;.</p>

 During debate on the Education and Inspections Act, we supported the suggestion that local authorities or other third parties might assess applications for school places on behalf of admission authorities in the area, with their agreement. Officials have now met local authorities who expressed an interest in piloting the &#145;admissions administration&#146; approach, and two have taken this interest further and are discussing the idea locally. Limited funding may be available to cover implementation costs, and the Department&#146;s officials have asked for details of what these might be.</p>

 The Department&#146;s current anti-bullying guidance, &#147;Don&#146;t Suffer in Silence&#148;, advises schools to work with pupils to map the places on the school premises where bullying occurs.

The guidance is currently being revised and, as part of that process, we will look at how we might strengthen its advice.</p>

However, should the overall establishment of the Afghan National Police rise from 62,000 to 82,000, as is currently being considered, then the revised establishment of the ABP will increase to 18,000. Presently, the actual number of ABP is approximately 7,900, deployed at 13 official land border crossing points, four international airports (Kabul, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif), and within a Quick Reaction Force and their HQ at the Ministry of Interior. In addition to static security at these fixed locations, they attempt to police at least another 400 unofficial land border crossing points located around the country. While it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on the precise surveillance techniques used at the border crossing points, we are aware this remains an area where the potential for major development exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70417w0012.htm_para10"><a name="07041982002743">Developing the ABP remains one of the top priorities for the GPPO and will also be covered by the proposed European Security and Defence Policy mission to Afghanistan. The UK will continue to keep a keen interest in the ABP's development given its significance in helping to stem the flow of insurgents and weapons through the eastern and southern border areas, as well as the fight against the narcotic trade and other illicit smuggling activities. On the northern border, the UK is contributing to a European Commission project to build border infrastructure and capacity for the Afghan border police and customs in Badakhshan province.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health to what extent residents of <i> (a)</i> state and <i> (b)</i> privately-run care homes who are (i) publicly and (ii) privately or self funded are covered by the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998. [130846]</p>

 A local authority running a care home is under a duty to act in a way which is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as required by section 6 of the Human Rights Act (HRA), 1998 because a local authority is a public authority for the purposes of that section.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="70417w0014.htm_para12"><a name="07041982002841">However, under current case law, the interpretation by of the Court of Appeal of section 6 of the HRA has led to the position that private care homes do not exercise public functions as referred to in that section when providing care and accommodation under contract to a local authority. Such a home is not, therefore, directly subject to the Human Rights Act.</p>

Councils are expected to take account of the relevant aspects of the HRA in their contracting arrangements, including those with care providers. Residents placed in a private care home under a council contract should, therefore, have their human rights protected through the contract.</p>

 Use of medicines is a fundamental component of each of the national service framework (NSF) standards and there are common medicines elements for every standard.

 Predicting the effect of the administration of Tamiflu is dependant on whether or not the unknown virus will be sensitive to Tamiflu, the clinical attack rate, the characteristic complications profile of the as yet unknown virus, the antiviral policy (such as targeted treatment or treating everyone), other interventions, and the effect of antivirals and other interventions on reducing spread. It is not a fixed figure. We use 25 per cent., 35 per cent. and 50 per cent. as our standard raw clinical attack rates for planning purposes because the pandemics of the 20th century had attack rates between 25 per cent. and 35 per cent. in the UK whereas 50 per cent. is the reasonable worst case.</p>

 There are two breeding and supply centres within the European Union that are accepted as suitable sources of non-human primates intended for use in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom, none in the USA, and five outside the European Union. It is not Home Office policy to name overseas supply centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="70417w0018.htm_para2"><a name="07041982003532">The guiding principle applied in appraising overseas breeding and supply centres is that they should meet the relevant standards set out in the Home Office code of practice for the housing and care of animals in designated breeding and supplying establishments at least in respect of animals destined for the United Kingdom. Minor deviations from those standards, such as minor variations in cage heights, may be acceptable provided that they do not have adverse consequences for the welfare of the animals at the centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="70417w0018.htm_para3"><a name="07041982003533">The International Primatological Society (IPS) guidelines for the acquisition, care and breeding of non-human primates are not a set of minimum compliance criteria for supplying animals for use in the United Kingdom. Rather, they are considered to provide guidance on good practice to which all breeders of non-human primates should aspire. Except where they differ from the requirements of the United Kingdom code of practice, Home Office policy is that compliance by overseas centres with the IPS guidelines is generally expected and overseas centres are required to identify any areas in which they do not meet the standards of the IPS guidelines when seeking acceptance as suppliers to the United Kingdom. However, not all of the IPS guidelines are appropriate in all circumstances. For example, providing a fixed light-dark cycle cannot apply where, as is the case in many source countries, animals experience natural daylight/day length throughout the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="70417w0018.htm_para4"><a name="07041982003534">Providing any deviation from the UK code of practice provisions does not have a material adverse effect on animal welfare, centres may be deemed acceptable as overseas sources. On this basis, all of the overseas supply centres currently accepted by the Home Office as suitable sources of non-human primates are judged to have appropriate animal welfare standards, even though they do not comply with every provision of the code of practice and IPS guidelines.</p>

 Those who are refused entry clearance to come to the UK under the new points based system will not have full rights of appeal. In cases where entry clearance is refused, unsuccessful applicants will be able to apply for an administrative review of the refusal. The entry clearance officer&#146;s refusal notice will set out precisely why the decision has been made, referring back to the criteria for which points are awarded. When applying for administrative review the applicant must set out which aspect of the decision, as justified in the refusal letter, was incorrect. Administrative review will provide applicants with a swift and effective remedy where a factual error has been made.</p>
