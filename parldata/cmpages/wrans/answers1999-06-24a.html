To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his oral Statement of 14 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 22-33, on Kosovo, what response he has received from Hashen Thaqi about ending violence in Kosovo.  [87591]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 As the Prime Minister pointed out in his statement to the House on Kosovo on 21 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 761-64, and at the G8 Summit, the KLA has now agreed an undertaking to demilitarise in phases over 90 days, beginning with an immediate ceasefire.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps he is taking to support the gathering of evidence in Kosovo on behalf of the War Crimes Commission.  [87875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We are doing all we can to help ICTY investigate crimes against humanity in Kosovo. A UK Scenes of Crime team has been initially tasked by ICTY to examine sites of two of the worst atrocities thought to have taken place in Kosovo. The UK team was the first such team operating on the ground in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para0">In April, we appointed a UK Kosovo war crimes co-ordinator who is responsible for ensuring that as much information as possible is passed to ICTY that might be relevant to the Tribunal's investigations.
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para1">We have contributed an extra &#163;290,000 this year to ICTY in addition to the UK's assessed contribution of US$5.1 million.

<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para2">These projects appear to be financed by the European Commission from the European Union Budget, line B3-306, Information Programme for European Citizens (Prince).
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para3">The Prince programme exists to stimulate public debate on the EMU. I understand that the Commission gave the European Trades Union Congress (ETUC) 200,000 euro under the Prince programme in 1997. ETUC distributed this money to the national trades union organisations. The money received by the TUC was used to help organise seven conferences aimed at stimulating public debate on the EMU.
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para4">The seminars for consumer organisations were also organised under the Prince programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 17 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>253</i>, which special advisers visited the United States of America on 10 and 11 September 1997; and if he will list the meetings which these special advisers held with members and officials of the US Government during the visit, stating the dates and locations of each meeting and the names of the US ministers and officials at each meeting.  [87414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), as the then President of the Board of Trade met Charlene Barshefsky (US Trade Representative), William Daley (US Commerce Secretary) and Elizabeth Moler (US Deputy Energy Secretary) during her visit to the United States of America in September 1997.

<a name="90624w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the tariffs imposed by the United States on European Union goods as a result of the banana dispute.  [87506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The point at issue in this dispute is the compatibility of the EU's banana import regime with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para5">This regime was revised during 1998 to take account of the earlier adverse WTO rulings, but the WTO Panel ruled on 12 April that the revised regime is still not fully WTO-compliant. In addition, the WTO arbitrator determined that the annual loss to the US from the current regime is $191.4 million. On 19 April, the US was given formal WTO authority to retaliate up to that level.
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para6">The US issued a revised retaliation list on 9 April removing several sectors which had been included on an earlier list. Whilst this scaling down was welcome, we remain acutely aware that many UK businesses are adversely affected by the retaliation still in effect.
<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para7">We are continuing to make representations to the US about the harm which is being caused to UK businesses in the affected sectors.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jun 1999 : Column: 425</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90624w01.htm_para8">We are also continuing to press for the EU to work with the US and other interested parties to achieve an early end to this unnecessary damage to business. We are pressing for further intensive consultations with all the parties involved on the options for reforming the banana regime, in order to make it unambiguously compatible with the WTO.

<a name="90624w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> All matters of security force activity in this area over the period of 12-15 March are the subject of major lines of inquiry for Mr. Port's continuing investigation. It is not, therefore, appropriate to go into detail at this stage. However, he has access to all the available information, in whatever form.

<a name="90624w02.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 9 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>332</i>, on the London River Police, what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i> cost of overtime payments and <i>(b)</i> total cost for the service, over the millennium public holiday, at a strength of (i) 89 and (ii) 101.  [87405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police tells me that all police officers on duty on the millennium public holiday will be entitled to overtime payment for being on duty. It is likely that every officer will be working a 12-hour duty, at an average cost of &#163;297.69 per officer.
<P>

<a name="90624w02.htm_para0">The total cost of the millennium public holiday river policing arrangements, based on a 12-hour duty on 31 December and a 12-hour duty on 1 January, using the same figure will be &#163;595.38 per officer. This gives a total cost of &#163;52,988.82 for 89 officers, and &#163;60,133.38 for 101 officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison Service does not collect centrally information on the time individual prisoners spend confined to their cell.
<P>

<a name="90624w02.htm_para1">Provisional data show that, for the year 1998-99, the average time prisoners were locked in their cells was 13.4 hours on a weekday and 14.7 hours at weekends.
<P>

<a name="90624w02.htm_para2">Within a prison establishment, the period for which individual prisoners or groups of prisoners are unlocked will vary according to a number of factors, including their level on the incentives and earned privileges scheme. Some prisoners may be confined to their cells for most of the day, though usually only for short periods. Reasons for this might include for the maintenance of good order and discipline, because the individual prisoner has declined regime activity or because of operational demands.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's caseworking operation is undergoing major accommodation and organisational changes.

I regret any delays caused by this.

 While I deplore the public disorder at Stonehenge over the summer solstice, I am pleased that specialist staff from English Heritage have ascertained that there has been no structural damage to the monument. The modern perimeter fence was damaged and there was some scuffing and dislodging of lichen caused by those who climbed on the stones. The National Trust has also confirmed that although there were people camping and lighting small fires on its adjoining land within the area of the World Heritage Site, no damage was caused beyond scorching and flattening of grass.

<a name="90624w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mrs. Faith Boardman. She will write to my hon. Friend.
<P>

<a name="90624w03.htm_para2"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Mr. Jim Murphy, dated 23 June 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency Independent Case Examiner.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have answered three of your questions by presenting the information in table format annexed to this letter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Table 1 shows the numbers of staff employed by the Independent Case Examiner (ICE). Senior management grades and the Independent Case Examiner herself are included in the category of investigation staff. The ICE Office began its work on 7 April 1997 but staff were recruited and receiving training from the preceding February.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Table 2 shows the intake of cases for two complete years of operation. It breaks down the number dealt with to those which received a full investigation and those which were rejected. When a complaint is received, the issues are identified and ICE check that 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>24 Jun 1999 : Column: 432</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the case can be accepted. If, for example, the Child Support Agency's complaints procedures have not been exhausted ICE will reject the case.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The rise in figures might at first sight suggest a deterioration in CSA customer service, however, this can be attributed to the legitimately rising workloads coupled with rising awareness of ICE following the launch of the first ICE Annual Report in September 1998 which generated a great deal of media interest and new work. September 1998 was the highest intake for ICE in a single month.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Table 3 gives the average time taken to carry out an investigation and report findings. A process was introduced in 1998/99 which allows appropriate cases to be identified and referred to the Child Support Agency for early resolution of the problem by taking prompt action. Thus negating the need for a full investigation by ICE. One effect of this initiative is to lengthen the average time taken to resolve those complaints where early resolution proved impossible and full investigation was needed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In your fourth question you asked what plans there are to review the role and responsibility of the ICE. The post of Independent Case Examiner is a three year, fee paid, contract with the Department of Social Security, with the possibility of renewal by mutual consent. The three-year period for Mrs Parker does not expire until February 2000. Any announcements about this will be made to Parliament in the normal way.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ICE acts as an impartial referee and conducts investigations into cases where CSA customers feel that they have been badly treated by the Agency. The ICE makes recommendations on redress, whether that takes the form of an apology, or financial compensation, and also makes recommendations on how the Agency might improve its administrative systems for the benefit of customers. The ICE role does not extend to investigating complaints relating to Child Support legislation, or those which have undergone, or are undergoing, investigation by the PCA.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are also certain criteria that need to be satisfied for a complainant to obtain the services of the ICE. The ICE will only take on a case if the Agency's own complaints procedures have been exhausted, and the complainant has received a letter from, or on behalf of, myself in response to their complaint, within the last 6 months.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope you find this helpful.</FONT></UL>

 The Government's response to the joint Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC) and Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) report, "Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine" has today been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90624w04.htm_para5">Following public consultation, the joint HFEA/HGAC report's recommendations included the proposal that consideration be given to regulations under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 to allow research for therapeutic purposes which involved cloning techniques.
<P>

<a name="90624w04.htm_para6">The Government reaffirm their policy that human reproductive cloning is ethically unacceptable and cannot take place in this country. Also, more evidence is needed of the potential benefits to human health before the use of cloning for therapeutic purposes is allowed in research. We recognise that regulations to allow therapeutic research should be very carefully considered. We believe, however, that more evidence is required of the need for such research, its potential benefits and risks and that account should be taken of alternative approaches that might achieve the same ends.
<P>

<a name="90624w04.htm_para7">That is why we have asked the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, to set up and chair an independent expert advisory group to seek the views of a range of experts, both here and abroad, so that we have a clearer idea of the potential benefits of such research for human health.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90624w04.htm_para9">We welcome the HGAC/HFEA report's recognition that the safeguards currently in place are wholly adequate to prevent human reproductive cloning in the United Kingdom, and that the Government's policy of forbidding this practice received support during the public consultation.

 We plan to evaluate fully the effectiveness of the Code of Practice for Age Diversity.

After a competitive tendering exercise, we have commissioned an independent organisation, NOP, to carry out a large scale research project to help evaluate the effectiveness of the Code.
<P>

<a name="90624w05.htm_para3">An employer survey will involve telephone interviews with a random sample of companies employing 10 or more people. The sample will provide a good coverage of different industrial sectors, regions and size of employers. There will also be in-depth case studies in order to explore practices and attitudes towards age discrimination in employment in more detail and to discuss the issues with managers and workers at the establishment.
<P>

<a name="90624w05.htm_para4">In addition, a random sample of older people will be interviewed on their current situation and their employment experiences and on whether they have experienced any employment discrimination on grounds of age.

Two further surveys will be carried out, towards the end of this year and in late Autumn 2000 to measure the impact of the Code. The evaluation will be completed and findings published early in 2001.

 The franchise agreements which govern the provision of service require train operators to provide facilities for the carriage of bicycles, so far as it is practicable for them to do so and subject to the availability of space on their rolling stock. The only five car trains operated by South West Trains are Wessex Electrics on services from London Waterloo to Southampton-Bournemouth, Weymouth and Poole. These

 Wembley's ability to handle large crowds through its public transport infrastructure was central to its successful bid for the new National Stadium.

 The Government's policy toward out-of-town retail development is set out in our Response to the House of Commons Environment Committee report on Shopping Centres [Cmnd 3729], which reaffirmed our commitment to Planning Policy Guidance note 6 (PPG6): Town Centres and Retail Developments. Further clarification of PPG6 was given in answer to a question from my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his Department's latest assessment of trends in rail performance.  [88571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 My Department has today published the latest quarterly Bulletin of Rail Statistics, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90624w07.htm_para8">Comparing the fourth quarter of 1998-99 with the fourth quarter of 1997-98, punctuality fell from 93.3 per cent. to 92.5 per cent. This is an unacceptable decline in performance. At the Rail Summit in February this year, rail companies agreed to improve performance year on year.
<P>

<a name="90624w07.htm_para9">A calculation error made in 1996 means that the figures for national average punctuality have previously been understated. This does not affect the percentage punctuality figures that have been published for individual operating companies. The reliability figures are also unaffected.
<P>

<a name="90624w07.htm_para10">However, current measures, including the corrected figures in this Bulletin, remain misleading. They are derived from Passenger Charter statistics, which do not cover all services and allow operators to disregard days ("void days") on which performance is very bad. The shadow Strategic Rail Authority are currently consulting on an improved measure of punctuality and reliability to be finalised this Autumn.
<P>

<a name="90624w07.htm_para11">Punctuality is just one of a number of factors considered important by passengers. The new National Passenger Survey will ensure that all major passenger concerns will be monitored for each TOC. This will allow precise identification of areas for improvement and give passengers a voice in the running of the railway. First results from the National Passenger Survey will be published by the end of the year.

The then Solicitor-General and I consulted widely, in meetings between May and November 1997, with members of the senior judiciary, the Treasury Solicitor's Department and others who could assist us in reaching a view as to who should be appointed as the next First Treasury Counsel (Common Law).

 If Service personnel must, for operational reasons, approach damaged vehicles, they will visually examine the vehicle to identify if the damage is consistent with depleted uranium calibre ammunition. However, Service personnel are instructed not to approach any damaged vehicles unless operationally necessary, due to the wide variety of dangers they present.

 Since June 1997 I have received letters on six occasions (from three sources) expressing concern about the deteriorating condition of Gwrych Castle. It is privately owned but the ownership is presently subject to legal dispute. When this has been resolved, Cadw:Welsh Historic monuments would be willing to consider grant assistance towards a project to repair the fabric of this Grade 1 listed building.

 I have no plans to publish a monthly list of Government consultation papers. Each Government department and agency is responsible for publishing its own consultation papers, including a summary of proposals and a deadline for submissions. Last year, the Cabinet Office published a guide on conducting written consultation exercises. This states that departments should publicise the existence of consultation documents (for example through an approximately targeted press release), and wherever possible the internet should be used to publish and receive replies.

 The Government have announced an ambitious programme of support for families which will mean that by the end of this Parliament we will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year on our 13.8 million children.
<P>

<a name="90624w10.htm_para1">Families will benefit from the largest ever increase in Child Benefit--an extra &#163;2.50 a week for the eldest child from this April--and further three per cent. real increases for all children from next April. Together with the introduction of the new Children's Tax Credit in April 2001, a family with one child will receive double the support for their child compared to May 1997--&#163;23 a week. We are also targeting extra support on the poorest families through the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and increases in IS. On average, &#163;750 more will be going to each of 5.75 million children in low-income households every year by the end of this Parliament. The WFTC will make 1.5 million families on average &#163;24 a week better off, benefiting three million children. It will provide a guaranteed minimum income of &#163;200 a week (&#163;10,400 a year for a family with someone in full-time work on the National Minimum Wage.
<P>

<a name="90624w10.htm_para2">These measures combined will lift 700,000 children out of poverty. Families with children will, on average, be &#163;740 a year better off.

<a name="90624w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government will not accept the draft directive on Savings in its current form because of its likely impact on our financial markets, particularly the Eurobond market.

 We estimate that 1.4 million families will be eligible for the Working Families Tax Credit in 2000-01, the first full year of operation. These families will on average be &#163;24 a week better off from WFTC alone, or &#163;1,280 a year. Taken together with the reforms to tax, NICs and the largest ever increases in Child Benefit, the WFTC will lift 700,000 children out of poverty.

 No. A differential threshold for service traders would further complicate the VAT system and create uncertainty, thereby increasing compliance costs for business and administrative costs for Government.

However, the Deputy Prime Minister has announced the Government's desire to see the proportion of new homes provided on brown-field sites increased to 60 per cent. over the next ten years. The Government are considering a wide range of measures to help achieve this target. We will study the recommendations of Lord Rogers' Urban Task Force with great interest; and will publish an Urban White Paper later in the year.

<P>
<a name="90624w11.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In his statement to the House of Commons in October 1997, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out five economic tests which will have to be met before any decision to join a successful single currency can be taken. Applying the economic tests, the Government have concluded that there is no realistic prospect of the UK economy having demonstrated, before the end of this Parliament, convergence which is sustainable and settled. Barring any fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances, making a decision, during this Parliament, to join is not realistic. This position was restated by the Prime Minister in a statement to the House of Commons on 23 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 179-84.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w11.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The climate change levy will make a very significant contribution to meeting the Government's legally binding target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set under the Kyoto Protocol, and their domestic goal of a 20 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. The levy will encourage energy efficiency in business and is expected to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="90624w11.htm_para4">The design of the levy reflects closely the recommendations made by Lord Marshall. It will entail no increase in the overall burden of tax on business as revenues will be fully recycled via a 0.5 percentage point cut in the main rate of employer National Insurance Contributions. Business will also benefit from an additional &#163;50 million for schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable sources of energy, like solar and wind power.
<P>

<a name="90624w11.htm_para5">The Government recognise the need for special consideration to be given to the position of energy intensive industries given their energy usage and exposure to international competition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90624w11.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It is the intention that climate change levy should be charged on industrial and commercial use of electricity. The levy will be charged at the point of supply to the final consumer which means that the input to generation will be exempt.
<P>

<a name="90624w11.htm_para7">Combined Heat and Power (CHP) schemes are a form of electricity generation. The Customs and Excise consultation document asked for views on whether they should be treated as conventional generators, by relieving their input fuels and applying the levy to their outputs, or afforded special treatment whereby their input fuels are subject to the levy and the electricity they produced relieved. Officials are currently analysing responses to this exercise.

 <i>[holding answer 14 June 1999]:</i> We encourage emerging markets to carry out capital account liberalisation in a careful and well sequenced manner. However, the use of controls on capital inflows may be justified during transitional periods as emerging markets strengthen the institutional and regulatory environment in their domestic financial systems. Controls on capital outflows may sometimes be necessary in exceptional

<P>

<a name="90624w11.htm_para8">The international financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that the IMF should play a constructive role in helping countries to liberalise their capital accounts in an orderly way. But the IMF should also further refine its analysis of the experience of countries with the use of capital controls.

The Contracting Out (Functions in Relation to Insurance) Order 1998 empowered the Treasury to authorise a third-party--the Financial Services Authority--to carry out most of these functions from 1 January 1999. Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Financial Services and Markets Bill will vest this responsibility with the Financial Services Authority in its own right.

These measures include a fivefold increase in the winter allowance from &#163;20 to &#163;100, the introduction of a Minimum Tax Guarantee which will mean that no-one over 64 will pay income tax unless their income is over &#163;110 a week, and the minimum income guarantee through Income Support which is set at &#163;75 per week for single pensioners from April 1999.
