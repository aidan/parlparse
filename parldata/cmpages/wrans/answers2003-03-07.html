 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2003]:</i> My talks with the Spanish Prime Minister on 27&#150;28 February covered a wide range of issues, foremost of which was Iraq. We discussed the Convention on the Future of Europe, and issued a joint statement on the future institutional framework of the European Union. Gibraltar was also discussed briefly. Copies of the statements agreed at the summit have been placed in the Library of the House. The full texts are also available on the website of the British Embassy in Madrid, www.ukinspain.com.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Whilst security is kept under continual review, especially so following the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, there have been no discussions between the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office to create a combined air and seaports police for the UK.
<P>

<a name="30307w01.html_para0">However, on 19 December last year, and following a Governments led review of aviation security, the Secretary of State for the Department for Transport did announce the development of a capability to place covert, specially trained armed police officers aboard UK civil aircraft.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The need for an armed police presence at Belfast City Airport was identified as part of the continual review of security measures at the Airport. As the airport is located within the wider Belfast Harbour estate, it is right and proper that the Belfast 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2003 : Column 1236W</I><P>
Harbour Police should be included in consultations on how to meet the required level of service. These discussions are currently being taken forward by the airport authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Security at Belfast City Airport is kept under continual review. The need for an armed police presence was identified as part of this on-going process. This measure should be in place in the very near future.

<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McGrady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when broadband telecommunications access will be made available throughout Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement.  [100876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Telecommunications provision is a matter for the private sector. The Government's role is to work with the private sector to encourage the provision of broadband services across Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30307w01.html_para1">To this end the government, through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, is involved in a range of activities including: technology trials and pilot action work under the UK Broadband Fund; a satellite programme in non-ADSL enabled areas; and a flagship call to stimulate broadband applications, content and services.
<P>

<a name="30307w01.html_para2">In addition, the Government is conducting a feasibility study into broadband aggregation in preparing a telecommunications strategy for the region, taking powers to enable it to provide supportive funding; and working on a Local Access Call which is consistent with EU State Aid Requirements. It is also working with the relevant RoI authorities on the preparation of a Call for cross-border telecommunications infrastructure projects with funding from the third EU Integrated Regional Development Programme (Interreg III).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The report of the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Task Forces contained a wide range of recommendations relevant to the work of most Northern Ireland Departments. The Executive provided an initial response in June 2002.
<P>

<a name="30307w01.html_para3">An updated Government response document, detailing progress and planned actions, was provided to the two Task Forces in December and I met and discussed it with them on 23 January. There is regular contact between Departments and the Task Forces liaison group and I plan to meet local representatives again soon to ensure that this momentum is maintained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport to which organisations the proposed Railway Standards and Safety Board will report.  [98338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Office of the Rail Regulator has proposed that the Rail Safety and Standards Board will follow the company limited by guarantee model used for Network Rail and as such will be accountable to its membership drawn from the rail industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Completion dates for Crossrail 1 and 2 would depend on decisions yet to be taken on whether, and if so how, either project should be taken forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how he estimates the demand forecast in the February 2003 South East and East of England Regional Air Services document for Packages 20 and 21 in Annex D would be affected by Packages 6 and 9 in Annex D on the basis of availability of capacity in <i>(a)</i> 2011 and <i>(b)</i> 2024; and how Packages 6 and 9 would affect the Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value of Packages 20 and 21.  [100859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Although not specifically modelled, the impact of one or two additional Gatwick runways (package 6 or package 9) on package 21 (four new runways at Cliffe) would be to lower the economic benefits and financial internal rate of return from investing at Cliffe. Delaying the opening of a new Gatwick runway in package 20 (two runways at Cliffe in 2011 plus a narrow-spaced runway at Gatwick) from 2021 to 2024 reduces the present value of net economic benefits from that package by &#163;180 million; there may also be a small impact on financial returns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_wqn9"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what indications he has received that the Automatic Train Operation System was a contributory factor in the recent Chancery Lane accident on the London Underground; and if he will make a statement. [101321]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, pursuant to his answer of 11 February, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 625&#150;26W, on low-cost airlines, if he will establish rules to provide for compensation for consequential loss to air passengers whose flights are cancelled more than two weeks before departure. [101804]




<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2003 : Column 1238W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Passengers suffering losses as a result of the cancellation of their flight may, if the flight was not part of an ATOL bonded package, seek redress via the courts. Determination of the extent of an airline's liability towards its passengers depends very much on the circumstances of each case, making the establishment of rules on compensation for consequential loss very difficult. The Government therefore does not intend to establish rules but to rely on existing judicial procedures for the settlement of claims.

<P>
<P>

 I have not received any representations from suppliers of powered wheelchairs or powered scooters (both of which are described in law as ''invalid carriages'') about their road safety implications.

 Early warning systems set up by the Food and Agricultural Organisation and operated in collaboration with the Government of Burundi, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF have predicted low output from the September to October 2002 agricultural season. The effect of this low availability of food will be compounded by epidemic disease and by further disruption caused by continued conflict in some areas. Access to the worst-affected areas is limited by insecurity. WFP are planning to distribute food relief.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w02.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Burundi ranks near the bottom of the international league tables in terms of life expectancy. This is due in large measure to the burden of disease, inadequate nutrition, and poor services. Malaria is one of the major causes of death.
<P>

<a name="30307w02.html_para7">In January the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) quoted the Burundi Department of Epidemiology and Statistics as reporting an increased number of malaria cases for the period October to November 2002 in five provinces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w03.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Malawi Government has imported approximately 250,000 tonnes of the national staple grain, maize, for sale to the public with a 50 per cent. subsidy. Substantial imports by private traders from surplus areas in Southern Tanzania and Northern Mozambique are making available maize at prices even

lower than the Government subsidised price. High levels of maize in the national grain reserves could seriously jeopardise the maize market following the expected harvest commencing in April.
<P>

<a name="30307w03.html_para0">My Department's officials in Lilongwe have met with the Government of Malawi, other donors and civil society organisations, and have endorsed the decision to reduce maize stocks. This will limit potential market distortion and reduce the heavy fiscal burden associated with the initial purchases of maize and the subsidy. Maize is being offered at the subsidised price to NGOs for their humanitarian programmes and 50,000 tonnes has been offered to private traders for local sales, to supplement their own imports. The Government of Malawi will increase their Strategic Grain Reserve from 60,000 to 100,000 tonnes. Donor-supported humanitarian programmes continue to provide free grain to more than 25 per cent. of the population.

 The crop estimates issued by the Malawi Ministry of Agriculture at the end of January 2003 suggest a national maize crop of 2.05 million tonnes if the present good rains continue. The harvest will begin in April. Together with additional food from other crops, national self-sufficiency may be achieved this year.

 We contribute to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which is working with national governments to tackle meningitis and other epidemics. In response to the latest meningitis outbreak WHO has provided 500,000 doses of vaccine to Burkina Faso with a further 1 million doses ready to be shipped. Our general assistance to Burkina Faso is provided through multilateral agencies, in particular the EU. Our share of the substantial EU programme is just over &#163;5 million.

 The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down has the remit to provide the United Kingdom and its Armed Forces with safe and effective protection in the event of Chemical or Biological weapons being used against them. Wherever possible, scientists at Dstl Porton Down are developing in-vitro models to replace and reduce the numbers of animals involved. However, to undertake this research effectively necessitates some research involving the use of animals.

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 2003]:</i> Many independent reports have been produced that consider the battlefield effects of using depleted uranium (DU) munitions, but none has found widespread DU contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel. These include work by the US RAND Corporation, the US Institute of Medicine, the Royal Society, the European Commission, the United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The two Royal Society reports on ''The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions'' (2001, 2002) support the Ministry of Defence's view that risks to the health of soldiers on the battlefield are minimal except for a small number of extreme cases.
<P>

<a name="30307w03.html_para8">Under the auspices of the independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board, a test for DU in urine is currently being developed and we aim to make it available to all those who wish to be tested later this year. In parallel with this, we will also carry out an epidemiological study which will examine the link between exposure to DU and health.
<P>

<a name="30307w03.html_para9">No UK troops who served in the Gulf experienced the highest level of DU. However, thirty-three US soldiers were highly exposed when their vehicles were accidentally hit by DU rounds. Consequently, seventeen of them have retained embedded DU shrapnel for the last twelve years. The health of this group is closely monitored by the US Government and so far they do not show signs of health problems attributable to DU.
<P>

<a name="30307w03.html_para10">At the end of August 2001, the World Health Organisation (WHO) despatched a technical team to Baghdad to establish specific projects to explore areas of health concern in Iraq. These discussions, carried out in an atmosphere of full collaboration and co-operation with the Iraqis, culminated in four project proposals covering health surveillance of cancers, health surveillance of congenital malformations and renal diseases, studies to explore health effects of environmental risk factors (including DU) and an implementation plan for cancer control. The WHO sent details of the proposals to the Iraq Ministry of Health in the last quarter of 2001, but a response is still awaited.
<P>

<a name="30307w03.html_para11">Meanwhile, WHO has contracted the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm to complete the first phase of extensive epidemiological studies to investigate environmental factors that may lead to increased incidences of various cancers. The first meeting to schedule and detail the studies has been called for mid-March. The Iraqis will participate in the studies, in full collaboration with these institutes.

 The Ministry of Defence keeps in touch with the United States Administration on possible future developments in missile defence. The United States has undertaken to extend missile defence coverage and make missile defence capabilities available to the United Kingdom, subject to technological developments and our willingness to participate in such a system. This would involve the siting of interceptors in Europe. Decisions on whether the UK should seek to acquire missile defences, and the location and provision of interceptors, are for the future, in the light of the prevailing security circumstances at the time. We have no reason to expect a request to site a missile defence X-band radar in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Defence does not therefore intend to undertake or commission any research into radiation effects.

<a name="30307w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 During the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney several athletes who were subsequently found not to have met the eligibility criteria competed in events for intellectually disabled athletes. As a result the International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) had its membership of the International Paralympic Association (IPC) suspended and athletes with an intellectual disability were not able to compete in IPC events. Membership has since been reinstated. However, athletes with an intellectual disability will remain banned from IPC competitions until such time that the IPC are satisfied with the procedures regarding the eligibility of athletes with an intellectual disability.
<P>

<a name="30307w04.html_para3">In October 2002 the IPC decided on the programme of events for the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens in order to meet deadlines for the organisation of the Games. The INAS-FID were given additional time to continue with the development of a new eligibility system. The IPC recognised that some progress had been made by INAS-FID on a more stringent verification procedure, but other areas such as the development and implementation of protest procedures were still not in line with IPC policy. The IPC felt that these events could not go ahead in a fair manner at the 2004 Paralympics and that there was a risk of ineligible athletes competing. As a result, a final decision was made on 1 February 2003 that events for intellectually disabled athletes would not be included in the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games.

 On 17 February 2003 HM Treasury published a detailed report entitled Meeting the Challenge: Economic reform in Europe. This report updates last year's White Paper Realising Europe's potential, evaluates progress on economic reform and identifies priorities for action in the short and medium term. It also considers the Lisbon process in the light of enlargement. The report finds that there has been clear progress towards the Lisbon goal in a number of areas. Nevertheless, there remains a great deal to be done. Copies of the Treasury report have been placed in the libraries of the House.

As the Review identified, the primary objective must be to make the service more responsive to local needs and better placed to deliver community safety. Moving to a flexible risk-based approach to fire cover, as part of a new integrated risk management planning process, offers a real prospect of reducing the incidence of fire, and deaths and injuries from fire, as well as from other threats to community

Before local arrangements are introduced the views of smokers and non-smokers are sought and any differences resolved by agreement.

In addition to this, many foreign destinations have introduced an increased security policy at ports and airports, which is resulting in delays before the mail enters the recipient country.</FONT></UL>

 Our active labour market policies, delivered by Jobcentre Plus, are helping people move from welfare into work in all parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para3">Since April 2002, Jobcentre Plus has helped over a million people into jobs and, since they started, the New Deals have helped more than three quarters of a million people move from welfare into work.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para4">We are building on this success, providing more help for those who face the greatest barriers to work. Last year, for example, we launched StepUP in 20 pilot areas to provide transitional jobs for long-term unemployed people who have not secured sustained employment through the New Deals.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para5">We have introduced Employment Zones specifically to help long-term unemployed people. These are based in some of the most employment deprived areas in the UK. The 15 Zones have already helped over 30,000 people move into jobs. From October 2003 we are extending the Employment Zone approach to lone parents and New Deal returners in existing Zone areas.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para6">In addition, Action Teams for Jobs are assisting jobless people from a range of disadvantaged groups in the most employment deprived areas of the country. So far, the Teams have helped over 60,000 people move into work. We are enhancing the support provided by Action Teams, investing new funds, worth some &#163;7 million per year, to help them support employment and transport projects that will benefit their local communities.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para7">We are continuing to improve and extend the range of help available to people living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Beginning next year, we will pilot a programme of intensive support for people living in some of those areas that have the highest concentrations of worklessness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Our intention is to provide more consultations and procedures outside hospitals and closer to where patients live. It is for local health communities to consider how their development of primary care services will affect demand for secondary care but the development of new or expanded services in primary care can be funded from the increased resources for primary care trusts which was announced in December 2002.

 No decision has been taken to postpone the transfer of responsibility for commissioning specialised services to primary care trust (PCT) consortia. PCTs have been commissioning specialised services since April 2002 on a collaborative basis via their regional specialised commissioning groups (RSCGs) and their local specialised commissioning groups.

<a name="30307w07.html_wqn8"><B> Ian Lucas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what responsibility is retained by NHS trusts for clinical waste handled by a contractor.  [99557]




<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2003 : Column 1260W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places ''duty of care'' requirements on importers, producers, carriers, keepers, treaters or disposers of ''controlled waste''. As waste producers, National Health Service trusts have responsibility to take all such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to prevent unlawful depositing, handling or disposal of waste; the escape of waste from their control; to ensure the waste is only transferred to authorised persons and that appropriate records are maintained.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para9">Where a NHS trust employs a waste disposal contractor to dispose of its waste it must satisfy itself by a process of monitoring and auditing that the clinical waste collection and disposal process is adequate and complies with appropriate legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_wqn9"><B> Ian Lucas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will make a statement on the procedure for disposing of waste human tissue from the NHS.  [99556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Identifiable human tissue is classified as clinical waste and needs to be dealt with by an authorised waste handling facility. The only appropriate treatment for identifiable human tissue is incineration.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para10">The National Health Service will follow recognised procedures for appropriate segregation and disposal of waste human tissue, as laid down in advice and guidance documentation. NHS Estates has published <i>Safe disposal of clinical waste&#151;whole hospital policy guidance</i> and the Health and Safety Commission has published <i>Safe disposal of clinical waste.</i>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_wqn10"><B> Ian Lucas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will list the current contracts entered into by the NHS for the disposal of waste human tissue; and if he will place the terms of the contracts in the Library.  [99555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. The National Health Service Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) has no national contract in place and so NHS trusts negotiate their own contracts in this area.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para11">Because of this, we are not able to place the terms of these contracts in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30307w07.html_para12">However, in the last 24 months waste management has been highlighted by PASA as an area with significant national spend and supply chain dynamics, suggesting that a national purchasing strategy should be developed. To this end, PASA has produced a procurement guide for total waste management and is working on a common set of terms and conditions for all trusts to use.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_wqn11"><B> Ian Lucas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will make a statement on the judgement in the case of R <i>v.</i> Eurocare Environmental Services Ltd, at Chester Crown Court on 14 February.  [99776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Any breach of the law with regard to clinical waste is a serious matter. We will consider the judgment carefully and identify any further action we should take.

Learning about democratic and political processes is an important part of Citizenship education. Pupils learn about the institutions, issues, problems and practices of our democracy and develop an understanding of the importance of playing an active part in the political process.

The next biennial IEA Ministerial Meeting is planned for the 28 and 29 April but the IEA Governing Board is ready to meet as, and when, circumstances require it to do so. Issue relating to oil stocks were also discussed at the EU Energy Ministerial informal meeting in Thessalonika on 22 February 2003, which I attended.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We expect industry to respond to the framework that we have established and demonstrate they can achieve our goals at an acceptable cost. On that basis, as set out in the Energy White Paper, our aspiration is by 2020 to double renewables' share of electricity generation from our 2010 target and we will pursue policies to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="30307w11.html_para4">The impact on the cost of generation of a 20 per cent. share of renewables in 2020 will depend on the generation costs of the renewables technologies and those of the alternative forms of generation. There would also be additional systems costs as a result of the increase in forms of intermittent generation such as onshore and offshore wind.
<P>

<a name="30307w11.html_para5">A renewables strategy for the decade to 2020 will be elaborated in 2005&#150;06, in the light of progress on the current Renewables Obligation. But if&#151;purely as a working assumption&#151;support were to be provided on the basis of a buyout price of 3p/kWh, as for the current Renewables Obligation, the maximum annual cost to consumers of moving from a 10 per cent. share to 20 per cent. could by 2020 be between &#163;900m and &#163;1.1 billion (assuming additional generation required of between 30 and 35TWh). For a lower buyout price the cost to consumers would be commensurately reduced. Additional annual systems costs could amount to between &#163;140 million and &#163;400 million.

Moreover, women's organisations were included as part of the public consultation that my Department recently undertook on these negotiations and, in February, my officials met again with the Women's National Commission to further discuss GATS issues.

<a name="30307w11.html_para9">BNFL acquired the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC in March 1999 for a total consideration of &#163;641 million (which comprised a mixture of cash and liabilities assumed). This was disclosed in BNFL's annual report and accounts for 1998&#150;99. The acquisition of ABB's nuclear business was completed in April 2000 for &#163;300 million. This transaction is disclosed in BNFL's 1999&#150;00 annual report and accounts and the business has now been fully integrated into the Westinghouse entity. In line with the requirements of the relevant accounting standard BNFL reviewed the carrying value of these acquisitions for potential impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition. There was no evidence of impairment at that stage and there have been no subsequent events or changes in circumstances which might indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

 BNFL operates at several sites in the United States owned by the United States Department of Energy. The company were awarded contracts at the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Plant (AMWTP) and the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) worth circa $850 million and $250 million respectively. The contractual terms at each site are different and the process for claims can also vary. The amount of formal claims BNFL has at any site therefore will vary over time and is subject to continuous negotiation. However the total can represent a reasonable percentage of the contract value and run in to millions of dollars.

 The Government is concerned by increases in the cost of insurance for businesses, particularly Employer's Liability Insurance (ELI). A recent survey of small businesses for the Small Business Survey found that only 2 per cent. of firms spontaneously cited insurance as a major obstacles to the success of the business, although when prompted 27 per cent. of firms said insurance was an obstacle to success. It is difficult to assess the effect on competitiveness of these increases in the cost of insurance. The Government's review of the ELI system, led by the Department for Work and Pension, aims to examine the impact of the current system on employers and make recommendations for change accordingly. It is due to report in Spring 2003; details are available at http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2002/health-safety/eli-review/index.htm.

The European Commission is yet to produce legislative proposals. When it does do, the UK will push for the availability of safer alternatives to be a major factor in determining whether an authorisation is refused for production, import or supply of hazardous chemicals meeting the criteria for authorisation.

 The Department, with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, has convened a working group comprising a wide range of stakeholders, to undertake a fundamental review of policy and practice on non-native species.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am aware of the problems that can be caused by invasive non-native plants such as Japanese knotweed (<i>Fallopia japonica</i>) and Australian swamp stonecrop (<i>Crassula helmsii</i>). The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 provides measures for prohibiting spread of Japanese knotweed, and some other invasive plant species. It is an offence to plant or otherwise cause this species to grow in the wild. Waste containing Japanese knotweed is controlled under the Environment Protection Act 1990. Australian swamp stonecrop is not currently regulated.
<P>

<a name="30307w13.html_para5">The Environment Agency and English Nature, with the Centre for Aquatic Plant Management, produce detailed guidance for landowners and managers on how to control invasive non-native aquatic plant species. The Environment Agency also takes local measures to deal with problem plant species if flood defences are compromised. Similarly, English Nature may take local measures where conservation interests are threatened by these species.

 Defra has already committed some &#163;140,000 for trials into the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans in pelagic trawl fisheries. The trial will be resumed in March in order to refine the system and further assess the grid's effectiveness in protecting dolphins and maintaining fish catch rates. If SMRU's trials are not successful, we will look at other mitigating measures and I do not rule out any approach at this stage&#151;including arguing for EU restrictions on fishing, gear or seasonal closures.
<P>

<a name="30307w13.html_para7">For measures to reduce cetacean bycatch to be effective requires action on the part of all member states involved in the fisheries concerned and the Commission. This is why we raised the need for urgent action by the Commission and other member states at the January Council of Ministers' meeting. I have raised this issue with Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions both in writing and in personal contacts. I have also recently written to the Commission to press for urgent action to widen observer coverage off the South West coast where a number of other Member States' vessels fish. I was pleased that the Commission included a commitment to take action in this area in papers produced as part of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. I am looking for positive action on this in response to our recent approaches.

 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2003]:</i> The EU Pesticides Authorisations Directive (91/414/EEC) requires that pesticide active substances and their relevant metabolites, or breakdown products, should not exceed 0.1 micrograms per litre (0.1mg/L) in groundwater. This 0.1mg/L trigger value is the permitted level for pesticides and their relevant metabolites in drinking water. Its application to groundwater through Directive 91/414/EEC is designed to ensure that groundwater can be used for drinking water without treatment to remove pesticides. 0.1mg/L or 1 part in 10 billion is an extremely low level of contamination which ensures that consumers are protected from the most toxic pesticides.

<a name="30307w14.html_para0">The European Commission adopted a ''guidance document on the assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater of substances regulated under Council Directive 91/414/EEC'' on 26 February 2003. This document will soon be made available on the Commission website at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/ph ps/pro/wrkdoc/index en.htm
<P>

<a name="30307w14.html_para1">The aim is to lay down an approach to the determination of which metabolites are of concern and which are not. The Guidance has the support of all member states except Denmark. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, received a letter from the Danish Environment Minister sent to all EU Ministers for the Environment seeking a Council debate on the document before its adoption. We have received no other recent representations on this issue.
<P>

<a name="30307w14.html_para2">The relevance of the soil metabolites of particular pesticides is considered on a case by case basis using the approach laid down in the Guidance Document. In general metabolites are relevant if they <i>(a)</i> have comparable intrinsic properties to the parent compound or <i>(b)</i> have unacceptable toxicological properties. The conclusions on the relevance of particular metabolites as judged by the Guidance Document will be available in the review report for that compound. However, since the Guidance Document has only recently been adopted, no conclusions have yet been reached.
<P>

<a name="30307w14.html_para3">The limit of 10 micrograms per litre (10 mg/L) on metabolites is not a legal limit. It is a trigger value in the Guidance Document applicable to ''non-relevant metabolites'' or metabolites of lesser concern. If a compound were to give rise to non-relevant metabolites above 10 mg/L then it would not be approved unless there was strong evidence that the metabolite was of no concern.

 <i>[holding answer 27 February 2003]:</i> DDT is a substance which is banned for use as an agricultural pesticide in the European Union under Council Directive 79/117/EEC. However, substances which are not approved in Europe may be used in other countries. Differences in approvals between countries can arise because different approval conditions are applied and because the need for specific pesticides in different countries differs. As far as we are aware, DDT still has public health use in Kenya. The fact that a compound is not approved in Europe does not mean that residues of that compound in imported produce are unsafe or illegal. However, any residues found must not exceed any agreed maximum residue levels set.
<P>

<a name="30307w14.html_para5">The government conducts a wide-ranging annual surveillance programme for pesticide residues in food including imported food. Some 4,000 samples are analysed annually and the programme generates results for over 100,000 pesticide/commodity combinations. All the results are published on a web-site.

 The 15-day restriction applies to vessels using demersal towed gear of at least 100mm or beam trawl gear of at least 80mm in the designated areas. It is for owners to decide what gear they should use in the future, and thus determine how many vessels will be affected in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30307w15.html_para0">However, on the basis of activity during 2002, and excluding vessels that were decommissioned during the year, 807 over 10 metre UK vessels used the three gear types specified in the designated area at some time during the year. The breakdown of the nationality of these vessels is given below.

 Comprehensive records of arrests and convictions for the illegal importation of any meat are not held centrally. Prosecutions for offences relating to bushmeat can be brought under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species by HM Customs, and under the Products of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) (England) Regulations by local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Bushmeat refers to the meat of any wild animal hunted for food. It is not necessarily from endangered species. Bushmeat forms only a very small proportion of reported seizures of illegal meat. Controls on its import arise from both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and from controls imposed to protect animal health. Action against illegal imports is not limited to bushmeat, nor is it targeted solely at Africa.

However, we have always strongly maintained that the Group should remain first and foremost a Central and West African initiative. We have therefore deliberately sought not to initiate or participate too deeply in formal discussions. Our input to the direction taken by the Group and the development of its strategies and solutions is therefore taken forward mainly in the context of our participation in meetings of the Group, such as that taking place in Douala from 26 to 28 March 2003.

The Banner framework principles are now required for cloning research in the UK. This reinforces the Government's view that all animals (whether domestic, farmed or used for scientific purposes) should be kept to the highest possible welfare standards.

<P>
<a name="30307w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Report of the Committee to consider the ethical implications of emerging technologies in the breeding of farm animals (the Banner Report) was published in 1995. The Government has no plans to review its findings. The Farm Animal Welfare Council reported on the welfare implications of cloning farm animals and the Government response to their report was published on 7 August 2002 and is available on the Farm Animal Welfare Council web site www.fawc.org.uk. The Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission published a report on Animals and

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what financial inducements the Government is offering to farmers to farm non-food crops on set-aside land.  [100216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the European Union's Arable Area Payments Scheme, farmers receive a compensatory payment for putting land into set-aside on condition that no agricultural activity or other lucrative use is carried out in the set-aside period. But, in recognition of the fact that non-food crops do not contribute to oversupply of the cereals market, the Scheme does allow a range of such crops, including energy crops, to be grown without loss of the compensatory payment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures her Department is taking to encourage farmers to <i>(a)</i> reduce run-off and <i>(b)</i> store floodwaters on their land.  [99784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30307w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The effects of land use on flood run-off, particularly at catchment scales, are not well understood and Defra has commissioned a research project to review knowledge in this area and develop a clearly targeted programme of further research, which started in January 2003.
<P>

<a name="30307w16.html_para5">This Department is supporting the introduction of Catchment Flood Management Plans (CFMPs) which the Environment Agency is planning to deliver for the whole of England and Wales over the next five to six years. These will consider the impact of future development, land use changes and climate change and

<P><I>7 Mar 2003 : Column 1295W</I><P>
will explore the use of wetlands, washlands and flood storage areas in reducing flood risk to local communities.
<P>

<a name="30307w16.html_para6">The government is currently piloting an Entry Level Scheme aimed at paying farmers for a range of simple, environmentally beneficial management measures across wide areas of the countryside. Due largely to the scientific uncertainties mentioned above, these pilots do not contain measures specifically intended to reduce run-off or to store floodwaters. The main Entry Level Scheme is due to be introduced in 2005, subject to the success of the pilot. It is possible that some water management measures may be included at that stage if they can be scientifically justified and shown to be cost-effective. It will however be important to ensure that they do not result in incidental damage to other environmental interests, such as archaeology.
<P>

<a name="30307w16.html_para7">Many current flood alleviation schemes to reduce flood impact in urban areas rely on flood water storage on farm land. There is no automatic right to payment where land is naturally at risk of flooding and this risk will be reflected in the market price of the land and its pattern of use. Where changes to the flooding regime are made to benefit other areas then landowners/occupiers are entitled to compensation if they suffer any additional loss.

 A transfer of responsibility for critical ordinary watercourses from internal drainage boards and local authorities to the Environment Agency was one proposal considered during the recent review of the administrative and funding arrangements for flood and coastal defence.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2003]:</i> Following the flooding in January, the Environment Agency will be undertaking pre-feasibility studies to identify options for the alleviation of flooding in both Marlow and Medmenham. The Environment Agency have had discussions with residents of Medmenham at a public meeting and has met with Wycombe District Council to determine a joint approach for reducing flood risk in the area.
<P>

<a name="30307w16.html_para8">If the pre-feasibility study identifies a technically, environmentally sustainable and economically viable solution for the flood risk area then a capital scheme may be initiated.

<P>
<a name="30307w17.html_spnew11"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Clauses 81 to 97 of the Criminal Justice Bill sets out a new statutory scheme for admitting evidence of a person's bad character. Clause 81 defines the range of evidence whose admissibility is to be determined under the new rules. It does not follow that any evidence that comes within this definition is admissible. But it does ensure that any such evidence can only be admitted under the Bill's scheme.




<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2003 : Column 1300W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30307w17.html_para10">In terms of admitting evidence, clauses 83 and 84 set out, for non-defendants and defendants respectively, the circumstances in which evidence that falls under clause 81 can be admitted. These ensure that evidence will only be admitted where it will have a clear bearing on the issues in the case.
<P>

<a name="30307w17.html_para11">The scheme includes a number of important safeguards. These include, in the case of defendants, the fact that evidence is to be excluded in appropriate circumstances if admitting it would adversely affect the fairness of proceedings. In applying this test, the courts will weigh the possible prejudicial effect of the evidence against its probative value and exclude the evidence where the likely prejudice would exceed it.
<P>

<a name="30307w17.html_para12">The new rules will therefore assist juries and magistrates to reach proper and fair verdicts by enabling them to hear a wider range of relevant evidence while ensuring that evidence that is likely to be given too much weight or might distort a court's assessment of the issues is excluded.

 The Prison Service outsourced its Information Technology (IT) to Electronic Data Systems (EDS) with effect from 1 July 2000. Under the terms of the 12 year Agreement EDS is responsible for implementing a modern IT and telecommunications infrastructure. The contract also contains provision for IT enabled business change but any such projects are not guaranteed to EDS under its terms. The contract was awarded, following competitive tender, in February 2000.

 All schools and Local Education Authorities in England have previously been made aware that they can access guidance on dealing with terrorism via the UK Resilience website www.ukresilience.info. Many local authorities have also issued guidance to schools in their area to assist in emergency planning.
<P>

<a name="30307w18.html_para0">Government departments and the police are also working together to develop further public information to help people maintain vigilance and prepare for the consequences of terrorist acts. The aim of any agreed activity will be to increase public safety by providing a clear consistent and co-ordinated message. I announced on 3 March that I was setting up a new website www.homeoffice.gov.uk/terrorism on which information of this kind will also be clearly available.

 The Criminal Justice Bill extends the use of review courts from the drug treatment and testing order to the suspended sentence order, with further powers to introduce these for all community sentences in the future. Such courts provide sentencers with the opportunity directly to monitor an offender's progress. Sentencers will also engage closely in the use of all sentences through their representation on the Sentencing Guidelines Council.

<a name="30307w18.html_para3">The need for strong and effective liaison generally between the Probation Service, youth offending teams and the courts is well recognised, and arrangements have been put in place to facilitate and promote joint working practices.

<a name="30307w18.html_para6">The prison population, including the female estate, contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm. Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with other agencies such as the Youth Justice Board, and outside organisations such as Samaritans, is to better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk, with an approach that focuses on staff/prisoner relationships and the physical environment.

<a name="30307w18.html_para7">The Prison Service has a duty of care to all prisoners in its custody, and recognises that self-harm is a particular problem amongst women offenders. The Prison Service is currently developing several interventions that may help female prisoners reduce and manage self-harm in prison. One such example is at Holloway prison, where all prisoners who have been identified as at risk of suicide/self-harm are offered individual crisis counselling. About 40 per cent. of prisoners take up the offer, while others may be referred to alternative sources of help within the prison. Staff report that following counselling women have shown increases in self-esteem, decreases in depression and are less likely to see suicide or self-harm as the solution to their problems.
<P>

<a name="30307w18.html_para8">The Prison Service's suicide prevention and self-harm reduction programme (which applies to all prisoners, regardless of gender and age) includes a series of projects to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; the exchange of information; the care of prisoners; detoxification; prisoners supporting each other, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.

 On 27 February 2003, the Prison Service Pay Review Body, whose remit covers in-charge governors and other operational managers and prison officer and related unified grades, announced its second set of annual recommendations for the remuneration of this group of staff. In making its recommendations, which have been accepted by the Prison Service, it has

taken on board the representations on local pay made to it by the Prison Service, the Prison Governors' Association, the Prison Officers' Association and the Public and Commercial Services Union.
<P>

<a name="30307w19.html_para0">The Pay Review Body accepted the Prison Service's proposals for an increase to the local pay allowance scheme, which is extended to all Prison Service staff in London and the South East. The Pay Review Body has recommended that one of the four levels of the allowance be payable to all staff in these areas from 1 April 2003: &#163;3,800 (relating to central London), &#163;3,000, &#163;2,500 and &#163;1,100. These different levels of payment are made to prisons according to a variety of factors including evidence of recruitment and retention difficulties and the cost of living in the surrounding area. This allowance is paid in addition to the basic pay paid to all Prison Service staff nationally, and the amounts that have been set represent a substantial increase to the rates currently payable under the local pay allowance scheme.

<a name="30307w19.html_para1">A national recruitment campaign for prison officers was run during 2002 and resulted in the appointment of 1,562 new officers. In the last two months, a further 310 new officers were appointed and 116 other grades regraded. Provision for 2,200 training places has been made for the coming financial year. A high profile campaign is currently being run in the London area for prison officers and other continuing campaigns include the East Midlands and the female estate.

 The Prison Service keeps Ministers informed of its progress on improving religious provision for prisoners of all faiths, including Muslims.
<P>

<a name="30307w19.html_para2">In discussion with the Advisory Council on Religion in Prisons, the Service has been devleoping a new grading structure for prison ministers which will allow ministers of all faiths to be employed on an equal footing. All Muslim prisoners have regular access to Imams. In prisons with the largest Muslim populations full-time Imams are now being employed. Eight full-time Imams are now in post and a further six are being recruited.
<P>

<a name="30307w19.html_para3">The Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit (PLSU) is improving education for prisoners so that prisons are better able to respond to the needs of the individual learner. All prisoners, regardless of their cultural background, are already required to have an individual learning plan based on a comprehensive assessment of need, with basic skills given priority. The PLSU is responding to the diverse needs of the prison population by developing a cultural studies programme for prisoners which will focus on aspects such as cultural beliefs and values and prejudice.

<a name="30307w20.html_para0">As part of the review of animal welfare legislation leading to an Animal Welfare Bill we are considering measures to improve existing powers to investigate allegations of cruelty. We are also considering the introduction of more proactive legislation that allows earlier intervention where an animal is being kept in such a way that suffering is inevitable.
