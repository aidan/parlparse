1. There have been changes in the farm type classifications therefore comparison over time is not possible for some categories.<br>
2. Prior to 2000 minor holdings are not included in the figures. From 2000 onwards all holdings are included. A minor holding has to meet all the following conditions:<br>
(a) have a total area of less than six hectares<br>
(b) a labour requirement of less than 100 standard person days<br>
(c) no regular full-time farmer or worker<br>
(d) a glasshouse area of less than 100 square metres<br>
(e) the occupier does not farm another holding<br>
3. The introduction of the Single Payment scheme in 2005 has lead to an increase in the number of registered holdings.<br>

1. There have been changes in the farm type classifications therefore comparison over time is not possible for some categories.<br>
2. In the years 1981 to 1986, some data for the Isles of Scilly was suppressed for confidentiality reasons. These data are not included in the figures.<br>
3. Prior to 2000, minor holdings are not included in the figures. From 2000 onwards, all holdings are included. A minor holding has to meet all the following conditions:<br>
(a) have a total area of less than six hectares<br>
(b) a labour requirement of less than 100 standard person days<br>
(c) no regular full-time farmer or worker.<br>
(d) a glasshouse area of less than 100 square metres<br>
(e) the occupier does not farm another holding.<br>
4. The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 has lead to an increase in the number of registered holdings.<br>

2. In the years 1981 to 1986 some data for the Isles of Scilly were suppressed for confidentiality reasons. These data are not included in the figures.<br>
3. Prior to 2000 minor holdings are not included in the figures. From 2000 onwards all holdings are included. A minor holding has to meet all the following conditions:<br>
(a) have a total area of less than six hectares;<br>
(b) a labour requirement of less than 100 standard person days;<br>
(c) no regular full-time farmer or worker;<br>
(d) a glasshouse area of less than 100 square metres;<br>
(e) the occupier does not farm another holding.<br>
4. The introduction of the single payment scheme in 2005 has lead to an increase in the number of registered holdings.<br>

 We have reviewed the published findings of the Irish Four Areas badger culling trial (which were published in Preventative Veterinary Medicine in January 2005), as well as advice from independent scientists on whether the findings of the Irish research can be applied to the situation in England. The experience in the Republic of Ireland is not directly transferable to England because the badger population, farming practices and general environment are all very different. As a result, while we can learn from the Republic of Ireland&#146;s experiences, directly applying such a policy here is not possible.</p>

 The Department&#146;s regulatory impact assessment (RIA), produced in 2005 to assess the options available for implementing European Union Council Regulation 21/2004, identified that implementation of the double tagging requirements would actually be cheaper than maintaining the national arrangements in place at the time.

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2007]</i>: As a matter of policy MOD does not endorse or sponsor any commercial insurance scheme. The MOD, therefore, leaves the decision on whether to take out personal insurance to the individual as individual needs vary and personal insurance is a complex issue which is increasingly regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The MOD does, however, provide significant financial benefits for attributable death and injury during service. These were improved under the 2005 Armed Forces Pension scheme and Compensation scheme introduced on 6 April 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="70718w0013.htm_para9"><a name="070718106000242">There are two main life insurance schemes available to Service personnel that cover all risks including war and terrorism. Both provide cover to all personnel, regardless of whether they are low or high risk to the insurer. One of these schemes, PAX (which provides personal accident and life cover) is risk blind as the premium is set at a flat rate for all. Whilst premiums under the other scheme, Service Life insurance (SLI), take account of age and smoking history and therefore are not risk blind, they are not loaded for high risk activities and are therefore comparable to those paid by civilians.</p>

 We are deeply concerned at the increasing use of capital punishment in Iran. Last year Iran executed more people than any other country in the world except China (whose population is over 15 times the size). Many of the most basic standards in the application of capital punishment are absent and executions are often carried out in public. Iran is one of a tiny handful of countries that continues to execute juvenile offenders. This abhorrent practice is a clear breach of Iran&#146;s international human rights commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and runs contrary to the moratorium on juvenile executions that Iran announced in 2005.</p>

To this end, the UK fully supports the efforts of the UN Secretary-General and his personal envoy to the western Sahara, Peter van Walsum, to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self determination of the people of western Sahara.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="70718w0016.htm_para4"><a name="070718106000376">The UN Security Council adopted UN Security Council Resolution 1754 on 30 April, which extended the mandate of the UN mission for the referendum in western Sahara. There are no plans for a referendum to be held in the near future. However, the resolution also called for both sides to enter into negotiations without preconditions. The UK welcomes the first round of these talks between the parties, hosted by the UN in Manhasset, New York, on 18-19 June, and the agreement by all parties to take part in a further round in August.</p>

 Supporting families from black and minority ethnic families is a key priority for Sure Start local programmes and children's centres. The Department of Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) allocates grant funding to local authorities and decisions on spending this are taken locally. However we encourage them to take positive steps to provide services specially targeted to meet the needs of black and minority ethnic families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="70718w0019.htm_para0"><a name="070718106002780">A comprehensive national evaluation of the Sure Start programme is being carried out on behalf of DCSF by the Institute for the Study of Children, Families and Social Issues, Birkbeck, University of London. This looks extensively at the experience of ethnic minority communities in Sure Start local programmes and specifically includes an assessment of the impact of Sure Start local programmes on child, family and parental outcomes from which impacts for children and families from different ethnic minority groups can be identified. The national evaluation uses the 2001 census ethnic group classification with results generally focusing on the following groups: White, Mixed Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, Black African and Other. An early assessment of the impact of Sure Start local programmes on children, families and communities published in November 2005 found no significant differences in outcomes for children and families from different ethnic minority groups. The next phase of the longitudinal study of impacts is due to be published in spring 2008 and will include an assessment of impacts of the Sure Start programme for different ethnic minority groups. In addition, a focused study on how Sure Start Local Programmes worked with black and minority ethnic groups that identifies good practice in working with BME groups has also been carried out as part of the national evaluation and is available on the DCSF website at:</p>

 There is a comprehensive national level evaluation of Sure Start in place, which began in January 2001 and will run until 2008. To date, 24 reports have been published, including four published at the end of June. These can be found at:</p>

A number of these studies focus on a specific aspect of work, for example, outreach and home visiting or maternity services, others take a more overarching view such as the reports &#147;Understanding Variations in Effectiveness amongst SSLPs&#148; and &#147;Changes in the Characteristics of SSLP Areas between 2000/01 and 2004/05&#148; that were published last month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="70718w0019.htm_para4"><a name="070718106002786">These studies found that SSLPs were most effective when they implemented the programme well across all areas and that particularly important factors were having robust structures for governance and leadership, a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, and empowerment of providers and users of services. They also found that there had been improvements in Sure Start local programme areas between 2001 and 2005, such as a reduction in the number of children living in workless households that was larger than that for England as a whole, though such changes cannot be directly linked to the work of the Sure Start programme.</p>

A fuller assessment of the impact of Sure Start based on a longitudinal study of children at age three years will be published in spring 2008.</p>

 Climate change will affect the availability of water through levels of rainfall increasing (around the equator and in higher latitudes), decreasing (in mid-latitudes), becoming more variable from year to year and being more extreme (excessive rainfall in wet seasons and longer and more pronounced droughts in dry seasons). This will make provision of water in developing countries, where access to clean water is already extremely low and management of water for agriculture and other activities is weak, even harder.</p>

As the largest donor to the UN&#146;s Special Adaptation Funds, at &#163;20 million, we are already helping developing countries take account of adaptation in their planning. We are improving access to relevant climate data for developing countries to plan on the basis of likely water availability. We are funding research into the best local responses to climate change, including to water supply problems, through our &#163;24 million support to African research institutions, and will do the same in Asia and Latin America. We are making sure our own investments, including in the water sector, take account of the impact of climate change, as part of our on-going climate risk assessment exercise in Bangladesh, China, India and Kenya.

 Stroke&#151;ICD-8 430-438; ICD-9 430-438; ICD-10 I60-I69<br>
All circulatory diseases&#151;ICD-8 390-444.1, 444.4-458.9, 782; ICD-9 390-459; ICD-10 I00-I99<br>

Between 1984 and 1992, a different interpretation of the World Health Organization selection Rule 3 was used to select the underlying cause of death in England and Wales, to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period, and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications for 1984 and 1993-94 (notes 1 and 2) . The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should therefore also be interpreted with caution. Articles specifically examining the effects of the change in classification for circulatory disease and cancer trends were published in Health Statistics Quarterly 22 and Health Statistics Quarterly 23 (notes 3 and 4). More information about these changes, as well as the results of the study, can be found on the National Statistics website at www.statistics.gov.uk/icd10mortality.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Data are for deaths registered in each calendar year between 1977 and 1992, and occurrences of death in each calendar year from 1993 onwards.<br>

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neuro developmental disorder characterised by core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are outside the range of normal for the developmental stage of the person and cause impairment in functioning and was first described in 1902. Diagnosis is based on recognising these behavioural traits and making a judgment as to whether they are outside the range of normal. The traits are present in people without ADHD, and lie along a continuum. There is no diagnostic test as yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="70718w0025.htm_para4"><a name="0707193000488">ADHD is similar to other conditions where there is not yet a biological marker and symptoms are on a continuum, such as blood pressure and height. There is evidence of genetic and environmental components to the aetiology of ADHD and it is highly heritable but the inheritance is complex and likely to be due to a combination of genes acting together. Molecular genetics shows the relationship between various markers of ADHD and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter genes.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will provide the data behind the statement made by the Chief Executive of the NHS on page nine of his Annual Report 2006-07, published on 21 June 2007, that the NHS has been in underlying deficit for the last 20 years. [147566]</p>

 The statement was based on a combination of available data but also knowledge about the way in which we know national health service organisations have previously been able to mask the existence, or extent, of deficits prior to the transparency we have brought in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="70718w0028.htm_para0"><a name="0707193000768">We know, from audited summarised accounts, that in 11 out of the last 20 years the NHS recorded a bottom line net deficit, ending 2005-06 with a net deficit of &#163;547 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="70718w0028.htm_para1"><a name="0707193000769">We also know that, throughout this time, a number of factors may have worked to mask the existence or extent of the deficit. For example, prior to 2001-02, when the NHS operated under a cash financing regime based on annual allocations and in-year cash injections, the payment of bills could be delayed to deliver in-year spending controls and manage the financial outturn. Following the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting rules, the NHS developed the practice of using capital resources to support current revenue expenditure and were allowed to move money round the system by way of brokerage and other forms of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="70718w0028.htm_para2"><a name="0707193000770">On this basis, it is reasonable to conclude that the NHS has been in underlying deficit for the last 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="70718w0028.htm_para3"><a name="0707193000771">However, the introduction of a stronger, fairer and more transparent financial regime, coupled with a renewed emphasis on performance management, has enabled the NHS to end 2006-07 in its strongest financial position for many years, to tackle underlying deficits, and to establish a firm and sustainable financial position for 2007-08 and beyond.</p>

 The information requested is not held centrally. All national health service wheelchair services are funded out of general allocation funding to primary care trusts. It is up to individual PCTs to determine their allocation of resources to wheelchair services and to set their own eligibility criteria for their service. Decisions about the type of wheelchair provided to an individual will be based on an individual assessment of their needs and the PCTs eligibility criteria.</p>
