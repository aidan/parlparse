To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement about the future of the community of the tenants of the Walworth Church Commissioners estate in Southwark.  [160749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend will know, the Church Commissioners are consulting widely with interested parties over future letting policy in respect of a number of their residential estates, including that at Walworth in south London. The proposals forming the basis of consultation are, first, that the Commissioners will carry out a programme of improvements to the estates, and secondly, that over time, and for new tenants only, they will move to a mixture of affordable and market rents with the former being offered in future to key public service providers working in the local community.
<P>

<a name="10510w01.html_para0">That consultation is still in progress and includes seeking the views of residents groups, including the newly formed residents association on the Walworth estate. We have presented the proposals to some members of the association's committee and have been invited to give the same presentation at the inaugural meeting of the association on 15 May.
<P>

<a name="10510w01.html_para1">No decision will be taken until consultation has been concluded and the Commissioners have had a chance to consider the views of those affected by and close to the proposals.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell), representing the Church Commissioners, what the average rent level in tenancies is in the Walworth Church Commissioners estate in Southwark; and what assessment he has made of the average market rent levels in the Walworth area.  [160748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Properties at the Church Commissioners Walworth estate are let on a mixture of fair rents and assured tenancies, the former being applicable in the case of Rent Act tenancies granted before 1988.
<P>

<a name="10510w01.html_para2">The average rent levels (as at 4 May 2001) on the Commissioners Walworth estate in both cases, as compared with the equivalent estimated market rental values, are set out as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the procedure whereby military equipment which has become surplus to requirements is listed and described in order to give museums an opportunity to bid for the items, indicating when the existing procedure was instituted, how many artefacts have been so advertised to museums and how many bids have been <i>(a)</i> received and <i>(b)</i> accepted; and what changes are planned in the procedure.  [160350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There are established procedures, introduced in March 1999, for the six principal service museums, the regimental and corps museums, the Imperial war museum, the science museum, the national maritime museum and museums sponsored by local authorities that have a clear defence interest allowing them to identify equipment that they may wish to acquire. If equipment identified is declared as surplus and gifting or loan is not an option, museums are invited to bid by the Disposal Services Agency (DSA) by means of competitive tender. Currently the DSA has 76 museums on their database covering interests such as aircraft and armoured vehicles. There are no changes planned in the procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much has been spent in each year since 1990 on upgrading the communications monitoring bases at <i>(a)</i> Menwith Hill and <i>(b)</i> Fylingdales; and from what budget line the money has been drawn.  [160711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 RAF Menwith Hill is an integral part of a worldwide communications network, which supports UK, US and NATO interests. Information on detailed operations at RAF Menwith Hill, including funding issues, is withheld under exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information on the ground of national security.
<P>

<a name="10510w01.html_para10">The primary function of RAF Fylingdales is to provide the UK and US with early warning of a ballistic missile launch. It is not a communications monitoring base. The last upgrade of the early warning facilities took place in the early 1990s when the old "golf balls", which had become obsolete and difficult to maintain, were replaced with a modern solid state phased array radar. The UK Government contributed a total of &#163;48 million to the costs of this upgrade, from the headquarters Strike Command budget. A yearly breakdown of this figure does not exist.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally. Due to the wide range of defence applications which rely on the deployment of assets in space, it would be extremely difficult to derive the required information and, were it to be attempted, it could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

[160812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We are aware of the report and await the US Department of Defense response to it. The outer space treaty places important limitations on military activity in space without entirely prohibiting it. We do not want to see a general prohibition on military use of space because, for example, as confirmed in the Strategic Defence Review, we perceive a continuing needs for secure satellite communications for the armed forces. We do not support the further consideration of the use of outer space by the conference on disarmament in Geneva.

<a name="10510w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Government are committed to equality of opportunity and to increasing the diversity of those appointed to public bodies. Consistent with this, there are no age limits on appointments made to public bodies sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, other than to the advisory committee on conscientious objectors. Appointments to this body are part-time judicial posts, appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and therefore abide by the Lord Chancellor's Department's general policy of normally considering for appointment only those aged between 35 and 62. The upper limit is set to take account of the retirement age for judicial office holders, which for part-time office holders is 65.

<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what baseline data are being used for monitoring purposes for each of the genetically modified trial test sites at Mathry, Pembrokeshire;  [157572]
<P>
<UL>(2) what period elapsed between the baseline assessment date and subsequent assessment of the sites for genetically modified farmscale trials at Mathry, Pembrokeshire.  [157573]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The design of the farmscale evaluations experiment does not require a pre-experiment assessment of baseline data other than pre-sowing seed sampling, which gives an indication of the potential for weeds to grow in the field. This is because the experiment is designed to compare effects of herbicide use between the two sides of each experimental field. One half is randomly selected and planted with the GM crop, while the other half is planted with the non-GM equivalent crop. This design allows for the effects of the herbicides on wildlife in the two halves of the field to be assessed more accurately than would be possible by comparison with wildlife in the crop before the start of the experiment.
<P>

<a name="10510w02.html_para2">The purpose of the farmscale evaluations is to examine whether there are any differences in the diversity and abundance of farmland wildlife associated with the use of GM herbicide tolerant crops with the herbicides to which they are tolerant, as compared with equivalent non-GM crops. We are also measuring the effects of geneflow. The wildlife found in crop fields is affected by factors such as the vegetation and crop type. Wildlife present in the bare field before sowing or in a previous, different, crop the 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 2001 : Column: 254W</I><P>
year before will not be the same as that to be expected in the experimental crop. Measurements of differences in wildlife between a pre-trial audit and within the experimental crop during the experiment would therefore not allow the effects of the herbicide to be measured.

<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the impact on United Kingdom honey production of GM crops.  [158504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Only extremely small amounts of GM pollen (less than one part per million) might arise in honey as a result of the present plantings of GM crops. This is considerably below the 1 per cent. threshold for labelling produce as containing GM material set out in the Novel Foods Regulations. The pollen from these particular crops has also been determined by Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment not to harm bees. Therefore, we believe that the current cultivation of GM crops should not affect honey production any more than conventional farming.
<P>

<a name="10510w02.html_para3">However, I am aware that some retailers have asked their honey suppliers to move hives away from GM crop trial sites and this may have an impact on production. There is therefore an important issue of liability for any damage to another farmer's, or in this case, beekeeper's ability to sell his produce. I believe that we need a liability provision in law whereby a GM farmer or any other type of farmer is made statutorily liable for any damage caused to neighbouring farmers or producers. We are working on a range of options for possible liability provisions of this type, in respect of any damage from GM crops. In the meantime, an individual who has suffered loss may be able to commence an action in the courts. Each case will turn on its own facts and the question of who is liable will be determined in the light of all the circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what steps he has taken to implement the inspector's recommendation at the public inquiry into the Birmingham northern relief road that the Lichfield and Hatherton canal restoration should not be compromised by the toll motorway;  [160126]

<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's decision on the inspectors report into the Birmingham northern relief road (BNRR) scheme was published on 27 July 1997. That letter placed obligations on the concessionaire, Midland Expressway Ltd. (MEL), in respect of the Lichfield and Hatherton canals. MEL is required to facilitate the full restoration works for the canals, waiving any consequential loss of tolls that these works may occasion. MEL is also required to provide, at its expense, the foundations for an aqueduct to carry the Lichfield canal over the BNRR and a pipe for an interim supply if the Lichfield and Hatherton canals restoration trust considers this necessary. MEL will meet these obligations in full.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2001]:</i> In recognition of the size of the London Underground PPPs and the potential for alternative funding sources, the financial analysis of the PPP bids is based around a number of different scenarios, including ones that allow for a public sector bond-financed London Underground. Where appropriate, an adjustment representing the "reputational externality" is included in some of these scenarios. This is designed to capture the impact additional public sector borrowing would have on the Government's reputation for prudence and therefore on the risk premium demanded on sterling-denominated securities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations Transport for London has made on the policy of preferred bidder status in relation to the London Underground; what control Transport for London will have over the preferred bidder when London Underground comes under the responsibility of the London Mayor; what aspects agreed prior to the transfer will be the sole responsibility of the contractor; and if he will make a statement.  [160801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I understand that Bob Kiley, Commissioner of Transport for London, wrote to Sir Malcolm Bates, then chairman of London Transport, on 27 April 2001 giving TFL's views on LT's proposed decision to select preferred bidders for the two deep tube PPP competitions. On 2 May, the LT board--after giving full and proper consideration to TFL's views--selected preferred bidders for these contracts. The preferred bidder for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly Lines infrastructure company is Tube Lines. The preferred bidder for the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria Lines infrastructure company is Metronet.
<P>

<a name="10510w02.html_para5">On 4 May, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he had reached agreement with Bob Kiley on a way forward which will provide a secure basis for progressing the PPP. As a result of this agreement, Mr. Kiley will be appointed LT chairman and will lead negotiations with the bidders aimed at finding a way to meet his concerns on unified management within the framework of the PPP and the current procurement. The way forward protects the key objectives of achieving safety and value for money. The details of this agreement are set out in a memorandum of agreement, a copy of which has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="10510w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the preferred bidder for London Underground and the public sector comparator; if the preferred bidder has been informed that the comparator must be favourable when the bid is assessed; what information is being given to the preferred bidder about 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 2001 : Column: 256W</I><P>
the terms of the comparator; when it is expected to make the terms of the comparator public; and what his policy is in the event that the bidder receives an unfavourable assessment under the comparator.  [160800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The PPPs for London Underground are about delivering best value for both tube passengers and taxpayers. As such, we expect the LT board to sign PPP contracts only if they are satisfied that they represent value for money. They will be guided in this decision by the results of a rigorously designed and constructed public sector comparator. This has been made clear to both the preferred bidders for the deep-tube contracts.
<P>

<a name="10510w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Paragraph 6 of schedule 7 will insert a new section 34A into the Road Traffic Act 1988. This will enable a defence to a charge of driving a vehicle on certain classes of rights of way and land not forming part of a road, brought under section 34 of the 1988 Act (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000), to be raised in limited circumstances. The effect of section 34A will be to restrict those who can put forward evidence to rebut a presumption created by section 34 that the right of way shown on the definitive map carries only the rights applicable to that class of way.
<P>

<a name="10510w03.html_para4">Provision has been made in section 34A for regulations to be made specifying additional circumstances in which such evidence can be put forward. We hope to consult on proposals for such regulations later this year.

 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions manages a number of relevant funding streams, which I outline below. However, it should be noted that in all cases individual applications for funding will be judged on their own merits, and there are no DETR programmes which will guarantee support to particular organisations or projects.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para0">The neighbourhood renewal community chests programme (&#163;50 million over three years) will provide small grants to formal and informal local community groups in the 88 most deprived areas of England to support community self-help and mutual support activity. Introductory information has recently been published in the consultation document on funding community groups produced by the active community unit in the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para1">The community empowerment fund (&#163;36 million over three years) will support community and voluntary sector involvement in local strategic partnerships (LSPs) in the 88 most deprived areas of England. Introductory information has been published by DETR as an annex to the LSP guidance.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para2">National sports bodies would not be eligible for funding through either of these programmes.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para3">The new deal for communities programme (&#163;1.97 billion over 10 years) makes funding available to support regeneration in some of the poorest neighbourhoods in the country. Projects to invest in local community centres and sporting facilities have featured in many of the partnerships' plans for turning around their neighbourhoods, and partnerships should also engage with all the relevant local organisations, including community groups and sports clubs.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para4">The single regeneration budget (SRB) programme (&#163;5.6 billion covering six rounds) could help the area or local branch of a national sports body with the costs of, for instance, setting up a local training facility that would benefit members of the local community. Local clubs and communities could also be eligible for funding through the SRB programme.
<P>

<a name="10510w04.html_para5">The European regional development fund (ERDF)--which is concerned primarily with economic regeneration--could also provide limited funding for local clubs and communities in relevant areas for capacity building projects, provided sports facilities could demonstrate a wider benefit (for instance, boosting local tourism) and therefore be considered good value. Details of local and regional programmes can be obtained from the Government offices for the regions.

<P>
<a name="10510w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No. In the interests of safety and the free flow of traffic, it is essential to make severe restrictions on the number of motorway accesses. All accesses allowed to motorways must be by strategically located fully designed grade-separated junctions--normally from other trunk roads, major local roads, motorway service areas, or maintenance compounds. Exceptionally, accesses can be provided for other major transport interchanges such as airports.

<a name="10510w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Minister for Energy asked Ofgen to undertake a review of the initial impact of NETA on smaller generators based on its first two months of live operation. I have made clear to the chief executive of Ofgen the importance which I attach to an early and successful outcome to the review, so that the concerns which CHP generators are expressing about the impact of NETA are thoroughly addressed. CHP has significant environmental benefits, and we need to ensure that its full potential can still be realised within the context of NETA. As part of the CHP strategy, which we will issue for consultation later this year, we will also examine other ways of ensuring that our target of 10,000MW of installed CHP capacity is met by 2010.

[160799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have not updated the general costs per tonne of carbon saved that were included in the 1998 climate change consultation paper. We produced a qualitative assessment of the costs and benefits in the UK's climate change programme that was published in November 2000. The Government will consider whether it is possible to re-assess the costs per tonne of carbon saved from each policy in the future, as part of the formal evaluation of the climate change programme in 2004-05. The results of this evaluation will be published.




<P>
<P><I>10 May 2001 : Column: 265W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10510w05.html_para0">The climate change programme included estimated carbon savings for all those policies for which savings could be quantified. We estimate that delivery of the Government's target to provide 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewable energy, as against around 5 per cent. that might otherwise have been achieved, could bring savings of 2.5 MtC in 2010. Extensive discussions about the potential costs and benefits of domestic energy efficiency confirmed that a range of simple measures could save up to 2.7-3.8 MtC per year by 2010. The UK's current CHP capacity of around 4,700 MWe is estimated to save around 4 MtC per year. The carbon savings from increased use of CHP are reflected within those for a range of other policies within the programme, particularly the climate change levy, climate change agreements and community heating.

<P>

<a name="10510w05.html_para1">The genetically modified (GM) maize in the farm-scale evaluation programme is known as T25 maize (consent reference number--C/F/95/12/07).

 We welcome this judgment.

The House of Lords today unanimously upheld the Secretary of State's role under the planning Acts and have found no breach of article 6 of the european convention on human rights. They found that there is no incompatibility between the Secretary of State being responsible for formulating planning policy as well as for taking decisions in individual cases. He is democratically accountable to Parliament and, through the process of judicial review, to the courts. They found that article 6 is satisfied. Planning cases in the pipeline will continue to be handled in the normal way.

The report has been compiled jointly by the agency and the Health and Safety Executive. It advises that, while no form of contamination has been found off-site that might be hazardous to human health or the environment and there is no risk to the food chain, some local residents have reported symptoms some time after the fire. The report also confirms that the investigation by the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive into criminal offences that may have been committed is on-going.

 In January 1997, 1,790 early education places for three and four-year-olds were taken up in the Slough local education authority area. By January 2000, this had increased to 2,434.

There was a slight decline in the year to January 2000 but we have yet to receive the figure for January 2001. Furthermore, 1,130 out of school places in both group-based care and with child minders are planned to be created between April 2001 and March 2004. Data for January 2001 are not yet available.

 Key stage 2 test results are analysed and reported in terms of levels of a pupil's attainment rather than as marks or percentages. The marks from which the levels are derived are not appropriate for comparisons over time, because of the variations in the tests. National curriculum levels are set in a way that aims to ensure consistency of standards over time and therefore provide a sound basis for such comparisons.

Therefore, information is not available on the area of residence of pupils in independent schools and which local education authority would be responsible for them. Areas have different densities of independent schools which would lead to an over estimate of the proportion of pupils in independent schools in some areas.

Although capital funding has not been provided for an additional infant classroom at Sundorne infants, I understand that remodelling of existing accommodation has enabled the school to extend its nursery unit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what the average amount of money allocated to each pupil from the music standards fund is in the current year;  [159189]

(3) what formula was used to determine the allocation to local education authorities from the music standards fund for 2001-02.  [159188]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w07.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Until last year, the music standards fund was based on a system that allowed LEAs to bid for funding. From this year, LEAs will be allocated funding on a formula based on a free school meals deprivation factor. We expect &#163;10 million of the Government's contribution to be matched equally by LEAs. The matched funding was frozen at 2000-01 levels so that no LEA should pay more in matched funding, and no LEA would receive less grant for music than in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="10510w07.html_para5">The Government's grant of &#163;50 million is broken down in two ways; &#163;25 million was allocated based on the number of schools (primary, secondary, special and PRU) in each LEA, ie the &#163;25 million was divided by the total number of schools in all the LEAs and distributed to each LEA pro rata. The remaining &#163;25 million was allocated according to the full-time equivalent (FTE) number of pupils in those schools multiplied by the mean free school meals FSM percentage for each LEA.
<P>

<a name="10510w07.html_para6">Based on this formula, if the allocation to an LEA is lower than previously, we would protect the allocation based on last year's figures. In the case of Berkshire, all the unitary authorities received protected funding, as their allocations calculated by need would have been lower than their previous bids.
<P>

<a name="10510w07.html_para7">The overall amount per full-time equivalent (FTE) pupil in England is &#163;7.86. The table sets out the music standards fund allocations and the amount per FTE for the Berkshire unitary authorities:

 When this Government came to power, public sector net investment was equal to 0.5 per cent. of national income. The plans set out in the 2000 Spending Review will increase net investment to 1.7 per cent. of GDP by 2003-04. This Government are turning around 20 years of under-investment to modernise our public services.

 In late April the Government announced a consultation on two new proposals to encourage saving and the build up of assets, the Saving Gateway and the Child Trust Fund. The Child Trust Fund would benefit each of the 700,000 or more children born every year. The scheme would allow parents, grandparents, friends and children themselves to make additional contributions, so providing families with a safe and secure account to save towards their children's future. The Child Trust Fund would provide all young people beginning their adult life with the advantage that owning financial assets brings.
<P>

<a name="10510w10.html_para0">The cost of the scheme would depend on the level of the endowment and other aspects of its design, details on which the Government are consulting. But cost- effectiveness will be a key consideration as the Government develop this proposal in the light of consultation.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The landfill site at Fosterville, Newton Abbot was made available from 30 March 2001 to accept uninfected carcases from the livestock welfare disposal scheme. Carcases from animals taken for disease control purposes rather than under the welfare scheme are not being sent to Fosterville. 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 2001 : Column: 289W</I><P>
As of 23 April 2001 the site had accepted 34,540 carcases from the scheme. The site can accept approximately 200 tonnes of carcases per day. It is anticipated that use of Fosterville is likely to continue until the scheme is no longer necessary.
<P>

<a name="10510w11.html_para6">MAFF does not approve individual movements of livestock carcases under the livestock welfare disposal scheme. The Intervention Board is responsible for administering this scheme and directs carcases to disposal sites in order to maximise the use of available resources such as abattoirs and disposal sites at any one time, taking account of policy guidelines.
<P>

<a name="10510w11.html_para7">As far as possible, the objective of the authorities responsible for the disposal arrangements is to ensure that carcases are not transported from a higher risk area to a lower risk area. However factors such as the location of abattoirs and landfill sites mean this is not possible in all circumstances. We recognise that this is a matter of general concern, and has been raised a number of times. Veterinary advice is that the risk of spreading the disease through transporting welfare carcases from infected areas to non-infected areas is low when proper protocols are followed on veterinary inspection before slaughter, transportation and disposal.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The export ban was introduced on 21 February. Before that, movement restrictions had been placed around all of the known cases of the disease, starting with the first suspected case in an Essex abattoir on 19 February.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w11.html_spnew19"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Epidemiological investigations into the outbreak are considering all possible routes of spread. Farmers have been issued with a wide range of advice and guidance on managing contacts with other people. With regard to (i) farmers should limit contact with other keepers of livestock. However, if there is contact then they are advised to disinfect footwear, change clothes and wash with hot water and soap, including hair, before going near their own animals. Any item or object that may have had contact with disease should also be disinfected.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The only animals more than 3 km from infected premises which are being slaughtered under current foot and mouth disease control measures are animals which are dangerous contacts--that is, susceptible animals known to have been in contact with animals that have had the disease, or with personnel, vehicles and equipment which has been in contact with such animals. Exempting such dangerous contacts because they are organic stock or are from rare breeds would involve an unacceptable risk of disease transmission.

 <i>[holding answer 27 April 2001]:</i> On investigation for foot and mouth disease, a veterinary inspector in the field contacts a Veterinary Adviser at the Emergency Control Centre in Page street, London to discuss the individual case. The Veterinary Adviser will discuss the case with the Veterinary Manager of the Centre or a VA supervisor appointed by him. Centre managers are veterinary members of the senior civil service or unified grade 6. Veterinary Supervisors appointed by them are at veterinary grade 7 or equivalent. All these grades are staffed by experienced and qualified veterinary surgeons. The case is then either confirmed or negated on clinical grounds or the option of "slaughter on suspicion of disease" is followed.

<a name="10510w11.html_para12">At the peak of the outbreak in late March/early April, in order to reduce delays in confirmation, those veterinary advisers who were experienced were given the authority to confirm or negate cases if need be without referral to the manager, though working under supervision. In practice about two thirds of the cases were still discussed before a decision was taken. As soon as the situation eased somewhat centre managers reverted to the standard process of confirmation of cases after discussion with a veterinary manager.

 We have not received any evidence relating to the effectiveness of Borax as a treatment for foot and mouth disease, nor have we received any scientific evidence to demonstrate its efficacy, safety or quality. In the absence of such evidence which would be required before Borax could be authorised as a veterinary medicinal product, claims that it is effective in preventing foot and mouth disease would be incompatible with the requirements of the Marketing Authorisations for Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulations 1994 as amended.

 The two are not directly comparable. When livestock are slaughtered for disease control purposes, compensation is paid at market value.

This includes guidance on the construction and siting of pyres which takes account of the possible risks to health from the emissions of air pollutants from the pyres At the beginning of the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Environment Agency issued a joint statement which advised that pyres should be constructed as set out in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food "Air Code". The code contains detailed advice on the materials to be used for the construction of pyres.

<a name="10510w12.html_para4">Air quality monitoring has been undertaken at Sennybridge in Wales, and Holsworthy, Chumleigh and Okehampton in Devon. A limited survey was also undertaken around one pyre in Allerdale, Cumbria. At all sites, measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and particles have been made, and found to be generally low. At Sennybridge, Holsworthy, Okehampton and Allerdale monitoring for polyaromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls has also been carried out. Dioxin concentrations in air have been reported by Powys county council, measured in the vicinity of the pyre at Sennybridge, and Allerdale district council in the vicinity of the Allerdale pyre. At these sites dioxin concentrations in air, measured at locations between 1 km and 2 km from the pyres, ranged between 2.57-8.16 fg/m <sup>3</sup>  I-TEQ.

 The first stage of the review of Forest Enterprise has concluded that the agency has put in a strong performance on the sustainability of its forest management, has successfully involved communities and other stakeholders in its decision-making and has responded successfully to change--particularly devolution. The review has recommended that Forest Enterprise should retain its status as an executive agency of the Forestry Commission. Ministers in the UK Government, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales have accepted these conclusions and recommendations. They intend to review the options for further decentralising handling of forestry policy and management, in the light of continuing experience of the devolved structure. The report of the first stage of the review is available on the Forestry Commission's website and will be placed in the Library.

 The Government aim to provide a substantive response to Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) applications within 20 working days, except in special circumstances. The targets are set out in a Service and Performance Code published by the Export Control Organisation (ECO), and information on performance against these targets is set out in the Government's annual reports on Strategic Export Controls. In 2000, the Government processed 57 per cent. of SIEL applications within 20 working days. Within the

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w15.html_spnew0"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Current practice is for frequency channels comprising 8MHz which provide a single analogue terrestrial service, or one digital multiplex carrying multiple programme services. I understand from the Independent Television Commission that it is unlikely to be feasible to employ channels of only 2MHz because transmissions would not be compatible with current European transmission standards and no existing digital television receivers would be capable of receiving such transmissions, in addition to other technical constraints. In planning for the transition from analogue to digital television the Government will consider all potential uses of spectrum. A post-switchover plan will be developed providing a clearer indication of the long-term prospects for local television.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 As we announced in "Opportunities for All in a World of Change", the Government's aim is for the UK to have the most dynamic, high quality and competitive market for digital TV in the G7, as measured by take-up, choice and cost.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para0">The benefits of digital television are wide-reaching: it provides better picture and sound quality, enables an increased choice of programmes, both free-to-view and paid for, and can deliver new kinds of interactive broadcast services such as home shopping and home banking. Furthermore, while universal access to the internet, which is an essential objective for the Government, is not dependent on digital television, we strongly believe that the take-up of digital television does offer a valuable opportunity for many who may not otherwise seek to do so, to have access to the internet through the use of a familiar technology.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para1">We are now the world leaders in the take-up of digital television with nearly 30 per cent. of households already enjoying the benefits of digital viewing.

Telewest having over one million digital customers. More than one million households have already decided to receive digital television through the terrestrial platform which requires relatively little receiving equipment and is likely to be the means by which many will continue to expect to receive their television services in the foreseeable future.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para2">Everyday more homes move to digital but we are well aware that a significant number remain to be convinced of the benefits of making the switch. This is the reason why a number of important initiatives have been put in place recently, with the co-operation of the broadcasting industry and of the ITC, to promote the development of digital television in the UK. These initiatives are in the following areas: extension of coverage; information for consumers and research on their needs and expectations; and involvement of the stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para3">Government Departments and agencies are doing all that it is possible within the framework of international spectrum management arrangements to maximise the coverage of digital. We understand that the work on the equalisation of coverage across all six multiplexes--the "core coverage"--is well advanced. We have recently written to digital broadcasters, seeking their commitment to ITC plans to double the power on eight key transmitters, allowing improvement to the signal quality, giving better, more reliable reception of free-to-air and subscription services.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para4">The involvement of the digital broadcasting industry is important in all areas: we will continue to meet all the stakeholders and ensure that the fair competition between them leads to an enterprising and consumer-friendly environment.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para5">We intend to take a strong part in progressing the plans that the ITC is making to implement a programme providing a pilot series of neighbourhoods across the country with free conversion to digital television. Our aim in this is to understand better the practical and social issues which will be faced by people in taking decisions on switching from analogue to digital television.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para6">These pilots will complement the findings of the Viewers Panel we established last year, and whose report, due in September, will help us to ensure that our policies are well informed by consumer concerns and needs.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para7">We also hope that the DVB logo, now being promoted by broadcasters, manufacturers and retailers, will help consumers to purchase digital televisions with confidence so that they are not misled into buying sets with "digital features", under the mistaken impression that they are actually purchasing equipment capable of receiving digital services. We must now discuss with the industry how best to promote this scheme to be sure that all the consumers receive the appropriate information before buying a new TV set. Alongside this initiative, we must also consider whether a public information campaign will be helpful to demystify digital television.
<P>

<a name="10510w15.html_para8">We are committed to developing a strategic plan which will lead the UK to meet the criteria on affordability, availability and accessibility we have set to allow for full digital switchover within the period 2006 and 2010.

The only analogue services exempted from this requirement are those who broadcast, or are committed to broadcast, on a digital multiplex in the relevant area.

<P>

<a name="10510w16.html_para4">However, the Legal Services Commission, and before it the Legal Aid Board, have taken a number of steps to improve control over the cost of multi-party actions (MPAs). Due to their potential expense, MPAs have been subject to contract control since 1992. An expert panel of solicitors who have experience in handling such litigation was established in 1999, and new arrangements introduced to allow only panel members and any firm already involved in the action to submit a tender for an MPA contract.
<P>

<a name="10510w16.html_para5">Now, under the Commission's Funding Code (introduced in April 2000), cases can be put out to competitive tender among the panel members, at or below specified hourly rates.

Specialist Commission staff manage contracted cases, and those residual cases that are not under contract. As directed by the Lord Chancellor, the Commission has set aside a budget for special cases, of which MPAs are one type. This commenced when the Commission's Funding Code came into effect.

<a name="10510w16.html_para7">The Legal Services Commission records the value of main bills paid, comprising solicitors' costs, disbursements and Counsel's fees. The total figures for each year also include the value of claims which are met in full by the opponents. The net cost to the fund of clinical negligence cases is therefore less than the figures given.

<a name="10510w16.html_para8">It is not possible to identify separately claims against the NHS from claims against GPs and dentists; nor is it possible to identify separately claims against private practitioners from those working in the NHS. The Commission does not record separately amounts claimed for different stages in proceedings, and it is therefore not possible to report separately the cost of initial investigations.Prior to the introduction of civil contracting in January 2000 clinical negligence was not separately identified as a category of advice work. The figures in the table therefore do not provide information regarding payments for advice and assistance work done under the former Green Form system.
<P>

<a name="10510w16.html_para9">A number of measures have been introduced to seek to improve the value for money achieved in clinical negligence cases. From August 1999 only clinical negligence specialists who hold licences with the Commission have been able to provide publicly funded services in new cases. The Commission has a contract with Action for Victims of Medical Accidents (AVMA) to provide a merits screening test in clinical negligence cases; this expertise now supports the process of deciding which cases to fund. New guidance and tougher criteria have also been introduced and are aimed at restricting funding for lower value and weaker claims. Consequently there has been an increase in the proportion of claims that were found to lack merit, and were discontinued after the initial investigation, from 51 per cent. in 1996-97 to 60 per cent. in 1999-2000. There has also been an improvement in the success rate of claims that proceed beyond the initial investigation, from 46 per cent. in 1996-97 to 61 per cent. in 1999-2000. The discontinuation at an earlier stage of cases that lack legal merit represents an improvement in value for money. The reforms are also reflected in the number of new certificates issued annually for clinical negligence claims, which are just over half the totals being issued five years ago.

 We share the objectives underpinning the 20/20 initiative, but have reservations about its capacity to influence implementation of poverty reduction objectives. The 20/20 idea is based on inputs rather than effective use of resources. While it encourages desirable attention to social programmes, it does not ensure that resources will be directed to the meeting of the International Development targets. As far as we are aware, the World bank is not proposing to provide financial support to the 20/20 initiative.

<a name="10510w17.html_para0">The Netherlands have proposed amendments to the European Commission's proposal for a new Council Decision on the Association of the Overseas Countries and Territories with the European Community (the "OCT Decision"). The Commission's proposal maintains full freedom of access to the EC market for products originating in the OCTs, subject to special provisions for rice and sugar. The Netherlands' amendments would increase the proposed quota for milled or semi-milled rice, and would allow an additional quota for sugar which has undergone processing disallowed under the Commission proposal. The Netherlands have also suggested an alternative process for the management of these quotas. The Government are still assessing the implications of these amendments. In Council working groups, discussion is at an early stage.

<a name="10510w18.html_para4">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than data at a local authority level, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Glasgow, Pollok since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para5">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para6">Child Benefit is worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from this April: nationally about 7 million families receive child Benefit, and in Glasgow, Pollok 8,550 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para7">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Glasgow, Pollok the number has reduced from 3,000 to 2,000. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Glasgow, Pollok the number has decreased from 2,400 to 2,300.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para8">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. Last winter (2000-01), the payment was &#163;200 for households who qualified. Around 13,000 older people in Glasgow, Pollok received a Winter Fuel Payment.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para9">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 13,100 pensioners in Glasgow, Pollok will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 4,900 in Glasgow, Pollok. 3,600 pensioner families in Glasgow, Pollok are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. They are now at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10510w18.html_para10">To help tomorrow's pensioners, we have introduced the new stakeholder pension which is designed to help those on moderate to higher earnings who do not have access to an occupational pension; lower to moderate earners will benefit when we introduce the State Second Pension in April 2002; and from 2003, the Pension Credit will mean that pensioners will for the first time be rewarded, not penalised, for saving.

<a name="10510w19.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what proposals he has to amend the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme to include those who have been affected by vaccination but who are over the age of 21;  [160915]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will seek to amend the Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979 to allow payments to be made to a person damaged by vaccine, irrespective of the age of that person, and when the damage occurred.  [160916]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Vaccine Damage Payments (VDP) scheme is principally aimed at those vaccinated as part of the Department of Health-recommended childhood vaccination programme, although exceptions are made in cases such as polio and rubella where such vaccinations are more routinely given into adulthood. Given this basis those claiming a VDP must generally have been vaccinated before their 18 birthday.
<P>

<a name="10510w19.html_para0">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 27 June 2000, we propose to amend the time limit for claiming a VDP so that a claim must be made on or before the date on which a vaccinated person attains the age of 21, or within six years of the date of the vaccination to which the claim relates, whichever is the later. We have no further plans to amend age limit provisions.

<a name="10510w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) results for 2000-01 for the Prison Service are given in the table. The data are provisional and subject to final validation.
<P>

<a name="10510w19.html_para5">The results are extremely encouraging. The improvement in security is impressive--especially the reduction in escapes from prison establishments. There were 11 last year, compared with 30 in 1999-2000 and 232 as recently as 1992-93. The downward trend in drug misuse has continued and performance is well ahead of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) target. The level of drug abuse has fallen by 49 per cent. since 1996-97. The Service met the overall target for the number of prisoners completing accredited offending behaviour programmes and increased the overall number of completions by 30 per cent. on the previous year and by more than 93 per cent. on the number achieved in 1998-99. The purposeful activity target would have been met but for a sharp rise in the prisoner population since December, and I believe, could have been met despite the increase in population had governors not responded to encouragement to concentrate investment in education and offending behaviour courses which provide high quality activity but for small numbers of prisoners.
<P>

<a name="10510w19.html_para6">The Director General of the Prison Service has introduced new arrangements for dealing with the high levels of staff sickness in the Service and although the basic skills targets were not met, it is very encouraging to note that prisoners achieved more than 50,000 separate certificates last year, 12,500 of them at basic skills level 2.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans the Government have to take full financial responsibility for asylum seekers and their dependants in place of local authority responsibility.  [160792]<P>

<P>
<a name="10510w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Home Office assumed responsibility on 1 April 1999 for reimbursing local authorities for direct costs incurred, within unit cost limits for supporting asylum seekers. Payment is by way of grant.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the estimated total value is of the benefits available in vouchers, in cash and in kind, including accommodation, to an asylum-seeking family with two adults and two children which is being supported by NASS, broken down by type of benefit, in the financial year 2001-02.  [160634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Asylum seekers in need can be supported with accommodation, subsistence or both. The current weekly value of voucher support for a family consisting of a couple and two children, aged 16 or younger, is &#163;119.27, of which &#163;40.00 is paid in cash vouchers. Accommodation is provided directly by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS).
<P>

<a name="10510w20.html_para3">An asylum-seeking family in National Asylum Support Service (NASS) accommodation has their utility bills paid by NASS. This in-kind support is estimated to be worth around &#163;18 per week. In addition, NASS accommodation includes items not generally included in furnished accommodation, such as towels, bedding, cooking utensils, crockery and cutlery, at an estimated value of around &#163;5 per week. After six months, NASS-supported asylum seekers are also eligible for a one-off payment of &#163;50 per person.
<P>

<a name="10510w20.html_para4">If the children are new-born the family may be eligible for a maternity payment of &#163;300 per child.

 The areas designated as clusters are listed together with population figures. Research to identify the presence of ethnic minorities included advice received from consultation with regional consortium, voluntary groups and other interested parties plus evidence from the 1991 census. Actual statistics detailing the present ethnic minority population for each cluster area are not available.

<P>
<a name="10510w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has established a contract manager for each of its contracts with accommodation providers who is responsible for investigating complaints about the standard of accommodation. These investigations will either be carried out by the contract manager or by one of the chartered surveying firms employed by NASS as and when required.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para0">The main remit of the NASS Performance Monitoring Inspection Team is the assessment of housing management put in place by all NASS contractors.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para1">The current staffing level of the NASS Performance Monitoring Inspection Team is one Head of Inspections Senior Executive Officer (SEO), four Team Leaders Higher Executive Officer (HEO), 15 Inspectors Executive Officers (EO) and six support staff. All non-support staff are engaged in personally inspecting the accommodation and the support services that contractors are required to provide to NASS service users.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para2">The NASS Performance Monitoring Inspections team has no formal targets for the proportion of asylum seeker accommodation to be inspected. However, regular reviews of the management practices in place by accommodation providers are undertaken together with consultation with service users and independent property inspections to ensure that accommodation services are provided to the required standard.

<a name="10510w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In considering whether to proscribe the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), I took full account of the information available to me, including that about the Sri Lankan peace process. I am satisfied that as an organisation the LTTE is 'concerned in terrorism' as defined by the Act and that it was appropriate for me to exercise my discretion to proscribe.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para3">Since the proscription of the LTTE was agreed by Parliament and came into force on 29 March, I have received a small number of representations from Tamil organisations. I have received none from the Norwegian Government. I would be unlikely to revisit any decision to proscribe unless the organisation concerned had demonstrated a convincing renunciation of terrorism. This approach is consistent in respect of all the 35 proscribed organisations listed in Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

[160739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office is one of a number of Government Departments which spend money to reduce the supply of drugs, to prevent them from being taken, to reduce their harmful effects and to break the link between drugs and crime. Their actions are brought together under the Government's 10-year National Anti-Drugs Strategy launched in May 1998, "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain".
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para8">While we do not have information to answer all aspects of the question, it is hoped that the following may assist.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para9"><i>International Co-operation</i>
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para10">In each of the financial years 1997-98 to 2000-01, the Home Office spent about &#163;2 million providing specialist training and equipment to overseas law enforcement agencies in countries close to the source of production with the aim of improving their ability to reduce the supply of drugs to the United Kingdom. Additionally we assist in improving international co-operation through the United Kingdom's membership of Europol, the European Union and G8.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para11"><i>Effectiveness of Police Enforcement</i>
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para12">The Home Office is not responsible for Customs and Excise. The total amount spent by police forces in countering the supply of drugs cannot be disaggregated from other expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para13"><i>Domestic Control</i>
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para14">There are tight legislative controls on the possession and supply of controlled drugs and the maximum available penalties reflect the seriousness of the offences. Supplying Class A drugs carries a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment and an unlimited fine and a third conviction for the supply of a Class A drug carries a minimum period of seven years' imprisonment. For the Home Office, maintaining these controls will involve police (see earlier), probation and prison costs (see later). Its costs last year were some &#163;400,000.
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para15"><i>Prevention and support of local initiatives</i>
<P>

<a name="10510w21.html_para16">Prior to the 1999 establishment of the Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS) to provide support for local Drug Action Teams, the Drugs Prevention Initiative (DPI) was the vehicle by which the Home Office provided an

1. Offences of Criminal damage &#163;20 and under have been excluded up to 1997; all criminal damage is included thereafter.<P>

2. New guidance was issued in April 1999 that tightened up the conditions under which a crime can be detected. One of its principal features was the removal of post-sentence visits as a method of detection <P>

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) is the biggest single investment in an evidence-based approach to crime reduction which has ever taken place in any country. Knowledge gained will contribute to reversing the long-term growth rate in crime and ensuring we are achieving the greatest impact for the money spent. Projects which are successful will form the basis of future mainstream programmes; those which are not will be dropped.
<P>

<a name="10510w23.html_para0">All of the initiatives in the table are under way; no new initiatives are planned as part of the Crime Reduction Programme. CRP projects are of differing duration, but all CRP initiatives are due to finish by 31 March 2002 although some will, exceptionally and with prior approval, be completed in 2002-03.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what response he has received to the letter which he sent to the Indian Government about the imprisonment of Peter Bleach; and if he will make a statement.  [158444]<P>

<a name="10510w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not yet received a reply to his letter of 4 December 2000 to the Indian Government asking for Peter Bleach to be released on the grounds of fair and equal treatment with his co-convicted who have already been released. He sent a reminder on 29 January. Our High Commissioner in New Delhi has followed up the Foreign Secretary's request with key players in the Indian Government. My noble Friend Baroness Scotland, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, called in the Indian High Commissioner on 7 March to remind him of the Foreign Secretary's request. I also raised the case with the Indian High Commissioner on 22 March.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on his policy towards classification of EU documents graded as Top Secret.  [158753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 EU security regulations provide for classification of EU documents graded as Top Secret and set out the rationale for doing so. It is right that where institutions of the European Union hold information that is Top Secret, they should handle that information with appropriate care as provided for in the relevant security regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent discussions he has had with Spain regarding the European Union's single sky proposals; and if he will make a statement.  [159580]<P>

<P>
<a name="10510w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last discussed the matter with his Spanish counterpart on 9 April. The Government fully support the EU single sky initiative, which should benefit UK industry and consumers. The Stockholm European Council on 23-24 March called for progress on this issue before the next European Council in Gothenburg on 15-16 June.

 In early January I decided that this visit would have to be postponed. It was subsequently rescheduled for 20 March. Following consultations with officials in the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Office, by late February it was clear that this date would not be convenient for their Ministers. On 28 February I decided to cancel the visit. I hope it will be reinstated in the near future.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2001]:</i> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not played a direct role in the international mediation that has taken place in an effort to resolve the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk group, America, Russia and France are leading the negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

 Pitcairn has no air services nor a regular shipping service; however cargo vessels transiting between New Zealand and the Panama Canal are used to transport passengers and freight to and from Pitcairn. A passenger and cargo shipping service operates between the UK and St. Helena, calling at Ascension Island on a regular basis and Tristan da Cunha once a year. Tristan is also served by non-regular visits by research and fishing vessels. There is an American-run military airfield on Ascension Island, through which the RAF operates regular flights to and from the Falklands.

 The current population of Pitcairn is 44 (74 in 1976, the nearest date to 1971 for which there are reliable figures); St. Helena is 5,016 (5,147 in 1976); Ascension is 974 (1,311 in 1971); and Tristan da Cunha is 287 (312 in 1971). Norfolk Island is Australian territory and we do not hold these statistics.

On 1 April 1997 Staffordshire local authority was reorganised and Stoke-on-Trent local authority came into existence (i.e. the figures in the table for 1996-97 relate to one local authority (Staffordshire local authority) serving a larger area and population than it now serves. That same area is now served by two local authorities (Staffordshire local authority and Stoke-on-Trent local authority), who each receive a standard spending assessment based on their smaller than previous populations). Therefore, figures for 2001-02 are not directly comparable with 1996-97. <P>

 Information for Health focuses on the best use of information and Information Technology in improving health and health care and in supporting the delivery of patient centred care and services. It is also a partnership approach involving key stakeholders such as front line clinicians, professional and representative bodies and IT suppliers. By being inclusive, considerable approval and support has been gained for the strategy across the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para10">The strategy was launched in September 1998 and it has had to flex to take into account major new initiatives flowing from the NHS plan and the e-Government agenda. These requirements are now fully reflected.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para11">There are clear and defined national targets to ensure the implementation of a national information and IT infrastructure. Record levels of funding have been committed for investment in IT over a three-year period. Local plans produced in all health communities are monitored and analysed to ensure that investments will meet the target deliverables. Each local community consists of a host health authority, its constituent NHS trusts, general practitioners, other primary care contractors, local authority social services and voluntary sector organisations. All local plans produced last year were published on the Department's internet site.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para12">The document "Building the Information Core: Implementing the NHS Plan" (www.doh.gov.uk/ nhsexipu/strategy/update/) contains details of key targets to be achieved over the next four years, in order to meet the commitments contained in the NHS plan in relation to information systems. Other related targets around national service priorities will emerge in due course. Collectively they give the immediate Information Management and Technology priorities which Local Implementation Strategy (LIS) communities need to address to provide the NHS-wide core applications and services. These fundamental targets are listed in the table.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para13">The targets stretch to 2005 but progress on intermediate milestones has been strong. All GPs will be connected to NHSnet by March 2001 which will speed up and improve communications for test results, appointment booking and other patient centred information flows. NHS Direct services now cover the whole population of England.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para14">In addition to local implementation major development programmes are in place across the NHS. The National Booked Admission Programme pilots have now been running for 12 months and the Electronic Record Development and Implementation Programme (ERDIP) will provide essential lessons for national implementation of electronic patient and health records.
<P>

<a name="10510w27.html_para15">Progress so far has been strong and we will maintain the effort to ensure that we fully realise the opportunities now unfolding to support a patient focused and modern NHS.

 <i>[holding answer sent 03 May 2001]:</i> Our White Paper "A First Class Service" sets out a requirement for all organisations within the National Health Service to set up and implement a clinical governance framework, which identifies procedures to be followed when reporting and investigating clinical and untoward incidents. Such procedures should enable incidents to be investigated thoroughly in a culture of openness and reflection to ensure lessons are learnt and clinical practice improved.
<P>

<a name="10510w28.html_para0">In this particular case, a clinical incident report was completed on 10 December 2000. The head of nursing for theatres was asked to undertake a thorough investigation to review and revise the necessary trust theatre procedures.




<P>
<P><I>10 May 2001 : Column: 363W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10510w28.html_para1">As a result of the investigation, the importance of following theatre-checking procedures was reinforced to theatre managers and staff, and all theatre procedures were reviewed and amended accordingly to reflect lessons learned through this incident.
<P>

<a name="10510w28.html_para2">The clinical director for surgery has ensured that junior doctors involved in colorectal surgery have a clear understanding of the operating mechanisms of the stapling gun. In addition, the Trust medical director also wrote to all consultant surgeons who carry out colorectal surgery reminding them of the need to be present throughout this kind of surgery.
<P>

<a name="10510w28.html_para3">The consultant surgeon responsible for his care informed the patient on 18 January 2001 that the anvil had been left in his rectum following the operation of 4 December 2000. The patient's wife and another family member together with the specialist stoma nurse were present during this discussion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what has been the total cost incurred by the Walsgrave NHS Trust since the suspension of Mr. Barros D'Sa on account of that suspension, including the suspended surgeon's salary, disciplinary hearings and related procedures and legal and court costs.  [159610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w28.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2001]:</i> The total cost incurred by the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service Trust in regard to this matter was &#163;171,605 at the end of March 2001. This cost includes elements relating to the salary of the suspended consultant, costs of locum cover, the setting up of an Inquiry Panel in accordance with HC(90)9, legal and court costs and mediation meeting costs.
<P>

<a name="10510w28.html_para4">The National Clinical Assessment Authority will issue new guidance to NHS organisations later this year on handling suspensions and will consider any outstanding cases which are still awaiting resolution.
<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2001]:</i> The table shows a count of discharges from hospital for patients where the main operation was on the rectum and the main diagnosis was 'malignant neoplasm of rectum'. This information is for National Health Service hospitals in England, West Midlands and the Walsgrave Hospitals NHS Trust in 1996-97 to 1999-2000 and includes both emergency and planned operations undertaken in this period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the proportion of patients is who having suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) survive for five years; and what the equivalent figures are in <i>(a)</i> France, <i>(b)</i> Germany, <i>(c)</i> Sweden and <i>(d)</i> the USA.  [160239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2001]:</i> Data on the number of patients who survive for five years after having a heart attack are not routinely collected. Equivalent data for international comparisons are also not readily available. We have developed the National Service Framework for coronary heart disease, a 10-year strategy which deals with all aspects of coronary heart disease to provide a modern service with fair and fast access to high-quality services. One of the NSF's immediate priorities is to improve the use of effective medicines after heart attack (especially use of aspirin, beta-blockers and statins) so that 80 to 90 per cent. of people discharged from hospital following a heart attack will be prescribed these drugs.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10510w29.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2001]:</i> The Meat Inspection Charges Task Force was established by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in April 2000 to look at the issue of meat inspection charges and to consider alternative approaches to charging that would help to alleviate the burden of inspection charges on small and medium-sized abattoirs and cutting plants.
<P>

<a name="10510w29.html_para2">In its report, the taskforce recommended that the Government should contribute to the costs of meat inspection in Great Britain. The taskforce recommended moving away from charging for meat inspections on an hourly basis and that, instead, all abattoirs and cutting plants should be charged the lower of either the standard (headage) charges laid down in EU Directive 96/43/EEC or their actual inspection costs. The taskforce estimated that adopting this recommendation would result in a cost to Government of up to &#163;19 million in 2001-02 and each year thereafter.
<P>

<a name="10510w29.html_para3">We accepted the taskforce recommendation and announced new, additional financial support in the context of the publication of the Rural White Paper on 28 November 2000 to secure the future of small and medium-sized abattoirs.
<P>

<a name="10510w29.html_para4">Following consultation, a new charging system based on the taskforce recommendation was introduced by the FSA on 2 April 2001. Under the new system, the majority of meat plants will be paying substantially reduced meat inspection charges.

However figures on employee jobs by sector (the lowest level of aggregation available for Scotland) are collected by the ONS on a quarterly basis. For the dates specified, the closest match is the June quarter. These figures do not include the self-employed.

 The aim of the Employment Service is to help people without jobs find work and employers to fill their vacancies. The Employment Service in Scotland makes an important contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to delivering the Government's welfare to work policies, working in close partnership with employers and others. These targets pave the way for the new agency, Jobcentre Plus, whose pathfinder offices will begin work in October. They give stronger emphasis than ever before to helping individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from unemployment and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. The highest priority will be given to helping people who have been economically inactive for long periods, including lone parents, to find work, and to capitalise on the opportunities created by the new generation of New Deals.

<a name="10510w31.html_para7">The Employment Service in Scotland aims to make a major contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to the Government's objectives of an increase in the effective supply of labour, and countering poverty and social exclusion by helping welfare recipients facing the most severe disadvantages to compete effectively for jobs. It does this by working closely with employers and with its private, voluntary and public sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its chief priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) regime, delivery of the New Deals, and the provision of appropriate information, advice, training and support. The challenge and opportunity for the Employment Service, is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make these services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners.
