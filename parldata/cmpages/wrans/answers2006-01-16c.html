 DEFRA has distributed guidance materials to a range of industry groups, including the British Poultry Council, the British Egg Industry Council and the National Farmers Union.

We have also provided leaflets and posters to farmers and to many other people, including local veterinary surgeons and placed advertisements in poultry hobby magazines. Guidance is also available on the avian influenza pages of the DEFRA website.

 Restrictions on the movement of poultry in the event of an outbreak are contained within the Diseases of Poultry Order 2003.

These measures would prohibit the release of gamebirds in those zones. The order also allows the elimination of the disease by slaughter of infected and contact animals.

 As part of the Government&#039;s current programme to reduce the risks posed by avian influenza bird owners would be required, wherever practicable, to move their birds indoors as soon as possible if a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza were found in Great Britain.

 Bonfires on domestic and business premises, including those in rural areas, are already regulated under the statutory nuisance provisions in sections 79 to 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This means that local authorities have a duty to investigate complaints of smoke from premises which are prejudicial to health or a nuisance, and if satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists an abatement notice 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jan 2006 : Column 896W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
must be served requiring the abatement of the nuisance or the restriction of its occurrence or recurrence. Failure to comply with the terms of an abatement notice will, upon summary conviction, result in a fine of up to &#163;5,000 for domestic premises and &#163;20,000 for business premises. In addition, Section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from industrial and trade premises, which can include agricultural and horticultural premises.

<a name="stpa_38">However, the Department has also put in place the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005, the Packaging Regulations&quot; which place obligations on businesses to recover and recycle packaging waste. As the packaging waste recycling targets, set in the regulations, increase between now and 2008 it is expected that producers will have to ensure that more packaging waste is extracted from the household waste stream for recycling. Producers will therefore need to work with local authorities e.g. through their packaging compliance schemes and/or accredited reprocessors/exporters, to ensure that packaging materials can be collected by local authorities for recycling, e.g. by co-financing such collections. This is particularly so where producers&#039; needs extend beyond the local authorities&#039; own recycling obligations.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">The nZEC project aims to demonstrate coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage technology in China by 2020. The technology has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 90 per cent. This is in recognition that carbon dioxide emissions from China&#039;s increasing coal use are set to double by 2030.</p>
</ul>

 A new outline Strategic Plan, covering the period 2006 to 2011 was agreed by the Commission in July 2005. The text is available via the Commission&#039;s intranet and internet pages. This new plan confirms that the primary purpose of the House Service is to enable the House and its Members to perform their parliamentary duties effectively. Beyond this it has a duty to promote public understanding of Parliament&#039;s work and role through the provision of information and access. The plan also sets out six priority areas for the period 2006 to 2011: accommodation and works, human resources, information for the public, information management and ICT, planning and management and security. For each of these areas the board of management has developed a detailed statement of its aims for the planning period. These have been incorporated in the 2006 Corporate Business Plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_59">The previous strategic plan identified four on-going core tasks and eight developmental objectives for the period covered by the plan: 2001&#150;02 to 2005&#150;06. Pages 15&#150;48 of the 2004&#150;05 Commission Annual Report [HC65 2005&#150;06] provide a description of performance against each of the core tasks. A further statement on performance will be provided in the 2005&#150;06 Annual Report. The views of Members and other stakeholders on the implementation of elements of both the core tasks and the development objectives have been expressed in a number of ways, including reports and advice from the Administration Committee and its predecessors in the last Parliament and the Modernisation Committee, and the 2003 Survey of Services. It is anticipated that a further survey of services will be conducted during the current Parliament.

 In 1946 the Government reviewed all actions and campaigns that took place during world war two and decided that after this date no further awards would be made. This remains the case to this day, and it would be impossible to second guess the decisions made by military commanders at the time. For that reason it is not possible to make a posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Lieutenant-Colonel Blair Mayne.

We have not provided specific assistance for reconstruction. We understand, however, that the European Union is considering a request from the Cayman Islands Government for support to rebuild homes. DFID&#039;s focus has been aimed at improving and strengthening disaster preparedness in all UK Overseas Territories in the region. In the Cayman Islands, we also funded a study of the impact of Hurricane Ivan to help learn from the Cayman Islands&#039; experience of handling the emergency.

 Jordan is now a middle income country that receives relatively large amounts of donor funding in relation to its levels of poverty. DFID has provided bilateral funding in the form of technical co-operation (i.e. support for projects) as well as other types of bilateral funding such as humanitarian assistance and debt relief. DFID&#039;s bilateral programme with Jordan closed in September 2005. DFID also provided funding to Jordan through our contributions to multilateral organisations including the EC and the World Bank, which we will continue to do.

 The only legislation introduced by DFID since 1 May 2002 was the International Development Act 2002, which put furthering poverty reduction at the heart of the Secretary of State&#039;s statutory powers. Subject to this overarching objective, as defined by the Act, it did not outlaw any specific activities. The restriction in the Act over how funds voted by Parliament can be used means, for example, that aid cannot be tied to the purchase of British goods and services.

<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60116w14.html_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The policy of transferring non-core trunk roads (detrunking) to local highway authorities was first set out in the White Paper A New Deal for Transport&quot; published in July 1998. Detrunking allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic trunk road network, whilst enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes. The aim has been to transfer some 3,200 km (30 per cent.) of the trunk road network (as it was in April 1999) to local authorities in a phased programme. To date more than 80 per cent. (around 2,628 km) of the programme has been completed since April 2001. Prior to detrunking, the Highways Agency and local authorities agree the transfer of an appropriate level of funding for annual maintenance and in some cases for outstanding capital projects.

 The New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) was announced in the Government&#039;s 1998 White Paper A new deal for transport: better for everyone&quot;. The NATA provides a comprehensive assessment of the main impacts of a scheme on the environment, safety, the economic performance, accessibility and integration so that all the key criteria are considered in decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">NATA was first used to inform decisions taken during the 1998 Roads Review and results for 67 schemes which were candidates for the targeted programme of improvements were published in A new deal for trunk roads in England: Understanding the New Approach To Appraisal&quot;. The Highways Agency has continued to use the NATA for all major (that is, those costing more than &#163;5 million) highway schemes since then. It also introduced a simplified version of NATA for use on small schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">Subsequently, the NATA was revised to be applicable to other transport modes, including rail, light rail and bus schemes. NATA has been used for appraisal of Community Infrastructure Funding. The Department has required the use of the NATA for the appraisal of all Local Transport Plan major schemes (road and public transport) since 2000. The NATA was the basis for OPRAF&#039;s 1999 Planning Criteria&#151;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger rail services&quot;, revised in 2003 by the Strategic Rail Authority and published as Appraisal Criteria&#151;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger and freight rail services&quot;.

<a name="stpa_135">The NATA has been applied to a wide range of transport projects proposed by a number of different agencies. The Department does not hold a comprehensive record of all of these projects and to compile one would be prohibitively

<a name="stpa_136">NATA is used to appraise and inform the prioritisation of schemes. A range of appraisal requirements including assessments using the NATA system apply to all schemes submitted to the Department for funding, with the level of detail required in the appraisal being proportional to the scale and complexity of the scheme. For each scheme, the Appraisal Summary Table provides an indication of the impact of the scheme on each of five criteria.

 As part of its response to Kate Barker&#039;s Review of Housing Supply, the Government are currently consulting on the introduction of planning gain supplement (PGS), which would apply to residential and non-residential land.

<a name="stpa_194">PGS would not be implemented before 2008. The level of PGS has not yet been set. It is premature to attempt to estimate the amount of PGS that might be raised in Milton Keynes unitary authority in 2008 and beyond.

<a name="60116w22.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_195">PGS would be an essentially local measure. A significant majority of PGS revenues would be recycled directly to the local level for local priorities. This would help local communities to share better the benefits of growth and manage its impacts. As part of its consultation, the Government are consulting on how PGS revenues should be recycled to the local level for local priorities and how they should be used to fund strategic infrastructure at the regional level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w22.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_196">Separate from PGS there is currently a mechanism under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 whereby parties with an interest in land may enter into a planning obligation enforceable by the local planning authority. Such planning obligations are used to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms, for example to compensate for loss or damage created by a development or mitigate a developments&#039; impact.

The prospectus identifies the contributions to infrastructure that will be made by developers, through planning obligations, broken down on a per dwelling basis. The s106 contribution that developers are expected to make amounts to around &#163;18,500 per dwelling, plus land for social infrastructure and affordable housing. This represents approximately one quarter of the total

Further details of the expected uses of such contributions over the next five years can be found in recent MKPC papers (in particular September and December 2005) available online at: http://www.mkweb.co.uk/mkpartnership/home.asp.

 The contractual arrangements for future oil exploration and production are a decision for the incoming Iraqi Government and the Government have not sought to influence this decision. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office did support a 2003 independent study which set out the full range of possible contractual financing arrangements to allow the rehabilitation and development of the Iraqi oil industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w27.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">Under the outgoing Iraqi Transitional Government, the Ministry of Oil was clear that the option of concluding Production Sharing Agreements would be one of a range of contracts that might be needed to help redevelop the oil industry. This is because after decades of isolation, Iraq has weak technical and managerial capacity combined with an ageing infrastructure with severely outdated production facilities. Furthermore, there has been no explorations for new fields since the 1980s and limited post-2003 investment and poor maintenance. Given the state of the infrastructure, and the US$20 billion needed for reconstruction of the oil industry, it is highly unlikely that the Iraqi Government will be able to fund investment in the oil industry itself. Without the needed investment the oil industry will not be able to fuel the required sustainable economic growth in Iraq.

 Release of political reporting would cause harm to the effective conduct of international relations as it depends upon maintaining trust and confidence between Governments and international organisations. This relationship allows for the free and frank exchange of information on the understanding that it will be treated in confidence. By releasing information that they have provided strictly in confidence, there is a possibility that they would refuse to share similar information in the future. This would harm the UK&#039;s ability to protect and promote its interests through international relations, which there is a strong public interest in maintaining. For these reasons we consider that the public interest in maintaining this exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing it.

 We are committed to implementing the recommendation of a clearing house from the Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee report in 2001, and are currently working with the Learning and Skills Council to build on good practice from the various local, regional and sector-based models that are already operating. Our plans for 14&#150;19 reform include significant engagement with employers, and we are considering a form of clearing house which will incorporate other opportunities for young people to gain experience in the workplace, such as work placements. The recently published 14&#150;19 Implementation Plan states our intention to develop a clearing house by 2007/08.

 No Sure Start Children&#039;s Centres were opened between 1999&#150;2002. Local authorities were asked to start planning the development of Children&#039;s Centres in February 2003 and 67 centres were designated in 2003&#150;04. An additional 163 centres were designated in 2004&#150;05, and we expect a further 600 centres to be designated in 2005&#150;06. Local authorities are still developing plans for children centre delivery for 2006&#150;08, and a breakdown of numbers of centres to be opened in these years is not centrally available. However, by the end of this period we expect at least 2,500 to be designated. The Government intend to develop 3,500 Sure Start children&#039;s centres by 2010. This will mean every community in England will have a children centre co-ordinating a range of integrated services for pre-school children and their parents.

 The information is set out in the following table. All figures are for allocations of Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) per pupil. Authorities must apply the whole of their allocation of DSG to their schools budget, but they are free to add to it from their own resources: final figures for total expenditure per pupil may therefore be higher than the authority&#039;s allocation of DSG per pupil.

n/a=figures are not available.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup>School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup>The expenditure data to 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the annual &#039;RO1&#039; spending returns which local authorities submitted to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 are drawn from section 52 (table 3) outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards are taken from section 52 (table A) outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank rows. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup>From 2002&#150;03 the calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil 



of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup>Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup>Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(27)</sup>The expenditure data for 1999&#150;2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are reported in cash terms as at 11 January 2006 and rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

In cases where single foster parents are caring for a child, they are treated in the same way as lone parents in terms of their entitlement to income support (provided they meet the criteria).

 On 21 October the Government set out their priorities for post-16 education including adult line. I set out the Government&#039;s priorities for the learning and skills sector and the impact on funding in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 on the 21 October, and full details can be found in Priorities for Success&quot; on the LSC&#039;s website. Overall funding for further education (FE) which includes adult skills increased by 4.4 per cent. in 2005&#150;06. Funding for non-vocational learning opportunities for adults, delivered mainly through local authority adult education services, has also increased. In 2004&#150;05 we provided over &#163;207 million to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in support of this learning. This has risen to &#163;210 million in 2005&#150;06. After piloting from 2002 we have also announced the national roll-out of the National Employer Training Programme in 2006&#150;07 with a budget rising to &#163;399 million in 2007&#150;08. Through their dialogue with providers and their assessment of the needs of local communities, LSCs agree plans which enable colleges and other providers to deliver a wide range of learning opportunities to meet the needs of learners and employers. Literacy, numeracy and English language learning is a key priority.

The Training and Development Agency for Schools does not prescribe a number of hours to be spent on any individual area of the curriculum for trainee teachers. Instead, the Agency requires trainees to meet a demanding set of outcomes by the end of their training programmes. All primary trainee teachers are required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of PE as well as demonstrating teaching ability in PE before they can become newly qualified teachers. This should enable newly qualified teachers to meet the PSA target. All trainee teachers are required to be able to manage lessons safely.

 EMA was subject to one of the most comprehensive evaluations of any educational initiative.

<a name="stpa_268">The results indicated that EMA increased participation of eligible young people in the pilot areas by 5.9 percentage points.

EMA was rolled out to 16-year-olds in the remaining two thirds of the country in September 2004. There was a 1.9 percentage point increase in participation of 16-year-olds in full-time education between 2003/04 and 2004/05. This is in line with the increase in participation which was expected from the roll out of EMA and is the largest increase in participation for over 10 years. While it is not possible to say that all of the increase was due to EMA, this was one of the most important initiatives aimed at increasing participation. The Department and LSC will be doing further analyses of local participation when these become available to try to get a better estimate of the change which might be due to EMA. EMA was rolled out to 17-year-olds in September 2005 and will be fully rolled out to 18-year-olds from September 2006.

Where take-up is lower than anticipated, the local LSC targets additional support to raise awareness of EMA and increase the figures.

 A key aim of &#039;Putting the World into World-Class Education&#151;An international strategy for education, skills and children&#039;s services&#039; is to equip our children, young people and adults for life in a global society and work in a global economy. In addition, our national languages strategy clearly sets out the importance of international partnerships for the enrichment of language learning and to the curriculum more generally.

<sup>(46)</sup>For the purposes of this table, a school is defined as operating within its revenue budget during 2004&#150;05 if its closing revenue balance is greater than or equal to its opening revenue balance. The balance information reported in Shropshire&#039;s return is not internally consistent for all schools and in two cases this inconsistency, although relatively small, could mean that they should have been reported as over rather than within their revenue budget for the year.<br>

<sup>(47)</sup>Of the 122 schools who were within budget for 2004&#150;05:<br>

eight started the year with a deficit revenue balance and remained in deficit at the end of the year;<br>

15 went from having a deficit revenue balance at the start of the year to being in surplus at the end of the year;<br>





99 started the year with a surplus revenue balance and ended the year further in surplus;<br>

<sup>(48)</sup>Of the 45 schools who were over budget for 2004&#150;05:<br>

34 had sufficient surplus revenue balances at the start of the year that they still remained in surplus at the end of the year;<br>

seven went from having a surplus revenue balance at the start of the year to being in deficit at the end of the year;<br>

four started the year with a deficit revenue balance and ended the year further in deficit.<br>

Note:<br>

Data are as reported by Shropshire LA, but is being validated by the Department and is likely to change.<br>

Admission Forums provide a vehicle for representatives of admission authorities and other key parties to discuss admission issues and consider the effectiveness of local admission arrangements. The function of the Forum is to provide advice on difficult admission issues, information for parents and to broker agreement on arrangements for admitting vulnerable pupils to schools quickly. All maintained schools, including Trust schools, and Academies must have regard to the Forum&#039;s advice. Admission Forums will have no functions in relation to special schools or Pupil Referral Units.

New shorter, sharper inspections were introduced in September 2005 as part of the New Relationship with Schools. The White Paper proposes that Ofsted should explore the introduction of even lighter touch inspections for high-performing schools. It also proposes that Ofsted should be given powers to investigate complaints from parents.

The Schools Commissioner will have a general role in promoting trust schools, including encouraging the spread of good practice between schools. In particular, the Commissioner will support schools wishing to adopt trusts, for example by brokering relationships with suitable partners and providing model documentation to facilitate the formation of trusts.

<a name="stpa_276">The Schools Adjudicator rules on any objections to the proposed admission arrangements of all maintained schools, including Trust schools, and makes decisions on school organisation matters referred to him. Under the proposals in the White Paper, local authorities will be able to propose new foundation schools, propose the closure of all schools and propose expansion or the addition of SEN facilities to all categories of school. Where there is a conflict of interest, proposals will be decided by the Adjudicator. The Schools Adjudicator will have no functions in relation to Academies, special schools and Pupil Referral Units.

<a name="stpa_278">The White Paper sets out a role for local authorities as the champions of the young people and parents in their area. Local authorities are currently responsible for ensuring that there is sufficiency of supply (as laid out in Sections 13 and 14 of the Education Act 1996). Under proposals set out in the White Paper, the local authority will also be responsible for promoting choice, diversity and fair access. Local authorities also provide challenge and support to schools through the School Improvement Partner. They will have new powers to intervene early in underperforming schools. They will also be expected to consider radical action when a school is judged to be inadequate by Ofsted.

 I have overall responsibility for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). However the operations of the LSC are managed and overseen by Mark Haysom, the LSC&#039;s Chief Executive. Details of the LSC&#039;s Statutory Accounts and the guidelines and policies they use for the Government Capital Reserve are a matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom has written to the hon.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on changes in social mobility in relation to inter-generational academic achievement between 1978 and 2005.  [41449]</p>








<p><a name="st_351"><a name="60116w40.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Secretary of State&#039;s speech to IPPR on 26 July 2005 set out the Government&#039;s commitment to help develop a society which can foster greater social mobility. Her speech underlined the important role that education can play in improving life chances for all individuals, and it set out the forward looking context for our programme of reform across the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w40.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_281">An assessment of changes in inter-generational academic achievement is constrained by data limitations. However in a paper accompanying the speech, Has the Social Class Gap Narrowed in Primary Schools&quot;, analysis was presented to show how gaps in attainment between pupils from high and low income brackets (proxied by free school meal (FSM) status) have changed. The paper focused on key stage 2 between 1998 and 2004, the period in which the data allow such comparisons to be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w40.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_282">The analysis showed that performance has improved on average for both FSM and non-FSM pupils, but there was little significant change in the gap between the two groups. However it was found that schools with the highest proportions of pupils eligible for FSM did narrow the gap compared to schools with low proportions of FSM. For example in key stage 2 English, the gap in attainment at level 4 narrowed by eight percentage points in the period 1998&#150;2004 between schools with high and low proportions of FSM pupils. The full paper is available on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w40.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_283">Further analysis will be carried out over the coming months. In particular, we will look at key stages 1, 3 and 4, to the extent that data for these phases can be tracked over time on a comparable basis.

<p><a name="st_352"><a name="60116w40.html_spnew2"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The Government are committed to improving services for all children and their families, including those with learning disabilities. The Every Child Matters programme, alongside the implementation of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services and the Government&#039;s SEN strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, supports and promotes early intervention to help families of very young disabled children. In particular, the Government&#039;s Early Support Programme has been funded to improve support to parents of disabled children aged 0&#150;3 and to provide timely interventions at the very earliest stages of impairment being identified. The development of Sure Start Children&#039;s Centres will also improve the integrated support provided to families with children under 5. Disabled children and special educational needs are a priority for this programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w40.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_284">In the West Yorkshire area there are currently 24 Children&#039;s Centres (expected to rise to 76 by September 2006) and 1 Early Support Programme (with one currently being developed in Wakefield). All local authorities have now been asked to begin using the Early Support approaches and materials to review and improve services for families with young disabled children.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_285">Families of children with learning disabilities are, of course, entitled to access an additional range of local authority and health support. Details about these local services are not collected centrally and to do so would incur disproportionate cost.

 We welcome faith schools into the maintained sector as they can make an important contribution to community cohesion by promoting inclusion and developing partnerships with schools of other faiths, and with non-faith schools.

<i>[holding answer 20 December 2005]:</i> Following the Chancellor&#039;s 15 November announcement that Young Enterprise (YE) will run Enterprise Summer School Pathfinders in 2006, the DfES have been given responsibility for the delivery of the Pathfinders. &#163;2 million has been made available, and while we have had early discussions with YE about how, along with other organisations, they will deliver the Pathfinders, we are not yet at a stage to finalise detailed costings.

<a name="60116w41.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_288">The main reason for the higher figures in the most recent years is that some qualified teachers delay the start of their teaching careers. The proportion of qualifiers without teaching service usually falls substantially over the first year or two after qualification, and in the long-term has been around 9&#150;10 per cent. since 1990; the figures for the 2003 qualifiers are expected to fall to a similar level. For example, the proportion of all qualifiers without recorded teaching service by March of the year after they qualified has remained at 20 per cent. for 2001, 2002 and 2003, but for 2002 qualifiers it fell to 11 per cent. after another year and for 2001 qualifiers it fell to 8 per cent. after two.

<a name="60116w41.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_289">The Teachers Pension Scheme has only partial coverage for those teaching outside maintained schools, for example in independent schools or in further or higher education, so the true proportion is expected to be lower.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to the answer of 5 December 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1048W, on the Habitual Residence Test, if he will change the rules for non-contributory benefits so that those who make sufficient contributions to a contributory benefit to enable them to obtain half of the maximum are deemed to have passed the habitual residency test.

<p><a name="st_387"><a name="60116w45.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 The Habitual Residence Test is only applied to income-related benefits and people who qualify for a contributory benefit such as contribution based jobseeker&#039;s allowance will not be subject to the test. There is already provision in regulations which allows EEA nationals who have been working in the UK to be treated as habitually resident if they claim an income-related benefit. In line with EC case law, a returning UK national who has previously worked in the UK is likely to pass the Habitual Residence Test immediately. Non-EEA nationals who work in the UK are usually subject to immigration control and have no recourse to public funds. As such they have no access to income-related benefits and therefore would not be subject to the Habitual Residence Test.

Notes:<br>

1.Caseloads are rounded to the nearest hundred, average amounts are given to the nearest penny.<br>





2.Pension credit (PC) replaced minimum income guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto pension credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

3.PC data from the Generalised Matching Service (CMS) 100 per cent. scan taken on 16 September 2005. The caseloads have been rated up to give month-end estimates, but the average amounts have been supplied in an un-adjusted form, therefore they are representative of 16 September 2005.<br>

4.These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

Notes:<br>

Data are not collected for individual hospitals. Data were collected by health authority only prior to 2001&#150;02. Trust level data were collected from 2001&#150;02 onwards. The 2005&#150;06 data are upto Q2 2005&#150;06.<br>

We collect the number of patients admitted within one month or 28 days of a cancellation, not the number rescheduled.<br>

From 2002&#150;03, the number of patients not admitted within one month was replaced by the number of patients not admitted within 28 days.<br>

In 2002&#150;03, the number of patients not admitted within 28 days of a last minute cancellation was not collected.<br>

The number of patients not admitted within 28 days of a cancellation on the day of surgery was collected instead.<br>

A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation.<br>

For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day(Tuesday).<br>

If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation.<br>

This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br>

An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation.<br>

The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>

Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>

 The Government believe that care homes are only one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs. The Green Paper, &#039;Independence, Well-being and Choice&#039;, published in March 2005, set out the vision for adult social care. To make that vision a reality, domiciliary care must become an increasingly important element of social care provision. Domiciliary care services can help people to remain in control of their own lives. There has been substantial investment in other care settings for older people, such as domiciliary care and extra care housing. The Government recognise that most people want to live in their own homes for as long as possible.

 In 2004&#150;05, the total number of unique patients with a finished admission episode in the Countess of Chester Hospital National Health Service Foundation Trust was 37,746. Of these, 6,759 (or 17.91 per cent.) unique patients were resident in Wales.

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_304"><i>Patient counts:</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is based on a patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Each patient is only counted once, irrespective of the number of times that patient has been admitted within the year. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_305"><i>Finished admission episodes:</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_306"><i>Data quality:</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The health and social care information centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

<p><a name="st_429"><a name="60116w50.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Primary care trusts (PCTs) were notified of their budget allocations for 2006&#150;07 in early December, taking into account the current provision of services and the recent expansion of personal dental services. In both Portsmouth and other PCT areas, the recent budget allocations for local commissioning of dentistry in 2006&#150;07 onwards reflect the current provision of services in each PCT area. These budgets are ring fenced for three years and can only be used by the PCT for the provision of primary care dental services.

<p>
<a name="60116w50.html_para5">
In the future, the distribution of these resources within a PCT area will be a matter of local discretion. When a dentist leaves the local area or reduces his or her national health service commitment, the resources will return to the PCT to re-deploy according to local needs. PCTs may also commit additional funds from their overall allocation to augment the ring fenced dental budget and address local dental needs. The Department will continue to keep future budget allocations for dentistry under review.

 Trends in overweight and obesity and their relationship to other risk factors are monitored each year through the Health Survey for England. Body fatness is most commonly assessed by body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 25 to 30 is considered overweight and greater than 30, obese. There is a graded increase in the risk of total mortality and cardiovascular mortality with increasing BMI above 25. BMI combined with waist measurement is a good indicator of obesity and associated health risks. Waist circumference levels of greater than 102 centimetres in men and greater than 80 centimetres in women are associated with increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Revenue allocations to PCTs covering the period 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 were announced in February. For the two years covered by this allocation, a total of &#163;62 million has been identified nationally to invest in the school nurses, &#163;20 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;42 million in 2007&#150;08.

<a name="stpa_461">Suggestions as to possible members came both orally and in writing from Ministerial visits which took place over the summer, through a designated email account, from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, and following the Prime Minister&#039;s and my own meetings with key faith leaders and others.

<a name="60116w63.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_462">Members of the working groups were invited to participate because of their expertise and experience. A key factor was to ensure that the groups had credibility with the Muslim communities. In selecting these individuals consideration was given to those who were both challenging voices and well established figures who have the support of their community. To ensure a broad spectrum of representation, high profile and internationally known individuals were invited alongside individuals who hold a variety of different views. They were invited in a personal, unpaid capacity, rather than as representatives of their organisations and held no official status. The result of this was seven working groups with a membership total of 104.

 As part of the stocktake on the Sexual Offences Act 2003, my officials have contacted a number of organisations and sought their views on the operation of the Act. Officials also hosted a number of meetings with representatives from the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and non-governmental organisations (NGO) representing people with learning difficulties and adult victims of sexual assault. The need to increase the reporting of offending was raised during these discussions. The specific issue of increasing reporting by child victims of sexual abuse has been raised during the stocktake and is something my officials will take forward with child protection NGOs and other Government Departments in the spring of this year.

<sup>(95)</sup>For the years 1997&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes selected to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2004 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were selected:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

<sup>(101)</sup>The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for the years 



1997 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-I0) for 200I onwards. The codes used are listed below:<br>

Diabetes mellitus&#151;ICD-9 250; ICD-10 EI0-EI4.<br>

<sup>(102)</sup>Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(103)</sup>The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for diabetes as the underlying cause of death are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution.<br>

(42330)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_348">The attached Table 1 gives a comparison between the number of registered electors and the estimated population for wards in each parliamentary constituency in Essex, Hertfordshire and Greater London. Ward figures for the Unitary Authority areas formerly in Essex (Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock) and Hertfordshire (Luton) are included. Because of the length of the table it has been provided in electronic format and will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_349">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the <i>resident population</i> who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate and this can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_350">The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The electorate counts are on current ward boundaries and it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_351">The latest population data available at ward level are for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate even though the latter is definitionally closer to the resident population because the local government electorate is not available at ward level. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two time points. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies. Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_352">The population data are <i>estimates</i> and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. This margin of confidence is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority level estimates. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_353">There are a relatively small number of wards (28) where the electorate counts are more than 5 per cent. greater than the population estimate. These cases are attributable to definitional differences between the estimates and electoral counts, the margin of confidence in the ward estimates, the accuracy of the electoral registers and limitations in the methodology used to convert electoral counts to the CAS ward geography.</p>

On average measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution. There are a number of possible explanations for this. Some households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments.

Guide to quality:<br>

1. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>

2. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5%, we would expect the population average to be within the range 190 to 210.<br>
