 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> My Department does not maintain central records of investigations commissioned, circulated or recommended by medical officers on the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder among serving or former members of the Armed Forces. However, I am not aware that my Department has commissioned, or has been recommended by medical officers to commission, investigations specifically into the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder among serving or former members of the Armed Forces over the past 20 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 20 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>460-61</i>, on RN Base Faslane, in which year the current civilian system of monitoring started at RN Naval Base Clyde; and what proportion of Navy supervisors were qualified to City and Guilds standards prior to that date.  [69087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The use of civilian Health Physics Monitoring Supervisors was introduced at the Clyde Naval Base around November 1989.
<P>

<a name="90210w01.html_para1">Prior to this date, there were two categories of supervisors in the area of Health Physics, both were Royal Naval personnel. Monitoring Supervisors were in charge of the administration of the Monitors, while Radiological Protection Supervisors maintained an oversight of the Monitoring aspects. The latter were qualified to City and Guilds Stage 2 in Radiation Safety Practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what criteria he uses in establishing the preferment to be given to <i>(a)</i> UK only and <i>(b)</i> UK/European bids for procurement contracts when the competition is with non-EU contractors.  [69469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The MOD has a policy of open international competition whenever this is possible. A wide range of factors are considered by the MOD when making procurement decisions, including: long term value-for-money, security of supply, UK technological capabilities and the benefits to MOD of potential exports.

<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what criteria he uses to assess the export potential for UK-designed and produced equipment when considering bids made by competitors for defence procurement contracts.  [69468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 MOD assessments of the export potential of British defence equipment are based on a judgment of the potential requirements in the market place, the level of competition the UK company is likely to face, and the company's own assessment of its export potential, tempered by our knowledge of their previous record of export success.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish his Department's collation and assessment of responses to each of the Government's public consultations.  [69774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I assume that my hon. Friend is referring to public consultation conducted only by the Ministry of Defence. No single collation and assessment of all public consultation conducted by the Ministry of Defence exists. Our largest public consultation exercise to date was that conducted to inform the Strategic Defence Review. Where consent was given by the authors, copies of submissions made to the Ministry of Defence in the course of that exercise have been placed in the Library of the House. The assessment of those submissions formed part of the Strategic Defence Review, the recommendations of which were reported to Parliament on 8 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1073-96.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to fund a war memorial to service women.  [70174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 It has been a long-standing policy of successive Governments that the cost of memorials is usually met not from public funds, but from private donations or public subscription. However, the Government have nothing but the utmost respect and gratitude for those women who served and died in the service of their country.
<P>

<a name="90210w01.html_para2">We are aware of a campaign to erect a memorial to Service women. Although the Government are unable to assist financially with this project, I have announced in the House on several occasions since 20 May 1997, that if the necessary funds were raised from public subscription or private donation, my Department would be more than happy to provide representation at any dedication ceremony.

[70242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding</i> <i>answer 9 February 1999]:</i> The Defence Export Services Organisation became aware of Senator Pinochet's visit in the context of other business; DESO was not involved in arrangements for the visit and there is no record of the information being relayed further. In addition, as my noble Friend Lord Hoyle explained on 11 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, <i>House of Lords</i>, column <i>5</i>, other officials within the central staffs of the MOD had been informed of the Senator's impending visit on 16 September 1998 by officials at the FCO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1998]:</i> It is not yet known whether an oral course of pentosan polysulphate would be effective as a prophylaxis against nvCJD, or what dose or duration of treatment would be required, or what adverse side effects there might be from its use for this purpose. Therefore it is not possible to calculate the cost of an oral course as an effective prophylaxis against nvCJD.
<P>

<a name="90210w02.html_para0">The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) met on 11 January and considered the potential use of pentosan polysulphate as a prophylactic. The Committee is in the process of preparing its advice to Ministers. The Committee on the Safety of Medicines is also considering this use of pentosan. The Government are awaiting the advice from these committees.

[69683]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The European Union guidance came into operation in September 1997. As the development times for medicinal products are relatively long, there will be a delay before trials in children are submitted with all relevant applications for authorisation of medicinal products.
<P>

<a name="90210w02.html_para1">Where a medicinal product has an anticipated therapeutic benefit in children, the applicant is asked to provide details of a paediatric development plan if this is not already included in the dossier supporting the application for marketing authorisation. Information relevant to paediatric use, based on the availability or not of paediatric data, is included in the product particulars. The EU guidance on the investigation of medicinal products in children applies to products already on the market as well as to new products. Information on those companies which have so far complied with this guidance in other member states is not available, neither is information on those products which are being developed in accordance with this guidance in other member states.

<P>

<a name="90210w02.html_para2">European guidance is not legally binding on pharmaceutical companies and no steps have been taken to assess the costs to the National Health Service of making guidance on medicines for children legally binding on pharmaceutical companies. If the guidance does not have the effect of increasing the availability of appropriate medicinal products to children, there is scope for the United Kingdom and other Member States to raise with the European Commission the question of whether legislative steps should be taken to strengthen the regulatory framework.

<a name="90210w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The recent publicity surrounding the announcement of the establishment of the working group on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and the involvement of many health professionals, academics, patients and carers in its work has already raised awareness of CFS/ME. The best practice guidance that the Group has been tasked with producing will also raise understanding and awareness. In the mean time, we will continue to work with the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Alliance to promote awareness and understanding of this distressing and debilitating condition.

 The executive and advisory non- departmental public bodies (NDPBs) sponsored by the Department are actively seeking ways of operating in a more open way consistent with the recommendations of "Quangos--Opening the doors". A number of executive NDPBs already issue summary reports of meetings where practicable and these are in the public domain; these include the National Consumer Council; the Gas Consumer Council; the Post Office Users Councils; the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and the Research Councils. All executive NDPBs with board members have a register of their members' interests and these are available to the public, for example the Coal Authority publishes its register in its Annual Report and Accounts and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission place its register on its website. There is no statutory requirement in legislation for this sort of activity; however it represents good practice and is entirely consistent with "Quangos--Opening the doors".
<P>

<a name="90210w03.html_para5">In the case of advisory NDPBs, the Council for Science and Technology produces summaries of meetings and issues press notices on its website, which also contains information on meetings, events, and work in progress; it is also due to publish a register of members interest shortly.

It has a register of members' interests as do others, for example the LINK/Teaching Company Scheme Board, the Measurement Advisory Committee, the Spectrum Management Advisory Group, the Industrial Development Advisory Board and the seven Regional Industrial Development Boards. Other advisory NDPBs are taking steps to have registers of interest in place shortly, in line with the recommendations in "Quangos--Opening the doors". As in the case of executive NDPBs, there are no statutory requirements for this.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> The United Kingdom has made clear to all concerned our support for the main aims of the draft copyright Directive. However, we have expressed strong reservations on the over-prescriptive approach on exceptions to rights, many of which exceptions have little or no effect on the internal market. In particular, we remain firmly opposed to a general requirement to impose levies in return for all private copying exceptions, no matter how minor. The Government wish to maintain a fair and reasonable balance between the interests of rights holders and those of users of rights and intermediaries, including network operators and service providers. We have also called for clarification of the provision on technological protection measures, while supporting its general aim, and have welcomed the fact that liability of intermediaries is being considered as a horizontal issue in the draft electronic commerce Directive.

technology allows data to be more easily disseminated and used or copied, and effective copyright protection for the electronic age is essential. Without the confidence that rights are properly protected worldwide, there would be no incentive for suppliers of information to make works available on-line and therefore no global information society. The Government believe the copyright Directive should prove to be of considerable benefit to UK rights holders in the context of Europe as whole, and we have broadly welcomed it. However, we will also continue to press for more flexibility for member states in the exceptions provisions of the Directive. Rights holders, users of rights and intermediaries are all key players in ensuring the success of the new services of the information age.

<a name="90210w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 This has been another very successful year for the charter mark awards scheme with 508 awards being made--the highest number ever. There were a record number of applications from virtually all types of public service in the UK, and there were 128 second time winners and 18 third time winners. It was particularly pleasing to note that there were 74 winners of the award who had been unsuccessful in the previous year.
<P>

<a name="90210w05.html_para0">Charter mark is making a real contribution to improving public services and we will continue to develop the scheme to make it even more effective.

 The Better Government for Older People initiative, an important part of our commitment to modernising government, has valuable lessons to teach about developing improved services that are more responsive to the needs of their users. Next month we are putting in place a Learning Network so that many more local authorities across the UK can share in this learning and experience. Well over two hundred authorities have already expressed an interest in joining the Network.

 Local Government is a key partner in the drive to improve public service effectiveness and responsiveness and is involved at all levels in the production of the Modernising Government White Paper. For example, Sir Jeremy Beecham, Chairman of the Local Government Association attends meetings of the Ministerial Group on Better Government. I welcome a wide debate on these matters and I recently launched the Modernising Government discussion forum on the Downing Street website, to encourage people to participate in the consultation process.

 Her Majesty in Council has today approved an Order extending the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to an additional one hundred and eleven executive non- departmental public bodies and to forty-seven advisory non-departmental public bodies which have direct dealings with members of the public. This fulfils the commitment that the Government gave in "Quangos: Opening the Doors"--published on 29 June 1988--and will substantially increase the avenues of redress available to members of the public who wish to complain about their treatment by a non-departmental public body. It is another example of this Government's determination to ensure that all non-departmental public bodies are properly and fully accountable to both Parliament and the public for their actions.

<a name="90210w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In the case of Ropaigealach <i>v</i> Barclays Bank plc (Times Law Report, January 6 1999) the Court of Appeal held that a mortgage lender was entitled to exercise its common law right to take possession of a mortgaged dwelling house without first obtaining a court order. The protection provided to the borrower by section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970 applied only where the lender had brought an action for possession.
<P>

<a name="90210w06.html_para2">There are restrictions on the exercise of a mortgage lender's common law right to take possession of a mortgaged dwelling. The right must be exercised peaceably. Use of violence would be an offence under the Criminal Law Act 1977, and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 provides protection for tenants occupying the property.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> I understand that Canada and Russia have not yet ratified the agreement on humane trapping standards for animals caught in leghold traps agreed with the European Community in July 1997. I also understand that the USA has not ratified the agreed minute agreed with the European Community in December 1997. We will look for suitable opportunities to discuss with the Commission and EU Ministers what further progress can be made in pressing Canada, Russia and USA to ratify these agreements.

<a name="90210w07.html_para0">Her Majesty's Customs and Excise are responsible for ensuring implementation of the import ban on certain furs into the United Kingdom under Regulation 3254/91. In the case of all measures prohibiting the importation of goods, it is standard procedure for detailed written guidance to be issued to Customs officers as to the manner of regulating legitimate trade and the handling of illegal consignments. This practice was followed in the case of furs caught in leghold traps. I also understand that since the customs entry documents for virtually all commercial imports are processed electronically, and because all imported goods have a specific "commodity code" number which must be declared by importers on those documents, Customs officials are able to identify furs which may be prohibited from entering the United Kingdom under the Regulation.

<a name="90210w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 It is a requirement of the Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC) that individual discharges to groundwater should be subject to prior authorisation. It is for Member States, in accordance with their treaty obligations, to transpose these requirements into national law. The Groundwater Regulations 1998 complete transposition of the Directive by requiring authorisation of the disposal of listed substances to land, as distinct from a register of businesses.

<a name="90210w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Groundwater Regulations 1998 provide that disposals, or tipping for the purpose of disposal to land of listed substances, require prior authorisation. Transitional arrangements provide that applications which relate to an activity substantially the same as one carried out by the applicant previously, and made prior to 1 April 1999 (when the main provisions in the Regulations come into force), will be deemed approved until finally disposed of the by Agency. My officials wrote on 21 December 1998, to draw attention to these arrangements, to those consulted on the draft regulations, including the National Farmers Union, Tenant Farmers Association and the Farming Union of Wales. Draft guidance will be published for consultation as soon as possible.

 The Department does not hold this information.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) when he will announce the Government's intentions as to which roads will make up the GLA road network, for which Transport for London will be the highway and traffic authority;  [71002]
<P>
<UL>(2) what role Transport for London will have in relation to planning applications which affect GLA roads.  [71003]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w08.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Our White Paper, "A Mayor and Assembly for London", made clear that we start from the presumption that the GLA Road Network should be based on the primary route and red route networks. This base network is made up of some 220 miles of trunk roads and 105 miles of borough roads. We issued a consultation document last summer on whether roads might be added to or deleted from this base network to form the GLA Road Network. We received 93 responses to this consultation exercise. A summary of the responses has been placed in the Library. Copies of individual responses are available from the library of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para2">We have carefully considered the representations received and we have concluded that there should be some adjustments to the network as envisaged by the White 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 1999 : Column: 246</I><P>
Paper. Those are set out in the table and shown on the two maps which have today been deposited in the Library. In outer London, there are some small adjustments primarily to reflect the construction of new roads. In central London, we propose the addition of roads which act as key distributor routes for the area within the Inner Ring Road.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para3">The resulting network gives Transport for London a clear and coherent set of roads to manage. The Mayor's Integrated Transport Strategy will set the framework within which Transport for London and boroughs will work. It is important that the Mayor, through Transport for London, should be responsible for key roads to help facilitate improved co-ordination in the movement of people and goods. In particular, direct involvement in roads in the central area will help the Mayor ensure there is a balanced approach to accessibility and traffic management not only to and from the City and West End but also for the developing south bank of the Thames.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para4">This GLA Road Network is broadly the same size as the base network and the transfer of about 220 miles of trunk roads from the Highways Agency to Transport for London represents a significant shift of responsibility from central Government.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para5">Subject to Parliamentary procedures, we intend that the network will be formally defined by Order to come into effect when Transport for London is brought into being. In defining the network, we are minded to include those small sections of side roads which are necessary to ensure that the main road is managed safely and efficiently.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para6">We have looked carefully at the powers Transport for London should have as highway authority in relation to planning applications which affect GLA roads. Our conclusion is that Transport for London should be consulted by the local planning authority where the proposed development would materially affect the volume or type of traffic on a GLA road; require direct access to a GLA road or be likely to prejudice the improvement or construction of a GLA road. We do not envisage that the Mayor should have the power to direct the planning authority over highway related matters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what leisure facilities are planned to be made available for members of the National Assembly; and if he will make a statement.  [69218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have asked for a review of leisure facilities available to Welsh Office staff in Cardiff and elsewhere. Most of the staff to be employed by the Welsh Assembly will transfer from the Welsh Office in Cathays Park where the leisure facilities available to staff are quite limited. There is a fitness suite in Cathays Park, known as the Welsh Office Crown Building Fitness Centre, opened in May 1992, on the initiative of a number of staff. The suite is run as a private club by a committee of staff and its use is restricted to club members. The Department provides the accommodation in the mezzanine of Cathays Park but the equipment is funded by members' subscriptions and loans from the Civil Service Sports Council.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para7">There is also a Welsh Office Sports and Social Association (WOSSA) funded by subscription from staff, for which the Welfare Department provides the secretariat. However this has not been very active in recent years and any social and sporting activity carried on within the Department is generally organised by individual staff members, sometimes with the help of grants from WOSSA. Other than the support given in the form of basic accommodation, in the case of the fitness suite, the Department does not provide staff leisure facilities in Cardiff or elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="90210w08.html_para8">Members and officials working in Crickhowell House will be provided with an induction pack which will list the leisure facilities in the Bay and surrounding area. There is no room at present in Crickhowell House to provide any facility similar to that at Cathays Park, but as additional space becomes available, in due course, it may be possible to provide leisure facilities. Following the review, recommendations will be prepared for consideration by the Assembly.

<P>
<a name="90210w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I am very pleased to announce that John Baker, who is Chairman of Medeva plc, has agreed to investigate the commercialisation of public sector research establishments (PSRE) outputs, with the view to making recommendations for increasing the rate of their exploitation. The study takes forward a commitment made in the Competitiveness White Paper, published last December. Mr. Baker will be working closely with HM Treasury and the Office of Science and Technology, who are collaborating on the initiative.
<P>

<a name="90210w10.html_para8">It is time we took a close look at how we maximise the commercial potential of the high quality research that is carried out by the PSREs, where it is possible to do so. We need to identify the barriers to commercialising research and make sure that the PSREs share the best ways of overcoming them. The results should be of great benefit to the PSREs and the Departments that sponsor them.
<P>

<a name="90210w10.html_para9">The intention is that the study will look in particular at the coverage of commercialisation in research contracts between PSREs and their sponsors, the organisation of the knowledge transfer process and incentives for PSRE staff.

 There are no special fiscal incentives to encourage recycling of electronic equipment. Businesses make a commercial judgment on whether or not to recycle any equipment. Where they do so the cost of recycling is treated for tax purposes in the same way as any other business cost. However, tax relief already exists for firms that give gifts of trading stock, or equipment they have used in their trade, to recognised educational establishments.

 The Government have already implemented major recommendations of the review by making available resources to enable Customs to deploy additional staff to tackle the smuggling of alcohol and tobacco. Sixty-six new staff were in post at the south-east Channel Ports by the end of November 1998, and the remainder will be in post at other ports and inland by the end of February 1999, taking the total number of new staff to over 100.

 The Prison Service's six-month review of the Quantum project announced on 10 August 1998 has been concluded. I have seen the review report. The Director General and the Executive Committee of the Prison Service endorses the recommendation made in the report to take the project forward by means of a framework agreement in partnership with one of the two short-listed suppliers. The contract will cover an Information Technology infrastructure service, joint development of a strategy for Information Technology-based business change and an agreed mechanism for implementing business change on a partnership basis.

<P>
<a name="90210w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Canavan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the Government's plans for legislation on freedom of information.  [68642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Freedom of information is an essential component of the Government's programme to modernise British politics, as set out in our manifesto. This programme of constitutional reform aims to involve people more closely in the decisions which affect their lives. Giving people greater access to information is fundamental to that aim.
<P>

<a name="90210w11.html_para3">The effect of a Freedom of Information Act will be that for the first time, every citizen in the country will have 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 1999 : Column: 258</I><P>
the right of access to information held by bodies across the public sector. I believe this will radically transform the relationship between Government and citizens.
<P>

<a name="90210w11.html_para4">The Government published their proposals for Freedom of Information in December 1997 in a White Paper entitled, "Your Right to Know". The Home Office took over responsibility for Freedom of Information legislation from the Cabinet Office in the Summer, to enable the policy to be developed alongside other constitutional measures, such as human rights and data protection. Since then, we have devoted a great deal of effort towards translating the White Paper's proposals into a draft Bill. That process is very nearly complete, and the Government will publish a draft Bill as soon as it is ready.
<P>

<a name="90210w11.html_para5">There are those who feel that the Government should have produced a Bill sooner. I must emphasise, however, that any delay is not an indication of a lack of commitment on the part of the Government. It is quite the reverse. Indeed, we have devoted additional resources to work on Freedom of Information. This is a complex subject. There have been a great number of issues to resolve; for example: the need to address existing legislation which impinges on freedom of information, including that which arises from our international legal obligations; the need to consider the implications of devolution; the practicalities of the enforcement mechanism. These are just a few of the issues which have occupied us for some time, but I am convinced that we are right to take the time to get the detail right. If we are to achieve our aims then we must have an Act that is realistic and workable.
<P>

<a name="90210w11.html_para6">We therefore look forward to a thorough and informed debate when we publish the draft Bill. There will be a period of public consultation, during which the Bill will receive pre-legislative scrutiny by the Select Committee for Public Administration. We hope and expect that this 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 1999 : Column: 259</I><P>
process of scrutiny will lead to a more effective Bill. Following this period of consultation, the Government are committed to introducing the Bill to Parliament as soon as the legislative programme allows.
<P>

<a name="90210w11.html_para7">A Freedom of Information Act will radically change the way Government conducts its business. Government alone cannot bring about the cultural change necessary in public sector bodies for a more open approach in their relationship with the public. It will be for a wide variety of public bodies to implement the legislation, and cultural change must take place in all of those bodies if the Freedom of Information Act is to succeed. During the consultation period, I will set out my proposals for delivering this cultural change.

<a name="90210w11.html_para8">In July 1998 the Government announced a new &#163;250 million crime reduction programme.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The New Deal for young unemployed people is developing well in London. The latest Government Statistical Service figures to the end of November 1998 show that in the London area of the Employment Service London and South East Region, over 31,000 young people have joined the New Deal for 18-24 year olds. While most are still on the Gateway phase of the programme, over 5,000 have found unsubsidised jobs; 950 have been placed into subsidised jobs; over 3,000 have joined the Full-Time Education and Training option; nearly 750 the Voluntary Sector option; and some 330 the Environment Task Force. A comparison with other Employment Service Regions in England and with Scotland and Wales is set out in the table at annex A.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>More generally, the effectiveness of New Deal is being assessed through a comprehensive evaluation strategy within which a number of qualitative and quantitative surveys are being carried out. The findings from these surveys, as and when they are available, form part of our continuous improvement strategy in that they help identify those aspects of our processes which are working well and those that are capable of being improved. Findings from the evaluation surveys are communicated within the ES and to our partners who form part of over 40 partnerships in London responsible for New Deal delivery. Each partnership will draw up an action plan for performance improvement over the next 12 months, based on the evidence from local management information and evaluation findings.</FONT></UL>

2. It should be noted that the Government First Release national figures also include those outcomes where a Regional Office is not known.

 We are ensuring that the Employment Service develops effective links with local communities.

The New Deal personal advisers are trained in equal opportunities awareness, and given guidance on the problems facing people from ethnic minorities. I am monitoring the participation of ethnic minorities within all the New Deal programmes to ensure they are treated fairly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what research his Department has commissioned into the effectiveness of <i>(a)</i> integrated curriculum work and <i>(b)</i> subject specialist teaching in improving children's learning in primary schools.  [69793]<P>

<a name="90210w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> The Department has not recently commissioned research on the effectiveness of integrated curriculum work. But the current guidance on Key Stage 2 curriculum planning produced by the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority (now QCA) in 1995 addresses this issue. The frameworks for teaching literacy and numeracy produced by the Department, together with model schemes of work give the flexibility to plan through integrated themes based on the programmes of study.
<P>

<a name="90210w14.html_para0">The Teacher Training Agency has recently published reports of research on both effective teachers of literacy and effective teachers of numeracy. These reports and evidence from primary school inspections suggests that subject knowledge is a significant factor in improving children's learning, but that this need not always be taught through subject specialist teaching or by subject specialist teachers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will reduce the distance between primary schools which is used as the criterion for considering provision of additional accommodation; and if he will make a statement.  [70192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w14.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department will shortly be seeking views from local education authorities on the arrangements for the schools capital expenditure programme in 2000-01. One of the areas likely to be covered is Basic Need.

<a name="90210w14.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what grants have been made, or are planned to be made, by his Department to Devon County Council in addition to revenue support grant in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98, <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 and <i>(c)</i> 1999-2000.  [69365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Details of the grants, in addition to revenue support grant, made available, by the Department for Education and Employment to Devon County Council in 1997-98 and 1998-99 and planned to be made in 1999-2000 are shown in the following tables. From 1 April 1998, Torbay and Plymouth became separate unitary authorities, the figures across the first two years are therefore not directly comparable. The allocation of the grants for New Deal for Schools and the reduction of class sizes for 1999-2000 have not yet been made. For the Standards Fund the figures shown include the grant made by the Department and the contribution made by the local education authority.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> In 1998-99 education action zones were able to bid for funding for work related learning and the special early years programme. From 1999-2000 these programmes will be incorporated within the education action zones budget and bid for as a separate competitive exercise. Education action zones did not come into existence until after the 1997-98 bidding round.

<P>
<a name="90210w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment of the initiatives in 1998-99 involving competitive bidding from local education authorities, including education action zones, and the equivalent initiatives from 1999-2000, how many bids by each of the education action zones were <i>(a)</i> made and <i>(b)</i> successful .  [63311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 There have been no programmes in which Education Action Forums (EAFs) have competed with local education authorities. Unlike LEAs, EAFs do not bid for Standards Fund grant, or for New Deal for Schools capital. Of course, schools within EAZs can still benefit from these programmes through LEA bids. EAZs have been able to bid for work-related learning and Early Years in a separate exercise funded from the EAZ programme budget. In future years these activities will be funded from EAZs' own budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Scottish Office Crime Prevention Unit has responsibility for co-ordinating crime prevention in Scotland. This is done in collaboration with Scottish police forces, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and a wide range of national agencies.
<P>

<a name="90210w15.html_para6">On 16 June 1998, I announced to the Scottish Grand Committee a new community safety strategy for Scotland--"Safer Communities Through Partnership-- A Strategy for Action". The Strategy for Action, which was jointly agreed by The Scottish Office, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, is designed to reduce crime and improve community safety through well co-ordinated partnerships between public, private and voluntary bodies.
<P>

<a name="90210w15.html_para7">I welcome the fact that a number of partnerships have already been formed. To support this, The Scottish Office will publish, in May, comprehensive guidance to assist in the development of such partnerships. It will include examples of current good practice.
<P>

<a name="90210w15.html_para8">The Scottish Office constantly promotes crime prevention initiatives. The latest example is a renewed campaign against domestic violence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what guidance his Department has issued concerning arrangements for consultation between the police and the local community in each police force area; and if he will make a statement.  [69626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Justice Charter for Scotland requires police forces to consult their local communities and take their views into account when setting standards of service and deciding priorities. In addition, guidance was issued to police forces in March 1998 about the way in which "User Surveys" should be designed to measure public opinion on the police service. I am satisfied that police forces in Scotland fully appreciate the value of local consultation; have the necessary arrangements in place to engage with the public; and use the consultation process to inform their decisions on policing policy and priorities.

<P>
<P>

 Allocation of funding to individual Higher Education Institutions including the Edinburgh College of Art, Glasgow School of Art and the Royal Academy of Music and Drama is a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. The Council was aware of the findings of the Sutherland Report in making decisions on funding. However, as the report related to small institutions in England, and the SHEFC unit of resource for Arts, Design & the Performing Arts is substantially higher than that for Drama, Music and Art in England, the Council decided it would not be appropriate to award a funding premium.

 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate is responsible for the prosecution of crime in Scotland. Guidance to procurators fiscal has been issued following legislative provisions which have introduced variable and increased levels of fiscal fines; extended the jurisdiction and powers of the courts; and created new offences and penalties. Further guidance has been issued to procurators fiscal to ensure a consistent approach to the use of fiscal fines and to encourage them to make more extensive use of this alternative to prosecution in the district court. He informs me that the choice of court is determined by considerations of jurisdiction, the gravity of the offence, the offender's record and the likely penalty. The details of the guidance issued to procurators fiscal about prosecution policy are confidential.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 1999]:</i> Last year, the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned a report specifically with a view to helping Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries achieve millennium compliance in their civil nuclear power reactors. That report, entitled <i>The Millennium Problem</i>--<i>Raising the Awareness of Nuclear Power Station Operators and Regulatory Authorities in Central and Eastern Europe</i>, was translated into Russian and distributed to every nuclear plant and regulatory authority in the region. In addition the DTI has, so far, offered &#163;62,000 towards the International Atomic Energy Agency's extra budgetary activities this year specifically pursuing the international effort to assist the countries concerned in their efforts to avoid Year 2000 problems and to carry out contingency planning.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given to my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard) on 14 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>291.</i> The charges would be levied at slaughterhouses and cutting plants. The extent to which

these costs are passed on to primary producers is a commercial matter for the industry. The industry already bears the cost of removal and disposal of Specified Risk Material. We see no reason why the tax payer should bear the cost of enforcing these activities.

 The Ministry has not commissioned any research into the production of genetically modified grasses to be used for grazing. However, the Ministry has commissioned a desk study to assess the possible implications for agriculture should genetically modified grasses and legumes be introduced. The work is due to be completed in July 1999 and we would hope to make the final report available soon afterwards.

<P>
<a name="90210w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The proposals that we published for consultation on 27 January envisage a levy that would apply to all food retail and catering premises required to register under the Food Premises (Registration) Regulations 1991 (as amended), with the exception of premises dealing in wrapped confectionery, soft drinks, crisps and similar wrapped products. While chain stores and stores over 10,000 sq ft. that fall within this definition would be liable for payment, the proposals do not contain any specific provisions relating to these types of premises.

 The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole and not to one particular part. For the 1999 EU Budget, the UK's gross financing share before abatement is 18.15 per cent.

 We attach importance to the right to freedom of religion and expression. We were therefore concerned to learn about the deportation from the Maldives in July 1998 of nineteen foreign nationals for alleged proselytising activity and the detention of several Maldivian citizens who had apparently converted to Christianity. We understand that all those detained have now been released. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90210w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Our Embassy in Santiago telephoned the Resident Clerk late on 9 October following inquiries from the press about reports that Senator Pinochet had died that afternoon in London. The Resident Clerk obtained confirmation from the Chilean Embassy that the reports were untrue and informed our Embassy. The Embassy's subsequent note to the Department recording this exchange was received after Senator Pinochet was detained.
