 There is currently no standardised approach to information collection and needs assessment for the receipt of housing-related support through the supporting people programme. Nor are there currently standardised arrangements which cover supporting people and care assessments together. Arrangements are instead set by, and vary between, local authorities and between providers. There may be some duplication between the information collected for supporting people services and that collected through the Single Assessment Process, but in some cases this is already being handled in an integrated way.

 Supporting people is a grant programme for the provision of housing-related support services (or, in excellent authorities, welfare services). It does not fund health or care services. The power of the Secretary of State to issue guidance relates to the administration and application of supporting people grants and, as such, guidance on the use of supporting people funding does not directly discuss meeting health or care related needs.

Notes:<br>

1. More up-to-date figures on the cost of the contracted-out rebate are available but the most recent for the GDP are those published in the Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund. For comparison purposes it has been necessary, therefore, to use the same source for the cost of the rebate.<br>

2. Costs are for GB receipts and are in 2003&#150;04 prices terms&#151;the basis for projections in the Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund.<br>

3. The Quinquennial Review does not extend to the Northern Ireland Insurance Fund so the figures provided are for GB rather than the UK.<br>

 New scheme funding requirements will replace the minimum funding requirement for private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes from 30 December 2005. This flexible framework will give trustees greater leverage in framing the scheme&#039;s funding strategy and determining the contributions paid by the employer. In addition, from 6 April 2006 current HM Revenue and Customs requirements for pension schemes to reduce an actuarial surplus will be abolished. This will remove a factor which may have played a part in some decisions to allow pension fund contribution holidays in the past. We do not believe, however, that it would be appropriate to prevent a contribution holiday where the scheme is sufficiently well-funded, and the trustees and the sponsoring employer consider that it is appropriate in the circumstances.

Prior to the introduction of stakeholder pensions in April 2001, the Government advised that it would undertake a review of a number of provisions contained in the Stakeholder Pension Regulations 2000 after they had been in operation for three years. This review was concluded in October 2004, and after careful consideration, it was decided that no changes were necessary at that time. It was, however, recognised that developments in train in the wider pensions field might have a bearing on those provisions and that it might be necessary to look at them again at some point over the coming years.

<p>
<a name="51214w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_59">Following the Sandier report in July 2002, which looked at medium and long-term retail savings in the UK, we reviewed the stakeholder pensions charge cap. This resulted in the annual management charge being revised from 1 per cent. of the value of the fund a year to 1.5 per cent. for the first 10 years of membership, reducing to 1 per cent. thereafter for stakeholder pension policies bought on or after 6 April 2005. We also introduced the requirement for providers to offer lifestyling, the process where at least five years before retirement the members pension savings are gradually moved into less volatile arrangements.
