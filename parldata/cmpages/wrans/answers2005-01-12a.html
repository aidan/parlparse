<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="50112w01.html_wqn0"><b> Richard Younger-Ross: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what projections she has made of the amount of electricity used on the Government Estate which is sourced from good quality combined heat and power; and whether she expects the 15 per cent. target for such electricity to be met in 2010.  [205246]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50112w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 0.8 per cent. of electricity used on the Government Estate when the target was set, around 23 GWh/yr, was Good Quality CHP electricity. Departments are required to put in place strategies for delivering the CHP and other targets in accordance with the Energy chapter of the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. We project that this will amount to 350&#150;400 GWh/yr for Good Quality CHP in 2010. This assumes the 2010 target of increasing energy efficiency by 15 per cent. is achieved.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="50112w01.html_wqn1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her most recent estimate is of the daily energy consumption resulting from the use of standby units on televisions; and if she will make a statement.  [206025]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50112w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s Market Transformation Programme estimates that the 60 million television sets in the UK consume approximately 3 million Kwh per day while they are in standby mode&#151;approximately 8 per cent. of their total average daily energy consumption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In order to try to reduce the overall energy consumed by televisions the Market Transformation Programme (www.mtprog.com) has been encouraging manufacturers to reduce both the &quot;on&quot; and the &quot;standby&quot; power consumption of televisions through the adoption of design improvements, an EU-wide voluntary code of conduct, and best practice guidelines and targets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The EU-wide voluntary agreement on televisions has been particularly successful in reducing the average energy consumed by televisions in standby mode with the majority of new televisions sold in the UK soon to consume around 1 watt of power in standby mode rather than the 3&#150;8 watts consumed by older models. We expect this agreement to be extended to cover additional consumer electronics shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">In addition, the Government&quot;s initiative on sustainable procurement, announced last autumn, includes a requirement for Government Departments which purchase televisions to specify televisions with standby power requirements of less that 1 watt.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to introduce a policy on the control of feral animals.  [206627]</p>









<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50112w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We have no plans to introduce a general policy to cover all feral animals. The management of wildlife, whether feral or not, is dealt with on a species by species basis, as and when control is required, with action being taken by a range of different bodies, and by individual landowners and occupiers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">One of the key recommendations arising from the Working Group report on the Review of Non-Native Species Policy (2003) was that policies should be established with respect to the management and control of invasive non-native species currently present or newly arrived in the wild. To this end research has been commissioned by English Nature to establish an environmental audit of non-native species within England (replicating a similar audit of species in Scotland by Scottish Natural Heritage), and by Defra to develop a standard methodology for carrying out risk assessments on species, pathways and receptor habitats. The results of this research will inform Government policy on the control of non-native species in the wild.

The Home Secretary&#039;s Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet, established in 2001, meets on a quarterly basis with additional meetings of the taskforce subgroups and working parties taking place in a regular basis. A series of discussion forums have been held with young people about reducing the likelihood of them being victims of mobile phone theft. In August 2004 Ministers from the Home Office and Department for Education and Skill wrote to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) encouraging them to hold workshops on youth robbery. Half have already done so, the other half are planning to. A conference on this issue on 4 October 2004 also included a workshop on youth robbery.

<a name="50112w06.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_32">In addition to the discussion forums, conferences and focus groups held on crime reduction, other events have been organised to tackle antisocial behaviour and youth crime. For example an International Seminar on Youth Crime held in October 2002, examined the reduction of crime committed both by young people and against young people. Preparations for this included a meeting with the youth crime focus group and the organisation of a focus group in Huntercombe Youth Offenders Institute.

<a name="stpa_40">Those decisions were then challenged on various grounds before the High Court in December 2003, at which Mr. Roberts was represented by the SAA in closed session. The Court of Appeal heard the case in July 2004. In dismissing the challenges on both occasions, the courts considered that the Parole Board had the inherent power and discretion under Section 32(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and the Parole Board Rules to adopt the necessary procedures to enable it to perform its risk assessment task. In Mr. Roberts&#039; case, the courts held that the Parole Board&#039;s adoption of the SAA process, as a wholly exceptional measure in the circumstances of that case, was proportionate, correct and fair to Mr. Roberts.

 In September 2004 the Department received representations from Peter Caton, Campaign Co-ordinator of the Stand Up Sit Down campaign asking the Government to consider their proposals for the reintroduction of standing at Premier League and First Division football matches.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_51">The Department has also received a number of letters from Members of Parliament following representations they have received from their constituents asking the Government to consider the Stand Up Sit Down proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para7">
Having carefully considered the Stand Up Sit Down solutions, it is clear that these measures would run against the Government&#039;s current policy that football grounds in the top two divisions shall be all-seated. There is also a concern that the proposal would seek to introduce standing accommodation without the safeguards that are currently required on standing terraces in the lower divisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_52">The all-seater policy has been in place since 1991, following Lord Justice Taylor&#039;s report into the Hillsborough disaster. Lord Taylor summarised his position by saying that there is no cure-all solution that will achieve complete safety and solve all problems to do with crowd behaviour and control. However he was satisfied that seating does more to achieve those objectives than any other measure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_53">Following a pre-election commitment, the Government reviewed the all-seater policy in consultation with the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) in 1997. That review concurred with Lord Taylor&#039;s conclusion that seated accommodation is demonstrably safer than standing accommodation, regardless of how the stadium is configured.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_54">The FLA&#039;s figures for injuries at UK stadia over recent seasons consistently show that spectators are approximately twice as likely to be injured at grounds where standing is permitted, compared to all-seater stadia.

<a name="stpa_56">I understand that the FLA has agreed to meet Mr. Caton to discuss the proposals further.

<p>
<a name="50112w09.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_57">It is right that the Government should consider any representations made regarding standing at football matches. As Lord Taylor recognised, the debate about the virtues of seating at football matches is a controversial one and must be approached with sensitivity and an open mind.
