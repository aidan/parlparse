 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if she will make a statement on the future provision of sites for the disposal of hazardous waste.  [160300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government recognise that implementation of the Landfill Directive will have a significant impact on the disposal of hazardous waste. In particular the ending of co-disposal from 16&nbsp;July 2004 will lead to a reduction in the number of landfill sites taking hazardous waste. Coupled with the requirements for treatment of hazardous waste prior to landfill, this will lead to better management of hazardous waste and more incentive on producers to minimise the amount of waste produced.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what support she plans to give to Challenge Fund proposals with regard to waste disposal; and if she will make a statement.  [156388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) has been established to help push England's waste management practices up the waste hierarchy, and specifically to divert increasing amounts of waste away from landfill. Properly known as the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund, the Challenge Fund is managed by WIP and does not provide funding for final disposal facilities. Rather, it provides local authorities with opportunities to pursue schemes that reduce the volume of the household waste stream, and to increase the amount of household waste recycled and composted. From 2005&#150;06, the Challenge Fund will be replaced by a new Waste Management Performance Reward Grant, and Defra is currently consulting on its proposals for the design of this grant.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para0">It is recognised that final disposal will remain an important element in local authorities' waste management plans. This need is addressed through the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) block funding, which covers waste management among other local authority services. In addition, WIP is managing &#163;355&nbsp;million of waste PFI credits over the three-year period to 2006, providing the necessary investment in large-scale waste management facilities. WIP's New Technologies work stream is also promoting investment in near-market technologies that will encourage more sustainable ways of disposing of waste.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much hazardous waste can be <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;delivered and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;deposited in each month from 16&nbsp;July at landfill sites that have applied to take only hazardous waste from 16 July.  [156411]

<a name="40311w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency is undertaking a permitting exercise for sites proposing to take hazardous waste after 16&nbsp;July 2004. Latest information available indicates that, if all the permits were issued, the monthly capacity from 16&nbsp;July 2004 would be approximately 95,000 tonnes (derived from expected annual inputs). This figure is for those sites accepting hazardous waste on a "merchant" basis. The amounts delivered would equate to those deposited.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_wqn3"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many businesses produced hazardous waste in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;2002 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;2003; and what estimate she has made of the number of businesses producing hazardous waste in each year from 2004 to 2008.  [156421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Data on this for the years 2002 and 2003 are not yet available. The average number of active special waste producers over previous years (1999 to 2001) was 100,000.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para1">The number of active producers of hazardous waste is expected to rise to 750,000 when the revised European hazardous waste list is fully implemented.

<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_wqn4"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;tonnage and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;proportion of hazardous waste will require treatment from 16&nbsp;July; and what the capacity of existing waste treatment infrastructure is.  [156422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The tonnage requiring treatment will depend on a number of factors, not least the amount arising. In 2002, some 5&nbsp;million tonnes of special waste was consigned, and 47&nbsp;per cent. was specifically consigned to treatment facilities (including recycling and reuse), 39&nbsp;per cent. to landfill and 4&nbsp;per cent. to incineration.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para2">From 16&nbsp;July 2004, all hazardous waste sent for disposal at a landfill will require some form of pre-treatment, unless this is of no practical benefit towards meeting the aims of the Landfill Directive. For hazardous waste, the Government believe that treatments are available that will reduce the mass to be landfilled, as well as the hazards to human health and/or the environment. Any decision that treatments are not available can only be made following a thorough evaluation of the treatment options.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para3">Estimates on available capacity of existing hazardous waste treatment infrastructure were prepared for the Hazardous Waste Forum in September 2003 and posted on the forum's website: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/hazforum/031021/enviros.pdf
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para4">The forum continues to keep this information under review as it becomes aware of changes to waste industry plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her policy that there should be no stockpiles of hazardous waste from 16&nbsp;July.  [156424]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is Government policy to ensure as smooth a transition as possible of the implementation of the requirements of the Landfill Directive, in particular the ending of the practice of co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the same cell from 16&nbsp;July, 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1623W</I><P>
and to that end to avoid the need for storage of hazardous waste over and above that which normally occurs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which hazardous waste streams she has identified as the most problematic to treat and manage after 16&nbsp;July; and what steps she has taken to ensure the safe management of these waste streams.  [156426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have taken the advice from hazardous waste stakeholders through the Hazardous Waste Forum to identify the following waste streams which warrant particular attention.

<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para5">The task force on treatment and capacity is investigating in more detail these waste streams, and has set up two work streams paying particular attention to construction and demolition wastes (including contaminated soils) and waste oils. The task force is assessing the arisings and alternative capacity available, communicating the issues to the industries concerned, and looking at environmentally sound methods of managing the wastes.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para6">In addition, the Environment Agency are identifying the top five waste streams per region, based on potential risk to the environment (quantities and hazardousness) and public health. Cradle to grave audits on these waste streams will be carried out which will include taking targeted enforcement action when appropriate.

<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_wqn7"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much the Environment Agency has spent in the last year for which figures are available on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;detection and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;prosecution of illegal disposal of hazardous waste; and how much it proposes to spend on these activities in (i) 2003&#150;04 and (ii) 2004&#150;05.  [156428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The agency spends in the order of &#163;12&nbsp;million annually on detection and prosecution of illegal waste activities including fly-tipping. Figures relating only to hazardous waste are not available. The amount that the agency spends is driven in part by the level of criminal activity. Between 2001 and 2002 the number of incidents the agency responded to increased by 19&nbsp;per cent. across England and Wales. However, this masked a 73&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of incidents responded to in Thames region alone.
<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para7">During 2003&#150;04 additional funding has been made available for the development of "Flycapture", a national fly-tipping database, being set up by the Environment Agency. This will allow the collection and collation of summary data on fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the agency and local authorities.

<P>

<a name="40311w01.html_para8">The agency anticipates that its spend in this area will be in the order of &#163;12&nbsp;million during 2004&#150;05. Spending in future years is subject to a spending review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Guidance will be issued at least three months before the implementation of the new regulations for hazardous waste to explain the obligations to be placed on producers. The guidance will be available in both paper and electronic formats to ensure that it is accessible to small and medium sized enterprises and we will be liaising with the Small Business Service and Federation of Small Businesses to ensure that the guidance is both appropriate and helpful to those in such enterprises.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_wqn9"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what funding she has allocated for 2004&#150;05 for a campaign to inform waste producers of their obligations under the Landfill Directive.  [156434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A strategy to inform waste producers of their obligations under the Landfill Directive is an integral part of the Hazardous Waste Forum's Action Plan, published in December 2003. This strategy will receive the necessary funding although no specific budget has been allocated to cover the Government's role in this work. Also, Defra officials will continue to present papers on Landfill Directive issues at industry seminars on waste disposal as part of their normal duties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Responsibility for tackling illegal dumping and fly-tipping is shared between local authorities and the Environment Agency. Information on local authority incidents is not held centrally.

 <i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Government are committed to putting the UK on a path to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by some 60&nbsp;per cent. by 2050. International flights from the UK do not currently count in the national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions as there is no international agreement yet on ways of allocating such emissions between countries. However, the Government's Energy White Paper made it clear that the aviation industry is encouraged to take account of, and where appropriate reduce, its contribution to global warming.
<P>

<a name="40311w02.html_para4">This was restated, and built on, in the recently published Air Transport White Paper which announced a package of measures to reduce the impact of aviation on climate change. This included the Government's intention to press for the inclusion of intra-EU air services in the forthcoming EU emissions trading scheme, and that this will be a priority for the UK Presidency in 2005, with a view to aviation joining the scheme from 2008, or as soon as possible thereafter.

<P>
<a name="40311w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The main environmental concerns associated with the landfilling of batteries relate to the potential generation and discharge of leachate into the environment of hazardous substances i.e. cadmium, lead and mercury, all known to be toxic to the aquatic environment and human health. Discharge of these substances to the environment are likely to occur through <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the compaction of weight, leading to substances discharging from the battery and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;percolation of rainfall further leaching these substances into groundwater. It is however worth noting that spent batteries constitute only 0.1&nbsp;per cent. of the Municipal Solid Waste stream.
<P>

<a name="40311w02.html_para5">The Belgian Government recently commissioned a study Targeted Risk Assessment Report, (TRAR) currently under scientific peer review, to identify the environmental impacts of disposing batteries in landfill.

<a name="40311w02.html_para6">The TRAR study mainly focused on cadmium containing batteries and concluded that the impact of batteries on landfill leachate could not be judged, based upon current lack of knowledge and methodology. In addition, risks related to the uncertainties of hazardous substances from batteries going to leachate, would require the adoption of risk management measures.

 The draft Batteries Directive requires member states to achieve collection targets for household batteries (44&nbsp;per cent.) and household Nickel Cadmium batteries (80&nbsp;per cent.), and that all automotive and industrial batteries are collected and sent for recycling. At present, the UK is collecting less than one per cent. of household batteries and in 2002, 87&nbsp;per cent. of the total automotive batteries put on the market were collected and sent for recycling. HMG will be commissioning work, in the near future, to obtain data on the collection and recycling rates of industrial batteries.
<P>

<a name="40311w02.html_para12">The Government welcome the draft Directive. Defra and DTI are already in talks with those stakeholders affected by the proposal and are looking at ways to secure early participation, to enable the UK to successfully meet the collection target within the given timeframe. In addition, both Departments are fully involved in discussions with the Commission and the European Parliament, to ensure that targets for the collection and recycling of household batteries are challenging, but achievable.

[154708]<P>

<P>
<a name="40311w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Union has agreed a threshold of 0.9&nbsp;per cent. for labelling adventitious GM presence in non-GM products. We recognise that there are arguments for a lower threshold to apply particularly in relation to organic production, although no conclusion has been reached on this.
<P>

<a name="40311w03.html_para1">The separation distances needed between fields to limit cross-pollination to 0.1&nbsp;per cent. (on a whole-field basis) were considered in a review produced for Defra in 2000 by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB). This suggested the following distances on the basis of fields of an average size of two hectares or more:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>forage maize: 290 metres</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40311w03.html_para2">No distance was estimated in relation to sugar beet because cross-pollination does not affect the composition of the utilised plant tissues (only vegetative parts of the plant are harvested, rather than seeds or fruits). Moreover, beet crops are normally harvested before they flower and farmers usually control any 'bolting' plants that flower prematurely.
<P>

<a name="40311w03.html_para3">The information in the NIAB report needs to be considered further in the light of data from a Defra-funded research report on gene flow from the GM maize crops in the Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) trials (available at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-1&#150;5-138.htm). This study concluded that in the case of a GM and non-GM maize crop growing alongside each other, the rate of individual GM cross-pollination events (per maize kernel) would be below 0.1&nbsp;per cent. at a distance of 258 metres into the non-GM crop. A parallel report on gene flow from the FSE oilseed rape crops is in preparation and will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="40311w03.html_para4">Another relevant Defra-funded research project has studied landscape-scale gene flow in oilseed rape crops (report available at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/research/epg-rg0216.htm). This does not estimate the separation distances needed for specific cross-pollination thresholds, but it notes that relatively small distances will limit cross-pollination between fully-fertile oilseed rape varieties to around 0.1&nbsp;per cent. or below, and that pollination from one field to the next is

<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1632W</I><P>
likely to be less than 0.1&nbsp;per cent. averaged over the field. At present it is difficult to estimate the separation distances that would be needed for a 0.1&nbsp;per cent. threshold in relation to oilseed rape varieties that are not fully fertile.

 Rebuilding Afghanistan's road networks is key to promoting regional trade and revitalising the Afghan economy. The UK contributes to road construction through our funding of the European Commission and the Asia Development bank, both of which are actively involved in major road building in Afghanistan. The Asia Development bank is engaged in several priority road projects, including the rehabilitation of the critically important Kabul-Kandahar-Spin Boldak road. The European Commission has undertaken the reconstruction of the Kabul-Jalalabad-Torkham road, another very important transport route.

 I have had regular discussions with Inland Revenue officials regarding the administration of Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit since 6&nbsp;April 2003, including plans for the next stage of tax credits implementation.The process of finalising tax credit awards for 2003&#150;04, and renewing claims for 2004&#150;05, begins in April. We also plan in 2004&#150;05 to bring within Child Tax Credit (CTC) those families with children receiving support for them though Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (IS/JSA). The process of moving these families into Child Tax Credit will begin in April as planned. Families on IS/JSA already receiving CTC will start to receive support for their children solely through CTC. And new claimants of IS/JSA will no longer be awarded child allowances in those benefits and will receive CTC instead. The automatic phased transfer onto CTC of the remaining families with children within IS/JSA is planned to begin from October, subject to a final review in the summer. Meanwhile, families will continue to receive the same level of support through their benefits as they would from CTC.

<a name="40311w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Locally grown salad vegetables are purchased for use at Mount Pleasant Airfield, but the produce available is limited. Local meat has not been procured because, prior to this year, it did not meet the Armed Forces Quality Standard and the Falkland Island abattoir was not EC approved. However, the Falkland Island Development Corporation has recently opened a fully compliant, purpose-built abattoir, and they are working to improve the quality of local lamb and mutton, with a view to supplying to Angliss (UK), the MOD's meat supplier, in the near future. An exploratory visit in January 2004 by Angliss (UK) proved to be most encouraging.

<P>
<a name="40311w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The effect on the operational effectiveness of Challenger 2 tanks when their crew members are wearing individual protective equipment against nuclear, biological and chemical attack depends on a number of related and variable factors. These include the ambient temperature and the effectiveness of the crew cooling system; the length of time the equipment has been worn at high protection state; the amount of prior training undertaken by the crew; their physical fitness levels; and the psychological stresses imposed during battle. The requirement to operate Challenger 2 tanks in individual protection equipment is reflected in annual training.

 Following the announcement last summer of our intention to procure Hawk 128 to meet our Advanced Jet Trainer requirement, detailed contractual negotiations with BAE SYSTEMS are continuing. Subject to a satisfactory conclusion, we are planning on placing an order for 20 aircraft with options for up to a further 24. The first aircraft would be delivered during 2008.

 No estimates of the levels of salmon smolt predation by cormorants have been made on the River Bush in the last 10 years. Previous studies carried out during the 1980s indicated that predation levels could be in excess of 50&nbsp;per cent. of the wild smolt runs at that time.

 The closest approximation to the requested data derives from the Labour Force Survey in Northern Ireland, which collects information on nationality and country of birth. The most recent results indicate that between September and November 2003 there were an estimated 48,000 persons resident in Northern Ireland who were born outside the UK and held nationality from countries other than the UK. In addition, people born in Northern Ireland generally have the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship.

 In our discussions with all political parties, including those involved in the review of the operation of the Belfast Agreement, we have emphasised the need for an end to paramilitary activity, as set out in paragraph 13 of the Joint Declaration. We believe all parties must use any influence they have in order to bring this about.

Figures for 1997 have not been included, as they are not available for the full year and as result would be inconsistent with other years.<P>

All figures are subject to change as more up to date data becomes available.<P>

Figures for the latest months may rise significantly as information feeds through to the Appeals Service.<P>

Figures are rounded to the nearest five except for the National Live Load, which is rounded to the nearest hundred.<P>

'&#151;' denotes data equal to nil or negligible.<P>

Incapacity Benefit data is not available before 2000 due to a change in methodology. The live load figures for Sickness Benefits and Disability Benefits as at August 2003 were 2,715,800 and 4,228,100 respectively. These figures cannot be broken down to those for Appeals Service regional office areas to give the number of appeals cleared as a percentage of the live load.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of whether the monetary grant made available for prisoners on release from custodial sentence offering no fixed abode as an address acts as an incentive to give no fixed abode as their address; and whether paedophiles giving no fixed abode on release avoid immediate listing on the Register of Sex Offenders.

 The deployment of officers to territorial divisions is an operational matter for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (Sir John Stevens). The information requested has been provided by the Commissioner in tabular form. Table 1 sets out the position in the MRS between 1992 and 1998. Table 2 continues with figures for a revised structure in 1999 and 2000. Table 3 sets out the position following the boundary changes on 1&nbsp;April 2000. These tables have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40311w13.html_para10">The structure of Metropolitan Police territorial divisions and Borough Operational Command Units over the period 1992 to 2003 has changed. Figures are not therefore strictly comparable year on year as a result of boundary and organisational changes in the Metropolitan Police Service (MRS). In particular organisational changes were made following boundary changes on 1&nbsp;April 2000 with the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey forces. The current territorial areas, introduced in 2000, are not therefore compatible with the previous force structure.

 Plastic sacks stamped with the Prison Service logo are used to store prisoners' property while they are in custody.

Since October 2002 the Prison Service has made available to prisons plain nylon barrel bags for use for prisoners' property on discharge. These have been well received by prisoners and staff.

 The Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Fair Trading do not collect statistics about the on-line submission of complaints to trading standards Departments. However, ConsumerComplaints.org.uk is a site developed with DTI support, which enables consumers to complain on-line. The complaint is automatically directed to the appropriate Trading Standards Department. Individual trading standards Departments use computer systems that are able to generate reports on how complaints are received. This would include a report on the number of complaints received on-line, compared to other methods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which members of the energy efficiency industry she has appointed to her Energy Services Working Group.  [160097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Energy Services Working Group has now completed its work and submitted a final report to Ministers on 23&nbsp;January. John Chesshire of the Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes was a member of the Group. Other members, apart from Government officials, were Nick Eyre of the Energy Saving Trust and representatives of all the major energy suppliers. Minutes of the meetings of the Group, together with papers presented to it and the interim and final reports are available on the DTI website at: www.dti.gov.uk/energy/environment/energy efficiency/eswg/shtml

<P>
<a name="40311w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what impact she expects the EU emissions trading scheme to have on electricity prices.  [158850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The impact of the EU emissions trading scheme will depend on the price of carbon in the market and the extent to which this is passed through by generators. The Department has based its estimates on a carbon price in a range from Euros5&#150;25/tonne of CO2. In the first phase of the scheme at least, from 2005 to 2007, the Department believes that the carbon price is more likely to be towards the bottom of the range. The electricity price increase corresponding to a carbon price of Euros5/tonne is estimated to be 3&nbsp;per cent. for domestic customers and 6&nbsp;per cent. for industrial customers.
<P>

<a name="40311w15.html_para0">The Department commissioned ILEX Consulting to undertake work on the implications of the emissions trading scheme on the power sector. Their report can be found at: www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/ilex report.pdf

<P>
<a name="40311w15.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The global market for nanotechnology is forecast to exceed $1,000 billion within the next decade and it is vital that the UK is a strong player in this market. My noble Friend the Minister for Science announced our investment of &#163;90&nbsp;million in our Micro and Nanotechnology Manufacturing Initiative in July 2003 to help industry harness the commercial opportunities offered by nanotechnology. &#163;50&nbsp;million will be spent on collaborative R&D projects and &#163;40&nbsp;million on a new network of micro and nanotechnology facilities. This will help business build on the UK's excellent track record in small-scale science and win a share of this developing market. This activity will build on the substantial and wide ranging investment we are already making through the Research Councils. We expect to invest a further &#163;100&nbsp;million in our science base for nanotechnology based research over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="40311w15.html_para4">In addition in December 2003 I launched the "Innovation Report: Competing in the global economy: the innovation challenge, December 2003". This report describes a range of new DTI products to support technological innovation which are already being applied to support UK interests in nanotechnology.
<P>

<a name="40311w15.html_para5">It is the policy of this Government to be open about our approach to new technologies, to acknowledge uncertainties and to ensure that the public are engaged in the decision making process. To address any potential concerns the Government commissioned the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to carry out an independent study to make sure we are able to benefit from the advances that nanotechnology promises with the right regulatory safeguards and protections in place. The study will also be used to inform policy on what safeguards might be required over and above existing legislation and guidance.

[159666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have established the independent Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) to advise it by the end of 2005 on the long-term management of the UK's higher activity wastes. Consideration of the arrangements for managing these wastes before receiving that advice would be premature.

 The Rover Task Force was established early in 2000, led by the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers).

 Recent research of note in this area has explored whether there is any causative link between early cannabis use and later development of psychosis, but such a link has not been conclusively proven. However, the recent epidemiological research on the issue of earlier use of cannabis and risk of later development of schizophrenia, 'schizophrenic symptoms' and 'schizophreniform disorder' has shown a stronger association than was previously evident from

<P>

<a name="40311w18.html_para0">While a number of illegal drugs, particularly amphetamines and cocaine (and to a lesser degree cannabis), are well-recognised in causing short-lived psychotic symptoms and signs there is no conclusive proof of causation of psychosis in later life. It is difficult to exclude confounding factors in carrying out such long-term research on, where such drug use would also be only one of a number of risk factors. It is also difficult to differentiate the role of such drugs in possibly precipitating psychosis in a pre-disposed individual from causation in someone not otherwise pre-disposed.
<P>

<a name="40311w18.html_para1">The Department has commissioned the National Addiction Centre to review the evidence regarding the harmful effects of drugs of abuse and this is published as a Department of Health document, Dangerousness of drugs (2003). This describes a wide range of harmful effects of illegal drugs. A copy is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40311w18.html_para2">It is widely recommended by clinicians that anyone at risk of psychosis should avoid any drugs that can cause acute psychotic symptoms.

<P>
<a name="40311w18.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department has not commissioned or evaluated research on low fat diets free from animal products. The Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford) has been supported by Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council and the Europe Against Cancer Programme of the Commission of the European Community. Findings from EPIC-Oxford data have shown that diets free from animal products are associated with lower levels of obesity than diets which include meat.

 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> Subutex is licensed for use in the treatment of opiate dependency, which is included in the clinical guidelines on the management of drug misuse and dependence issued by the Department in 1999. The Department has also made it possible for doctors to prescribe Subutex for instalment dispensing, to ensure there is no disincentive for its use as compared to methadone. While there are recognised advantages, there are also disadvantages to its use. There is a clear risk of Subutex being abused by injection. Methadone liquid appears more suitable for severely dependent opiate addicts. It is for clinicians to determine the appropriate use of Subutex for patients.

 It is the responsibility of the Afghan Transitional Administration to provide security for the forthcoming elections.

The Mazar-e Sharif PRT has 90 British soldiers.

The number of British soldiers likely to be involved has not yet been finalised. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is also considering a role in support of the elections.

<P>

<a name="40311w21.html_para5">The numbers of applications received and resolved do not always tally. Applications that are recorded as being received in one accounting period may be carried forward for resolution in the next. It is therefore possible to resolve more applications during a period than were received for the same period. Figures show that fewer applications tend to be resolved than received. The method of recording the statistics accounts for this: a mother and three children on one passport may count as four applications received, but only one entry clearance resolved. Also, some applications will be counted as received that are subsequently withdrawn and therefore not counted as resolved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action can be taken against UK national companies involved in business with Zimbabwean companies classed as SDNs under United States Executive Order 13288; if he will make a statement on the extension of EU sanctions to include such measures; and when he expects EU sanctions to match those of the US.

<P>
<a name="40311w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 On 21&nbsp;February 2004 the EU's restrictive measures were renewed and extended to a larger number of Zimbabwean individuals who are responsible for policies that lead to the suppression of human rights, of the freedom of expression and of good governance. One of the measures is an assets freeze against a new list of 95 individuals. The US has similar measures against only 77 individuals. It would therefore be a backward step for the EU's measures to "match" those of the US in this regard.
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para0">On 3&nbsp;March, the US announced that it was also freezing the assets of seven companies, controlled by three of Mugabe's closest confidantes&#151;Information Minister Moyo, Speaker Mnangagwa and ex-Army Chief Zvinavashe. The UK and EU have already frozen the identifiable assets of those individuals. The EU measures target individuals, not companies. The UK and other member states have taken the view that targeting companies risks harming ordinary Zimbabweans who are already suffering under the present regime.

 The allocations to London boroughs over the three years 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05 are tabled as follows.
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para5">Homelessness grants from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are intended to supplement main sources of expenditure on homelessness (for example, local authority general fund expenditure and housing investment) to fund innovative services that tackle and prevent homelessness more effectively. The approaches underpinning this funding were set out in our March 2002 report, "More than a roof".
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para6">Allocations were boosted in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 in acknowledgement of the need to pump-prime a number of new schemes to help deliver the Government's target to end the use of bed and breakfast hotels for homeless families with children, except in short-term emergencies, while improvements to Housing Benefit subsidy for other forms of temporary accommodation were put in place.
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para7">All housing authorities are offered a set allocation based on historic levels of homelessness in the borough. An additional grant may also be awarded based on performance in tackling homelessness and an assessment by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government Offices in the Regions of bids submitted by authorities for funds to help them:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>tackle and prevent homelessness more effectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para8">Over the three-year period there has been a reduction in direct commissioning by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister of services to tackle rough sleeping. Resources have been transferred to local authorities to commission services themselves as part of the development and implementation of local homelessness strategies. This is most apparent in the increasing allocation to Westminster.
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para9">Authorities have considerable discretion over how they use the grant, provided that they deliver the required outcomes. While particular schemes are set out in individual financial agreements and monitoring returns for each authority, we do not maintain a detailed, central schedule of all the services funded in each year. Typical of the range of schemes that may be funded are: mediation; rent deposit/bond schemes; private sector and RSL lettings; advice services; services 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1711W</I><P>
for particularly vulnerable groups; tenancy sustainment and outreach services. Services provided in each local authority area, including those receiving Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funding, are likely to feature in most authorities' homelessness strategies if they existed or were planned when the strategies were being written.
<P>

<a name="40311w22.html_para10">An independent evaluation of the homelessness strategies developed during 2003 in response to the requirements of the Homelessness Act 2002 has been commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and will provide more detailed information on the approaches taken by authorities. A further project will be commissioned shortly to evaluate homelessness prevention schemes, including those funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's homelessness grants.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 23&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 25W, on development sites, if he will make a statement on the conclusions reached by the Joint Advisory Panel at the meeting on 10&nbsp;March regarding the review of progress made on Hampshire's house building targets.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the decision of the Joint Advisory Panel to recognise the uncertainty surrounding future housing provision in Hampshire, and to recommend a number of measures to reduce that uncertainty. The Panel has agreed to prepare a draft action plan, which we would like to agree in a month's time. The measures will need to be implemented by local authorities in Hampshire speedily, in order to obviate the need to release the reserve.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;instructions and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;guidelines are issued by his Department to local authorities on the writing off of (i) Council Tax and (ii) Housing Benefit debt when the debt recovery costs are greater than the debt itself; and if he will make a statement.  [160689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local authorities are under a duty to collect all council tax revenues owing to them. "Council Tax Practice Note 9: Recovery and Enforcement", issued jointly by the former Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office in 1993, states that authorities should have provisions in their Standing Orders or Financial Regulations to enable amounts to be written off if they are irrecoverable or not economical to pursue.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what additional grant is to be paid to the Isle of Wight Council in 2004&#150;05 following his decision to add &#163;1&nbsp;million to the grant for 2003&#150;04.  [160646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04, during the final consultation on our proposed formulae changes, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister accepted the Isle of Wight's argument that their New Earnings Survey sample size was too small for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to reliably calculate a separate area cost adjustment (ACA) for the island. As a result the Isle of Wight received the same ACA as Hampshire in the 2003&#150;04 settlement. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister used the same methodology to calculate the ACA for the 2004&#150;05 settlement when the Isle of Wight once again received the same ACA as Hampshire.

<a name="40311w23.html_spnew4"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 Following a series of pilots in local authority elections and thorough evaluation by the Electoral Commission, it is clear that all-postal ballots can significantly increase the levels of participation in elections. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considered this evidence carefully, before announcing our intention to hold the referendums by all-postal ballot in response to a question from the hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The difference between the 2002&#150;03 likely total budgets for elected regional assemblies and the European programme funding is the block grant which assemblies will receive from central Government. The budgets for which a future elected regional assembly would be responsible (in the form of the block grant) are currently allocated to the Government Offices and non-departmental public bodies from central Government Departments.

Current progress on the relevant regional planning guidance is tabled as follows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to examine the contribution of residential colleges for adult education to the Government's lifelong learning policies; and if he will make a statement.  [159525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are 32 adult residential colleges based in rural locations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These colleges are mainly owned and run by Local Education Authorities (LEAs) and provide, in the main, short courses. They do not receive funding direct from the DfES or the Learning and Skills Council. It is for local Learning and Skills Councils, in discussion with LEAs, to consider whether, and if so how, residential colleges can contribute to meeting local needs in lifelong learning in the light of our commitments in 21st Century Skills to safeguard budgets for such learning.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;schools and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other education facilities which have been identified as containing asbestos; what proportion of (i) schools and (ii) other education facilities have been surveyed for the purpose of identifying the presence of asbestos; which (A) schools and (B) other education facilities require (1) remedial work and (2) removal of asbestos; what this work will cost; what budgets are available for this work for 2004 and 2005; and what budget is available for future asbestos surveys.  [159656]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information on which schools and other education facilities contain asbestos, nor on the proportion that has been surveyed for asbestos. As part of the data collected through the appraisal of Asset Management Plans, the Department has information on maintenance requirements at maintained schools, but asbestos work is not separately identified. By May this year, in accordance with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002, schools should have identified and recorded the position of any asbestos. We do not provide funding specifically for the survey, treatment or removal of asbestos. Schools and authorities can use the large amounts of formulaic capital which is now allocated to them for investment in their buildings, including health and safety needs such as asbestos treatment. We would expect these needs to be prioritised highly in the local asset management planning process. The total amount of capital available for investment in school buildings in 2004&#150;05 is &#163;4.5 billion and in 2005&#150;06 it rises to &#163;5.1 billion.

 <i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;January 2004]</i>: As at 31&nbsp;March 2003, CAFCASS had received 916 complaints since its inception in April 2001, representing less than 1 per cent. of the total number of cases handled. Of the complaints, 47&nbsp;per cent. were not upheld and 31&nbsp;per cent. were resolved or withdrawn. Five per cent. of complaints were upheld, with 9 per cent. partly upheld and 8 per cent. remaining under investigation as at 31&nbsp;March 2003.
<P>

<a name="40311w24.html_para6">Figures for the period April 2003-March 2004 are currently being collected from CAFCASS' regions and will be published in their 2003&#150;04 Annual Report; which is expected to be laid before Parliament before the summer recess.
<P>

<a name="40311w24.html_para7">If complainants complete CAFCASS's complaints process and still remain dissatisfied, they are able to raise the matter, through a sponsoring MP, with the Parliamentary Ombudsman. In 2002&#150;03, four complaints were referred to the Ombudsman: in three, no evidence was found to support them. The Ombudsman made enquiries about the fourth

 <i>[holding answer 26&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The information requested is not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="40311w24.html_para8">The Children Act 1989 Guidance requires that reviews are chaired by someone at a more senior level than the case social worker to bring a degree of oversight and objectivity to the review and care plan. Regulations also require local authorities to appoint an officer to assist in the co-ordination of all aspects of the review.
<P>

<a name="40311w24.html_para9">To further strengthen this, provision was made in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 for legislation to require local authorities to appoint Independent Reviewing Officers. These officers are to be independent of the management of the child's case and independent of the resources allocated to that case. Regulations commencing this provision will come into force in September 2004 following a consultation exercise last year. A large number of local authorities already employ individuals fulfilling a similar function.

<i>[holding answer 2&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> At present no centrally funded programmes are in place that enable mature students on low incomes to acquire free or low price computers. The Government have however, established a network of UK online centres. These centres provide open access to ICT and the internet for people in all communities. All mature students in England should be able to find a UK online centre near to their home.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research Government departments have conducted within the past five years into the effects of domestic violence on children; and what the main conclusions were.  [159802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 There is considerable research already available conducted by experts in this field of social policy that highlights the effects of domestic violence on children. The main conclusions are that 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1727W</I><P>
children who have been exposed to domestic violence demonstrate more aggression, antisocial behaviour and anger, as well as withdrawal, depression, suicidal behaviour, anxiety, fears, phobias, insomnia and low self-esteem, compared to children who have not suffered these experiences.

<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;in place and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;planned to increase the consistency among geographical areas of standards of domestic violence services aimed at children.  [159803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Local authorities, in partnership with other agencies, both statutory and voluntary, are expected to assess the needs of children in their areas, in accordance with the duties imposed on them by Part III of the Children Act 1989 and then to determine the range of services that will need to be available in order to respond to those needs. This process, inevitably and properly, leads to diversity in the provision of services at local level.

<a name="40311w26.html_para0">In addition to assisting with planning, the Department has provided grant support to enable a number of promising students to attend the event and a grant for a new conference publication aimed at classroom practitioners. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has also provided a goodwill message for this international event, which will be reproduced in conference literature.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research his Department has carried out, in addition to the three-year assessments, to assess the impact of education maintenance allowances on participating in the Government-supported training; and if he will make a statement.  [155439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> Evaluation findings show that the national EMA scheme is expected to increase participation in education at Year 12 by 3.8&nbsp;per cent. and at Year 13 by 4.1&nbsp;per cent. Evidence from the pilot EMA areas shows that little of the increase in participation through EMA is from Government Supported Training. Over half of the increase in participation through EMA is from young people who would otherwise not be in any education, employment or training, and most others are 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1728W</I><P>
from work without training. There is some evidence from the pilot areas that suggests an increased flow into Government Supported Training at 18.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para2">Overall EMA supports a range of learning up to level 3. This includes young people doing quality assured NVQs and vocational courses in FE colleges that often incorporate work placements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_wqn4"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the impact of educational maintenance allowances in improving participation rates in post-16 education.  [156634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In the pilots, EMA increased participation by 16-year-olds in education by 5.9&nbsp;per cent. points. Judged against historic trends, this represents a major increase. Our evaluators predict that in the first year of the national scheme, some 35,000 additional young people will participate in further education, and this will rise to over 70,000 per year when EMA is fully in place.

<a name="40311w26.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Emotional Intelligence Initiatives</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what departmental initiatives there are in relation to emotional intelligence; what difficulties have been reported in implementing such initiatives; and how the success of these initiatives is evaluated;  [155290]
<P>
<UL>(2) what funding his Department provides to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;schools and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;local education authorities to develop (i) emotional intelligence and (ii) literacy initiatives;  [155292]
<P>
(3) which <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;schools, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;academics and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;university education departments his Department has assessed as the best practitioners in the field of emotional intelligence; and what his Department regards as best practice in this field.  [155293]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department is concerned to promote children's social and emotional development and their social, emotional and behavioural skills (SEBS), which themselves contribute to children's emotional intelligence and emotional literacy.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para3">Promoting positive emotional and social development is a crucial part of educating children. The Department is therefore committed to providing guidance and materials for every stage. Curriculum guidance for the Foundation Stage covers the emotional and social development of very young children and we are developing associated training materials. The Personal, Social and Health Education framework supports the emotional and social development of children at Key Stages 1 to 4. To supplement that, the Department is piloting specific Social, Emotional and Behavioural Skills (SEBS) materials for primary schools in 25 local education authorities (LEAs) and developing similar materials for secondary schools.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para4">The Department is investing &#163;600,000 in SEBS materials for primary schools over two years. The pilot is in the early stages of implementation but initial feedback from schools is very positive. It will be evaluated by the University of London's Institute of Education. The Foundation and secondary materials are still at the initial development stage.




<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1729W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para5">The development of SEBS materials is informed by existing good practice in a number of LEAs including Southampton, Bristol, Portsmouth, Cumbria, Merton, East Riding of Yorkshire, Brighton and Hove and Nottingham City. The Department is also advised by an expert SEBS practitioners group including academics from the universities of Southampton, Oxford and Middlesex, a range of voluntary bodies including the National Children's Bureau, the NSPCC and Antidote, senior school staff and LEA officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate the Government have made of how many EU accession country citizens will make use of the education system in the UK at each level.  [157348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 From 1&nbsp;May children living within the UK who come from the accession countries will have access to education here. In addition, students who attend Further and Higher Education Institutions will have home fee status as long as they have been resident within an acceding country for three years.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para6">The Government commissioned work from independent academic experts on likely numbers of migrants arriving which is published and available on the Home Office website. We will monitor the situation post enlargement to ensure that the impact on schools, FE and HE is understood. Government departments are working together to ensure that all the available data are brought together to offer a rounded picture of the impact of accession and as well as feeding into this we will be looking to use the results to inform the picture for education.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para7">For Higher Education we have been collecting data on the nationality of students, including those from accession countries for some years. We estimate a one-off increase in the number of EU students in the UK of perhaps about 8&nbsp;per cent. as a result of EU enlargement. Our January HEFCE Grant letter took account of the expansion of the EU due to take place in 2004, and so did the Additional Student Numbers (ASN) exercise that HEFCE are currently running for foundation degrees. We have already forecasted for growth in new EU students and will continue to do so in the next Spending Review. It is important to remember that since we do not give maintenance to students from the EU, coming to study in the UK is not a 'cheap option' for them; they still have to find ways to support their living costs themselves.

<a name="40311w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which UK agencies are best able to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;assist with recognising educational backgrounds and skills of migrant workers and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;help the UK employment sector to take advantage of the enlargement of the EU.  [157363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government welcome EU enlargement and expect that it will have a positive impact on the UK, allowing us to benefit from a wider skills market to fill key labour and skills gaps and boost productivity.




<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2004 : Column 1730W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para8">The UK National Reference Point (NRP) for Vocational Qualifications has been set up by UK Government to explain vocational qualifications (VQs) and particularly how UK VQs relate to ones elsewhere in Europe.

<a name="40311w26.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of how enlargement of the EU will affect the skills shortage in the United Kingdom.  [157362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government welcome EU enlargement and expect that it will have a positive impact on the UK, allowing us to benefit from a wider skills market to fill key labour and skills gaps and boost productivity. The UK has the strongest labour market for a generation and this puts us in a good position to absorb any additional migrant flows. Free movement of workers within a larger EU will complement the work we are doing to address the skills gaps that exist currently within our own workforce, which are predominantly in the Business Services and construction sectors.
<P>

<a name="40311w26.html_para10">As announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, A8-nationals who want to work in the UK will be required to apply to register as a worker once they have found a job. The benefit of this new light-touch worker registration scheme is that it will expand the range of skills and supply of workers available across the UK and allow us to monitor the types of work that accession country nationals are entering in the UK. Through our labour market data we will also be able to tell the impact on the UK labour market as a whole.

<i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Isle of Wight College recovery plan has been effectively implemented and the college now offers good quality courses across a wide provision to serve the needs of the local community. The college was inspected under the Common Inspection Framework in October 2003 and the inspectors judged that of the nine areas of learning delivered by the college, three were satisfactory, five were good and one outstanding. Leadership and management of the college was also judged to be good. The college has also recently been recognised as a Centre of Vocational Excellence for hospitality and catering.

<P>
<a name="40311w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There is no specific funding for such projects. Rather, training and education for people with learning difficulties is funded from the overall budget (&#163;8.1 billion in 2003&#150;04) which my Department allocates to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in order to carry out its education and training remit for young people and adults. Within this overall budget the LSC will spend &#163;105&nbsp;million this year on specialist residential college placements and considerably more supporting learners with learning difficulties in mainstream provision.
<P>

<a name="40311w27.html_para6">The Government have strengthened the rights of people with learning difficulties to appropriate post-16 provision through a combination of legislative change and collaborative work with key organisations representing disabled learners. Under Section 13 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the LSC has a specific responsibility to help young people and adults with learning difficulties. Although the LSC does not develop policies relating to specific groups of learners, its broad remit means that it can fund a wide range of provision to ensure these learners have access to suitable provision which meets their needs and, where appropriate, the additional support they require to undertake it.
<P>

<a name="40311w27.html_para7">The LSC has established a Forum on Learners with Learning Difficulties and/or Disabilities to ensure that inclusive learning is at the heart of its policies and processes. Membership includes representatives from Government, external representative bodies and learners with learning difficulties. The LSC also participates in local Learning Disability Partnership Boards, with the Department of Health and other partner agencies, to improve local inter-agency working.

 Until last year, information on literacy and numeracy skills had not been collected on a regular basis, so annual data are not available. However, the "Skills for Life Survey: A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills", which was published by the Department for Education and Skills in October last year, tested the literacy, language and numeracy skills of 8,040 people in England. The findings are shown in the following table. Attainment is split into levels that are broadly mapped to the National Curriculum Key Stages in schools: Entry Levels 1, 2 and 3 correspond to Foundation, Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2, Level 1 corresponds to Key Stage 3, and Level 2 to Key Stage 4. We consider those who are at Entry Level 3 or below to have a severe basic skills need.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w28.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what local education authority programmes encourage pupils to remain in education beyond the age of 16; and what steps his Department is taking to support these programmes.  [154945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We work with local education authorities (LEAs), the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), Connexions, and schools and colleges to encourage young people to remain in education or training after the age of 16. We are tackling the causes of low participation by providing a more flexible, coherent and better quality 14&#150;19 curriculum; advice and guidance; and financial support.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para6">We are working with 56 LEAs to pilot the Education Maintenance Allowance scheme. Evidence from the evaluation has led to our decision to extend the scheme across England from September 2004.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para7">We have put in place a national Connexions service to provide advice, guidance and support to help young people make an effective transition to post-16 learning and to adult life. This is supported by Connexions Direct&#151;an internet and telephone based confidential advice service available 18 hours a day and 365 days a year. The Connexions service has a specific target to reduce the numbers of young people not in education, employment or training by 10&nbsp;per cent. by November 2004.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para8">We are investing, jointly with the LSC, &#163;46&nbsp;million over the period 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05 in a programme of 39 14&#150;19 pathfinders. Pathfinder partnerships, which include LEAs, are testing local delivery of 14&#150;19 education and training in a range of settings, introducing more curriculum flexibility and choice so that students' programmes can be better tailored to their needs and aptitudes.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para9">We recognise that a key factor in the decision by young people to remain in education after 16 is the quality of their experience at school and the standards they achieve. That is why our strategy for transforming education in secondary schools, particularly the national Key Stage 3 Strategy, supports teachers in

tailoring teaching and learning to meet the needs of pupils and to personalise their learning experience. The results of national curriculum tests at KS3 last year showed standards at their highest ever in each subject and at every level. Standards at KS4 again improved on previous record levels with greatest improvements in schools in the most challenging circumstances. The 'Increased Flexibility for 14&#150;16 Year Olds' programme aims to increase attainment and encourage young people to progress into education or training. Over 90,000 pupils are currently involved and we are providing over &#163;50&nbsp;million of support in the current year to almost 300 partnerships between schools and colleges.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para10">We are also working, through the Sure Start initiative, with LEAs and providers to continue to expand child care, early learning and health and family support from which teenage and older parents can benefit.
<P>

<a name="40311w28.html_para11">And we recognise that educational participation is supported and enhanced by modern, accessible youth work providing personal and social development. In "Resourcing Excellent Youth Services", we set youth services a clear vision of what we expect them to provide for the young people in their area. To help youth services achieve this vision, we gave local authorities a 5.9&nbsp;per cent. investment increase in the EPS youth and community sub-block; and have also provided grant funding worth around &#163;80&nbsp;million over the period 2002&#150;06 explicitly to support modernisation.

<a name="40311w29.html_wqn1"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the changes in pupils' attainment in the early years of secondary schools over the past two years.  [159819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Key Stage 3 (KS3) National Tests are the main measure of pupils' attainment in the early years of secondary education. The 2003 tests, recorded the best ever pupil attainment at KS3, with improvements in every subject and at every level. Over the past two years the percentage of pupils achieving Level 5 or above has increased by four percentage points to currently stand at 69&nbsp;per cent. in English; increased by five percentage points to reach 71&nbsp;per cent. in mathematics and increased by two percentage points to stand at 68&nbsp;per cent. in science. The percentage of pupils achieving Level 6 or above over the same period has increased by three percentage points in English to reach 35&nbsp;per cent., six percentage points in mathematics to reach 49&nbsp;per cent., and six percentage points in science to reach 40&nbsp;per cent..
<P>

<a name="40311w29.html_para0">These achievements endorse the positive impact on pupils' attainment of the Key Stage 3 National Strategy which we introduced to raise the attainment of all 11 to 14-year-olds. Our priority now is to build on these gains to achieve even higher standards this year by further embedding the strategy, maintaining a focus on tackling under performance, and supporting teachers to personalise teaching and learning to meet the needs of individual pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the implications of the decision to prioritise some groups of adult learners in recreational adult education.  [146316]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There has been no decision to prioritise some groups of learners in recreational adult education. We gave a commitment in the Skills Strategy White Paper to safeguard the availability of lifelong learning courses by agreeing with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) an overall indicative budget for non qualification provision provided through local education authorities (LEAs), family and neighbourhood learning. This we have done. The figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;207.4&nbsp;million compared with &#163;206&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04. This follows a period when the Government significantly increased the budget for this type of learning from &#163;145&nbsp;million in 2000&#150;01, and &#163;183&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03. In November 2002, 662,000 adults were on predominantly non vocational and non qualification courses run through LEAs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the change in the rate of incidence of emotional and behavioural difficulties as a special educational need among primary school children over the last 10 years.  [157176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w30.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In the past no figures have been collected for special educational need by type of difficulty. However, from January this year we have started to collect information about type of need for pupils with statements of SEN and for those at School Action Plus as part of the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC). One of the categories used is 'Behaviour, Emotional and Social Difficulty' (BESD).
<P>

<a name="40311w30.html_para1">From this summer, information will be available on the number of children in primary schools with BESD. These figures will act as the baseline against which we will be able to compare future trends.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w30.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Each child with a statement of special educational needs (SEN) is expected to have short-term educational and development targets set for them during the course of the year. In addition to routine monitoring of the child's progress by their teacher, these targets form part of their individual education plan which should be reviewed by the school at least twice a year and fully considered by the Local Education Authority at the annual review of the child's statement before new targets are set.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the future role of moderate learning difficulty special schools will be; and if he will make a statement.  [159383]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w30.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Government's special educational needs strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement makes it clear that we believe that special schools have an important role to play within the overall spectrum of provision for children with special educational needs&#151;educating some children directly and sharing their expertise with mainstream schools to support greater inclusion.
<P>

<a name="40311w30.html_para3">There will always be changes to local provision to reflect local needs and circumstances. This is a matter for local decision. Local education authorities are required to review their provision and future needs for children with special educational needs when drafting their School Organisation Plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what percentage of pupils at special schools was successfully reintegrated within the mainstream school system in 2003.  [160071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40311w30.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In January 2003, local authorities reported that 1020 pupils had transferred from special schools to mainstream schools. That is 1.1&nbsp;per cent. of the special school population. In addition, about 2000 pupils are dual registered and spend part of their time in a mainstream school. Others are on the roll of a special school but have regular mainstream experience.
<P>

<a name="40311w30.html_para4">The Government's SEN Strategy, "Removing Barriers to Achievement", encourages greater collaboration between special and mainstream schools in order to promote inclusion. This will include greater movement between special schools and mainstream schools by both pupils and staff. We will also encourage more special schools to participate in federation, cluster and twinning arrangements and, through the Building Schools for the Future programme, hope to bring more schools closer physically, including through co-location.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) teaching funding method provides funding for students who complete their course of study. Students who do not complete their course are not fundable. Figures for the public costs of student support for higher education students who do not complete their courses are not available.




<P>

<P>

<a name="40311w30.html_para5">Further education funding for institutions is based on learners' attendance on termly census dates. If students finish their studies before the planned end of their course no further funding is provided. Thus if a student attends for one term of a one year course, the college gets 30&nbsp;per cent. of the funding for the whole course. The Learning and Skills Council estimates that around &#163;319&nbsp;million is spent on teaching students who attend only part of their course. This does not include any Learner Support Funds received by these learners as this information is not available centrally.

 Repayments of income-contingent loans are collected through the tax system, apart from a few exceptions.

 We are investing nearly &#163;470&nbsp;million over this and the next two years in measures to improve behaviour and attendance in schools. These include training for school staff in managing pupil behaviour and reducing and preventing violence. We have also made it clear that head teachers can permanently exclude pupils responsible for violence, and that we would support such action. In January 2003 new Regulations governing exclusions came into force and the DfES issued new Guidance on Exclusion from Schools and Pupil Referral Units, which introduced several changes. Independent Appeal Panels are not able to reinstate a pupil solely on the basis of technical defects in prior procedure. They are also now required to balance the interests of the excluded pupil against the interests of all the other members of the school community.
<P>

<a name="40311w31.html_para1">New legislation in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 will enable local education authorities and schools to enter into parenting contracts with parents whose children are excluded from school, helping parents who are willing to engage to improve their children's behaviour. Where children are excluded for serious misbehaviour and parents are unwilling to engage, local education authorities may apply for court-imposed Parenting Orders, compelling the parents to attend parenting classes. We have issued "A legal toolkit for schools", which identifies legal remedies available when school staff experience problems with violent parents. Some of these are also available when dealing with violent pupils.
