 United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF confirm that during two rounds of National Immunisation Days (NIDs) in Sudan in February and March this year, over one million children in Southern Sudan were vaccinated against polio. The next Sudan NIDs are planned to take place in February and March 2000.

 We are working to influence the World Bank and the IMF during the comprehensive review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative to strengthen the linkage between debt relief and poverty eradication. In particular we are stressing the need for HIPC to deliver a greater reduction in the level of service payments in the early years to enable governments to invest sufficient resources in anti-poverty programmes such as health and education and so achieve the International Development Goals.

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I participated in discussing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative at the Interim Committee meeting of the IMF and at the Development Committee of the World Bank in Washington at the end of April. At both meetings, Ministers gave strong support to providing more debt relief to countries which are committed to eradicating poverty. In discussions on the fundamental review of the HIPC initiative, the Chancellor and I emphasised the need for change, in order that the initiative provides countries with a permanent exit from their debt problems, as it was intended to do. We also stressed the importance of debt relief being provided in 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 1999 : Column: 2</I><P>
such a way that it releases resources for governments to invest in key sectors to enable them to achieve the International Development Goals. Phase 2 of the HIPC review will consider how to strengthen this link between debt relief and poverty elimination.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what provision will be included in the Government's proposed debt relief framework for debt <i>(a)</i> service and <i>(b)</i> stock reduction.  [83300]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative focuses on reducing the stock of debt, with countries receiving one large cut in their debt which takes effect after many years. We are pressing the international community to agree not only to provide more debt relief to countries who are implementing demonstrably pro-poor policies, but to provide it in a way that enables governments to increase spending on anti-poverty programmes. This points to revising the Initiative so that it takes more account of what governments can afford to pay from their budgets, and delivers greater reductions in debt service paid, especially in the early years.

<P>
<a name="90510w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are working with the European Commission, EU Member States and International Financial Institutions to determine the longer term needs of Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. As the Donors Conference on Macedonia on 5 May indicated, the international community is prepared to provide considerable support based on real needs. Bilaterally we plan to focus on know how and technical support to enable the Governments of the region to increase their capacity to respond to the crisis and absorb international assistance.

<a name="90510w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Multilateral organisations including the IMF have a key role to play in helping countries to meet the international development targets. Following last year's review of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, it was agreed that the IMF should take more account of the social impact of their programmes, the quality of government expenditure, and should protect budgets in high priority areas such as health and education. We are encouraging the IMF to work more closely with the World Bank to ensure that, in designing structural adjustment programmes, they take account of the impact on the poor. Following proposals put forward by the UK, the World Bank is developing principles of good practice in social policy, in consultation with the IMF. We envisage that these principles will be 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 1999 : Column: 3</I><P>
drawn upon by the World Bank and the IMF in the design of programmes. We continually emphasise the need for the IMF to build support for reforms which lead to economic growth which benefit the poor programmes, through discussion and consultation with civil society.

<P>
<a name="90510w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UN estimate that there are 3,250,000 people in need of humanitarian relief in Ethiopia. 397,000 of whom have been displaced due to the border conflict. In Eritrea 540,000 people need support with 290,000 displaced by the conflict. Main relief requirements are food, shelter, clothing, household items, health care, water and sanitation. Since January 1998 Britain has provided &#163;5.2 million (including our contribution to EU actions) for emergency food and other support to Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<a name="90510w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are continuing to press all parties to the conflict to agree a cease-fire and to reach a negotiated settlement. The signing in April of the Sirte agreement between the DRC, Uganda, Libya, Chad and Eritrea was a welcome step towards a cessation of hostilities, as was the communique issued on 5 May by the leaders of Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda re-affirming their commitment to a peaceful settlement of the conflict.

 Staff transferring from English Partnerships, the Rural Development Commission and Government Offices to take forward transferring functions, will have, or will have access to, any necessary environmental expertise to carry out the work. RDAs have been recruiting for a wide range of posts, including strategy development and corporate functions. Where environmental expertise is relevant to the post this will have been a consideration in the advertisement and selection process. RDAs will also be establishing links with a range of organisations, some of which will be able to provide advice on environmental issues. However, separate records are not kept on the environmental expertise of individual staff in the RDAs.

 We have received representations concerning the consultants who have prepared for my Department a report which updated annual UK emissions data for HFCs, PFCs and SF6, provided emission projections to 2020 and assessed the costs and benefits of options to reduce future emissions. One of the representations included a detailed list of comments on the report, and a detailed reply, responding in full to each of the points raised, has been made.

<a name="90510w02.htm_para0">The Government intend to develop a balanced and equitable strategy across all sectors, to meet the UK's climate change targets. The climate change consultation paper, which we published last October, set out a range of policy options that could be used to meet these targets. We are now developing a draft UK climate change programme for publication later this year. This will be informed by the responses to the consultation paper and other relevant information, including the above report and any representations concerning it.

<P>
<a name="90510w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Montreal Protocol allows chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to continue to be produced for use in the manufacture of metered dose inhalers (MDIs). This essential use exemption will continue to be provided only until an adequate range of non CFC alternatives is on the market, which in the European Union is likely to occur within the next two to five years.
<P>

<a name="90510w02.htm_para1">The Montreal Protocol also required Parties to prepare a national or regional strategy by 31 January 1999, which would ensure a smooth and efficient transition from CFC MDIs to non CFC MDIs whilst protecting the health and safety of patients.
<P>

<a name="90510w02.htm_para2">As the European Community is a Party to the Protocol, the European Commission prepared an EU wide transition strategy in consultation with member states, which was published by the Commission at the end of October 1998. The EU strategy sets out the criteria which will be used to determine when the essential use criteria for MDIs will be withdrawn in the EU. A number of non CFC MDIs are now available in the UK, and we anticipate that it should be possible to complete the transition for most types of MDI in the next three years.

 Based on data supplied by the European Commission, my Department estimates that the volume of chlorofluorocarbons used by manufacturers of metered dose inhalers in the United Kingdom was 2,208 tonnes in 1997 and 2,109 tonnes in 1998. About 40 per cent. of these metered dose inhalers will be used in the United Kingdom, the remainder being exported to other European Union countries and elsewhere. It is assumed that all the chlorofluorocarbons used in the manufacture of metered dose inhalers will eventually be emitted to atmosphere.

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 1999]:</i> In 1997, an estimated 2.5 per cent. of all tonne-kilometres performed in Great Britain, for both domestic and international haulage, were performed by vehicles originating outside the United Kingdom. Virtually all of this foreign activity was accounted for by the British part of international journeys by foreign hauliers. Domestic journeys by foreign hauliers accounted for under 0.04 per cent. of the total Great Britain tonne-kilometres in 1997, which is the last year for which we have full figures. However, there is some anecdotal evidence that the foreign haulier activity within the UK has been increasing over the recent years. This is one of the issues we will be addressing through the Road Haulage Forum.

<a name="90510w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department has issued guidance to local authorities on a range of measures to improve town centres for people with mobility difficulties. On the transport side, in January this year we published new guidelines on the use of tactile paving surfaces to provide warning and guidance to blind and partially-sighted pedestrians. We also intend to publish our strategy to encourage walking soon. This will set out the need for town centre improvements to take into account the needs of all groups, including disabled people and the 30 per cent. of households without access to a car.
<P>

<a name="90510w03.htm_para1">More generally the planning policy guidance for town centres and retail developments (PPG6) we have issued to local authorities has made particular reference to improving access to and within town centres, improving the pedestrian environment and, in particular, addressing the needs of people with mobility difficulties. We would expect authorities to survey the access and mobility needs of disabled people and demonstrate a commitment to meeting their needs in drawing up their strategies for town centres, their development plans and in making decisions on new developments.
<P>

<a name="90510w03.htm_para2">We also expect local authorities to demonstrate a similar commitment in their Local Transport Plans (LTPs). The guidance already issued to local authorities on preparing their LTPs has made particular reference to the needs of people with mobility difficulties. We expect LTPs to provide evidence to support their record in this area, and provide detail of their future plans.
<P>

<a name="90510w03.htm_para3">Turning to buildings, Part M of the Building Regulations requires that reasonable provision should be made for access and facilities for disabled people in all new buildings. These requirements currently apply to buildings other than dwellings, but from 25 October this year they will be extended to all new dwellings.
<P>

<a name="90510w03.htm_para4">In terms of low incomes, we have commissioned research into the links between public transport and social exclusion. The research will seek to establish the level of exclusion from public transport, identify the factors which discourage different groups from using it, examine the initiatives to encourage new passengers, and propose a range of initiatives to encourage ridership among excluded groups. The results of the research will be available in late 1999.

<a name="90510w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 None. All Special Areas of Conservation are selected on the basis of their scientific conservation interest. The decision to allow the building of a road must be based on a number of planning factors one of which is its possible effect on nature conservation sites. Article 6 of the Habitats Directive requires all plans or projects which may have a significant effect on sites designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) to be assessed for their implications on the site's conservation objectives. If that assessment shows that the plan or project would adversely affect the integrity of the site, consent may only be given, in the absence of alternatives (ie a less damaging way of carrying out the scheme), in the overriding public interest.

<a name="90510w04.htm_para10">As NATO has said, a military facility was struck at Aleksinac, home of the 203rd mixed artillery brigade. Despite meticulous pre-attack planning, it is possible that one weapon fell short of the target. (I am placing in the Library of the House a full transcript of what was said on the subject by a NATO spokesman at a press conference on 6 April 1999).

<a name="90510w04.htm_para11">Unlike President Milosevic, we take great care to reduce the risk of casualties and collateral damage. If there has been any unintended damage to civilian property or loss of life we regret this, but NATO's military actions are the result of Milosevic's brutal policy of ethnic cleansing.

Having been declared surplus to my Department's requirements, they are now being prepared for disposal. A draft Planning Brief has been the subject of a public consultation exercise and was approved by the full Borough Council on 25 February. Marketing of the site will begin shortly. With regard to the New Ranges, DERA is seeking to appoint a new contractor to support the operation of the range. It is intended that this contractor will also work with the Agency to improve exploitation of the range through the introduction of alternative activities to supplement income. Several possible diversification opportunities have been identified. However, as negotiations are currently in hand with preferred bidders, it would be premature to provide details until the remaining contractual issues have been resolved.

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 1999]:</i> No official estimate has been made of the number of businesses run from home. The Labour Force Survey, Spring 1998, estimated that 600,000 self employed people work mainly from their own home, and a further 1.1 million use their home as a base while working in different places.
<P>

<a name="90510w06.htm_para3">There are no schemes specifically addressed towards home-based businesses. Home based businesses and the self employed are eligible for business support in the same way as any other small business. Business Link partnerships provide support to all businesses regardless of size or their location. In addition, the DTI makes available a considerable amount of free information on a wide variety of topics.
<P>

<a name="90510w06.htm_para4">I met with officials from the Home Business Alliance on 27 April to discuss their concerns for home-based workers.

 Since the UK/China human rights dialogue was established in September 1997, and the EU/China human rights dialogue resumed in October 1997, China has taken several positive steps which will bring about its closer co-operation with UN human rights mechanisms. These include signature of the international covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and Civil and Political Rights, and agreement to report to the Un under those covenants in respect of Hong Kong. It has received visits by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary

Turkey must improve its record in these areas in order to meet the criteria for membership of the European Union laid down by the 1993 Copenhagen European Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures his Department is taking to promote traditional folk and acoustic music.  [83294]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w08.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of folk and acoustic music to our wider arts policy. The strategic arms length relationship between DCMS and the Arts Council in funding issues means that it is for the Arts Council and Regional Arts Boards to take decisions on the funding of specific art forms, but DCMS is aware of the need to ensure that performers, producers and promoters of folk music continue to receive appropriate support. The Arts Council--having already provided significant Lottery support to folk music, and having also increased substantially the grant-in-aid budget to be committed to it--will shortly be launching a new Folk Music Policy which, following consultation, will provide a framework for future development, partnerships with other sectors, and future funding.

 The Broadcasting Act 1990 disqualifies groups whose objectives are wholly or mainly of a religious nature from holding a terrestrial national radio licence issued by the Radio Authority. However, this disqualification does not extend to local, satellite and cable radio licences where the Authority is permitted to licence religious bodies subject to compliance with its religious guidelines. It is under these provisions that, for example, United Christian Broadcasters already holds two satellite broadcast licences from the Radio Authority. A religious organisation can hold a digital satellite radio licence but not a terrestrial digital radio multiplex or sound programme service licence under the 1996 Broadcasting Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We are not persuaded that it is necessary to change the Immigration Rules. The Dublin Convention provides an agreed legal framework for deciding which member state should decide asylum applications made in the European Union. It provides for a range of criteria to be taken into account including the applicant's family links. Member states have not decided to suspend the operation of the Convention in respect of Kosovan Albanians. In recent weeks, we have transferred 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 1999 : Column: 35</I><P>
a small number of Kosovans to other member states. In each case the receiving state had, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Convention, accepted responsibility for considering the asylum applications. All of these persons had arrived in the European Union before the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organisation action. None of those Kosovans who are being airlifted directly from the region to the United Kingdom will be transferred to other states on safe third country grounds.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information is that no nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose cases have been considered substantively, have been refused asylum in the period January to March 1999. It is not possible separately to identify Kosovans within the statistics held on nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
<P>

<a name="90510w10.htm_para2">All applications for asylum are considered within the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol. At the present time, and in general, ethnic Albanians from Kosovo who apply for asylum are likely to be able to demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution and will be granted asylum.
<P>

<a name="90510w10.htm_para3">Where, under the provisions of the Dublin Convention, another European Union member state accepts that it is responsible for determining the claim we would normally seek to transfer the applicant there. Six nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, excluding dependants, have been transferred to European Union Member states since 24 March 1999 under the Dublin Convention. All of these persons had arrived in the European Union before the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organisation action. None who arrived since that date have been transferred.

We are looking at all parts of the United Kingdom. There will be a variety of different forms of accommodation used as temporary reception centres where the refugees can be housed prior to moving into more settled accommodation.

<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Details of the payment arrangements between the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) and Siemens Business Services are commercially confidential. A high proportion of the payments to the supplier are linked to the successful delivery of key elements of the IND Casework

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the additional costs to the Government which have resulted from the late delivery of the Siemens Business Systems contract with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.  [83618]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Under the terms of the contract between the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and Siemens Business Services (SBS), the financial risk for the late delivery of elements of the Casework Programme is borne by Siemens Business Services. Although development of the full information technology application has been delayed, many elements of the Programme, in particular improvements to the business process and some new information technology, have been delivered. A package of changes to the contractual payment terms has been negotiated with SBS.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what penalties have been imposed on Siemens Business Systems for late delivery of work at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.  [83613]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Casework Programme is a Private Finance Initiative. A high proportion of the payments to the supplier, Siemens Business Services, are linked to the successful delivery of key elements of the Programme, including the computer system, and to improvements in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's productivity. If the expected benefits are not achieved, the payments to the supplier fall below the target in the contract. The delay in delivering the Programme and the Computer system means that Siemens Business Services have received substantially less income.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the total cost of the contract with Siemens Business Systems for work at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.  [83612]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w10.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The contract contains a novel charging mechanism in which the Immigration and Nationality Directorate pays for services provided as specified in the contract. Milestone charges relating to the delivery of key elements of the business process improvements and the information technology system and a productivity-related charge is based on the level of savings achieved. Because payments are linked to productivity-related savings, it is difficult to predict the value of payments to be made to Siemens Business Services.

 The largest single type of violence against women is domestic violence. We have, therefore, initiated a domestic violence publicity and awareness campaign to make clear the impact of violence against women, including how it so often leads to murder; to challenge misconceptions, such as believing that violence within relationships is somehow not a crime, or that the victim is to blame in some way; and to show what we can all do to reduce domestic violence and its impact, including on children who witness the violence.

 Funding for Local Education Authorities for the education of children of Refugees from Kosovo will be provided by the Department in the same way as that for all children on school roll. When we have more information on the number of refugee children from Kosovo likely to come to the UK; their educational needs; and the geographical areas where they will be located, then we will consider what additional funds, if any, local education authorities may need to provide appropriate support.

 At a joint Department for Education and Employment and Refugee Council Seminar on 28 April, I made clear the Government's commitment that the children of refugees entering Britain from Kosovo will have access to education in mainstream schools. The Department is in regular contact with the Local Government Association and the local authorities who have received refugees to date, to arrange suitable school provision. Those contacts will be developed when we have more detailed information on the numbers of refugees from Kosovo likely to enter the country, and the geographical areas in which they will be located.

 The Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 (No. 1102), which were laid before Parliament on 9 April, came into force on 1 May. The Regulations extend the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to cover protection from discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment in the fields of employment and vocational training.

The Government's vision is set out in "Extending opportunity: a national framework for study support" published last year. &#163;80 million of Standards Fund money will be made available from April 2000 for the development of study support activities throughout England. In addition, &#163;425 million of lottery money is being made available through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) over the next four years to support the expansion of out-of-school hours activities--both education and child care. The policy directions issued by my right hon. Friend the Culture Secretary make clear that music, art and drama activities are included within the framework of activities that NOF can fund.

Monitoring of uptake during 1998 showed that both segments succeeded in remaining within their main targets. Following representations from the industry, we approached the Commission to see if unused effort could be carried over into subsequent years. They have now confirmed to us that this is possible. We will accordingly be holding urgent consultation meetings with those concerned to explore how to reflect this in effort allocations for this year.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> A considerable amount of work has been done to estimate the number of duplicate and fraudulent National Insurance Numbers in the Departmental Central Index.
<P>

<a name="90510w14.htm_para0">Since 1995, the Departmental Central Index Data Cleaning Project has checked the database by selecting cases which fit certain risk criteria. The project has so far resolved over 750,000 duplicate records held in the database which were mainly created when details of customers were accidentally recorded incorrectly. Since the project started, it has detected only about 10 cases of the fraudulent use of National Insurance Numbers.
<P>

<a name="90510w14.htm_para1">National Insurance Contributions Office has worked with employers to check their records and looked at over half a million cases: less than 0.1 per cent. of the items were referred for investigation of potential National Insurance Number irregularities.
<P>

<a name="90510w14.htm_para2">The best available measure of the scale of fraud is provided by DSS benefit reviews. Since 1995, two Housing Benefit reviews have been carried out and in no instance was a case of identity fraud confirmed. Two Income Support benefit reviews have been carried out since 1995. The second review reported in 1997, and in 99.1 per cent. of cases randomly selected, identity was established to our satisfaction. The remainder included cases in which the customer could not be found.
<P>

<a name="90510w14.htm_para3">The studies carried out indicate strongly that identity fraud is one of the least common types of fraud, and the fraudulent use of National Insurance Numbers will form only a proportion of identity fraud. Nevertheless, we are determined that the Welfare System should be secure against fraud of this kind. Our best defence against such fraud is through our current policy of rigorously checking all applications for new National Insurance Numbers, and continuing our programme of data-cleaning departmental databases, and ensuring records are reliable.

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 0.1 billion. Gross costs have been provided by the Government Actuary's Department. The cost of uprating basic State pension in line with earnings is net of Income Related Benefit offsets.

2. Estimates should be treated as broad orders of magnitude.

3. Income Support and Housing Benefit offsets have been calculated using PENSIM which does not include offsets for linked benefits.

 We have recently reached the end of the consultation period on our proposals for the State Second Pension. Final decisions, including those on earnings thresholds at which different pension accrual rates apply, will take account of the responses received. However, to achieve the policy intention that higher earners would have broadly the same pension entitlement from State Second Pension as under SERPS, the upper limit for the middle band of earnings would need to be set at approximately &#163;20,000 in 1998-99 terms.

 Around 390,000 men would receive an average payment of &#163;930 with a cost to the Exchequer of &#163;360 million. This assumes entitlement conditions for statutory paternity pay would reflect those for statutory maternity pay. This would require a man to have been with his current employer for at least 26 weeks and have earnings at or above the lower earnings limit for national insurance purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to the oral statement by the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley), on 20 April 1999, <i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> column 864, what assumptions he has made about the cost or savings to the Exchequer of a change in people's behaviour as a result of changes in the law on entitlement to incapacity benefit.  [82721]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90510w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The costings in the explanatory notes to the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill assume that overall the financial effects of any behavioural changes as a result of the proposed changes to Incapacity Benefit will be broadly neutral.
<P>

<a name="90510w15.htm_para3">The behavioural effects of the change to the contribution conditions are assumed to be negligible. This is because it would be difficult for many people to adjust their circumstances in such a way as to ensure that they

<P><I>10 May 1999 : Column: 56</I><P>
meet the contribution conditions at the time when they claim Incapacity Benefit. In addition special arrangements to enable people to re-qualify after short breaks in entitlement without paying further contributions will, together with linking rules, reduce any incentive for people to stay on benefit longer as a result of the new conditions.
<P>

<a name="90510w15.htm_para4">The behavioural effects of the proposal to take some account of occupational and personal pensions over &#163;50 are assumed to be broadly neutral. Potential behavioural changes would include some people increasing their pension income, to compensate for the benefit reduction, which would lead to higher savings. Other people might seek to change their pension arrangements to maintain the level of benefit, which would lead to lower savings. In the absence of any evidence as to which of these effects will predominate it has been assumed that they will broadly cancel each other out. Since only half the pension income over &#163;50 will be deducted from benefit, people on Incapacity Benefit will still gain from having made their own provision.

As well as achieving this through a system of licensing before the marketing of medicines, the agency is also responsible for the monitoring of medicines and acting on safety concerns after the medicines have been placed on the market. The agency checks and monitors the standards of pharmaceutical manufacture and wholesaling, represents UK pharmaceutical regulatory interests internationally, and manages the British Pharmacopoeia Commission in setting quality standards for drug substances.

 The report, "A Survey of Multiple Sclerosis Provision in England 1998-99", was produced by the Association for Quality in Healthcare in November 1998 on behalf of the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
<P>

<a name="90510w17.htm_para0">We have set out our plans to address unacceptable variations in services via a modernisation programme to deliver more consistent and higher quality care for patients. We remain committed to improving standards of healthcare and to ensuring that newer treatments, including new medicines, are introduced into the National Health Service as fast as possible where they represent a genuine therapeutic advance and are cost effective.
<P>

<a name="90510w17.htm_para1">In addition, the move to new commissioning arrangements will bring about improvements in services for people with conditions like MS. Longer term agreements, reflecting dialogue between clinicians and focusing on health improvement and quality objectives, will increase the emphasis on programmes of care that cross the traditional boundaries to meet patients needs best.

<a name="90510w17.htm_para2">In order to inform that programme, the Department commissioned Industrial Relations Services Research to undertake a survey of NHS trusts in England published in August last year, "Equal Opportunities and monitoring in NHS trusts", available from the Department of Health, Wetherby. This survey showed that 98 per cent. of NHS trusts have an equal opportunities in employment policy, but only a minority monitor promotions, redundancies, dismissals or training from an equal opportunities perspective. The survey has provided a baseline against which we are now able to measure progress and set targets for raising standards in employment practice.

This framework sets targets for reducing racial harassment of staff by colleagues and service users, and increasing ethnic minority representation in the work-force. By April 2000, local NHS employers are to have policies and procedures in place to tackle racial harassment, supported by monitoring and reporting arrangements to measure progress. They must also demonstrate that they are making progress year on year in achieving a more representative work-force.

 The study to trace people who might have developed hepatitis C following blood transfusion focused on those who were unlikely to have remained under clinical care and who could benefit from treatment which had then become available. As haemophiliacs are in constant contact with their clinicians, the need to include them in the tracing exercise did not arise as they would have already been known to the service. It was implicit in the hepatitis C exercise that anyone who was concerned about their hepatitis C virus status could request a test.

<a name="90510w19.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government build alliances with other Member States on a range of issues under discussion in the EU both to deepen bilateral relations and to influence the wider EU debate. Work with Spain on employment and economic reform is one example, reflecting a shared approach on many of these issues. The Working Group was established to bring together various strands of existing collaborative work. There is no requirement for a dedicated budget. Gibraltar will not be a focus of the Group's work.

 Our relationship with our European partners is based upon principles of positive engagement and co-operation. This has enabled us to strengthen our influence in Europe without compromising our national interests.
<P>

<a name="90510w19.htm_para0">To help support this new constructive relationship a Ministerial Group for European Co-ordination (MINECOR) was established in December 1998. The members of the MINECOR group are Ministers from all UK Government departments which have an interest in European policy issues. The objective of the group is to achieve greater co-ordination of the presentation of HMG's European policies both within the UK and overseas. To that end, the group considers papers which give guidance to Ministers and officials on the presentation of government policy on Europe. The group also monitors Government efforts to develop closer co-operation with other EU partners and EU applicant countries. The group meets on a regular basis and is chaired by the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin).

 It is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland under the Planning (NI) Order 1991, where it considers it expedient to do so, to take enforcement action against all breaches of planning control.

 In the last year, in the Derry District Council Area, the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) heard 22 appeals. Of these, 18 were allowed and 4 dismissed.

<a name="90510w19.htm_para5">The PAC is an entirely independent body and it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State to comment on the handling of cases by the PAC or on the merits of PAC decisions.
