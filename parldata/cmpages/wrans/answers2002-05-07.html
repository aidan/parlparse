<a name="20507w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will provide a breakdown of the investment her Department made in 2000&#150;01 to the programmes designed to improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.  [49877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department's expenditure in this area is reported under the objective of "Promotion of enterprise, innovation and increased productivity". The total cash outturn for this objective is shown in the Appropriation Accounts 2000&#150;01 (HC 335-IX), and the resource outturn in the Consolidated Resource Accounts 2000&#150;01 (HC503). Further breakdowns will shortly be published in the Department's Expenditure Plans Report for 2002&#150;03, and also in the Treasury's Supplementary Budgetary Information (SBI) tables. I regret that a breakdown between manufacturing and service sectors is not available. However, a good proportion of this money, though not all, will have benefited manufacturing directly or indirectly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which of the services of her Department have not been reviewed under the Better Quality Services Initiative; and when they will be reviewed.  [50319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Department has been reviewing its services under the Better Quality Services programme for some time (see Trade and Industry&#151;The Government's Expenditure Plans 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04), and building on this work, my Department has recently undertaken a review of its role, priorities and structure, and a review of its business support. As a result of these reviews, from 2 April 2002, a new structure has been put in place that is designed to help facilitate change and help the Department become more customer-focused. Tools and techniques from BQS will now be included in the Department's change management programme as part of improving customer focus and the effectiveness and value for money of service delivery. The Department is continuing its reviews of its agencies in line with BQS principles.

 The Common Position text requires the end of life costs for equipment imported into the UK to be met by the manufacturer in the case of EU-made goods or the professional importer in the case of goods made outside the EU.
<P>

<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK continues to support the Common Position text adopted by member states at the Council of Ministers meeting in June 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government's policy was to welcome the establishment of the EU R and D expert group on countering biological and chemical terrorism which should lead to improved coordination of member states' research efforts in this field.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on what subjects and on which dates her Department has consulted organisations representing young people; and if she will list such organisations.  [52492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I regret to inform my hon. Friend that the information is not held centrally in the manner requested and that the information can be secured only at disproportionate cost.




<P>
<P><I>7 May 2002 : Column 3W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20507w01.html_para2">However, the Department of Trade and Industry will be guided by the new core principles for the involvement of children and young people in the design, provision and evaluation of policies and services that affect them. These principles were published by the Minister with responsibility for young people in November 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_wqn7"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what progress her Department is making in establishing a quality mark scheme for the construction industry;  [52990]
<P>
<UL>(2) what action she is taking to rationalise the number of registration schemes which promote quality within the construction industry.  [52991]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister with responsbility for energy and construction announced his decision to roll out the scheme across the country over a three to four year period, in his answer to the question from the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) on 12 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 891W. A Quality Mark Shadow Ownership Group has since been set up and, at its first meeting on 19 April, it began developing a comprehensive implementation strategy and detailed business plan. The group is finalising decisions about the next stages of the roll out.
<P>

<a name="20507w01.html_para3">Following recommendations in the pilot review, the scheme is developing recruitment mechanisms to accelerate achievement of a critical mass of members. So far 175 builders have been awarded the Quality Mark and 247 are in the assessment pipeline, with more firms expected to apply shortly.
<P>

<a name="20507w01.html_para4">The DTI is also working with local authorities, financial services groups, consumer groups and others to promote the scheme to tradesmen and encourage their participation.
<P>

<a name="20507w01.html_para5">The national launch of the Quality Mark at the Ideal Home Show produced extensive television and radio coverage and articles in regional newspapers. The scheme is already being marketed successfully to consumers in Birmingham and Somerset through a variety of media, including Yellow Pages and Thomsons directories, household leaflet distribution with advertising and editorial coverage in a number of local papers and radio stations. Further targeted marketing will follow in new areas once sufficient numbers of builders and tradesmen are registered, to satisfy consumer demand.
<P>

<a name="20507w01.html_para6">The DTI is working with a number of trade bodies to fast-track members into the Quality Mark scheme through use of trade association vetting procedures adapted as necessary. The DTI is also examining the scope for developing closer links between the Quality Mark and Constructionline, looking for some form of passporting system between the two schemes that might allow fee reductions and reduce duplication of assessments. However, the schemes do have different client targets and operating systems and a number of issues need to be considered carefully. In addition, the DTI has been liaising closely with DTLR on self-certification schemes and extension of non-notification of building work under amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 2002]:</i> Ministers and civil servants meet many people as part of the process of policy development and analysis. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code, the Civil Service Code and Guidance for Civil Servants: Contacts with Lobbyists. Some of these discussions take place on a confidential basis, and in order to preserve confidentiality, it is not the normal practice of Governments to release details of specific meetings with private individuals or companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 A decision to bid for work on the US-initiated programme of National Missile Defence is a commercial one for individual firms to make. DTI Ministers and officials have regular meetings with UK aerospace and defence companies on a range of issues and is supportive of decisions to bid for work in this and in other areas.

<a name="20507w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Watts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the Government will introduce improved safeguards to stop employers requiring their employees to work overtime without payment.  [54187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Payment for overtime is a contractual matter for negotiation and a agreement between employers and employees (or their representatives). Employees can already seek redress in the form of a breach of contract claim if they suffer financial loss because any terms of their contracts of employment are changed without their consent. Workers can also seek redress if unlawful deductions are made from their wages.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B>

Schedule 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 specifies that notice of an application for leave to refer a case to the Court of Appeal shall be given to the Registrar of Criminal Appeals within 28 days from the day on which the sentence, or the last of the sentences, in the case was passed.

<P>
<a name="20507w03.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> From the research that has been possible in the time available, I am aware of three cases in which a claim of sovereign immunity has been made or intimated in Northern Ireland conflict-related cases.
<P>

<a name="20507w03.html_para3">The cases are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>McElhinney <i>v</i>. Williams and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in which proceedings were commenced in the Republic against the United Kingdom Government by a claimant who claimed in respect of an alleged shooting incident at the border. The decision of the Irish Supreme Court is reported at [1996] ILRM 275, and the Court explains in detail the basis of sovereign immunity upon which it upheld the order striking out the claim.
<P>
<BR>
Bridget McGovern <i>v</i>. Ministry of Defence (in the early 1990s, unreported), in which the claimant claimed in the Republic in respect of damage to her property caused by an explosion at the border. Her claim was struck out by the Irish Court on grounds of sovereign immunity. Ms McGovern subsequently issued proceedings in the Courts of Northern Ireland and recovered damage for her loss.
<P>
<BR>
Adams <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and George Mitchell (1998 unreported). Mr. Gerry Adams sought judicial review in the Court of the Republic in respect of the decision of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to exclude Sinn Fein at that stage from the peace negotiations. A claim for sovereign immunity was to be made but the claim was not pursued to a substantive hearing, probably because the negotiations returned to Northern Ireland.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20507w03.html_para4">Sovereign immunity is an elementary principle of international law which states that in general an independent sovereign state may not be sued in the courts of a foreign state against its will and without its consent. One factor of relevance is which is the most convenient forum for the claim to be heard, and it is noteworthy from the McGovern case that Ms McGovern was able successfully to pursue her claim in the Courts of Northern Ireland.

 So far this year, Ghana and Sierra Leone have reached their decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, bringing the total to 26 out of a total of 42 HIPCs. We hope that, by autumn, Cote d'lvoire will be added to the list of countries benefiting from the Initiative. In 2003, three countries (Comoros, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo) may qualify for HIPC relief. The prospects for the remaining eight unsustainable countries are not good. Six&#151;Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan&#151;are still affected by conflict; Togo has governance problems; and Lao PDR is undecided as to whether to opt for HIPC relief. Angola, Kenya, Vietnam and Yemen already have sustainable debt burdens.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) if she will list the multilateral institutions which received payments from the HIPC Trust Fund to cover their provision of debt relief broken down by <i>(a)</i> amount received and <i>(b)</i> country;  [53787]
<P>
<UL>(2) which countries had financial assistance from a multilateral debt fund in the financial years <i>(a)</i> 2000&#150;01 and <i>(b)</i> 2001&#150;02; and how much they received.  [53788]<P></UL>

<a name="20507w04.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative Trust Fund makes payments to multilateral creditors to enable them to meet their shares of the costs of providing debt relief to eligible HIPC countries. The Trust Fund is administered by the International Development Association (IDA), which holds the details of information sought. I will write to the hon. Member with further information shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much of the bilateral debt owed to the United Kingdom by each of the HIPC eligible countries <i>(a)</i> has been written off and <i>(b)</i> is outstanding, broken down by country.  [53789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w04.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The total outstanding bilateral debt owed to the UK by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) is &#163;1.529 billion; the amount written off is &#163;0.703 billion. Most of this relates to old rescheduled debt owed to ECGD from the 1970s and 1980s; details are set out, by HIPC country, in table 1. The outstanding debt figure includes &#163;53 million of aid loans which have already been cancelled but are still in DFID's accounts, as payments are written off as they become due; details are set out, by HIPC country, in table 2.
<P>

<a name="20507w04.html_para1">The Government provide 100 per cent. relief on their bilateral debt to HIPC countries once they qualify for debt relief under the HIPC initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the proposals to increase health aid budgets contained in the World Health Organisation's report by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, published on 20 December; and what role her Department has played in the report's distribution in the United Kingdom and in British overseas territories and embassies.  [54166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w05.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We welcome the broad messages of the Commission for Macroeconomics (CMH) report. It has provided clear evidence that investing in health is far more important for economic development and wider poverty reduction than was previously understood, and we embrace the call for extra resources from both donors and developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para0">I hosted the worldwide launch of the CMH report at the Department for International Development headquarters in December. Later this month I shall be opening a conference (organised and part funded by my Department) to disseminate the messages of the report to the global audience and plan how to take these findings forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress has been made toward the 2015 targets for reducing poverty.  [53711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w05.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Latest forecasts from the World Bank suggest that globally, meeting the 2015 target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty is attainable. There has been progress. During the 1990s, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world fell from 29 per cent. in 1990, to 23 per cent. in 1999. This was mainly due to the substantial progress made during the 1990s in east Asia, and in particular China.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para1">In the developing world, progress has also been made during the 1990s against almost all the other 2015 Millennium Development targets. The proportion of children completing a full course of primary school

increased from 68 per cent. to 73 per cent.; the under-five mortality rate decreased from 88 to 84 deaths per 1,000 births; and the proportion of people with access to an improved water source increased from 73 per cent. to 79 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para2">However, to meet all of the 2015 targets progress must be improved. The sub-Saharan African region presents the biggest challenge to meeting the 2015 targets. We need an enormous effort internationally to accelerate progress in Africa. My Department is dedicated to do all in its power to accelerate progress towards the targets.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para3">A detailed description of progress towards all the 2015 targets is contained in a recent World bank publication: World Development Indicators 2002, which can be found at the following website: http://www.worldbank.org/ata/ wdi2002/worldview.pdf.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w05.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 A St. Helena Government team visited the UK in February 2002 to take forward discussions on air access for the island with my officials. The team reported on these discussions to the St. Helena Government at the beginning of April. Further discussions on the issue of air access will take place over the coming months.

<UL>(2) what role her Department will play in the interpretation of "humanitarian" in relation to tax relief on the responsible donation of medical supplies and equipment to developing countries announced in the Budget.  [53344]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w05.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has been working closely with HM Treasury, Inland Revenue and other Departments on a range of measures to improve access to medicines for the developing world, including tax relief on donations of medical supplies.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para4">The tax measure is intended to be supportive of health strategies in developing countries. The Inland Revenue will be issuing guidance to its tax inspectors on interpreting what constitutes a donation for "humanitarian purposes". The Inland Revenue guidance will include appropriate reference to elements of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines.
<P>

<a name="20507w05.html_para5">The WHO guidelines clearly set out that drug donations should: constitute a sustainable contribution to government health strategies in developing countries; be based on need and relevant to the disease pattern of recipient countries; have at least one year remaining shelf

<P>
<a name="20507w06.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 This project was formally reviewed in June 2001 and has been monitored on a regular basis since then. It is an institutional building project focused at national and local government levels, NGOs and civil society. The project is assisting the Polish authorities in changing the way regional planning is implemented in line with good EU practice by the instruction of a more participative and bottom-up approach to decision-making processes.
<P>

<a name="20507w06.html_para0">DFID assessments have shown that the project is providing value for money in terms of its impact on (i) the progress being made in the Lubelski voivodship in building local capacity and networks and (ii) links being made into the national policy debate to inform regional policy in preparation for Poland's accession to the EU and its future effective use of structural funds.

 The local government White Paper&#151;"Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services"&#151;set out our intention to pool a proportion of housing capital receipts arising in debt free authorities to finance new housing investment in areas where it is most needed. The change will put the treatment of housing capital receipts in debt free authorities on an equal footing with their treatment in other authorities. It also removes a real disincentive to authorities to take up the new borrowing freedoms planned as part of the simplification of the local authority capital finance system described in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="20507w06.html_para1">The change will be introduced alongside the wider changes to the local authority capital finance system which require primary legislation; the timing of this is still to be decided. The detailed arrangements for pooling, including the proportion of receipts to be pooled, and the allocation of resources from the pool are currently being considered. The new arrangements will not apply to receipts already realised. We will be consulting on detailed proposals and will report on the outcome of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="20507w06.html_para2">The number of authorities that will be affected by the change will depend on what happens to debt levels and on housing stock transfers between now and the introduction of the pooling arrangement. A list of the authorities that were debt free at 1 April 2001 was given in reply to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) on 9 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 330&#150;32W. Housing capital receipts are mainly generated from the sale of dwellings and around 30 of these authorities own council housing. The amount of additional resources for allocation from the pool to fund new housing investment will depend on the proportion of receipts to be pooled and future levels or receipts for debt free authorities.

 The report on the progress on the adoption of area wide local plans and unitary development plans is published today and details the progress made by local authorities in England in preparing and reviewing their development plans.
<P>

<a name="20507w06.html_para3">Although it was considered that the publication of the planning Green Paper would raise uncertainties in respect of local authorities preparing plans, this report gives a clear indication that local authorities are continuing with development plan work. We have yet to achieve 100 per cent. national coverage and there are still 13 per cent. of LPAs who have not produced an adopted development plan. The continuing delays in adopting local plans and, subsequently, altering or replacing those plans adds weight to the recommendations in the planning Green Paper on the need for reform of the planning system to introduce faster and more flexible arrangements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w06.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions which proposals in the planning Green Paper would require <i>(a)</i> primary legislation and <i>(b)</i> secondary legislation to be implemented.  [54448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 A number of the proposals will require changes to primary legislation. Among them the proposals to abolish structure plans, local plans and unitary development plans and replace them with the new Local Development Framework, and introducing statutory Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) to replace Regional Planning Guidance. Powers would need to be introduced for major infrastructure projects to be referred to Parliament and any changes to the current system of planning obligations. A number of development control measures such as putting funding for planning aid on a statutory basis and introducing a planning checklist are likely to require primary legislation. While some legislative amendment may be required for the introduction of business planning zones.
<P>

<a name="20507w06.html_para4">Many of the changes in the Green Paper can be made by secondary legislation. In particular those development control measures designed to speed up and made the process more transparent such as the proposals to enable electronic submission of planning applications and appeals, and the requirement on local authorities to make copies of plans and planning applications publicly available at low or no cost. A number of the proposals will requires amendments to be made to the General Development Procedure Order.

 Smith and Williamson were appointed under a framework agreement under which each work assignment commissioned forms a contract in its own right (in accordance with the terms and conditions of the overarching framework). The framework was let following a competitive tender exercise conducted under the EC Restricted procedure, i. e. service requirement advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities, Expressions of Internet (EOIs) invited from potential suppliers, EOIs sifted to select those to be invited to tender.

 Prior to the introduction of the Supporting People programme most local authorities were not involved in the practice of mapping supply of assisted living units in their area. It is therefore not possible to provide the information you require.

<P>
<a name="20507w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Department is very concerned about the number of public transport workers who are assaulted at work. The Department is raising awareness and addressing the issue through research programmes and good practice guidance for public transport operators.
<P>

<a name="20507w07.html_para1">Work-related violence is a health and safety issue, and employers have a legal duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 to protect their staff from the risk of violence in the course of their work. The specific assistance given to public transport workers who are assaulted at work is a matter for the individual transport operator. For example, London Underground staff receive support from their managers in the form of sympathetic treatment, home visits, hospital visits (if applicable), gradual reintroduction to the work place (including move of location if appropriate), assistance in legal proceedings (support at court) and assistance with CICA claims. They may also receive support from in-house Employee Assistance.

<P>
<a name="20507w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Railway Safety Regulations 1999 require automatic train protection (ATP), where reasonably practical, or otherwise the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), to be fitted on all trains and throughout the network by the end of 2003. The rail industry estimates that TPWS should mitigate over 80 per cent. of ATP-preventable risk. Mandatory common technical specifications (TSIs) developed under the European rail interoperability directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC will mean that a European form of ATP, known as the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), should be fitted to all high speed and many conventional rail lines in Great Britain when they are constructed, upgraded or (conventional lines only) renewed.
<P>

<a name="20507w07.html_para2">The public inquiry report into train protection systems, chaired by Professor Uff and Lord Cullen, recommended that ERTMS be adopted as the standard form of train protection in this country. On 25 April the rail industry published a report setting out what it considered a feasible timetable for fitting ERTMS to Britain's railways. I have asked the Health and Safety Commission, as the independent rail safety regulator, to review the industry report. They will want to have a constructive debate on all the issues raised including costs and timing before they report back to me with formal recommendations. I look forward to receiving the Health and Safety Commission's recommendations and then deciding the best way forward.
<P>

<a name="20507w07.html_para3">The report from the Commission for Integrated Transport argued that level 1 of ERTMS would reduce capacity on high speed, high capacity lines, causing travellers to switch to roads, with a much worse safety record than rail, leading to more fatalities overall. The industry report on ERTMS makes a similar point. I would expect the HSC to consider these points when reviewing the report and making their recommendations.

 The winners of the Strategic Rail Authority's (SRA's) freight innovation competition were announced on 13 June 2000. The contracts were signed on 26 January 2001 in all three cases and none of these contracts have been renegotiated. The terms of the contracts are commercially confidential and could not be disclosed without the agreement of all parties to the contracts. The Authority selected projects submitted which scored highest against the published criteria and these were audited by a consultant to assess their deliverability in all areas including vehicle acceptance and operational issues prior to selection. The guidance notes for applicants, which include the criteria used to judge the competition, have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Up to the end of the year 2001&#150;02 the SRA, which is wholly responsible for financing the competition, has spent &#163;4.52 million as a result of it.

 Public service employers will implement in full the European Court of Justice ruling concerning the right of part-time public service employees to gain retrospective access to their pension scheme. All part-timers have had the right to join their occupational pension scheme since 1995, and in many public service schemes from an earlier date. The current ruling on the Preston case concerns the treatment of part-timers' service prior to 1995 (or the relevant date of full admission). The Employment Tribunals are currently considering a number of issues, which will determine the eligibility of part-timers and their entitlements under the ECJ ruling.

 There are no direct statistics on the proportion of UK GDP accounted for by immigrants, and the data required to produce indirect estimates do not extend back to 1972. However, in 2001 foreign-born people accounted for around 8 per cent. of total UK employment, and the average gross weekly pay of foreign-born employees was about 16 per cent. above the average for all employees. On this basis, and assuming that relative wage rates proxy relative labour productivity, it can be estimated that the foreign-born population accounted for around 10 per cent. of UK GDP in 2001.

<a name="20507w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Since 1 April 2001, the VAT annual accounting scheme has been available to some 1 million businesses, but less than 10,000 have so far taken it up. In the consultation document "Easing the impact of VAT", the Government explained that "despite the administrative and cash flow benefits, take up of the scheme is currently very low" and set out plans to reform the scheme to encourage greater take-up. These reforms were introduced on 25 April and are expected to achieve a significant increase in take-up of the scheme.

<a name="20507w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In the Budget, the Government announced that&#151;from next April&#151;the flat rate scheme will be available to 700,000 small businesses with turnovers up to &#163;150,000. If the upper turnover limit of the flat-rate scheme was extended to &#163;200,000 or &#163;250,000, approximately 80,000 or 130,000 additional traders would respectively be eligible to join. The costs of such an extension would depend on the details of such proposals, including the rates applicable under the scheme.

 Unlike Gurkhas who are recruited in accordance with the 1947 Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) between the Governments of India, Nepal and the UK, recruits from Commonwealth countries are employed as individuals and fully integrated into the armed forces. With the exception of the following allowances, recruits from Commonwealth countries have the same pay, conditions of service and pension rights as United Kingdom-born recruits. The allowances that are specifically designed to meet the needs of recruits from the Commonwealth are:

[54317]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Gurkhas are recruited into the Army in accordance with the 1947 Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) between the Governments of India, Nepal and the UK. This is the basic instrument that enables both the UK and India to raise and maintain formed Gurkha Regiments and aims to ensure that both Armies are able to recruit on an equal basis. As a result Gurkhas Terms and Conditions of Service, including basic pay and pensions, remain linked to those of the Indian Army. We have no plans to review these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20507w12.html_para0">There have, however, been significant enhancements to Gurkha conditions of service in recent years. Gurkhas are now paid a cost of living allowance known as Universal Addition for service in all theatres outside Nepal. This allowance is uplifted annually to ensure that the combination of Gurkha basic pay at Indian Army rates and Universal Addition brings their remuneration broadly into line with the net pay of comparable British Service personnel. These arrangements have been in place since 1997.




<P>
<P><I>7 May 2002 : Column 45W</I><P>
The approximate cost to the Ministry of Defence of the pensions paid to former Gurkha soldiers in each of the last five financial years is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1997&#150;98: &#163;5.3 million
<P>
<BR>
1998&#150;99: &#163;6 million
<P>
<BR>
1999&#150;2000: &#163;8.2 million
<P>
<BR>
2000&#150;01: &#163;23.9 million
<P>
<BR>
2001&#150;02: &#163;26 million (includes forecasted expenditure).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20507w12.html_para1">The significant increase in expenditure for the financial year 2000&#150;01 reflects the outcome of a comprehensive examination of Gurkha pensions conducted by the Ministry of Defence at that time. This led to all Gurkha pensions being at least doubled and they now compare favourably to professional salaries in Nepal, where all Gurkhas are discharged. The vast majority of Gurkha pensioners, who continue to be entitled to an immediate pension after only 15 year's service, welcomed the outcome of the examination. British service personnel discharged at this point of service would receive no pension until they reached the age of 60. We remain of the view that the arguments for an immediate pension on discharge in Nepal are compelling.
<P>

<a name="20507w12.html_para2">Because of the different terms of service and career structures that apply, it is very difficult to make the direct comparisons that are sought. The cost of transposing British service personnel pay and conditions of service to Gurkhas cannot be computed accurately, and not without incurring disproportionate costs.

<a name="20507w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As at 1 April 2002, there are 3,449 Gurkhas serving in the British Army. They serve in a variety of roles, mainly in the infantry but also with significant numbers of engineers, signals and logistics specialists. We expect Gurkha manning to remain at around this level for the foreseeable future.

 We currently have some 360 shore-based military personnel deployed in Sierra Leone, supported by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Sir Geraint, and we will maintain our presence at that level over the period of presidential and parliamentary elections in May 2002. We are also contributing 15 military observers and seven headquarters staff to UNAMSIL, the UN operation in Sierra Leone.

<P>
<a name="20507w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Pilot Officer is a rank and it covers all RAF officer branches not just pilots and navigators. Potential pilots and navigators are selected for the General Duties Branch and applicants are recruited as either a Pilot Officer, Flying Officer or exceptionally as a Flight Lieutenant.
<P>

<a name="20507w12.html_para3">Usually all pilot or navigator applicants that have been successful at Initial Officer Training are offered a flying training place. On rare occasions there may be exceptions. Withdrawal could be for a range of reasons, such as personal, medical or issues of conduct. We do not keep a specific count of these instances because they are infrequent. A trawl of our records for the last three years identified only one officer that was unable to take up flying training. All other officers in the period would have been offered or are in the process of being offered a flying training place.

<P>
<a name="20507w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government has published today the draft Communications Bill and an accompanying policy document on a number of matters, including Gaelic broadcasting. We plan to secure improvements in the current delivery of service in various ways. We propose to build on the strengths of the Gaelic Broadcasting Committee by extending its representative base and by giving it a new statutory power to plan strategically for development of the service. The policy document indicates also our intention that I will assume a power of approval for appointments to the new committee as part of improved accountability procedures. We are considering within the Spending Review the scope for some additional investment to support these and other changes. Urgent talks convened by my Department will now begin on the detail of the proposed committee role and on the possibility of creating a more unified structure in the oversight and transmission of Gaelic programmes.
<P>

<a name="20507w12.html_para4">The Milne Committee recommendations have helped to focus on the need for overhaul of the current structures but we do not agree that the scale of change and extra resourcing they proposed is feasible or justified. I believe 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 2002 : Column 47W</I><P>
our policy intentions represent a constructive response to meeting some of the Gaelic speaking community's aspirations for a better co-ordinated service. We look forward to working with the community's representatives and with the broadcasting interests to make it happen.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> Because of the difficulties of collecting sheep brain material that is in a suitable condition for strain typing by conventional bioassay in mice, and because of the length of time it takes to get the results from such studies, work is in hand to develop and evaluate molecular methods of distinguishing BSE from scrapie. SEAC has recently endorsed a programme of work at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency which includes a statistical analysis of the robustness of molecular approaches, retrospective testing of 1,400 sheep brains which were positive for a TSE in the VLA archive and prospective sampling of the brains from all clinically reported suspects which prove to be positive for a TSE.

 The Department is engaged in a wide range of regional and international processes to combat the principal threats to sustainable development. Many of these are referred to in recent answers to my hon. Friend. As far as the European Union is concerned, the Government has strongly supported the recent agreement by the European Council on a sustainable development strategy for the EU which sets high-level objectives and targets and aims to provide a more coherent framework for the EU's policies. This strategy is expected to be extended at the Seville European Council to cover the EU's external responsibilities, notably on trade, aid and governance.

 The Department suffered severe disruption last year due to allocating top priority to defeating the Foot and Mouth epidemic. Furthermore the sheer volume of correspondence following the creation of DEFRA had a major impact on the Department's performance, resulting in a large backlog of letters. Mechanisms are now in place to prevent any further recurrence of the problems experienced, and a range of work is in hand to tighten both quality and the speed of our response to Member's letters. The events of last year were exceptional, and their impact is still being felt across a range of Departmental activity.

<P>

<a name="20507w14.html_para0">An important part of the research programme is the badger field trial which recommenced from 1 May 2002. The trial is designed to evaluate, once and for all, the extent to which badgers contribute to cattle TB and the effects of badger culling on the incidence of the disease. It will provide data on the prevalence of TB in badgers and the spatial distribution of infected badgers and social groups, its relationship to population density, social group size and structure, geographical and physical environmental factors and, most importantly, the spatial relationship between TB in cattle and badgers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the Environment Agency's data on nitrate levels in rivers located in the Macclesfield parliamentary constituency; what comparison she has made of these data with the 50mg/litre threshold contained in the Nitrate Vulnerable Zone Directive; for what reason farmland located in the Macclesfield constituency is included in a nitrate vulnerable zone; and if she will make a statement.  [54042]<P>

 There are currently no existing nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) in the Macclesfield parliamentary constituency.

<P>

<a name="20507w15.html_para1">The Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) requires action programmes for reduction of agricultural nitrate pollution to waters to be applied either throughout the whole territory (Option 1 in our recent consultation for England) or within specific NVZs (Option 2).
<P>

<a name="20507w15.html_para2">Under Option 1, farmers throughout the whole of Macclesfield parliamentary constituency would need to apply Action Programme measures.
<P>

<a name="20507w15.html_para3">Under Option 2, an indicative map showing the location of possible new NVZ areas, as identified in an initial assessment, was published in the consultation document "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive", in December 2001. Parts of the Macclesfield parliamentary constituency were included in these areas because they were parts of river catchments which contained one or more monitoring points where nitrate levels have been shown, through statistical analysis of the data, to have exceeded the levels specified in the Nitrates Directive.
<P>

<a name="20507w15.html_para4">We are refining our assessment of these failing monitoring points to take account of data anomalies and long-term nitrate concentration trends. We are also carrying out more accurate mapping work to identify precisely which parts of each catchment would require designation as NVZs. As was explained in the consultation document, such refinements are expected to alter some of the possible NVZ boundaries illustrated in the consultation document.
<P>

<a name="20507w15.html_para5">A decision on how the Government intends to implement the Nitrate Directive will be announced in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent discussions she has held with UK Sport and the Greater London Authority regarding a future London Olympic bid.  [54123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The decision on whether or not to launch a bid for the Olympic games is a matter principally for the British Olympic Association which has yet to decide whether to make a bid for the 2012 games. I have not discussed a bid with UK Sport, the Greater London authority or the BOA. My Department, together with the BOA, GLA and UK Sport, is sponsoring a cost-benefit analysis of a possible London Olympic bid, and we will take decisions once that work is complete.

 As is standard in PPP arrangements of this kind, the PRO's contract with QinetiQ includes a clause which would allow it to terminate in the event of contractor default and to acquire the contractor's interests in the services infrastructure. In the highly unlikely event of a default because of financial failure at QinetiQ, the activation of this clause would provide the basis for an alternative way of delivering the 1901 online census service.

 The two sites are very different in character&#151;the Scottish census site manages 4.5 million names as opposed to 32.5 million names on the 1901 Census for England and Wales, and the present population of Scotland is approximately a tenth of that in England and Wales. The payment model chosen for the online sensus in Scotland imposes an initial &#163;6 charge for access to the site and units of &#163;6 thereafter. The 1901 Census for England and Wales has an entirely free index search facility, which can be used without any restriction; the

minimum fee for access to transcriptions or record images is &#163;5, in return for which the user can obtain between six and ten copies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w19.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Matters of probate are included within the scope of public funding under the Legal Services Commission's (LSC's) Funding Code which is approved by Parliament under the Access to Justice Act 1999. As a result, public funding for Legal Help or Legal Representation (formerly legal aid) could be available in such a case to individual family members who could demonstrate their financial eligibility, subject to a funding assessment of the merits of the case by the LSC.
<P>

<a name="20507w19.html_para1">Financial eligibility is determined by assessing the gross income, disposable income and capital of the applicant; a funding assessment is carried out to establish whether it is reasonable, taking all the circumstances into account, for public funding to be granted.

<a name="20507w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para0">Schedule 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 is a list of cruelty, violent and sexual offences against children. This list has been used by various agencies as a way of identifying those committing these offences as posing a risk to children, although not all necessarily do so or do so currently. Some of those guilty of offences on the list, for example, may have committed the offence many years previously, may themselves have been children at the time and the offence may have, for example, involved a fight with another child of a similar age. Others convicted of offences on the list may have been engaged in mutually agreed sexual activity, albeit with someone under the age of legal consent, to whom they were relatively close in age. There are no specified requirements flowing from commission of an offence on Schedule 1 of this Act that prohibit offenders from having unsupervised contact with children. There are, however, other more recent means of achieving this and of protecting children from the risk that violent and sexual offenders pose.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para1">Those offenders sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment are released subject to a licence which can include, in relevant cases, a requirement not to have unsupervised contact with children. Breach of these conditions can result in a return to prison. Moreover, a similar prohibition can be included in a Sex Offender 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 2002 : Column 74W</I><P>
Order, for which the police can apply to magistrates' court with respect to a convicted sex offender whose current behaviour indicates they pose a risk of serious harm. Breaching the terms of the order may result in a maximum sentence of up to five years imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para2">Part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 provides for certain of those convicted of offences against children to be disqualified from seeking or taking employment, whether paid or unpaid, with children in the future.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para3">The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act also placed a statutory duty jointly on the policy and probation services to put arrangements in place for assessing and managing the risk posed by sexual and violent offenders. These arrangements enable a risk assessment to be undertaken and plans to be devised for managing the risk that such offenders pose.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para4">Despite these measures, it nonetheless remains important for parents to be vigilant about those to whom they entrust the care of their children, particularly when they are not present to ensure their safety.

<P>
<a name="20507w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 On 5 July 2001 the House considered the latest report of the SSRB on the parliamentary pension scheme. The House agreed to four of the eight recommendations of the SSRB and invited the trustees of the scheme to consider the remaining recommendations. The trustees are now reaching agreement on how to implement all eight recommendations, including extension of entitlement to unmarried partners and continuation of entitlement to surviving partners who have subsequently remarried. The trustees will be able to fund these improvements with no additional charge to Members.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para5">The House also voted to increase the accrual rate from 1/50th to 1/40th. The Government do not accept the proposal in the resolution that all the cost should fall on the Treasury. It has therefore referred the cost of this improvement to the SSRB and invited their advice on how it should be funded.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para6">The SSRB has been asked to report by 1 July. Thereafter the Government will table a statutory instrument giving effect to all recommendations of the SSRB.

<P>
<a name="20507w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what are the levels of pensions as a proportion of average weekly earnings in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> each other EU member state.  [19956]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The most recent figures available date from 1994&#150;95 (except those for Italy where they are from 1993&#150;94). They do not take account of the fact that since 1997 this Department has taken a number of measures to improve the income of pensioners, particularly the poorest of this group. Over 2 million pensioners benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), currently &#163;98.15 for a single pensioner and over 10 million pensioners benefited from the above inflation increases in basic Retirement Pension. Over 11 million Winter Fuel Payments, at a cost of around &#163;1.7 billion, were sent out last winter.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para10">Since 1997 single pensioners in receipt of MIG, Winter Fuel Payments and free TV licences are at least &#163;18.00 a week better off and pensioner couples have gained by more than &#163;27.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para11">A further step is the Government's intention to introduce Pension Credit in October 2003. Around half of all pensioner households will be eligible for the Pension Credit&#151;5.1 million individual pensioners or 3.9 million pensioner households stand to gain (excludes those living in residential care and nursing homes). On average, they will gain &#163;400 a year, with some getting up to &#163;1,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para12">It will get more money into pensioner's pockets and ensure that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;100 a week (&#163;154 a week for couples).
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para13">The level of average UK pension income from all sources of income as a proportion of average weekly earnings is not available. The level as a proportion of population net income is 78 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w20.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Annual upratings have never been generally paid abroad. Exceptions apply under the EC's Social Security Regulations, which apply to pensioners who have a UK pension living in the European Economic Area, and under reciprocal social security agreements with other countries, which allow for increases to be paid there. The countries with which the UK has reciprocal agreements which allow pension upratings to be paid are: Barbados, Bermuda, the Channel Islands, Cyprus, Israel, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, the Philippines, Switzerland, Turkey, the USA and the now separate republics of the former Federal Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia Montenegro, Bosnia Herzegovina), Croatia, Slovenia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). Pensions are not uprated in any other country.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para15">To bring everyone up to the current rate they would receive if they had remained in the UK, but not to pay arrears, would cost around &#163;400 million in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20507w20.html_para16">Uprating is paid in some countries because the Government are either legally required to do so or have previously entered into reciprocal agreements to do so. However, the underlying intention of uprating is that it is meant to cover increases in the cost of living in this country.

 The benefit system has undergone radical changes in the last 30 years. For this reason, it is not possible to compare like with like. From 1972 until 1988, supplementary benefit was in payment. The assessment of entitlement for supplementary benefit was complex, and the introduction of income support addressed and simplified this assessment. Income support continues to be paid through the minimum income guarantee. There were considerable differences between the benefits, for example, on some occasions, supplementary benefit was uprated

twice a year. The figures quoted are based on benefit years (April to March) rather than calendar years&#151;rates may be different to published rates as they represent an average over the benefit year, eg in 2002 MIG was uprated on 9 April therefore we have assumed there were eight days when MIG was still at the old rate.

educate children with statements of SEN, they will have to show that the education of such children is incompatible with the provision of efficient education for other children, and that there are no reasonable steps they can take to prevent this incompatibility. The revised SEN Code of Practice has been designed to decrease bureaucracy while improving the SEN framework. The Code includes guidance on the new duty for head teachers to ensure that a Transition Plan is drawn up for pupils with statements of SEN in year nine of their schooling.
<P>

<a name="20507w22.html_para4">In 2001&#150;02, head teachers prepared for the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting, which will benefit all schools by improving the framework for benchmarking, as well as streamlining financial administration. Head teachers had to implement modest changes to target setting for Key Stage 4. They also had to process claims for the Welcome Back Bonus, an incentive to encourage teachers returning to the profession.
<P>

<a name="20507w22.html_para5">Administration of the Standards Fund was considerably simplified last year, so that head teachers and others had much less paperwork to contend with in securing additional funds for their schools. Moreover, for the first time it was possible to merge schools' annual reports with prospectuses, again freeing up valuable head teacher time.

 Following a review of the medical workforce, published in December 1997, and the commitments made in the NHS Plan in July 2000, the number of places available to study medicine in England will increase to almost 6,000 in 2005&#150;06. Of the additional places, over 45 per cent. will be at new medical schools or centres of medical education. The report "Securing Our Future Health: Taking A Long-Term View" (the Wanless report) makes no recommendation for further increasing the number of students entering medical training. The cost of training nurses, midwives, health visitors and other health professionals is met by the NHS.

numbers; and what it would receive under the LSC's own funding formula, which reflects the nature and number of programmes being studied. The LSC allocation for the school is the higher of these two figures. Almost two thirds of schools are being funded under the LSC's formula in 2002&#150;03, so are receiving more than they would under the real terms guarantee.
<P>

<a name="20507w22.html_para6">The LSC notified LEAs of the sixth form funding allocations for their schools in early March. It was for LEAs to set overall budgets for all their schools by the end of March, incorporating the LSC allocations. Schools receive the funds from the LEA as one pot of money and are not required to account separately for the LSC allocation. However, LEAs are required under the rules of fair funding to ensure that schools receive for their sixth forms at least the real terms guarantee and one third of any difference between that and the LSC formula allocation, rising to the full amount by 2004.

previous year. This will enable the LSC to make progress towards its key targets. These include increasing the participation and achievement of young people in learning (including work based learning) and increasing the demand for learning by adults and employers. We have also increased the flexibility available to the LSC to meet its priorities by simplifying the budget structure and removing unnecessary restrictions on how the grant is spent. We have worked with the LSC to agree clear outcomes which include promoting equality by highlighting outcomes for under-represented groups in work-based learning.

<a name="20507w23.html_para0">The Government have contributed substantial financial support for Modern Apprenticeships (MAs). Between 1997 and 2002 over &#163;3.7 billion has been allocated to Government-supported work-based learning, of which it is estimated that in excess of &#163;1 billion has been used to support MAs. As a result of this investment, the number of young people on MAs has risen from 75,000 in 1997 to over 220,000 today. We are investing an additional &#163;180 million over three years 2001&#150;04 to support and further develop MAs, a clear sign of the importance we attach to their role in raising skills levels in the workplace, and in offering young people high quality vocational and work-related options for post-16 learning.

When finalised, we will consider the evidence and take appropriate action. This will include reviewing how we measure achievement in work based learning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The criteria governing entitlement to ill health retirement benefits were amended in 1997 to require that, despite appropriate treatment, applicants have a medical condition that would render them permanently incapable of undertaking any further teaching. In this context, permanent is defined as lasting at least up to the scheme's normal retirement age of 60. This replaced the previous less stringent criteria that required the presence of a medical condition that would prevent teaching only for the foreseeable future (defined as lasting at least 3&#150;4 years).
<P>

<a name="20507w24.html_para0">The Department also commissioned the Faculty of Occupational Medicine to produce occupational health guidance specifically aimed at the employers of teachers. This guidance was published in December 2000. The reduction in the number of ill health retirements since 1997 is therefore a consequence of a greater awareness among teachers' employers of the benefits of effective occupational health provision, including consideration of alternatives to ill-health retirement such as part-time working or redeployment to less demanding duties, and the more rigorous criteria governing entitlement to ill health retirement benefits.

 General practitioners have the right to remove patients from their list but in so doing they should comply with the guidance provided by the General Medical Council. Patients should be removed only as a last resort and GPs should as far as possible give reasons for the removal. Changes to the procedures for removing patients from GP lists are being renegotiated as part of the new contract for GPs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w26.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Health authorities have the power to commission local personal dental services contracts with dentists. This provides for the occasional treatment of non-registered patients and is particularly useful in making up shortfalls in urgent treatment. The Government supported this scheme with over &#163;1 million funding in 2001&#150;02 and we are currently considering ways of building on this provision during 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20507w26.html_para4">This is an especially valuable service to patients in deprived areas where registrations with dentists are particularly low. In addition, dental access centres are increasing opportunities for employment of salaried dentists in a number of socially deprived areas.

<P>

 The NHS Plan recognises that we live in a diverse society and sets out as core principles that the national health service will shape its services around the needs of the patient, be responsive to the needs of different groups and individuals within society and challenge discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality.

These services will be a pivotal building block in achieving the patient-centred services envisaged in the NHS Plan and the targets set in the national service frameworks. The development of telephone based support via NHS Direct and organisations such as language line (used in the NHS walk-in centres) offer alternatives to help with the delivery of languages needed in a co-ordinated way.

 The Department ran market-testing programmes in 1995 and 1997, which generated substantial savings.

<a name="20507w27.html_para8">Market testing was subsequently replaced by Better Quality Services (BQS) initiative in July 1998, which was introduced to ensure that all services provided by central Government are regularly reviewed and that action is taken to achieve improvements.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]:</i> We expect a climate of openness and dialogue in the national health service and a culture and environment that encourages staff to feel able to raise concerns about healthcare matters sensibly and responsibly without fear of victimisation.
<P>

<a name="20507w28.html_para2">Guidance issued in Health Service Circular (HSC) 1999/198 on 27 August 1999 reinforced the above message. The HSC stated that all NHS trusts and health authorities are expected to issue guidance to staff so that they know how to raise concerns in a reasonable and responsible way. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) gives significant statutory protection to employees who disclose information reasonably and responsibly in the public interest and are victimised as a result.
<P>

<a name="20507w28.html_para3">All employees would be protected for raising concerns with their employees under PIDA. District general nurses who may be employed either by the NHS, a local authority or the private sector can now raise concerns with the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) who is responsible for inspecting the quality of service provided in a variety of care establishments.

Alcohol advertising is governed by a voluntary code of practise which works well and there are no current plans to limit the form or content of alcohol advertising. The code of practise ensures alcohol advertising is socially responsible, and does not specifically target young people. All authorities operate complaints procedures.

 In line with the targets published in the 2000 spending review service delivery agreement, the Food Standards Agency audited 10 per cent. of local authority food law enforcement services during 2001&#150;02. Local authorities were selected for audit to represent a cross section of authority types, which included low performing local authorities. During 2001&#150;02, 40 local authorities in England, 32 local authorities in Scotland and two in Wales were audited. In Northern Ireland, all five authorities scheduled for audit this year will have been audited by May 2002.

 The vast majority of UK local authorities have submitted their final returns for 2001&#150;02 in an electronic format and others are in the process of doing so. A small number of local authorities are, due to local IT difficulties, unable to make their return electronically. The agency has agreed these local authorities can submit data clerically, and is giving advice on resolving the IT difficulties.

 The Food Standards Agency survey of fresh and frozen raw chicken on retail sale was carried out between April and June 2001. The overall salmonella contamination level was 5.8 per cent. and these preliminary findings were announced on 16 August 2001.
<P>

<a name="20507w30.html_para6">The level of salmonella contamination is markedly lower than in previous surveys of retail chicken in the UK. The findings from the 2001 survey indicate that substantial progress has been made in tackling this problem in the UK and, as a result, the agency's target of reducing salmonella contamination of UK retail chicken by 50 per cent. in five years has been met ahead of schedule.

A large number of trusts already have PALS in operation and others are actively developing their service, appointing staff and are expecting to be operational in the near future. A number of primary care trusts are in the process of being set up, and therefore will need to look at incorporating PALS as part of their establishment. At this stage, therefore, there is no full list of those trusts which do not currently have PALS. However, we are in the process of setting up a system for monitoring PALS implementation.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> As of the 1 April 2002 the National Care Standards Commission had received approximately 2,500 applications from providers and managers who were required to apply for registration by that date. It is not possible to say how many of these applications are from care homes since the commission is still assessing from which service areas the applications originated and the associated documentation sent with them. It is probable that once the commission has processed all of the applications sent to it prior to 1 April 2002 there will be significantly more than 2,500 applications.
<P>

<a name="20507w32.html_para0">All care homes are required to produce statements of purpose from 1 April. The NCSC will take copies of the statement of purpose from existing providers at the time of the first inspection this year in the spring and summer. New care homes seeking registration and those previously exempt providers required to apply before the 31 March should attach their statement of purpose with their application for registration. The NCSC has indicated that it will work with providers during the registration process to ensure that statements are drawn up appropriately by providers.
<P>

<a name="20507w32.html_para1">Providers required to apply for registration by 31 March are given protection from section 11(1) of the Care Standards Act as long as they have submitted their application forms and until a decision to grant or refuse registration is made by the commission. When registration is granted by the commission a provider is automatically deemed as complying with section 11(1). Where a

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20507w33.html_para3">A transcript of both civil and criminal trials will normally be produced where one of the parties to the action wishes to lodge an appeal. In civil cases, an unrepresented appellant in poor financial state can request that the cost of the transcript be borne at public expense. It is for the judge to decide whether to grant that request. In criminal cases, where the appellant has a representation order, the cost of the transcript will also be borne at public expense. The cost of the transcript depends on its length as transcribers charge per folio (72 words) and will therefore vary from case to case.

The only means available to extract this data would be to resort to manual scrutiny of every case dealt with since 1996 and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20507w35.html_para0">The proposals in the White Paper "Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform" set out a radical and ambitious programme of reform, with the overall aim of reducing crime and the fear of crime and tackling antisocial behaviour. The special constabulary has a key role to play in the fight against crime and the fear of crime. The Government are accordingly introducing a wide range of measures to improve the recruitment and retention of specials. These include improvements to the recruitment, training, conditions, management and deployment of specials&#151;focusing their role on intelligence-led, high visibility patrolling and local crime reduction initiatives.

<UL>(2) if he will make a statement about the accuracy of the VASCAR vehicle speed detection device.  [52444]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The VASCAR vehicle speed detection device relies in part on the operator accurately and consistently operating switches. These start and stop a clock and, where necessary, a distance measurement from the vehicle's odometer. The instrument can, alternatively, be pre-fed with the distance between two selected marker points.
<P>

<a name="20507w35.html_para1">Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) requires operators to be trained and to pass a test as to their performance. They must demonstrate in a sequence of five measurements that none has an error greater than two miles per hour and that the average error across all five is less than 0.75 miles per hour. They are also trained on the selection, for pre-fed operation, of road marks, in order to minimise parallax errors.
<P>

<a name="20507w35.html_para2">VASCAR also relies on frequent distance calibration checks. ACPO guidance requires these to be carried out at the start and, where VASCAR has been used, at the end of shifts. There are minimum distances over which measurements are made. The clock in the device is crystal controlled and its errors are insignificant.
<P>

<a name="20507w35.html_para3">Where the operator is fully trained and the ACPO guidance followed, I am satisfied that the VASCAR device is accurate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w35.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the police have discretion whether to record a reported crime; and whether a complainant may be requested to attend a police station if the crime is to be recorded.  [52335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w35.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> Under the National Crime Recording Standard, introduced in all forces in England and Wales from April 2002, all reports of incidents, whether from victims, witnesses or third parties, and whether crime-related or not, will result in the registration of an incident report by the police. Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary.
<P>

<a name="20507w35.html_para4">Police officers will determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether an incident amounts to a crime, based on their knowledge of the law and of Home Office counting rules. In most cases, a belief by the victim (or person reasonably assumed to be acting on behalf of the victim) that a crime has occurred will be sufficient to justify its recording as a crime. Once recorded, a crime would remain recorded unless there was credible evidence to disprove that a crime had occurred. A complainant could be requested to attend a police station in the normal course of police inquiries, but this would not be a pre-condition of an incident being recorded as a crime.
<P>

<a name="20507w35.html_para5">In several forces "assault clinics" have been set up in order to improve the level of service provided to victims of minor assault and/or harassment. An initial report of an incident leads to a victim being given an appointment at the clinic, where the victim's statement is taken and the crime is recorded. A review by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of the system in one force found 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 2002 : Column 135W</I><P>
that in some cases the victim did not subsequently attend the assaults clinic, leading to the incident not being recorded as a crime. The force is now changing its processes to ensure that this no longer occurs, and other forces have been advised accordingly.

<P>

<a name="20507w36.html_para2">Pursuant to section 64A of PACE samples may be retained in all cases, even following acquittal or a decision to drop a prosecution, except where the sample was taken as part of a mass screening process and the individual does not consent to the retention of the sample. Retained samples can only be used for purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution.

 Community support officers and members of community safety accreditation schemes, as contained in Chapter 1 of Part 4 of the Police Reform Bill, will not have powers of arrest. It is the Government's belief that, where appropriate, the chief officer of police should be able to give community support officers the power to detain someone for up to 30 minutes, pending the arrival of a constable, and, as a last resort, to use reasonable force to enforce this.

<P>

<a name="20507w37.html_para32">In cases of homicide, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) family liaison strategy states that FLOs should provide the pack to one or more family members at as early a stage as possible in order for bereaved people to establish some control over their access to the information. The FLO's own knowledge of the criminal justice system and coroners' processes should be used as appropriate to suggest to a family member that they may look at the pack or part of it, on their own, with another family member, with the FLO, or with Victim Support, as issues arise for them. Furthermore, the obligation of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in explaining any decisions made in accordance with its Victim's Charter should be explained and, where appropriate, a meeting facilitated.

The introduction of a managed system of induction, accommodation, reporting and removal centres will secure a seamless asylum process and maintain contact with applicants. The appeals system will be streamlined to minimise delay and cut down barriers to removal.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> The terms "racism" and "xenophobia" are not defined in the United Kingdom's domestic law. Our law deals with those who act on racism through, for example, racial discrimination or inciting racial hatred, behaviours which are defined in our legislation. Where these terms appear and are not defined, such as in Article 29 of the Treaty of European Union, in the view of United Kingdom Government the terms should be given their ordinary accepted meaning having regard to the context in which they are used. This is also the approach taken within the Home Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans his Department has to spend the two Whitehall budgets for conflict prevention, referred to by the Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State in a speech to the Royal College of Defence Studies on Thursday 25 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w39.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Spending under the Sub-Saharan Africa and Global Conflict Prevention Pools is well under way. The PSA target of the pools is improved effectiveness of the UK contribution to conflict prevention and management as demonstrated by a reduction in the number of people whose lives are affected by violent conflicts and a reduction in potential sources of future conflict, where the UK can make a significant contribution. Activities funded by the pools are tailored to meet this target.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the <i>(a)</i> size and <i>(b)</i> nature is of the two Whitehall budgets for conflict prevention, referred to by the Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State in a speech to the Royal College of Defence Studies on Thursday 25 April.  [54145]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20507w39.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Following a review of the Government's conflict prevention and resolution activities, the FCO, Ministry of Defence and Department for International Development agreed to pool relevant existing funds to allow for a more co-ordinated approach to conflict prevention and resolution activities. Two conflict prevention pools were established on 1 April 2001: Sub-Saharan Africa (Africa pool) and another for the rest of the world (global pool). The Africa pool has been allocated &#163;50 million per annum from 2001&#150;04 to spend on conflict prevention programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa. The global pool budget will be &#163;60 million for 2001&#150;02, &#163;68 million for 2002&#150;03 and &#163;78 million for 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20507w39.html_para10">In addition, the pools contribute to the additional costs of the UK assessed and non-assessed contributions to support UN and other peacekeeping and peace- enforcement operations. In 2001&#150;02 these included commitments in Sierra Leone, DRC, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and the Iraqi no fly zones.

The travel advice for Greece includes guidance on local laws and customs. Specific travel advice for the 2004 Olympic games will be prepared nearer the time. Currently the advice for Greece headed Local Laws and Customs reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Visitors should not become involved with drugs of any kind. Possession of even small quantities can lead to long terms of imprisonment.
<P>
<BR>
Driving any vehicle whilst over the legal drinking limit is heavily penalised and can result in stiff fines and/or imprisonment.
<P>
<BR>
Visitors seeking employment in bars or night clubs should be aware that they are required to have a Health certificate/licence issued by the local authorities to work in such establishments. Failure to have such a certificate is punishable by a fine and or imprisonment.
<P>
<BR>
Do not take photographs or make notes near military or official installations. Seek permission before photographing individuals.
