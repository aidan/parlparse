<i> Note:</i><br>
The Prison Service/NOMS definition of self-inflicted deaths is broader than the legal definition of suicide and includes all deaths where it appears that a prisoner has acted specifically to take their own life. This inclusive approach is used in part because inquest verdicts are often not available for some years after a death (some 20 per cent. of these deaths will not receive a suicide or open verdict at inquest). Annual numbers may change slightly from time to time as inquest verdicts and other information become available.<br>

 The Government consider that decision making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary/alternative treatments, are a matter for local national health service service providers and practitioners. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the treatment, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend.

 All cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which makes it an offence to intentionally kill or injure cetaceans. The Government strengthened the protection given to cetaceans through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which introduced a new offence of recklessly disturbing cetaceans. The first successful conviction under the Act was in December 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80307w0010.htm_para0"><a name="08030756001131">All cetaceans are also listed under Annex IVa of the Council Directive (92/43/EEC) on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (the Habitats Directive), as species in need of strict protection. This directive is transposed into UK law by the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 1994, protecting cetaceans from deliberate killing and capture.</p>

 Owners of inshore fishing vessels that target quota stocks and operate (i) off the north east coast centred around Hartlepool, (ii) off the east coast centred around Lowestoft, and (iii) in the Thames Estuary, will be invited to participate. The pilot will collect information on a range of indicators including fishing method, catches, discards, marketing and fuel consumption. This, and other information, will help inform the implementation of Fisheries 2027, a long-term vision for sustainable fisheries. DEFRA officials have spoken with a number of fishermen from the above areas who have expressed an interest in participating in the pilot and, in due course, they will be holding meetings in the three pilot areas to discuss details of the scheme. I have not offered compensation but costs of equipping participating vessels will be met by DEFRA. I will consider extending the pilot to recreational fishing following a review of the first six months of the scheme which I aim to have operational by the summer.</p>

It is difficult to determine if the vessels were pelagic fishing at the time of observation as not all vessels were inspected. The German pair team accessed the UK 12 nautical mile limit in the North sea off the Northumberland coast, the French pair teams were all operating in the English channel.

 I meet regularly with EU counterparts on a range of issues, including the EU Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), as do my Ministerial and policy colleagues. Currently the UK is working with EU partners, including the Commission, to review how the EU ETS can best deliver the necessary reductions in emissions beyond 2012. The UK view is that the review should be ambitious, delivering real emissions reductions (ie 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. as part of an international negotiation) by 2020, as agreed at the spring Council 2007, greater harmonisation and long-term certainty, and maximise its potential to stimulate investment in low-carbon technology. The Commission&#146;s proposal for a revised EU ETS from 2013 was discussed by EU Environment Ministers at the Environment Council on 3 March and will also be discussed by EU leaders at the spring European Council on 13-14 March.</p>

The EU ETS and other mandatory emissions trading schemes being developed around the world are crucial stepping stones towards this. It is a major pillar of both UK and EU climate change policy and is the primary market based mechanism in the fight against climate change. It is fundamental to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by keeping emissions within agreed limits while allowing emission reductions to be made at least cost through trading of allowances.</p>

These arrangements, which saw the introduction of red and green customs channels in both directions, came into force in December 2006 and have considerably improved border fluidity.

They are currently talking to all of these groups both in and outside of Darfur to encourage them to unify further and agree on common platforms for negotiations with the Government of Sudan. The UN/AU will be hosting a meeting of international partners in Geneva on 18 March to set out the current status of the peace process and how to move it forward including in relation to the level of rebel engagement.

<i> [holding answer 10 January 2008]:</i> Nearly 60 per cent. of students are women. The proportion of students studying for equivalent or lower level qualifications who are women is the same. But our policy of redistributing grant will widen participation and mean that more of the ten million women of working age who do not have a first higher-level qualification, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be able to benefit from participating in higher education. I have had no discussions with the Minister for Women specifically on this issue which does not discriminate against women, but offers more opportunities for both men and women without a first higher education qualification.</p>

Despite doubts about the viability of growth and individual courses when we introduced our policies in 1997, there has already been an increase in the number of students in the system of over 300,000 and we remain confident that any sceptics will once again be proved wrong.

 None. We are redistributing funding not saving it. The large majority of students already study these subjects as a first HE qualification and as a result of our policy of redistributing &#163;100 million by 2010 away from supporting ELQ students, there will be even more opportunities for students to study these subjects either as a first higher education qualification or a higher education qualification to one they already hold.</p>

 Such a student would only attract institutional funding if the level of that accountancy qualification was higher than a higher national diploma.

 None because the request to HEFCE was itself a request to consult on the details of the decision we had already taken from first principles and advise us on the way these issues might best be tackled in a way that gets the balance right between regulation and not having an overly bureaucratic system. In all cases, HEFCE will work with institutions to audit fundable student numbers and final HEFCE funding will be determined oh the basis of audited returns and through a robust audit process.</p>
