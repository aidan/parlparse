To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the cyclically-adjusted surplus on current budget is as a percentage of GDP for each year from 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03.  [110229]<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the total cost to the Exchequer of cancellation of the debts of the countries which have met the requirements for the qualification stage of the HIPC debt relief process.  [109780]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w01.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 As at 31 March 2003, the amount of debt agreed multilaterally under the HIPC initiative as being unrecoverable and consequently written off by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, amounted to some &#163;859.5 million. These debts resulted from insurance and guarantee claims paid out mainly in the 1980s. Additional relief given in accordance with the Government's 100 per cent. forgiveness policy for HIPCs totals &#163;41.8 million. All aid debts to low-income countries had already been written off.
<P>

<a name="30429w01.html_para2">In addition the UK has so far pledged US $495 million to the HIPC Trust Fund to cover the costs of multilateral HIPC debt relief, and we hold all debt payments in trust for the day they can be returned to fund poverty reduction for all countries still to secure debt relief through HIPC because the absence of a poverty reduction programme.
<P>

<a name="30429w01.html_para3">The Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the timescale is for the review by the Environment Agency of the regulations governing emissions from power stations; and from when the new regulations are likely to apply.  [107982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Emissions from large power stations to air, water and land are currently regulated by the Environment Agency through the Integrated Pollution Control ("IPC") regime established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and Regulations made under the Act. The Environment Agency is not responsible for reviewing that legislation. The Environment Agency does regularly carry out reviews of the authorisations it has issued under that legislation. The next principal review is due in 2003&#150;04 and any new conditions or requirements in relation to emissions that the Agency seeks to impose on power stations following that review would probably be implemented from 2004&#150;05.

Crown Prosecution Service case records are held by category of offence, rather than by a specific offence. It is not possible from the records to show separately in how many of these cases a prosecution proceeded or the result of the case. This information could be recovered only by examining individual case files which are in storage, and the cost of such an exercise would be prohibitive.<P>

Exceptions to the universal service daily delivery can only be allowed in very specific and restricted circumstances (the relevant policy document is available at http://www.psc.gov.uk/documents/licensing).

<a name="30429w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tynan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answers of 22 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 328W, on marine pollution, and 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1170W, on naval hulls, why a compliance date of 2010 has been adopted by his Department; what planning has been carried out to meet that deadline; when he intends to invite tenders for new vessels; and how many vessels he intends to procure.  [103699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and the Protocol of 1978) provides for the phased introduction of Double-hulled tankers. Whilst the convention does not apply to vessels owned or operated by a state and used only on Government non-commercial service, as is the case for the fleet of Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Oilers, it continues to be Ministry of Defence policy that, where practicable, we comply with Shipping Acts and associated Regulations. 2010 was selected as the target date for the earliest practicable Ministry of Defence compliance based on the Department's current plans for the progressive withdrawal of non-compliant, single-hulled vessels over the rest of this decade and their replacement with compliant equivalents. The first such compliant vessels, the Auxiliary Oilers RFA Wave Knight and RFA Wave Ruler, are due to enter service this spring.
<P>

<a name="30429w05.html_para0">So far as future procurement is concerned, the Ministry of Defence established the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) project in July 2002 to consider, among other things, the Royal Navy's future requirement for oil resupply. The capability provided by this will be fully compliant with any environmental legislation in force at the time of entry into service but it is premature to decide exactly how this requirement will be met or when industry will be invited to bid.

DFID has been a significant contributor, providing &#163;51 million to help Zimbabwe since the humanitarian crisis began in mid 2001 The prospects for Zimbabwe in 2003 remain dismal. Food security continues to be affected by chaos in the agricultural sector, economic disincentives to production, unemployment at 70 per cent., and 228 per cent. inflation eroding purchasing power.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. Energy Consumption: this is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20-year average for 1990&#150;91. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign. Figures include the FCO's only Agency, Wilton Park Conference Centre, for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 only.<P>

2. Energy Expenditure: this is actual spend, and from April 2001, includes the Climate Change Levy. Costs are inclusive of VAT from 1999&#150;00.<P>

3. Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.<P>

4. Savings over 1997&#150;98: These have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.<P>

5. Energy efficiency spend: Note that this is not necessarily a good measure of an effective energy efficiency policy. For example, when a new building is commissioned or an existing one refurbished, good design can actually reduce capital costs, e.g. by avoiding air conditioning. The &#163;801,000 recorded by the FCO in 2000&#150;01 is the capital sum invested in energy efficiency measures incorporated into the refurbishment of the Old Admiralty Building.<P>

<P>

<a name="30429w07.html_para1">The Energy White Paper, "Our Energy Future&#151;Creating a Low Carbon Economy" made clear the importance the Government attaches to improving energy efficiency in its own estate. This is reflected in several targets. There is currently an interim target of a 1 per cent. per annum ongoing reduction in weather-corrected carbon emissions, pending the development of new indicators and targets based on benchmarking the performance of each Department's largest buildings. These new targets are planned to be in place later this year. New targets for Government Departments' use of CHP generated electricity will also be established during 2003.
<P>

<a name="30429w07.html_para2">In addition, the review of Government procurement has identified areas where procurement could reinforce the achievement of these targets, and arrangements are being made centrally for Departments to purchase goods with high energy efficiency standards and which provide good value for money.

<P>

<a name="30429w07.html_para3">On the purchase of renewable electricity, Ministers agreed the following target in May 2001: "All departments will ensure that by 31 March 2003, at least 5 per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources that are exempt from the Climate Change Levy or from self generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. The FCO achieved this target. The target will rise to at least 10 per cent. supply from such sources by 31 March 2008, but will be reviewed after 31 March 2003 to take account of market conditions following the introduction of the renewables obligation. The review of 2003 will include consideration of increasing or bringing forward the target".

The Commission made its decision public on 13 April 2002. We have called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to implement fully the Algiers Peace Agreements and to accept the Boundary Commission's decisions as final and binding. We have done this through successive UN Security Council resolutions, EU demarches and in our bilateral contacts with both countries.

 The latest humanitarian estimate is that over 7 million Zimbabweans are currently dependent on food aid. We have provided &#163;51 million in humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe since September 2001. We, through the UN and non-governmental organisations, are providing supplementary food to more than 1.5 million Zimbabweans a day, mainly children, pregnant mothers, unemployed farm workers and the elderly. Prospects for the coming year are under assessment.
<P>

<a name="30429w08.html_para10">The human rights situation continues to deteriorate. A successful "stayaway" from work on 18 and 19 March was followed by a wave of violence, largely against the opposition party and its supporters. There were over 500 arrests, 250 people hospitalised, and one death. Scores of people were beaten and tortured while in police custody. Both the Vice-President of the MDC and the party's parliamentary speaker were arrested. The EU has condemned the violence and sponsored a resolution on Zimbabwe at the UN Commission on Human Rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what provision there is for young people leaving Moderate Learning Difficulty schools in Northern Ireland; what research on this subject has been carried out or is planned; and when it is intended to publish such research.  [108877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w09.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Special education legislation imposes duties on Education and Library Boards (ELBs) in the planning for a young person's transition to adult life. The Department of Education's Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs provides further advice on the process. ELBs are required to inform Health and Social Services (HSS) trusts up to a year in advance of a young person, with a Statement of Special Educational Needs, leaving school.
<P>

<a name="30429w09.html_para4">The first and subsequent annual reviews of a Statement of Special Educational Needs after a young person's 14th birthday should involve the agencies that will play a major role during the post school years, including the relevant HSS Trust and the Department for Employment and Learning's Careers Service, so that all options for further education, training and employment are given serious consideration. Following the meeting the ELB will prepare a transition plan, in order to plan coherently for the young person's transition to adult life. The plan is circulated to the parents, the principal and all other relevant partners.
<P>

<a name="30429w09.html_para5">A research project entitled "Provision for Pupils with Moderate Learning Difficulties", funded by the five ELBs is being undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). It is currently in its third year and it is hoped to publish its findings by early 2004. The main focus of this research is the current provision for MLD pupils, but the researchers will also endeavour to track the pupils' first destinations on leaving school.

Moreover, all four Health and Social Services Boards have identified the development of day care services as a priority area, but funding has been a limiting factor.
<P>

<a name="30429w09.html_para7">The Department for Employment and Learning's (DEL) Disablement Advisory Service, in conjunction with the Careers Service, provides such young people with help to assist them access appropriate employment and learning after school. There is a range of programmes including "Access to Work", "Employment Support", "Job Introduction Scheme" and "New Deal for Disabled People". Special Needs Careers Officers provide careers information and guidance services both at school and when the young person has left school to ensure that appropriate choices have been made and that the young person has settled into his/her next destination. The officers continue to provide support to those young people who have not secured a placement in education, training or employment on leaving school.
<P>

<a name="30429w09.html_para8">Should it be considered appropriate, provision is also available through Jobskills and the statutory Further Education sector. Although Jobskills is aimed mainly at 16 and 17-year-old school leavers, young people with disabilities can enter the programme up to their 22nd birthday. DEL has put in place a range of initiatives and financial support mechanisms, in further education, which promote access for young people with MLD, including specific support for individuals.

<a name="30429w12.html_para5">Among other initiatives, the following steps have been taken in recent years to improve access to NHS dentistry in England:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;10 million was made available between 1997 and 1999 under the Investing in Dentistry scheme to allow dentists to increase their NHS commitment or start new practices in areas of poor access.
<P>
<BR>
A Dental Care Development Fund of &#163;4 million was made available in 2000&#150;01, along with &#163;6 million Dental Action Plan money in 2001&#150;02, to allow practices to grow and treat more patients.
<P>
<BR>
49 dental access centres have been established since 1998, treating unregistered patients in areas of poor access.
<P>
<BR>
The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes that each primary care trust be given a duty to provide or secure primary dental services to the extent it considers reasonable to do so. This would mean that access issues could be addressed at the local level.

 The only body which undertakes a full inspection of national health service hospitals is the Commission for Health Improvement, which undertakes a rolling programme of clinical governance reviews. On average, each trust might be inspected once every four years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> general practitioners and <i>(b)</i> other NHS staff, broken down by category, in the area served by South Wiltshire Primary Care Trust have been called up for military service in the Iraq conflict; what arrangements have been made (i) to cover their absence and (ii) to fund replacement staff; and if he will make a statement.  [110085]<P>

<P>
<a name="30429w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Avon Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Strategic Health Authority that one general practitioner and two national health service staff, one consultant surgeon and one nurse, working in the area served by South Wiltshire Primary Care Trust (PCT), have been called out for military service in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30429w13.html_para1">To cover the GP's absence, South Wiltshire PCT has asked part-time general practitioners to work extra hours. The PCT is not required to pay the called out GP during his period of service, as this is covered by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), which means the PCT has been able to redirect this money to the part-time GPs for the extra hours they are working. The PCT should also be able to recover any other costs associated with setting up this arrangement, for example, advertising, etc. from the MOD.
<P>

<a name="30429w13.html_para2">For the consultant surgeon and nurse, their employer, the Salisbury Healthcare NHS Trust, has contracted an associate specialist on a locum basis and utilised bank nurses. Similarly, the trust is not required to pay the salaries of the surgeon and the nurse during their period of service as these are covered by the MOD and has therefore been able to redirect these funds to pay the associate specialist and bank nurses for the cover they are providing. The trust should also be able to recover any other costs associated with setting up this arrangement from the MOD.
<P>

<a name="30429w13.html_para3">The Department of Health has been working closely with the NHS and the MOD to ensure the impact on health care delivery as a result of call outs of NHS staff with military commitments for service in Iraq has been kept to a minimum.

<P>

<a name="30429w13.html_para5">The option of referring patients abroad is open to all NHS commissioners and so the number of patients treated abroad will be dependent on the take-up of the scheme by NHS trusts. Overseas treatment will be offered nationally to patients within the choice strategy framework from the end of 2005 as one of several options if alternatives are not available in this country.

 While the number of doctors on an individual rota will generally have to increase, the intention of the Department's guidance&#151;HSC 2003/001 "Protecting Staff, Delivering Services&#151;Implementing the European Working Time Directive for Doctors in Training"&#151;is that trusts should find ways to reduce the number of resident rotas. Thus, the total staffing requirement does not increase substantially as a result of the Working Time Directive.

 The White paper "Respect and Responsibility&#151;Taking a Stand Against Anti-social Behaviour" encourages the development of an increased range of specialised, intensive support schemes to help parents and children. These schemes aim to support families where a lack of parental capacity or ability contributes significantly to the child's behavioural problems.

<a name="30429w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Office contributes to various diversionary schemes for young people. The results have been encouraging and evidence from them suggests strong arguments for the potentially positive contribution that diversionary activities can make in helping and preventing young people who are involved, or are at risk of becoming involved in crime and Anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30429w14.html_para8">Positive Activities for Young People fund is to be launched in May 2003. This pulls together under one initiative, a range of funding to provide year round activities for young people. &#163;25 million is available for 2003, which comprises contributions from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) (New Opportunities Fund), the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) (Connexions) and Home Office (Community Cohesion and Splash), and will be distributed by the Government Offices.

In the 2002 Comprehensive Spending Review, the Positive Futures programme received an additional &#163;15 million over the next three years.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30429w14.html_para10">Levels of preparedness in the event of a civil emergency are primarily determined through testing and exercising. Government Departments, the emergency services and local authorities have all exercised their contingency plans for many years. Earlier this year a cross-governmental working party was established to provide a formal mechanism for reviewing Departmental exercise plans covering a comprehensive range of domestic challenges and counter terrorist areas of activity. The aim of this group is to create a prioritised programme of exercises that will reflect and test effectively the range of lead Government Department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, regional and local authorities and interdependent communities of interest. Local authorities are encouraged to prepare flexible plans for responding to a wide variety of peacetime hazards, and these plans are also regularly tested, reviewed and updated as circumstances change.
<P>

<a name="30429w14.html_para11">Exercises at local, regional and national levels involve a wide range of participants including the emergency services, and local authorities and the NHS.

<a name="30429w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="30429w15.html_para1">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Hemsworth. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="30429w15.html_para2">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that while only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, while users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three fifths of all the illegal income reported.
<P>

<a name="30429w15.html_para3">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour.

 Substances known as benzodiazepines have been controlled as Class C drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 since 1 April 1986. They have legitimate uses as medicines and are regulated under Schedule 4 Part 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, with the exception of temazepam and flunitrazepam which are regulated under Schedule 3. On 1 February 2002, the benzodiazepines under Schedule 4 Part 1 were made subject to full import, export and possession controls (temazepam and flunitrazepam were already subject to such controls).

<a name="30429w17.html_para5">In addition to the annual British Crime Survey, the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate commissions other research relevant to the study of street violence.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para6">So far in 2003 the Home Office has published two relevant studies, although neither focus exclusively on women. Home Office Research Study 254 looks at the nature of personal robbery and examined over 2,000 robbery reports in seven police forces areas. Women made up 24 per cent. of robbery victims and six per cent. of offenders. Of those who were victims of robberies, women were more likely than men to be victims of 'snatch robberies': Seven out of 10 robberies where the victim was a women involved property being snatched or grabbed from their person.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para7">Secondly, Home Office Research Study 265 is an evaluation of the TASC project which aimed to reduce alcohol-related violence and disorder, much of which takes place on the streets. This found that 17 per cent. of victims of violence and 12 per cent. of those arrested were women. The report identifies a number of examples of good practice in tackling this form of crime and disorder.

<P>
<a name="30429w17.html_wqn4"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to paragraph 3.119 of Budget 2003, HC500, how the Government will work closely with regional and local partners to deliver infrastructure, economic development and regeneration in growth areas; and what steps they will take to strengthen local delivery mechanisms to achieve these policy arms.  [110172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Sustainable Communities Plan, published by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 5 February 2003, sets out some of the ways in which Government will work with regional and local partners to realise the potential of the growth areas.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para10">The regional planning bodies and local authorities have started work on translating the development proposals for the growth areas into revisions of regional planning guidance so that they set out agreed levels of housing provision and how growth can be delivered. These proposals will be the subject of consultation and testing through examination in public.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para11">New regional steering and delivery groups have been established to bring local and regional partners together to co-ordinate programmes. These include the Regional Development Agencies, English Partnerships and other public sector agencies.

<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para12">Additional local delivery mechanisms will also be required to co-ordinate, focus and drive forward major new developments, maximising private sector investment. Consultation is taking place with local authorities and other partners to consider the best approach for each locality to promote development. Any new arrangements will need to be fit for purpose and will operate with the full involvement of the local partners. Various mechanisms are available as no single approach will be suitable in all circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para13">Over the next three years &#163;446 million will be made available for the Thames Gateway and &#163;164 million for the other growth areas. These resources include an element for setting up and running the local delivery vehicles, as well as site assembly and remediation of brownfield land, and essential local infrastructure. The Planning Delivery Grant will also offer extra resources in the growth areas to help local planning authorities better manage and progress the development process.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para14">These resources cannot pay for all the infrastructure needed to facilitate growth&#151;for example, major transport projects, education and health and private investment.
<P>

<a name="30429w17.html_para15">Government Departments are working together on the needs of the growth areas and with the private sector to look at sources of funding. Alongside other priorities, the Department for Transport is considering the longer-term transport infrastructure needs of the growth areas as part of its review of the 10-Year Transport Plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn1"><B> Jon Trickett: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the impact of the proposals contained in the draft Housing Bill on domestic gas safety.  [109984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The provisions in Parts 2 and 3 of the draft Housing Bill will enable local housing authorities to impose conditions for the proper management of houses and flats that are subject to licensing. This will raise health and safety standards in part because a licence condition may include a requirement to carry out 



<P>
<P><I>29 Apr 2003 : Column 366W</I><P>
gas safety checks. Such a condition will reinforce the current statutory requirement that a landlord carries out an annual inspection of gas appliances and fittings in any property that he lets, under The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998.
<P>

<a name="30429w18.html_para0">Under Part 5 of the Bill, anyone marketing a home will be required to produce a Home Information Pack, including a Home Condition Report. That report will include an informed opinion on the condition of services, including gas, based on a visual inspection. This should go a long way towards ensuring that potential hazards or safety issues are drawn to the attention of both the seller and any prospective buyer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn2"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to paragraph 3.125 of Budget 2003, HC500, what incentive he will give to local authorities to encourage them to allow land allocated for industrial or commercial use in their development plans; and how greater help to planning authorities in negotiating planning obligations will be given.  [110173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Some local planning authorities have allocations of land for employment and other uses which cannot realistically be taken up in the quantities envisaged over the lifetime of their development plan. The Government regard this as a wasted resource, especially in areas of high demand for housing. Local planning authorities should review all their non-housing allocations, and unless a convincing case for retention can be made, look favourably on housing or mixed use proposals on suitable sites. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister proposes to support this policy on appeal, and intends to issue updated guidance on planning obligations shortly.

<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the additional transitional funding for LASHG announced by his Department on 5 March 2003 is in addition to the &#163;97million of Approved Development Programme announced in the Communities Plan on 5 February 2003.  [109658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced an additional &#163;111 million of LASHG transitional funding, to safeguard schemes that could have gone ahead in 2003&#150;04. This is in addition to the &#163;175 million announced in the Communities Plan. The additional resources will be found from within current departmental provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn5"><B> Jon Trickett: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the number of private landlords in <i>(a)</i> Hemsworth, <i>(b)</i> Yorkshire and <i>(c)</i> England.  [109918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn6"><B> Jon Trickett: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate his Department has made of the likely uptake by local authorities of the power to selectively license private landlords.  [109986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The draft Housing Bill sets out a discretionary selective licensing power for local authorities, and the extent of take-up would therefore depend on decisions by individual local authorities in due course. Responses to the 2001 consultation on selective licensing indicated that 50 local authorities in England were in favour. For the purposes of the Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the draft Bill, we made the assumption that selective licensing would be taken up by a majority of local authorities in areas of low housing demand, and that 75 per cent. of low demand dwellings would be likely to be required to obtain a licence.

<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has received about the Regulatory Reform (Assured Periodic Tenancies) (Rent Increases) Order.  [109969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Officials at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have answered a number of questions, mainly from registered social landlords, about the use and completion of new prescribed forms of rent increase notice applying the new rule on the timing of rent increases in the Regulatory Reform (Assured Periodic Tenancies) (Rent Increases) Order 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he plans to amend planning policy guidance so that the five kilometre distance recommended between offshore wind turbines and people's homes is applied to onshore turbines also.  [109827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The annex on Wind Energy in Policy Planning Guidance Note 22 (PPG22) already contains guidelines about various factors which should be taken into consideration in relation to wind turbine location, including suggestions about turbine separation distances from residential dwellings, specifically in relation to noise. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends to consult on a revision to the planningguidance later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the method used by his Department to assess the likely noise impact on local residents of a planned onshore wind turbine.  [109835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Paragraphs 39&#150;47 within the annex on Wind Energy in Policy Planning Guidance Note 22 contain guidelines about noise levels in relation to wind turbines. The guidelines include a table comparing the noise in decibels generated by a windfarm at 350 metres to that generated by other everyday activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps the Department is taking to address the issue of age discrimination.  [109446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30429w19.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 My Department is committed to creating an inclusive employment environment that will attract and retain staff of all ages. Following the recommendations in the Performance and Innovation Unit Report, "Winning the Generation Game" in 2000, my Department has integrated age into its equal opportunities policies.
<P>

<a name="30429w19.html_para0">A wide range of flexible work options to support changing lifestyle needs is available to all staff and the feasibility of extending the current retirement age is being explored. The issues facing older people in the work place were addressed on the mandatory Diversity Awareness Training programme for all staff in 2002, and age thresholds have been removed from the job selection process to ensure that all staff are promoted on merit.
<P>

<a name="30429w19.html_para1">My Department began to gather information on staff by age in 2002 and publishes figures annually as part of its Equality and Diversity Annual Report. 29.7 per cent. of staff in my Department are currently over the age of 50 and 18.8 per cent. of staff are under 29.
