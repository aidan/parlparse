To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers have been directed to Leeds, broken down by each Leeds constituency.  [75001]<P>
<P>
<P>

 As at the end of June 2002 the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) was supporting 1,485* asylum seekers (including dependants) in accommodation in Leeds.
<P>

<a name="21024w01.html_para0">Some asylum seekers supported by NASS find their own accommodation and receive subsistence only support from NASS. As at the end of June 2002 there were 570* asylum seekers (including dependants) in receipt of subsistence only support in the Yorkshire and Humberside region (which includes Leeds).
<P>

<a name="21024w01.html_para1">Figures are not currently available by constituency for those asylum seekers supported by the NASS.

<a name="21024w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the Government's policy is on the detention of pregnant women seeking asylum; and how many pregnant women are detained while their asylum applications are considered.  [76280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w01.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Pregnant women are not normally considered suitable for detention under the Immigration Acts unless there is a clear prospect of early removal from the United Kingdom and medical advice suggests no question of confinement prior to this. In addition, women in the early stages of pregnancy may be detained briefly at Oakington Reception Centre as part of the fast-track asylum process. Statistics for the number of pregnant women detained under Immigration act powers are not available.

This represents 29 per cent. of the total number of orders made. In Kent 196 orders have been made over the same period, of which 64 have been revoked for failure to comply; this represents 32 per cent. of total orders made in the area.

 The White Paper ''Secure Borders Safe Haven'', published earlier this year, set out a comprehensive approach for supporting the victims of trafficking. We will make arrangements for their protection and support by providing access to safe accommodation and services such as medical care, legal advice, and counselling. We are working with the voluntary sector to set up these arrangements and hope to set up a pilot scheme next year, which will initially run on a trial basis for a period of six months so that we can evaluate its impact.
<P>

<a name="21024w02.html_para1">The Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are running a number of prevention projects aimed primarily at raising awareness and educating potential victims (mostly women and children) of the dangers of being trafficked. We have given #3 million for the International Labour Organisation's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) programme in the Greater Mekong region (parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam). This involves a number of inter-linked interventions to raise awareness, prevent trafficking and to support community reintegration for victims of trafficking. The United Kingdom is also contributing to the European Union STOP Programme, which provides support to Member State organisations responsible for action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w02.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Privy Council has made an Order in Council, the Consular Fees (No. 2) Order 2002, which gives authority for a revision in passport fees. The revision will take effect on 21 November 2002. The fee for a standard 32 page passport will increase from #30 to #33 while the fee for a 48 page passport will remain at #40. The fee for amending an existing passport will increase from #18 to #22.50. The cost of a passport for a child will increase from #16 to #19. The additional charges for those making use of the guaranteed fast track and premium services available from the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) counters remain unchanged at #30 and #45 respectively. The fee for a collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups, will decrease from #42 to #39. The Order also increases fees for passport applications made overseas to British consular posts. These will be an increase from #49 to #54.40 for a standard 32 page passport, an increase from #60 to #65.20 for a 48 page passport, an increase from #29 to #34.70 for a child passport and an increase from #30 to #33.90 for an emergency passport.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2002 : Column 419W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21024w02.html_para13">Passport fees are set at the level needed to cover the costs of passport issuing, including&#151;in this case&#151;the recovery of certain deficits accrued before 1999, and the costs of providing overseas consular protection services which are not covered by other fees. The changes set out in the Order follow a careful review of costs to ensure that the fee for each type of passport service closely reflects the production costs and past deficits accrued by that service and bears its share of the cost of consular protection services. In relation to the cost of travel abroad, the new fees still represent very good value for money.

 Petro-chemical plants in the United Kingdom are designed to process crude oil for the production of fuels, lubricants and other hydrocarbon chemicals. Although such facilities, given access to the appropriate raw materials, could potentially be used for the production of chemical weapons or their precursors, in the UK their only dual civil/military use is for the production of fuels, lubricants etc. which are required for normal military as well as civil purposes.

 The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and the Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances in electrical equipment (ROHS) Directive completed the conciliation process on 11 October. Following legal checking and translation the final texts should be presented to the European Parliament and Council for approval around the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="21024w03.html_para4">The scope of these Directives is very wide. To fall within the scope electrical and electronic equipment must rely on either an AC current of up to 1000 volts or a DC current of up to 1500 volts to operate correctly. It must also fall within one of the ten broad categories the WEEE Directive outlines. These categories apply to equipment intended for use by the consumer or for professional use. On this basis it is likely that at least some industrial kitchen equipment will fall within the scope of the Directives. Detailed guidance on scope can start to be developed once the final text is available and we have consulted business further. The Department will also monitor closely developments in other member States to help ensure a consistent application of the Directives.

<P>

<a name="21024w03.html_para7">The UK is strongly encouraging the Commission in its work to develop better ways to track and assess the impact of the Framework programmes. However, successful commercial applications often depend on bringing together a number of technological innovations from different sources (which might include, among other sources, elements drawn from the wide range of outputs from successive Framework Programmes) with the aim of meeting a particular user need. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to compile a restrictive, ranked list of commercial successes.
<P>

<a name="21024w03.html_para8">Nevertheless, it is possible to give some general examples where Framework programmes have contributed significantly to subsequent successful commercial applications: for example, underpinning development of GSM telephony (mobile phones), production of new generations of microchips, competitiveness of European Aerospace industry, improved energy technologies, and a much-improved understanding of life sciences and global climate change.

Since the Cabinet Secretary's Review of Export Promotion in 1999 and the subsequent establishment of British Trade International, the focus of Government support for trade has shifted from promoting overseas markets to British business to developmental work in order to improve the ability of companies to export and trade overseas successfully. There is also a greater emphasis on identifying and exploiting specific sectoral opportunities within overseas markets where they correspond to sectoral strengths in the British economy.<P>

The entry criteria are laid down by the appropriate Single Service.

During the phase we spent some #127 million in resource terms, with the competing Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) prime contractors (Lockheed Martin and Boeing). In addition approximately #8 million was spent during Financial Year 2001&#150;2002 as part of the current System Development and Demonstration phase, which began in November 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what factors are taken into consideration in the assessment of the requirement of the numbers of Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.  [76368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w05.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Our current planning assumption is that up to 150 Joint Strike Fighters (JSF) will be required to meet our through life Future Joint Combat Aircraft requirement. However, no final decision on numbers has yet been taken and detailed work is currently ongoing.
<P>

<a name="21024w05.html_para9">The decision will take into account a wide variety of factors including: the number of pilots required to man the aircraft on operations; the number of peace time flying hours required to train and maintain those pilots at combat ready status; expected rates of attrition; and the expected airframe life of JSF.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Royal Navy ships have been recalled from sea so that crew members can be trained in firefighting duties in the last 12 months.  [76357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No Royal Navy ships have had to be recalled from sea so that crew members can be trained in firefighting duties. However, the planned activities of the Fleet's ships have inevitably had to be re-prioritised due to the need to train and deploy personnel in anticipation of the Fire Brigades Union strike.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many personnel from each service have been trained in firefighting duties in each of the past six months;  [76356]
<P>
<UL>(2) which Fire Service roles service personnel will take on should they be required to cover firemen's duties in the event of a national firemen's strike;  [76374]

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Armed Forces personnel will provide emergency fire and rescue cover during the fire brigades dispute. Whilst this cover cannot replace in full the service provided by professional firefighters, it will be designed to ensure that the loss of life which may be occasioned by the dispute is minimised, drawing on the proven effectiveness and dedication of the Armed Forces in serving the public. Cover will be provided by 827 Green Goddess crews, 331 Specialist Breathing Apparatus Rescue Teams, and 59 Rescue Equipment Support Teams.
<P>

<a name="21024w06.html_para0">About 3,000 RN personnel, 7,700 Army personnel and 2,300 RAF personnel have been trained to provide this front line emergency cover. The training lasts up to five weeks, depending on the skill and role of the individual. Information on the monthly breakdown of these figures is not readily available and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21024w06.html_para1">The specialist teams will have all the skills required to use breathing apparatus necessary for fire rescue and the use of cutting equipment required to free people from damaged buildings and vehicles. Green Goddess crews are being trained to control fires from outside the building. Other training includes specialist driver training, first aid training and specialist equipment maintenance training.
<P>

<a name="21024w06.html_para2">A further 6,500 personnel from all three services will be engaged in administrative, security, command and control and other duties drawing on normal Armed Forces skills and training. A total of more than 19,000 Armed Forces personnel will therefore be engaged in providing emergency cover during a strike.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The expected reduction in fire cover at RAF stations will result in some loss of flying hours. A prolonged strike will also have some impact on engineering support, which will adversely affect aircraft serviceability and also lead to some loss of flying hours.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service men have had their post-operational tour leave cancelled as a consequence of preparing to train for firefighting duties.  [76668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In order to train for emergency firefighting duties, nearly a thousand personnel who have recently returned from the Balkans have had some or all of their post-operational tour leave delayed. It is intended that all post-operational tour leave will be taken as soon as these troops can be released. In the meantime, some leave is being taken as opportunities arise, within the constraints of preparations for firefighting duties, and the Ministry of Defence is actively pursuing options in order to reduce the impact to a minimum. Depending upon the duration of strike action, further personnel may also be affected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what provision will be made, and in what locations, for emergency fire services in rural Dorset in the event of a strike by firemen.  [76862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Emergency cover in Dorset, as in the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddess crews, breathing apparatus teams, rescue teams (equipped with specialist equipment) and the police. The provision of Ministry of Defence emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer and local police to minimise call-out response times and maximise the availability of the range of firefighting capabilities.
<P>

<a name="21024w06.html_para4">Three temporary fire stations will be located in Dorset itself, at Weymouth, Poole and Bournemouth. The operational control centre, based at Winfrith, will be responsible for co-ordinating emergency response in the

<P>

<a name="21024w06.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence's emergency cover will not replicate the fire fighting capabilities of the Fire Service, but will minimise as far as possible the danger to human life. Service personnel will provide basic fire and rescue cover.

 These capabilities&#151;the Land Commander's Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) requirements&#151;will be met principally by a combination of the WATCHKEEPER Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and manned ground reconnaissance. We expect the latter to be provided by the ISTAR variant of the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES).

 The contractual in-service date for the Nimrod MRA4 is March 2005, though risk analysis suggests the date will be later in 2005. BAE SYSTEMS have recently acknowledged a delay in the programme for the first flight of Nimrod MRA4. The consequences of first flight slippage on ISD and potential mitigation action are being urgently examined by the Ministry of Defence and the Company. The results of this work will be available at the end of the year. It would therefore be premature to speculate on the impact of this slippage on the in-service date for the MRA4.

It has not always been possible to maintain ideal career structures in all parts of the Services through the rapid changes which took place in the last decade, and past failures to achieve recruiting and retention targets can create imbalances that last a generation. Occasionally the Services have to resort to targeted retention incentives in order to sustain operational capability, and length of service can be a factor in the targeting process.

(4) whether the cost effectiveness has been assessed of transferring the duties of the Joint Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Church Fenton to the university air squadrons.  [76578]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w07.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No additional instructors will be required when the tasks are transferred from RAF Church Fenton as the Qualified Flying Instructors at the University Air Squadrons will absorb the task.
<P>

<a name="21024w07.html_para5">The total number of qualified flying instructors at the University Air Squadrons is 69. However, the additional duties of the Squadron Commanders and Chief Flying Instructors reduce the available flying training time to the equivalent of 50. There are currently no ground instructors at the University Air Squadrons.
<P>

<a name="21024w07.html_para6">No staff at RAF Church Fenton will be subject to Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) legislation. It is expected that their task will be absorbed into the existing arrangements for the University Air Squadrons. This means the task will be done in a different manner and location rather than simply transferring to another contractor.
<P>

<a name="21024w07.html_para7">Contract negotiations are still underway. The actual savings will not be known until they are complete, but significant annual savings are anticipated.

Anyone who would otherwise be eligible under the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme but who joined the Indian National Liberation Army had removed themselves from that captivity which the Ex Gratia Payment Scheme recognises. Their inclusion in the scheme would not be compatible with its purpose and therefore those Prisoners of War who joined the Indian National Liberation Army are not entitled to any payment under the Scheme.

 I have no plans to meet with representatives of teachers unions&#151;nor am I aware of any request by them to meet me. Responsibility for local road safety schemes rests with local highway authorities. It is for them to decide their investment priorities consulting local people as necessary. However, we advise local authorities to pay attention to child casualties, assessing roads around schools and the routes children use to get to school. This should be a component of the child road safety audits we expect local authorities to undertake, and will indicate where investment is required. Furthermore, their school travel plans should include measures necessary to ensure that there are safe routes to school for children.

 I understand that no more than 168 higher education students are eligible to transfer to another higher education institution as a result of the A level regrading following Mike Tomlinson's enquiry. Where a student transfers to another institution in the current academic year, they will pay no more in total than their assessed contribution to the personal tuition fee, which depends on their income and that of their parents. Guidance from Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals advises the institution they are leaving to refund the unused portion of any tuition fee which has been paid and the receiving institution cannot levy a higher tuition fee than the balance of the student's personal contribution.
<P>

<a name="21024w13.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We are determined to build on the progress that has been achieved by the sector in recent years to raise standards. In June we published our proposals for a reform of further education&#151;''Success for All''. This comprises a comprehensive strategy, which has received the overwhelming support of key partners, for radical improvements. It will improve the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning and develop the teachers and leaders of the future. We plan to make further announcements shortly.

 This year, 2002&#150;03, #4.4 billion has been allocated to further education, an increase of #1.2 billion (24 per cent. in real terms) compared with 1997&#150;98. The Spending Review settlement for the next three years up to 2005&#150;06 includes a 1 per cent. real terms annual increase in core funding and paves the way for three year budgets for colleges and other providers which demonstrate their effectiveness. We also expect to announce further substantial resources later in the autumn to support our strategy for reforming further education and training.

 At present the performance of the Criminal Records Bureau is not impacting on the process of appointing teachers. My Department has advised employers in the education service that teachers, and other staff and volunteers, can be appointed provisionally in advance of the receipt of a Disclosure from the CRB. They may be deployed to work with children at the discretion of the Head teacher, subject to a satisfactory check of my Department's List 99 which contains details of people who are barred from teaching and other work involving regular contact with children, taking up references, and other usual recruitment checks. We have also advised employers that where appropriate they should continue to seek a CRB Disclosure, and review the person's suitability in light of any information revealed by that when it is received. The interim arrangements to allow teachers to be appointed in advance of receiving a Disclosure were first introduced in May.

<a name="21024w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr Miliband: </B> 
 There are statutory tests for primary school pupils at the end of Key Stages 1 and 2 as they complete one programme of study and prepare to move on to the next. Each year the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority carries out evaluations of the key stage tests, including questions relating to pupil anxiety. The evidence over several years, including this year, is that teachers generally feel that most children cope well with them. Other recent studies include a review by the EPPI-Centre on the impact of summative assessment and testing on students' motivation for learning. These studies help inform the development of policy.

 Colleges in the further education sector, including sixth form colleges, are run by independent corporations with their own pay arrangements. Colleges agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them. Within this context, there is a nationally recommended pay increase agreed by employer representative bodies and the unions. There has not yet been agreement between employers and the trade unions on a national recommendation on this year's pay. The Government has strongly encouraged both parties to enter into meaningful discussions on this year's pay award.
<P>

<a name="21024w14.html_para1">In consultation with the Association of Colleges, the Sixth Form Colleges' Employers' Forum and the FE unions we have introduced the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) to help colleges modernise pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers.

Colleges agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them. Within this context, there is a nationally recommended pay increase agreed by employer representative bodies and the unions. Pay arrangements in the sector are therefore diverse, reflecting colleges' local priorities and the overall resources available to them. Extra resources have been made available to FE colleges. There is #4.4 billion available to the sector this year, an increase of #1.2 billion in five years. Within this there is #142m available for the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) which helps colleges to modernise pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers and we have recently announced its extension to non-teaching staff for the first time.

 On 20 September, I announced an extra #32m for the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) in further education colleges this year and the Learning and Skills Council has notified colleges of their additional allocations. Of the #32 million, I indicated that #20 million was for teachers and lecturers and #12 million to allow colleges to make a start on extending the initiative to non-teaching staff for the first time through the College Pay Initiative (CPI). However, colleges have complete flexibility in determining how they allocate their share of the #32 million between different groups of staff to meet local priorities. The additional #32m represents approximately one per cent. of the overall FE pay bill.

 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> There is already a great deal of research evidence from the UK and elsewhere about effective strategies for teaching English as an additional language (EAL). The general consensus among practitioners in England is that EAL teaching is most effective where it is firmly embedded across all National Curriculum subject areas. This ensures that pupils have the opportunity to learn English in a meaningful subject-specific context. My Department's role is to ensure that the particular needs of bilingual learners are properly taken into account in all policies and programmes aimed at raising standards. Recent examples include the development and dissemination of EAL modules as part of the National Literacy and Numeracy strategies and Key Stage 3.

 My right hon. Friend has asked the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) to consider the pay of London teachers, but has not specifically asked it to review the qualifying areas for the three London allowances. All schools, including those outside the existing London Allowances area, already have discretion to pay recruitment and retention allowances worth up to #5,262 per annum to target their particular recruitment and retention issues. She has also asked the STRB to consider what scope there would be over the longer term for introducing some form of local pay, which will better reflect local differences in costs and rest more responsibility for pay in the hands of Headteachers. She awaits the STRB's recommendations with interest.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 19 September, <i>Official Report</i>, column 111W, on physical education, what research was undertaken to enforce the joint Public Service Agreement with her Department and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in respect of sport in schools; and if she will place such research in the Library.

 All School Sport Co-ordinator partnerships are currently undertaking an annual data collection exercise. This will provide in-depth information on the number of pupils with access to two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week, within and beyond the curriculum. Early messages from this will be available before the end of the year and the House will be informed of the results.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 23 October 2002]:</i> At Barcelona in March 2002, the Council decided that a one stop European Job Mobility web site should be established by the end of 2003 at the latest.
<P>

<a name="21024w16.html_para0">The Commission, together with the national public employment services, has developed the European Employment Services (EURES) system which, since 1998, has provided job vacancies on the Internet. The Commission is also currently testing a new portal website which will provide access to training and learning opportunities. It is expected that the new portal will be launched next month.
<P>

<a name="21024w16.html_para1">The Commission plans to bring together the two Internet services in 2003 to offer a single point of access for citizens interested in jobs and learning opportunities. The new, single, portal will form the basis of the European Job Mobility website.

 It is the Department's intention to publish a statement on the disposition of TEC assets in the Department's accounts which are currently being audited by the NAO and are due to be published on 4 December 2002. The disposition of TEC assets has been subject to a policy agreed with Ministers and Treasury with the aim of making sure that TEC assets are used for the benefit of the TEC local communities in the furtherance of broader government objectives and not for private gain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools have not been classed by Ofsted as well led over the last five years; and what proportion this is of all schools inspected.  [75256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 These are matters for the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED). The HM Chief Inspector for Schools, David Bell will write to the hon. Gentleman and a copy of his letter will be placed in the Library.

<a name="21024w17.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on whether the performance inequalities between <i>(a)</i> primary schools and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools have narrowed since 1997.  [75258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There has been a significant narrowing of the performance inequalities between primary schools, following the introduction of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. At Key Stage 2, for example, the average performance of the lowest attaining 20 per cent. of schools improved from 41 per cent. in 1997 to 61 per cent. in 2001, an increase of 20 per cent. points compared to the national average increase of 13 per cent. points.
<P>

<a name="21024w17.html_para0">We are committed to narrowing the performance gap between secondary schools through the implementation of our plans to transform secondary education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w17.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what has been the total cost in each of the last four years of the performance related pay scheme for teachers, broken down by <i>(a)</i> administration costs, <i>(b)</i> payments to teachers and <i>(c)</i> other costs; how many of those who applied received the additional payments; and if she will make a statement.  [75260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Teachers have been receiving performance threshold increases since September 2000. Over #245 million in threshold grant payments were paid to local authorities in the 2000&#150;01 financial year, over #436 million in 2001&#150;02, and to date over #279 million in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="21024w17.html_para1">The Department has a contract with Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) for the provision and deployment of threshold assessors and external advisers to governing bodies on heads' performance. We also have a contract with Centre for British Teachers (CfBT) for training in threshold assessment and performance management. The value of these contracts depends on the volume and quality of activity. Since January 2000 total CEA contract costs have been around #47 million and CfBT costs around #13 million.
<P>

<a name="21024w17.html_para2">Not all teachers who were eligible to apply did so. Over 200,000 teachers in England applied to cross the performance threshold in the first round and over 31,000 in the second round. Of these, nearly 224,000 were assessed as meeting the threshold standards. This is something of which the profession can be proud.

 Responses to extensive consultation on the Burns Report showed almost universal support for the abolition of the 11 plus Transfer Tests and a predominant view that academic selection should be ended, although there was also substantial opposition to this proposal. There was also support for the development of a Pupil Profile, a broadening of curriculum choice at age 14, and for greater co-operation and collaboration between schools. There is a clear demand for change in order to address the weaknesses of the current system. It is important that we continue to make progress on this key issue and the Department will be meeting the key education partners to build consensus on new transfer and post-primary arrangements that are fair for all children and enable all children to reach their full potential.

The overall process will have three components: a public debate organised independently of the Government, a review of the science on GM issues, and a study of the costs and benefits associated with GM. The Government wants an open and balanced dialogue that will help to deepen understanding of the issues surrounding this technology.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to conserve and enhance biodiversity in England; and if she will make a statement.  [77743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w18.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Today I am publishing a biodiversity strategy for England. The document, ''<i>Working with the grain of nature</i>'' is being placed in the House libraries.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para0">The undertaking to prepare a biodiversity strategy for England was made in the Rural White Paper, ''<i>Our Countryside, the future: a fair deal for rural England</i>''. The Strategy is intended to build on the progress that the Government has already made in protecting and enhancing biodiversity in England, for example with greater protection for sites of Special Scientific Interest under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and the implementation of 436 biodiversity action plans for priority habitats and species. We recognise that we can only secure the long-term health of biodiversity that is needed to bring a truly sustainable future by also achieving fundamental changes to public policy and the behaviour of people across the board.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para1">The Strategy sets this process in train by seeking to embed biodiversity considerations into all the main sectors of economic activity, public and private. The Strategy sets out a vision and programme for the next five years for five important policy sectors.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para2">In Agriculture, we aim to encourage the management of farming and agricultural land so as to conserve and enhance biodiversity as part of the Government's Sustainable Food and Farming Strategy.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para3">In water, we aim for a whole catchment approach to the wise, sustainable use of water and wetlands.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para4">In woodland and forestry, we are looking for the management and extension of woodland so as to promote enhanced biodiversity and quality of life.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2002 : Column 476W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para5">In marine and coastal management, we aim to achieve the sustainable use and management of our coasts and seas using natural processes and the ecosystem-based approach.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para6">In urban areas, we want biodiversity to become a part of the development of policy on sustainable communities, urban green space and the built environment.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para7">The Strategy also identifies a number of cross-cutting themes, with the aim of involving society as a whole in the achievement of biodiversity improvements. For example, we aim to encourage business to act for biodiversity in the boardroom, through the supply chain, in their management systems, in their annual reports and accounts and on the ground. We will also help make biodiversity part of people's everyday lives through information, communication and education and establish a mechanism to involve children and young people in the development of biodiversity policy. In addition, we will continue to encourage partnerships for biodiversity at local and regional levels in England.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para8">It will be essential to ensure that we measure biodiversity trends and the effects of our policies. Much work is already underway to improve the information that is available to understand the status of habitats and species, and the Strategy announces the development of a new web-based Biodiversity Action Reporting System to be launched in 2003 and the adoption of a set of biodiversity indicators to measure our progress. These indicators will be published in full within a year.
<P>

<a name="21024w18.html_para9">This Government Strategy has been prepared, uniquely, with the active contributions of a large number of partners and stakeholders. We shall continue to rely on the widest possible partnership as we move forward to implementation. The partnership will be represented through the England Biodiversity Group, which will review the Strategy annually and publish a report on progress in 2006.

<a name="21024w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 99 per cent. of the population of England and Wales are covered by Community Legal Service Partnerships (CLSPs) with the aim of improving access to good quality legal and advice services. By focusing on social welfare and family law, such as housing, welfare benefits, debt and employment, the Community Legal Service is making it easier for vulnerable individuals and families to learn about their rights and how to enforce them. The Partnership Innovation Budget is allowing CLSPs to develop creative ways to deliver services to excluded groups while changes to the eligibility limits mean that more people now qualify for free initial advice and guidance. This will make it easier for those individuals most at risk to address problems before they escalate.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list by country the number of child abduction cases being dealt with by the Child Abduction Unit which have exceeded the six week deadline for a hearing and are awaiting a resolution.  [76407]<P>

<P>
<a name="21024w19.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Article 11 of the Hague Convention makes reference to a six week ''deadline''. This Article draws to the attention of Contracting States the urgency with which these proceedings should be dealt with. Article 11 does not oblige the courts to conclude a case within six weeks. Common delays are where the country in question is unable to locate the child or where additional enquiries are necessary to assist the court in their decision.
<P>

<a name="21024w19.html_para2">The Child Abduction Unit currently has 105 cases outstanding where children have been wrongfully removed to, or retained in, other Hague Convention countries. Without examining each case it is impossible to say exactly how many of these cases have exceeded the six week period, but it will be the vast majority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to change the rules for claiming bereavement benefits.  [77652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w20.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 I have laid Regulations today to amend the Social Security Claims and Payments Regulations, 1987. Subject to Parliament's approval they simplify the rules for claiming bereavement benefits.
<P>

<a name="21024w20.html_para0">Bereavement benefits were introduced in April 2001. We have been looking at the way the three elements fit together and whether there might be improvements made by simplifying the rules. Depending on when someone claims a bereavement benefit there can be two separate social security decisions to be made&#151;one for the weekly benefit of either Widowed Parent's Allowance or Bereavement Allowance and another for the lump-sum Bereavement Payments when there is no real difference in the qualification rules. This is both time-consuming and can be confusing for bereaved people themselves.
<P>

<a name="21024w20.html_para1">We want bereaved people to claim and receive the help that they and their families are entitled to when they need it&#151;immediately after the bereavement. Most people do; more than four fifths claim within four or five weeks of their loss. The claim is easy to make; using only one form, a widow or widower can claim whichever of these three benefits they may be entitled to without further form-filling. However, we acknowledge that not all bereaved people find it possible to claim as promptly as the current rules for the lump-sum Bereavement Payment require. To simplify matters further, we are extending the time limit for claiming Bereavement Payment and aligning it with the period over which a person can receive Bereavement Allowance&#151;namely 12 months. We see this as a sensible alteration that will simplify the scheme for everyone while remaining compatible with underlying benefit entitlement rules.
<P>

<a name="21024w20.html_para2">We intend to make this change effective for claims in respect of deaths that occur on or after 1 April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w20.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend will be making a number of minor changes to the discretionary social fund, with effect from 28 October 2002.

 Free movement of people is one of the four freedoms within the internal market of the European Union. Within the Free Movement Title of the EC Treaty, Article 39 states that free movement of workers ''shall be secured within the Community''. This means that workers of the Member States are free to accept offers of employment actually made in another Member State, and to remain in another Member State for the purposes of carrying out employment. However, Article 39 does not apply to employment in the public service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans his Department has to review the operation of pension entitlement for married women who have paid national insurance contributions at the reduced rate where no official advice was given as to the consequences of exercising this option.  [76817]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 In order to pay the reduced rate contribution, married women had to complete a form CF9 which was attached to leaflet NI1 (National Insurance for married women). This leaflet explained the consequences of the choice. In particular, it explained that the choice could affect future entitlement to benefit, including Retirement Pension. In addition, they had to sign a statement that they had read and understood the leaflet.
<P>

<a name="21024w21.html_para0">The option to pay the reduced rate was withdrawn in 1977 but those who were already paying the reduced rate were allowed to continue to do so with the option to revoke it at any time. This was widely publicised. Following the restructuring of National Insurance contributions in 1989, the Department again ran a publicity campaign to inform married women paying the reduced rate contribution that they could be paying more in reduced rate contributions than if they paid the standard rate.




<P>

<a name="21024w21.html_para1">This campaign also reminded them that they could revoke their option to pay the reduced rate. In October 2000, they were again advised, following changes to the structure of the National Insurance scheme, to reconsider their choice to pay the reduced rate contribution.

<a name="21024w21.html_para6">The National Insurance number (NINO) allocation process for persons from abroad is known as the Enhanced NINO Process and is administered by Jobcentre Plus. The process involves a rigorous face to face interview, scrutiny of supporting documentation, and corroborative checks made on the information provided prior to the allocation of a NINO. The process applies to all foreign nationals requiring a NINO. Anyone actively seeking work may apply for a NINO regardless of their immigration status. If during the allocation process suspicions are raised as to the legitimacy of an individual's right to be in the country, the case is referred to the Department's National Identity Fraud Unit for further action. Upon arrival in this country asylum seekers are initially supported by the Home Office National Asylum Support Service. Contact with this Department for the allocation of a NINO will therefore not normally take place until a decision has been made by the Home Office on the person's application for asylum. Once this has taken place (or if the person has been in the country for more than 6 months and is still awaiting a decision), an application for a NINO can be made through the Enhanced NINO Process.

<P>
<a name="21024w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a licence to export laboratory equipment to UNESCO for use by the Suleymaniyah Technical Institute in Northern Iraq. The export included potassium cyanide and hydrofluoric acid which are subject to the Dual-Use Items (Export Control) Regulations 2000 as amended. HMG is confident that there is no proliferation threat associated with this export.
<P>

<a name="21024w23.html_para7">The UN Iraq Sanctions Committee approved this export to Iraq under the Oil for Food programme (OFF). Under OFF Iraq is allowed to export unlimited quantities of oil to fund the purchase of humanitarian goods. The export is consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.

 The service increment for teaching reimburses National Health Service organisations the additional costs they incur as result of providing a clinical setting for medical and dental undergraduate students' training. #585 million was made available for this in 2002&#150;03 and included additional funds to support increased numbers of medical and dental students. Between 1999 and 2001 the higher education funding council (HEFCE) allocated 57 per cent. more medical school places to higher education institutions in England. Actual training costs are met by HEFCE, which is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.

<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Development of robust community-based mental health provision is the key to ensuring that patients adhere to their care plans.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2002 : Column 501W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para0">The NHS Plan pledged to establish a total of 220 assertive outreach teams by December 2003. There are 180 teams in operation at present. These teams provide services to people with a mental illness in the community who have difficulty engaging with mainstream mental health services.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para1">Another NHS Plan initiative is to create crisis resolution teams which provide intensive support for people in a mental health crisis in their own homes. These teams are designed to offer prompt and effective home treatment, including medication, in order to prevent hospital admissions. A total of 335 crisis resolution teams will be established by 2004 when all people in contact with specialist mental health services will be able to access crisis resolution teams at any time.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para2">Although, community-based teams can support and encourage patients to adhere to their care plans, they currently cannot compel them to do so. The draft Mental Health Bill contains proposals so that patients who meet the criteria for treatment under compulsion might remain at home, supported by an outreach service, rather than having to be detained in hospital. Patients will not be forcibly treated in their own homes. These patients will be subject to conditions authorised by the independent mental health tribunal to ensure that they comply with their individual care plan, including where necessary taking medication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts (PCTs) have the freedom to commission services from wherever they can to obtain the best services for their patients. It is likely that the majority of National Health Service trust hospitals have more than one PCT that commissions care from them, although the precise figures are not collected centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The proposed new consultant contract is designed to provide a much more effective system of planning and time-tabling consultants' duties and responsibilities for the National Health Service in ways that best meet local service needs and priorities. Under the proposed arrangements, full-time consultants will typically devote at least seven out of a total of ten weekly programmed activities to direct clinical care. The new contract will also facilitate arranging extra consultant activity on a more planned and efficient basis.

 The Department does not have its own system for categorising conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis in this way. However, it employs the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Benign myalgic encephalomyelitis appears in the current version, ICD&#150;10, as a neurological illness.

<a name="21024w25.html_wqn4"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance he gives to general practitioners about ME.  [75976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Action on ME, a voluntary group active in this area, has recently produced guidance on the management of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). We have brought this guidance to the attention of National Health Service chief executives through the CE Bulletin; and will be making reference to in the next issue of the GP Bulletin.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para3">The CFS/ME independent working group's report, which was published on 11 January 2002, has been placed on the Chief Medical Officer's web-site, so that it can be accessed by all interested parties including general practitioners.

<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para4">Most cases of CFS/ME are managed in the community although general practitioners can refer patients for specialist opinion and advice where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para5">ME is mainly managed in primary care. It is the responsibility of local primary care trusts to commission services for their local populations including those suffering from CFS/ME.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department has not recently made an assessment. The social services inspectorate's report <i>Detained</i> focused on the quality of service experienced by detained patients generally and in particular, the approved social worker's role. It was published in February 2001.

2002. NHSU is the body that has been set-up to prepare the establishment of a university for the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para6">NHSU is currently finalising a development plan for the NHSU setting out the vision for the university, as the basis for an extensive consultation exercise with the NHS and its partners, between November 2002 and January 2003. The plan will be widely distributed and a number of consultation events will be organised jointly with NHS workforce development confederations around the country.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para7">The NHSU will begin to work later next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason Wythenshawe Hospital scheduled an operation on Mr. S. Ford of Warrington at a time when the relevant consultant was known to be away; how many times this has happened to other patients in the last year; and what procedures will be put in place to prevent such occurences in the future.  [76648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There was a breakdown in communication within the cardiac waiting list department. This was the first and only time such an incident has occurred. Staff have been reminded of the importance of informing the cardiac waiting list department in the event that a consultant is not available to cover the trans-oesophageal echo list.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_wqn9"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will ask the Commission for Health Improvement to investigate <i>(a)</i> the procedures in place for monitoring the number of times patients have operations cancelled at Wythenshawe Hospital, <i>(b)</i> the procedures which are involved when the hospital cancels a patient's surgery more than once and <i>(c)</i> the system used for ensuring patients are notified of a new date for surgery within 28 days.  [76646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) has power to undertake special investigations into particular areas of concern in the delivery of health care. The Commission considers all such requests against six guiding principles which are set out in its, <i>Policy on assessing requests for investigations and fast track clinical governance reviews</i>, copies of which are available in the Library and on its website at www.chi.nhs.uk. These principles include situations where there has been an incident of great severity, where there is evidence of repeated service failure and where action by CHI could result in lessons for the whole of the National Health Service.

[75989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Information is not collected centrally on the number of patients waiting for diagnostic tests. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any diagnostic test is dependent on their clinical condition. 



<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2002 : Column 504W</I><P>
Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, however this is dependent on the clinical priority of all remaining patients waiting to have diagnostic tests.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para8">The NHS Cancer Plan set new targets to shorten the time patients have to wait for diagnosis and treatment. The first step in reducing cancer waiting times was the introduction of the two week waiting time standard form urgent general practitioner referral to outpatient appointment for cases of suspected breast cancer from April 1999. The two week standard was extended to all other urgent cases of suspected cancer during 2000. By 2005 there will be a maximum two month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for all cancers.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para9">We are making unprecedented investment in the provision of new and replacement diagnostic equipment, improving the recruitment and retention of staff and streamlining the way care is delivered through the cancer services collaborative.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish guidance from his Department to NHS trusts and health authorities on the speed of processing of patients onto <i>(a)</i> inpatient and <i>(b)</i> outpatient waiting lists following (i) GP and (ii) consultant referral; and if he will make a statement.  [76288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All guidance to the National Health Service is published in the NHS data dictionary/manual. This covers the relevant information on when a patient should appear on a waiting list and how a waiting time should be recorded.
<P>

<a name="21024w25.html_para10">Patients are added to the inpatient elective admission list at the time there is a decision to admit the patient and the waiting time is calculated from that date. For first outpatient appointments the waiting time is calculated from the date the NHS trust receives the referral, except where a patient as been referred under the urgent cancer referral route, then the waiting time is calculated from the date the general practitioner decided to refer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether endoscopy tests are included in the waiting list figures for <i>(a)</i> inpatients and <i>(b)</i> outpatients; what guidance has been issued to hospital trusts and health authorities about exclusion of endoscopies from waiting list statistics over the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [75985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Data on waiting times for consultant led inpatient elective admissions and consultant led first outpatient appointments, following a general practitioner referral, are collected on the consultant's main specialty not by procedure. Endoscopies can be recorded as either inpatients or outpatients depending on the setting in which the endoscope takes place. Guidance to this effect is available on the Department's web-site, at www.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/frequentlyaskedquestions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21024w25.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Laws: </B>

<a name="21024w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2002]:</i> The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) currently applies to all health and social care staff, with the exception of doctors in training.
<P>

<a name="21024w26.html_para6">The Department issued guidance in Health Service Circular 1998/204, <i>Working Time Regulations&#151;Implementation in the NHS</i>. It is for local National Health Service employers, within the guidelines issued by the Department, to conform to the legislation as an individual employer. In relation to the social care workforce, individual employers in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors are also required to conform to current legislation, assuming their responsibility as the employer.
<P>

<a name="21024w26.html_para7">Doctors in training will come under the EWTD from August 2004, which will be introduced in stages with an initial maximum requirement of 58 hours reducing to 48 by 2009. The Department will be issuing guidance on implementation this autumn and is working with stakeholders including the medical Royal Colleges, British Medical Association, NHS Confederation and the service to ensure that effective solutions are developed. The Department is also funding a programme of pilot projects based in NHS trusts to develop and test innovative solutions to EWTD implementation. Full details of the pilot programme will be announced when the guidance is issued.

 <i>[holding answers 22 October 2002]:</i> The implementation of section 49 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 relates to National Health Service funded nursing care, not free continuing care. The guidance states that patients should have their need for registered nursing care reviewed and re-assessed three months after their placement in a nursing home; at least annually thereafter, or when there is a significant change in their condition. Entitlement to local NHS continuing health care criteria is the first consideration in any assessment by NHS nurses. I have received several representations in relation to the implementation of section 49.
