<P>
<a name="30618w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No such estimate has been made as part of the process of introducing integrated risk management. The Deputy Prime Minster has repeatedly made it clear that the modernisation of the fire service can be achieved without the need for compulsory redundancies.

 The proposals put forward by Professor Frank Burchill for the resolution of the pay dispute between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and their local authority employers contained no detailed costings. The proposals put forward by the employers, accepted by the FBU on 12 June 2003, do not include costings, but the employers have assured me that the deal is deliverable within current budgets, supported by &#163;30 million of transitional funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, repayable over the Spending Review 2002 period.

 As of June 2002, local authority statistics show that 600 people were sleeping rough on any one night. This figure sustained the Prime Minister's target to reduce rough sleeping by at least two-thirds from a baseline figure of 1,850 in June 1998.
<P>

<a name="30618w02.html_para23">The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister brings together the work of the former Rough Sleepers Unit, the Bed and Breakfast Unit and a team to ensure the effective implementation of the Homelessness Act 2002 and assist local authorities in the development of strategies to tackle homelessness.
<P>

<a name="30618w02.html_para24">The Homelessness Directorate has a revenue budget this year of &#163;70 million and is providing grant support to local authorities to help them implement homelessness strategies and where necessary bed and breakfast action plans and rough sleeping strategies.

<a name="30618w02.html_para26">This was highlighted in the recent Social Exclusion Unit report "Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion", which aims to tackle social exclusion by ensuring people can get to work and key services and to reduce the disproportionate impact of traffic on disadvantaged areas. This does not just involve improving transport but changing where and how services are delivered.

<a name="30618w02.html_para27">The report introduces a new framework&#151;accessibility planning&#151;to be led by transport authorities when preparing and implementing their second Local Transport Plans (due in 2005).

 Under seat belt wearing legislation, the driver of a vehicle is responsible for ensuring that children under 14 years use child restraints or adult belts, as appropriate, in accordance with the regulations. There is nothing in this legislation to require hire companies to provide appropriate child restraints for customers or ensure that they are properly fitted. The provision and fitting of appropriate child restraints is a matter between a hire company and their customers.

 With the help of the Advisory Group on Motorcycling the Government are currently exploring a number of important issues relating to the role of motorcycling in an integrated transport policy, including congestion. The key workstreams should be completed by 2004, when we aim to determine a strategy for motorcycling.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 23 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 514W, on paper supplies, whether any of the paper or paper products supplied to his Department by Premier Paper are supplied by Stora Enso's Veitsiluoto Mill in Finland; and what assessment has been made of whether this paper contains <i>(a)</i> timber from old growth forests and <i>(b)</i> timber that may have been logged illegally in Russia.

 Paper and paper products supplied to my Department by Premier Paper are not supplied from Stora Enso's Veitsiluoto Mill in Finland.
<P>

<a name="30618w04.html_para0">Over 94 per cent. of the paper that we use is made from material containing a high proportion of post consumer waste. Our approach is to phase out virgin paper for non-specialist uses and where it is used we specify that it should be made from pulp that comes from sources that have been independently verified as legal and sustainably managed in accordance with Government Policy. This should ensure that the Department does not purchase any paper that contains <i>(a)</i> timber from old growth forests and <i>(b)</i> timber that may have been logged illegally in Russia. However, I am taking steps to ensure not only that the policy is understood and implemented but also that it is being policed.

 Comparative figures are not available at this stage. However, we have appointed consultants &#151;Halcrow&#151;to monitor the number of utility works carried out on roads in England. They will be reporting to us later this summer with figures for the period April 2002 to March 2003. Copies of their report will be placed in the Libraries of the House in due course. Copies of their 2001&#150;02 report have already been placed in the House Libraries.

<a name="30618w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to increasing rail's modal share of the freight market. The Strategic Rail Authority's "Freight Progress Report", published in May 2003, explains the achievements to date and sets out its future plans for increasing rail's overall share of freight traffic. Copies of the report are in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Negotiations and agreements between rail unions and train operating companies are matters for those bodies. Franchise agreements do, however, require the Strategic Rail Authority to approve any proposed pay agreement that would exceed the average earnings index either in the last 12 months of a franchise or in later years because these would result in liabilities for successor train operators.

<a name="30618w05.html_spnew0"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 The overall cost of running the House administration (excluding capital works etc.) in 2002&#150;03 was some &#163;133 million, giving an average daily cost of the order of &#163;365,000. The difference in cost between a sitting day and a non-sitting day is negligible: the major costs of accommodation and staffing are not affected appreciably by the change to September sittings. These figures do not include the cost of paying Members' salaries or allowances, which are not normally regarded as part of the cost of running the House itself.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport with reference to the Digital Action Plan, what her definition of digital television being affordable is; and what criteria she used to come to this definition.  [119650]<P>

 We have said that switching to digital television must be an affordable option for the vast majority of people; and as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers must have access to digital equipment. One of the key tasks for Government in the Digital Action Plan is to conduct a comprehensive review of progress towards digital switchover, with particular reference to the accessibility, availability and affordability tests announced in September 1999. I have asked the Digital Television Consumer Expert Group announced on 17 June to help the Government with this.

<a name="30618w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport whether recent changes to the concessionary TV licence fee regulations will require people who are over 65, who previously had concessionary TV licences and who work part-time, to pay full rates; and if she will make a statement.  [119381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w05.html_spnew7"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The recent changes to the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary television licence scheme, to introduce preserved rights to the concession for existing beneficiaries, have not altered the categories of resident eligible for the concession. These are disabled persons, mentally disordered persons and retired persons aged 60 years or more. The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system, including responsibility for determining entitlement to the ARC concession in individual cases. However, I understand that residents aged 60 years or more who are either not in paid employment, are in paid employment but work no more than 15 hours per week, or are in paid employment but do not work in their lifetime career, are considered to fall within the category of retired persons aged 60 years or more.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w05.html_spnew8"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system. This includes responsibility for determining refund policy. However, I understand that, in cases where residents in sheltered housing have obtained full fee licences but have since become entitled to preserved rights to the Accommodation for Residential Care concession, the BBC's policy is to offer refunds for full, unexpired calendar months from 1 April this year, when the amending regulations came into effect.

 Where a child benefit claimant dies and their partner wants to claim child benefit instead, he or she needs to make a new claim.

 The UK Government continues to press the urgent case for an International Finance Facility to raise the additional finance needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 in all relevant national and international fora and with both developed and developing country governments.
<P>

<a name="30618w07.html_para11">Support has been achieved through events such as the Chief Secretary's visit to Ethiopia, Ghana and South Africa earlier this month; an official level visit to Rwanda to address the eighth meeting of the HIPC Finance Ministers on the IFF; and a Treasury representation at the Annual Economic Commission for African Finance Ministers in Addis Ababa. At this meeting Ministers issued a Communique stating "we strongly welcome the proposed International Finance Facility as the first of its kind designed to mobilise additional resources for the poorest countries to meet the MDGs."
<P>

<a name="30618w07.html_para12">The Development Committee and the IMFC discussed the IFF at the Spring Meetings in April and the Development Committee will raise it again at the Annual Meetings. Agreement was made in the Communique of the last G7 Finance Ministerial meeting to continue to focus on the Millennium Development Goals, and their financing, including facilities. At the G8 Summit in Evian, Heads of State requested that Finance Ministers report back on the IFF in advance of the Annual Meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in September 2003. The Treasury also continues to discuss the IFF in European meetings, including ECOFIN, at both Ministerial and official level.

 Under our long-standing formal agreements with our European partners, we are permitted to keep our existing zero rates but may not extend them or introduce new ones. As such, it is not possible to remove VAT from the items mentioned. Member states are permitted to introduce reduced rates of VAT on a prescribed list of goods and services set out in Annex H of the EC Sixth VAT Directive. However, none of the items mentioned currently feature on this list, and we cannot therefore apply a reduced rate to them at this time. The Annex H list is due to be reviewed by the European Commission later this year, and we will consider any representations for new reduced rates in the context of this review.

 The Ministry of Defence is aware of changes introduced recently by various broadcasters, including the BBC, to restrict reception within Europe in compliance with international rights and licence agreements. It is with these agreements in mind that the Ministry of Defence provides bespoke radio and television services overseas to British service personnel and their families (the "entitled audience") under the banner of the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) through a contract with the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC) which is an independent limited company and registered charity. The availability of BFBS services to any specific location is, however, subject to practicality and affordability. The MOD is, in conjunction with SSVC and British command staffs based in Naples, currently reviewing the means by which it may be possible to extend the BFBS television service to entitled personnel in the Naples area and other locations in Italy. The deliberations are being undertaken independently of, and without reference to, any changes introduced by other broadcasters.

A poster and leaflet campaign has been carried out, head teachers in Basrah have been briefed and military teams are delivering mine and unexploded ordnance awareness training to Primary and Secondary schools on a daily basis using material approved by the ICRC. In addition to this local radio stations are informing the local population about unexploded ordnance and encouraging them not to tamper with anything that has either been marked as or may look like unexploded ordnance.

 Seventy-four local authorities have so far notified the Home Office that they have made designation orders under section 13 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to restrict anti-social public drinking in areas that have experienced alcohol-related disorder or nuisance. These are listed in the table. This represents around 18 per cent. of the total number of local authorities (county, metropolitan, unitary, borough and district councils) in England and Wales. The new arrangements introduced by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 replaced the previous Home Office public drinking byelaw. Any such byelaw will lapse after five years from the commencement of the relevant provisions on 1 September 2001, unless replaced by a section 13 designation order.

 Underage drinking is one of the forms of behaviour that can be tackled by the use of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) and Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs), as was confirmed in the guidance "A Guide to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders and Acceptable Behaviour Contracts" issued on 12 November 2002. In addition, the White Paper "Rights and Responsibility&#151;Taking a Stand Against Anti-Social Behaviour" made clear the Government's intention to introduce, in the Criminal Justice Bill, a new Individual Support Order that will extend the protection that ASBOs provide to the community by requiring children and young people subject to such orders to undertake individually tailored activities, which could include attending treatment for substance misuse.

 The existing Treaty on the European Union includes preventing and combating terrorism as a Union objective and already provides for extensive police and judicial co-operation. This has been strengthened by the action agreed at the Tampere European Council in October 1999. This co-operation is in Britain's national interest as we face the threat of terrorism and has already proved its worth, for example by ensuring that all member states have effective legislation on combating terrorism.
<P>

<a name="30618w14.html_para10">The Council held an orientation debate on the Regulation creating a European enforcement order for uncontested civil claims during which Ministers discussed the scope of the Regulation, minimum standards for the service of claims, appeal provisions and the omission of a public policy based right to refuse enforcement. Baroness Scotland welcomed the proposed Regulation, emphasising the benefits that better debt recovery would bring to businesses trading cross-Europe. She supported the Presidency's proposals, in particular the inclusion within the minimum standards of postal service where that method was permitted in the State in which both parties resided and where the possibility of setting aside the judgment continued until enforcement commenced. The issue of whether to exclude consumer debts from the scope of the Regulation and the matter of claims which attracted state immunity protection were remitted to the working group.
<P>

<a name="30618w14.html_para11">Member states indicated that they could accept the proposal that confiscation orders be enforced in the absence of dual criminality for a list of offences specified in Article 5 of the Framework Decision on the execution in the EU of Confiscation Orders. However, member states linked the enforcement of extended confiscation orders as defined in Article 2 to grounds for refusal set out in Article 7.

<a name="30618w14.html_para12">The Presidency presented a progress report on the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of "ne bis in idem" and on negotiations with Switzerland to participate in the Schengen Aquis and asylum matters. The Commission gave a detailed summary of the latest version of the JHA Scoreboard noting in particular that some of the deadlines set at the Seville European Council were not going to be met.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what his policy is in respect of making representations to <i>(a)</i> the Prison Service and <i>(b)</i> the Commissioner for Correction, concerning the exercise by the Parole Board of its judgements on parole;  [117583]
<P>

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]</i>: Information is served on the Parole Board on behalf of the Secretary of State in every case which is referred to the Parole Board to consider an application for early release. All such information is served to the prisoner, save in special circumstances described below.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para0">The Secretary of State has made no undisclosed representations to the Parole Board in respect of any individual case. Such action would undermine the transparency and fairness of the parole and early release process, as well as the independence of the Parole Board, which he considers an essential contribution to public confidence in the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para1">Under the Parole Board Rules 1997 (which apply to oral hearings of the Board) the parties to a parole hearing are the prisoner and the Secretary of State. Paragraph 5 of the Rules requires the Secretary of State to serve on the Board and on the prisoner, information relating to the prisoner, reports relating to the prisoner and such further information which he considers to be relevant to the case. This material takes the form of a dossier of reports from prison and probation staff, prison psychologists where appropriate, court and police reports at the time of the trial, and any other relevant information, including an assessment of risk which the prison may pose if released. Where the Parole Board decides that an oral hearing should take place, both parties are entitled to be represented at the hearing and to hear each other's evidence.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para2">The same principles apply to paper reviews by the Board, and the information which is required to be put before the Board on behalf of the Secretary of State in these cases is set out in Prison Service Order 6000, a copy

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his Answer of 11 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 948W, on duplicate passports, how many current passports have been issued as second passports.  [119952]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w15.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2003]:</i> The UK Passport Service (UKPS) does not routinely collate centrally figures relating to the issue of second passports. The information could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much was paid in attendance allowances to members of police authorities in England and Wales in each of the last 10 municipal years; and how much he estimates will be allocated in the current municipal year.  [118744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Police Act 1996 provided for the reimbursement of expenses and allowances by police authorities to their members from within their own budget (schedule 2, paragraph 25 and schedule 2A, paragraph 20). Payment was subject to any framework determined by the Secretary of State and approved by the Treasury. This framework was deregulated by virtue of section 107 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2002 which amended Schedule 2 of the 1996 Act to allow police authorities to develop their own local expenses and allowances schemes. The Home Office has never made direct payment to police authorities to cover the costs of allowances payable to police authority members and neither is there any power to require police authorities to provide this data to the Home Office. Accordingly, there is no central record held by the Department of the total costs borne by authorities in respect of such expenses and the cost of collecting this information from individual authorities would be prohibitive.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what strategy is in place to reduce the number of <i>(a)</i> young people and <i>(b)</i> women at risk of (i) sexual exploitation and (ii) prostitution in England and Wales; and what studies he has made of other EU states' strategies for the reduction of prostitution and the protection of (A) young people and (B) women from such exploitation.  [119053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w15.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government are taking a range of measures to address the involvement of young people and adult women involved in prostitution.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para6">The Sexual Offences Bill, currently before Parliament, will strengthen the legal framework for tackling the commercial sexual exploitation of adults and children and trafficking for this purpose, both within the United Kingdom and internationally. The provisions covering children will protect them up to the age of 18 and cover buying sexual services from a child, recruitment, control in prostitution or pornography, causing, inciting, arranging or facilitating child prostitution or pornography. The maximum penalties will range from seven years to life imprisonment depending on the age of the child and the activity involved.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para7">The offences in the Bill will help fulfil the requirements of European Union Framework Decisions on Combating Trafficking of Human Beings and the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography, which the United Kingdom were actively involved in negotiating.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para8">In May 2000, the Government published "Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution". This guidance is aimed at all agencies that come into contact with children involved in, or at risk of becoming involved in, prostitution. It sets out a multi-agency approach, based on local protocols. It is issued pursuant to the Government's child protection guidance "Working Together to Safeguard Children".
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para9">In September 2001, the Government published the "National Plan for Safeguarding Children from Commercial Sexual Exploitation", in preparation for the Second World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in Yokohama, Japan in December 2001. The plan forms an important part of the Government's drive to improve safeguards for children. It focuses on those children who are induced or coerced into unlawful sexual activities for the commercial advantage of others. It explains what the Government, the devolved administrations and partner agencies are doing and are planning to do, looking at both UK-based and international sexual exploitation of children.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para10">In addition, the Home Office recently funded 11 prostitution initiatives as part of the "What Works: Tackling Prostitution" scheme, funded by the Crime Reduction Programme. These projects seek to develop and inform us of successful strategies for dealing with and managing the nuisance caused by the activities of prostitutes, the behaviour of those involved in the exploitation of others and ways of supporting those involved in prostitution who wish to exit the trade. Reports will be available later this year.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2003 : Column 267W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para11">With respect to children at risk of being drawn into prostitution or other commercial sexual exploitation, an assessment of the child's individual needs will be undertaken in accordance with the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families (2000)". This assessment should be followed by consideration of how best to address the identified needs of the child and the development of a care plan.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para12">For individual children already in prostitution, assistance and support should be provided by local statutory services in response to identified needs, whether directly or through specialist agencies. Child victims of commercial sexual exploitation are likely to be in need of welfare services and, in many cases, protection under the Children Act 1989. Social services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of these children following an assessment of their circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para13">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, such as the police or councils with social services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure either that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under s.20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within its area if it considers that this would safeguard or promote the child's welfare.
<P>

<a name="30618w15.html_para14">The Government are extremely concerned about the Mafia-style criminality associated with the exploitation of girls and women, the links between prostitution and drug dependency, and the way in which prostitution can blight local communities. There is a great deal of work to be done to establish how best to break the links between the sex trade and organised crime, to help those who are exploited to leave prostitution, and to support local communities to develop effective neighbourhood regeneration schemes. This is a complex area. As announced in 'Protecting the Public', published in November 2002 [Cm 5668] we are examining the scope for a review of the issues surrounding prostitution and the exploitation, organised criminality and class A drug abuse associated with it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police forces have seen a decline in the number of special constables employed in the last five years; and how many have seen a decline greater than 20 per cent.  [117773]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Figures on strength by police force area have moved to an annual cycle from March 2002 and will be available in the Library as previous publications. From March 1997 to March 2002 (latest figures available) all but one police force (Merseyside) in England and Wales have seen a decline in their numbers of special constables; and 38 have seen a decline greater than 20 per cent. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) figures (from records supplied by 37 forces) show that 569 specials left to join the regulars in the year ending 31 March 2002 and by 30 September 2002 (the latest date available) there were 131,548 police officers in England and Wales. There was also 58,909 civilian support staff in March 2002 (latest available). Both are record numbers.
<P>

<a name="30618w16.html_para0">The Government are committed to reversing the decline in specials and we are working with stakeholders to increase the size and effectiveness of the special constabulary. In particular, we will be publishing 'Good Practice Guidance' on the new website, following on from the Specials "champions projects", ensuring that specials' contribution is properly valued and used to best effect. The new specials website, www.specialconstables.gov.uk, was launched in February to provide specials and their managers with up-to-date information on the special constabulary and access to legislation and Home Office circulars.
<P>

<a name="30618w16.html_para1">We also held the first ever National Specials Weekend in February to raise the profile of specials and give recognition to the invaluable work they do. And we have freed up regulations to allow forces to trial payment schemes funded locally. We are also looking at how we can improve the engagement of employers with the special constabulary; and whether we can increase the opportunities for recognising the skills and experience specials acquire in forces within their wider workplace.

In particular, we will be publishing 'Good Practice Guidance' on the new website, ensuring specials' contribution is properly valued and used to best effect. We also held the first ever National Specials Weekend in February to raise the profile of specials and the invaluable work they do. And we have freed up regulations to allow forces to trial payment schemes funded locally. We are looking at whether we can increase the opportunities for recognising the skills and experience specials acquire in forces within their wider workplace as well.

 The Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC) Sub Committee on the Medical Implications of Less Lethal Weapons (DOMILL) has issued a statement on the medical implications of the use of taser. It concludes that the risk of death from high power tasers (such as the M26) is low, and certainly very much lower than that from conventional firearms. The full statement was included in the Third Report of the Research Programme into Alternative Policing Approaches towards the Management of Conflict issued by the Northern Ireland Office in December 2002.
<P>

<a name="30618w16.html_para4">The statement recommended further work in three areas to clarify cardiac hazards associated with the use of taser on individuals who could be considered to have a greater risk of adverse effects. Although DOMILL did not consider this research essential, it was commissioned last autumn. The work is being carried out by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) under contract to the Police Scientific Development Branch of the Home Office.

 The police and Security Service attach a high priority to monitoring the activities of those in the United Kingdom who are suspected of involvement in terrorism overseas. It is an offence under the Terrorism Act 2000 to incite another person to commit an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom. It is also an offence under the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 to conspire in this country to commit an act of terrorism overseas. Where there is any evidence of any offence being committed under this or any other counter-terrorist legislation, then action is taken.

 The Directive is currently under discussion at the European level, and until a final version is agreed, its implications will remain unclear.

 All national health service trusts have major incident plans in place and there are regular exercises to test these plans. Chemical, biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents are now considered at every planning meeting between Health Emergency Planning Advisers (HEPAs) and NHS trusts and are a significant focus of all NHS emergency planning development.
<P>

<a name="30618w18.html_para3">The emergency response division of the HPA has introduced a system to record centrally all exercises undertaken in the NHS and will be disseminating lessons learned. NHS trusts have, since 11 September 2001, been provided with greater amounts of improved personal protective equipment (PPE) and decontamination equipment. Training for dealing with CBRN incidents is also being urgently rolled out. NHS trusts have been working with local HEPAs to assess their capability to respond to CBRN incidents and lessons learned from these assessments are being implemented.
<P>

<a name="30618w18.html_para4">The HPA is also working with NHS trusts to improve emergency preparedness, particularly through a much expanded programme of exercises. Training needs are being identified and targeted training is being delivered. Consideration is also being given to staff turnover and the need for a programme of continuous training to be offered. Work being taken forward under the New Dimensions Project will also engage NHS trusts in a more integrated emergency response to CBRN threats together with other partner agencies.

 Wood preservatives and the use of organotin compounds in antifouling products are controlled under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended). The independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) most recently considered the wood preservative substance IPBC, and is awaiting responses from the industry before recommending any necessary regulatory action on the 101 products containing this substance. The most recent review of a wood preservative before that was copper/chrome/arsenic in November 2000, and the ACP recommended that approvals for the 32 products containing this could continue, subject to certain conditions. The organotin compounds, tributyltin oxide and tributyltin naphthenate, have previously been considered by the ACP. Information on assessments by the ACP are published on the following website: http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/acp/acp.htm

 The pilot survey, which was funded by the Food Standards Agency and carried out by five trading standards departments, found that three products contained undeclared horse meat. Two products, a peppered salami and Cervalat salami, were of the brand L'Artibon and these were purchased from Safeway in Durham. The third sample was labelled as a wild boar salami, manufactured by Bernadi Gastone of Pisa, Italy and sold by Alvini North, a wholesaler in Leeds.

 Local authorities are responsible for enforcement of food law. The three samples of salamis found positive for horse DNA in the pilot survey funded by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) were the subject of further investigation by two local authorities. Formal samples of a different batch of product were taken at a later date, but were subsequently found to be negative for horse DNA and no further action is possible on these samples. The FSA is carrying out a larger, nation wide survey on salami and salami-type products to determine the extent of this problem. If further unidentified horse meat is detected, local authorities will be encouraged to take formal action.

 Details on the methodology used are contained in the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals' (EVM) report, a copy of which is available in the Library. The EVM reviewed over 200 pieces of information on vitamin B6 from both animal and human studies. The available human data were considered inadequate for use in risk assessment. The EVM concluded that, based on the most appropriate animal data, 10 mg per day represents a clear safe upper level, with no adverse effects being anticipated over a lifetime's exposure.

 The Government are committed to legislating as soon as possible to give transsexual people their Convention rights. We aim to publish a draft Bill later this Session with substantive legislation following when parliamentary time allows. The draft Bill will give legal recognition in their acquired gender to transsexual people who can demonstrate that they have taken decisive steps towards living fully and permanently in the gender acquired since they were registered at birth.
<P>

<a name="30618w19.html_para5">Changing legal identity is a serious step, with significant consequences. It is important that no one should embark upon formal recognition in the acquired gender without convincing evidence. We will therefore propose that applications should be scrutinised by an authorising body, given legal powers to assess medical evidence before the transsexual person is allowed to register in the new gender. In some cases, where the person undertook gender reassignment years earlier, and has lived successfully in the acquired gender, that assessment may be straightforward. In other cases, the authorising body will need to be assured that, in addition to meeting medical criteria, the transsexual person has lived successfully in the acquired gender for at least two years. The medical criteria may include medical treatments to modify the person's sexual characteristics, but the Government will not require

<a name="30618w20.html_para1">A national scheme was proposed in order to reduce the cost of collecting and disposal of fallen stock and to encourage compliance with the Regulation. However, an infrastructure of knackers' yards and renderers is already in place, and we would expect farmers to have been complying with the new rules from 1 May 2003. There is a help line in place for farmers to use if they do not know what disposal services exist in their area. The help line number is: 0845 8507070.

<a name="30618w20.html_para2">In the absence of a scheme, costs to the farmer of disposal of fallen stock would depend on the type and number of animals on the farm and its location.

<i>Note:</i><P>

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also, the proportion of high-risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. This includes herds restocked post-FMD where additional testing is being carried out to manage the increased risk posed by the movement of infected cattle into re-formed herds. As a result, the number of new herd incidents in 2002 is not comparable to that of previous years.<P>

<a name="30618w21.html_para9">PVC is not classified as a special waste and so does not appear on the special waste database. The commercial and industrial waste survey is a sample survey of approximately 18,000 businesses, but it does not include the level of detail to establish the weight of PVC in waste consumer goods or the proportion disposed by different routes. The Government's Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will shortly be funding a comprehensive research project into options for PVC recycling in the UK.

We have implemented, or are implementing, all the recommendations relevant to Government.

<a name="30618w22.html_wqn4"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the precautionary principle, set out in the EU Directive 2001/18/EC and in the Environmental Protection Act 1990, has been adhered to in the farm scale evaluation programme; and if it is her policy that it will be adhered to in the Government's forthcoming decisions relating to GM crops.  [118575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government is firmly committed to taking a precautionary approach to decision making on GMO releases, this had always been the case under directive 90/220/EEC and is now explicitly recognised in directive 2001/18/EC and the national legislation that transposes it. Each proposed GMO release is subject to an evidence-based, case-by-case assessment of the potential risks to human health or the environment and approved only if the applicant can satisfy the regulatory authorities that all appropriate measures are being taken to avoid adverse effects.
<P>

<a name="30618w22.html_para1">The farm scale evaluations are an example of the Government's precautionary approach working in practice. In 1998, a genuine concern was raised about the potential impact on farmland wildlife of the herbicide use associated with GM herbicide-tolerant crops. We established the programme to investigate these concerns, and secured the agreement of the biotechnology industry that no GM crops would be grown commercially in the UK until the evaluations were complete.
<P>

<a name="30618w22.html_para2">The companies who developed the GM crops in the evaluations had already made applications at European level through directive 90/220 for approval for commercial cultivation. This requires the submission of a comprehensive dossier of information about the GMO and its properties and an environmental risk assessment. In one case (T25 maize) approval for commercial cultivation had already been granted. The risks to the environment of carrying out the farm scale evaluations were explicitly addressed before they commenced based on advice from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. The trials have been closely monitored and could and would have been halted if necessary.

<P>

 The Department does not set targets for malicious fires, but we take very seriously the threat that arson poses to some schools. If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.
<P>

<a name="30618w24.html_para0">To help schools manage fire safety, The Department published Managing School Facilities Guide 6, Fire Safety, in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risks of both accidental and malicious fires occurring, and advises on how to identify hazards and carry out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.

 On 15 May, my right hon.

This is to be for this year only and must be a decision taken by the school with the agreement of the local education authority only where there is a clear case that failing to do so would lead to excessive instability within the school.

<a name="30618w24.html_para2">On 16 May, my Department made detailed guidance available to schools and to local education authorities, to enable them immediately to discuss locally where thus capital flexibility can be used. My Department is not included in these discussions, but we expect later this summer to ask all authorities of the extent to which this flexibility has been used.

<a name="30618w24.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list each site for which his Department has considered a city academy, indicating for each <i>(a)</i> the LEA, <i>(b)</i> the names of private sector partners, <i>(c)</i> what dates have been agreed for an opening date, <i>(d)</i> the expected number of pupils, and their age range, <i>(e)</i> the contribution to capital costs from the public purse and <i>(f)</i> the estimated revenue funding per project.  [119580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]:</i> The table sets out the information available. Academy projects receive modest funding to develop proposals to a point where we are satisfied that the plans are viable and a funding agreement can be signed. From this point, projects receive additional funding to implement their proposals and prepare for opening.
<P>

<a name="30618w24.html_para3">Once open, Academies receive an operational budget to cover their day-to-day running costs, which is comparable to the level of funding for similar maintained schools within their local authority areas. The level of capital funding is intended to ensure that Academies are built and equipped to a standard comparable with the best in the maintained sector.

We intend to develop a 'Leading Practice' programme with common national criteria and branding. It will be focussed on identifying outstanding work in particular areas, within schools that are performing well across the board. The LEA will have a role in working with 'leading practice' schools to ensure they contribute to local networking arrangements so that excellent practice is spread widely.

 Understanding the origins and implications of the diverse ethnic, cultural, national, regional and religious identities in the United Kingdom is an important part of Citizenship education. Citizenship education is part of the Personal, Social and Health Education framework for primary schools and became part of the statutory National Curriculum for 11&#150;16 year olds in September 2002. Pupils are taught from an early age to respect the differences between people, to appreciate other's feelings and points of view, to recognise the effects of stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination of any kind and to develop the skills to challenge them assertively. Guidance from QCA on how to deliver these aspects of the National curriculum was sent to all schools in 2002.

 The Aimhigher programme supports a wide range of activity involving collaborative working between schools, colleges and higher education institutions in order to increase the educational attainment and aspirations of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Activities can include university tasters such as summer schools, mentoring, support for teachers, master classes and many more. Much of the activity is aimed at getting year 11 pupils to stay on in education and get better grades so that they can aim higher. The Aimhigher publicity campaign provides clearer information and better marketing of the route to HE for young people with a particular focus on reaching families and communities who do not have a tradition of entering HE, raising expectations of students and teachers alike. Any university wishing to introduce higher fees from 2006 must first have an access agreement, approved by the Office for Fair Access, and outreach with schools and colleges will be one of the essential elements of such an agreement.

 The Government are committed to widening participation in Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE). In FE, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a clear remit to raise and widen participation in education and training. The LSC's "Successful Participation for All: Widening Adult Participation Strategy" was launched for consultation in February of this year. The LSC will publish its resultant Widening Participation Strategy in the autumn. This is likely to consider widening participation targets, funding and prospects for future growth in FE and training.

 While nanotechnology is not specified in the statutory National Curriculum, there is potential in the National Curriculum for science teachers to explore some of the scientific aspects of nanotechnology with their students.

The QCA are currently consulting on changes to the programme of study for science Key Stage 4, following their recent review. The new science GCSE, Science in 21st Century, which is being piloted from September 2003 includes emphasis on students' understanding of the ethical issues surrounding potential applications of controversial new scientific technologies. The Applied Science GCSE, introduced in September 2002, provides an opportunity for young people to study for a science qualification which focuses on vocationally-related aspects of science.

<a name="30618w27.html_para3">The government's position remains that the terms and conditions of employment of school support staff are best determined locally, in light of local needs and circumstances. The National Agreement will improve training and career progression opportunities for support staff and makes clear that we expect their pay to reflect their level of training, skills and responsibilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of PPP contracts for educational provision in England in the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement.  [115949]<P>

<P>
<a name="30618w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Contracts with private sector providers for education provision are for the most part the responsibility of local education authorities, who assess their effectiveness as part of the contract management process. Ofsted has in the past 12 months inspected seven authorities which had contracted out significant education functions at the time of the inspection, or previously had entered into short-term management support contracts as part of an intervention solution. In all cases, performance had improved by at least one grade since the previous inspection. The recently published Indepen/Bannock Consulting Evaluation of new ways of working in LEAs studied three cases where education provision or senior management had been contracted out. In all three cases, they concluded that the arrangements were organisationally robust, had already or promised well to improve performance, represented value for money, and were likely to be sustainable and replicable.
<P>

<a name="30618w27.html_para4">PPP contracts have also been used for three schools in Surrey. These are the responsibility of Surrey Education Authority who let the contracts and it is for the LEA to assess the effectiveness of the contracts.

<a name="30618w29.html_para0">As part of the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC), schools are required to record ethnicity data to reflect the main categories used in the 2001 National Population Census. Children of Somali ethnic origin are recorded under the category of "Black African". In 2002, the Department carried out a consultation exercise with Local Education Authorities (LEAs) on a "key list" of extended ethnicity categories that included a separate "Somali" category. In 2003, for local reporting and monitoring purposes, LEAs were given the option of using the extended categories in their schools if they felt that the main categories did not meet their local management needs. However, not all LEAs chose to use extended categories and LEAs are required only to report to the DfES using the national categories. The Department does not therefore hold complete data for the extended ethnic background categories.

<a name="30618w30.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills has reviewed the system of tuition fees as part of a wider assessment of the higher education sector. The White Paper "The Future of Higher Education" (Cm 5735) which was published in January 2003 sets out our proposals to allow higher education institutions to charge variable fees, between &#163;0 and &#163;3000 per year per course from 2006/07. We will also abolish up front fees, so that students can defer paying their fees until after they graduate. We will continue to provide a means-tested grant to cover the standard tuition fee (&#163;1,100 in 2002/03), as part of a wider package of measures to encourage students from families on low incomes to enter higher education. We have no further plans for review of the system of tuition fees.

<a name="30618w30.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]:</i> We have been advised by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) that no students were wrongly informed that they had lost their place at the university of their choice. 18,000 prospective students were informed by UCAS in May that it had not received from them the necessary confirmations of acceptance of offers from institutions, and that a further 10 days were available for that process to be completed. The latest data available to UCAS indicates that the number of unconfirmed offers is now lower than at the corresponding point last year.

 Figures for the number of students who enter higher education are not collated centrally by constituency. The latest available information, showing the proportion of 18-year-olds from Shropshire Local Education Authority (LEA) entering full-time undergraduate courses in the UK via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="30618w30.html_para0">It should be noted that the proportions in the table are based only on the number of 18-year-olds entering full-time HE. This is a different definition to the Department's main measures of HE participation: the Age Participation Index (API), which measures the proportion of UK domiciled students who enter full-time HE by the age of 20, and the Initial Entry Rate (IER) which measures the proportion of 17&#150;30-year-old English domiciled first time entrants to full or part-time HE. Neither the API nor the IER are calculated for each LEA, because of the lack of detailed data at local authority level.

<P>
<a name="30618w33.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what types of wood and other biomass material are classified as renewable for the purposes of the renewable obligation certificates available for industry; and whether this includes <i>(a)</i> material grown specifically for a renewable energy programme and <i>(b)</i> wood which is produced for other purposes.  [119183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30618w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 All types of wood and other biodegradable material are renewable as the term is used in the Utilities Act and the Renewables Obligation Order (RO).
<P>

<a name="30618w33.html_para0">Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) may be issued only for the biodegradable fraction of the fuel supply, and only where the conditions of the Renewable Obligation Order concerning the fuel supply and technology used are met. Where the feedstock is at least 98 per cent. biodegradable, there is eligibility for ROCs regardless of the energy conversion technology used. 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jun 2003 : Column 332W</I><P>
Where the feedstock is mixed waste, there is eligibility only in the case of advanced energy conversion technologies.
<P>

<a name="30618w33.html_para1">In the case of stations fired by both a fossil-derived fuel and biomass (known as co-firing), waste which is purely biomass is eligible under the Renewables Obligation until 31 March 2011, but from 1 April 2006, at least 75 per cent. of the biomass must be from energy crops as defined in the Renewables Obligation Order, that is "a plant crop planted after 1 January 1990 primarily for the purpose of being used as a fuel".
<P>

<a name="30618w33.html_para2">A technical review of the Renewables Obligation, including the co-firing provisions, is under way. This will be followed by a Statutory Consultation, beginning later in the summer.

<a name="30618w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 First tier local authorities are required under the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001 (REPPIR), to prepare and exercise the emergency plans which would be activated in the event of an emergency with off-site consequences at a civil nuclear site. This would include an emergency which might result from a terrorist incident. In the preparation of these plans, first tier local authorities are required to consult interested parties or agencies, which could include elected councillors at county, borough and parish level. They are also required to consult on any proposed changes or reviews, and we would expect them to continue to share their plans
