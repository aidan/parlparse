<i> [holding answer 21 May 2007]:</i> It is not MOD policy to publish details of the readiness states of individual Royal Navy vessels or types (we have made exceptions for the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible and those ships entering refit, as detailed in my letter of 6 March 2007); nor would we be prepared to divulge the readiness profile of the fleet as a whole, or comment on individual changes. Such information could enable deductions to be made about the condition and preparedness of units and of the Navy, and would therefore be prejudicial to the safety of individual units and to national security.</p>

 Too often, children who stay in care long-term are affected by numerous changes of carer, which impacts on their security and wellbeing, their ability to make and maintain friendships, and their schooling, which is often disrupted as a result. The Department appointed a small team of independent consultants&#151;all former senior managers in social services&#151;to work with 34 local authorities who had a significant contribution to make to the department's PSA target on improving stability for children in long term care. Each local authority received five days&#146; free consultancy to help them develop their own action plans to improve stability. Each authority is also being encouraged to share their learning with others in the same region, and materials are being developed to facilitate this. Telephone consultancy was also offered to 50 more local authorities, if they wished to accept it. The work ended in March this year, and it is therefore too soon to identify the impact it has had on performance.</p>

 We do not provide guidance to local authorities on &#145;topslicing&#146; nursery education funding. Funding for the free entitlement to early education for three and four-year-olds is provided to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant (DSG), alongside funding for all pre-16 learning. Local authorities&#151;in consultation with their school forums&#151;are responsible for deciding how best to apply their total school and early years funding across all age groups and between different types of provider, based on an assessment of local circumstances.</p>

As part of our consideration of these options and to assess their impact, the Department is developing a more comprehensive evidence base of current practice around the country. We asked all authorities to complete a questionnaire, by 18 May 2007, setting out how they allocate and distribute free entitlement funding to maintained schools and to private, voluntary and independent (PVI) providers. We are also working with authorities to produce estimates of the level of funding allocated to early years in each local authority and its distribution between the PVI and maintained sectors in 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>

 DFID has funded a number of studies into how private sector participation might support poor people and help them access basic services all of which draw on extensive external research. These include the study by WELL, the network of resource centres at Loughborough university, into private sector participation and its impact in improving affordable access to water and sanitation for the poor in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="70524w0008.htm_para18"><a name="07052497001130">The track record of the private sector delivering water in developing countries has been mixed&#151;and it is important that lessons are learnt along the way. In Cochabamba, Bolivia, the failure of private sector water provision led to rioting and the cancellation of the contract with the private provider. In Mozambique, on the other hand, reforms which began in 1994 have ushered in a new era with the introduction of private sector management, cost recovery tariffs and better regulation. A new public-private partnership, whereby assets remain state owned but operations are privately managed, has helped about 70 per cent. of the urban population of Mozambique benefit from better water supply and improved sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="70524w0008.htm_para19"><a name="07052497001131">In Senegal, private sector involvement since 1995 has helped about 1.6 million people living in Dakar and secondary cities to gain access to safe water. An innovative public-private partnership has helped make over 140,000 new connections for poor families at subsidized rates, and household water connections reached 76 per cent. of the population by 2006. Senegal&#146;s level of connection to urban water services is now the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Sanitation also improved in urban areas, with 830,000 people getting access to sewerage connections or new toilets and latrines. Our conclusion is to support what works&#151;and what works vary from country to country and region to region.</p>

After piloting a desalination plant, South East Water has decided not to pursue desalination yet as a solution for delivering extra water at peak times.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate he has made of the extent of the reduction in <i> (a)</i> UK and <i> (b)</i> EU emissions which will result from the first phase of the European Union&#146;s Emissions Trading Scheme. [137524]</p>

<p><a name="st_171"><a name="07052497001278"><a name="70524w0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="07052497002287"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 The approved UK National Allocation Plan (NAP) for Phase I (2005-07) of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is set to deliver carbon dioxide emissions savings of around 65 million tonnes (roughly 8 per cent.) below the projected business-as-usual emissions of the installations covered by the scheme during phase I. The rationale behind emission trading is to ensure that the emission reductions take place where the cost of the reduction is lowest thus lowering the overall costs of tackling climate change. The aforementioned emission reductions referred to may not, therefore, all take place in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="70524w0010.htm_para5"><a name="07052497001279">As phase I has not yet finished, it is difficult to quantify what the overall emission reductions will be across the EU. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others has suggested that emission reductions (abatement) across the EU resulting from the implementation of EU ETS in 2005 could be somewhere in the region of 50MtCO2 to 200MtCO2. A survey by Point Carbon showed that about two-thirds of the 800 or so EU ETS participants who responded stated they had initiated internal abatement projects as a result of the EU ETS. Another survey for the European Commission conducted by McKinsey and Ecofys also found that the EU ETS is impacting on corporate behaviour. Based on this scheme, CO2 involves a real cost. About half the companies already &#145;price in&#146; the value of CO2 allowances and over 70 per cent. intend to do so in the future.</p>

 DEFRA does not collect this information. In 2006, the Environment Agency monitored 10,258 sewage discharges to receiving waters in England and Wales. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), ammonia, suspended solids and pH were monitored routinely, along with other parameters presenting a risk to the environment.</p>

 No. In their 25-year water resource management plans, water companies are expected to follow the twin-track approach of considering the need for new resources, such as reservoirs, in parallel with the full range of options for reducing demand. New resources should be developed only where the scope for managing demand is clearly insufficient or unjustified in terms of cost.</p>

 The data in the following table is taken from the e-Digest of Environmental Statistics, published on the Department's website, and shows an average for the whole year of estimated abstractions expressed in daily amounts (mega litres per day). The data originates from the Environment Agency. Estimated actual abstractions differ from the maximum abstraction permissible under the terms of individual abstraction licences. The level of future abstractions will depend on the extent to which abstractors use their licensed capacity together with that abstracted under new licences granted.</p>

 The Government support a number of initiatives to promote water efficiency in the domestic and commercial sectors. The Water Industry Act 1991 mandates water companies in England and Wales to promote the efficient use of water to their customers. This can include the distribution of free water saving devices, free or subsidised supply pipe leak detection and repair, and free home or business water saving audits. The Water Services Regulation Authority (publicly known as Ofwat) monitors each company's actions annually and expects water companies to take a more active approach when supplies are under pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="70524w0012.htm_para0"><a name="07052497001536">Other measures include the establishment of the Water Saving Group, which I chair, including representatives from a range of stakeholder groups. The group aims to encourage the efficient use of water in households and contribute to demand management in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="70524w0012.htm_para1"><a name="07052497001537">To address water efficiency in new housing, Communities and Local Government (CLG) have introduced a code for sustainable homes (CSH). This sets out performance levels and standards, including minimum performance levels for water use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70524w0012.htm_para2"><a name="07052497001538">In addition, DEFRA and CLG have recently consulted on regulatory options for minimum standards of water efficiency in new homes and commercial buildings. Responses to the consultation will be published in due course. CLG are also reviewing the sustainability of the existing building stock, including water use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="70524w0012.htm_para3"><a name="07052497001539">The Government also support a number of programmes to further sustainable water use by businesses. These include Envirowise and the enhanced capital allowance scheme for water efficient technologies.</p>

The Secretary of State, Ofwat and the Environment Agency are statutory consultees, and will be able comment on the measures water companies are taking in respect of security of supply, including the transfer of water between companies&#146; resource zones.

They concluded that based on the information and evidence available, and while there is the possibility of some short-term subjective effects if the duration of exposure is prolonged, there would appear to be little likelihood of persons exposed to vhf/ultrasound from this device suffering long-term ill health.</p>

 The return of radioactively contaminated metals exported from decommissioning facilities at BNG Sellafield to Studsvik Sweden must meet the requirements of regulators both in the UK and Sweden. Following treatment by smelting in Sweden, the metal is recycled through the Swedish metals industry. This might require the metal to be held at Studsvik Sweden for a period of &#145;decay&#146; storage in order to achieve the recycling concentration criteria established by the Swedish environmental regulator and the European Commission. If the concentration of radioactivity in the metal is too high to achieve the recycling criteria within 10 years of &#145;decay&#146; storage it will be returned to the UK for storage or disposal. If repatriation is required it will usually occur within two years of the smelting process. Radioactive waste materials separated out in the smelting process (for example in the slag) are separated and returned to the UK consignor for disposal, together with any other radioactive wastes produced.</p>

 In the course of the public consultation on proposed changes to the Highway Code in 2006, DSA received a total of 2,612 comments on rule 58 in the consultation text (the equivalent of rule 47 in the current edition of the Highway Code and rule 61 in the proposed draft code laid in Parliament on 28 March 2007). 32 of these comments were from cycling organisations, 29 from other organisations, 10 from MPs and 2,541 from individuals who may or may not be cyclists. A summary of consultation responses, including those on cycling issues, was placed in the Libraries of both Houses when the proposed revised code was laid before Parliament on 28 March 2007.

The Department has registered the demand for local discounts expressed through the consultation exercise on the proposals set out in our document &#147;Proposed Changes to Charges at The Dartford - Thurrock River Crossing&#148;.

 The Department for Transport and its agencies maintain the policy that traffic violations such as parking tickets and speeding fines remain the responsibility of the individual, and are not reimbursed from public resources. The one exception to this is the Government Car and Despatch Agency which pays parking tickets when they arise operationally in circumstances where overriding security requirements necessarily dictate the choice of parking location. The GCDA are the Government's own services for moving people and documents safely and reliably throughout the UK. The amount paid by the GCDA in 2006 was &#163;11,165.</p>

 The Highways Agency's national telecommunications network has reached the end of its useful life, is costly to maintain, needs modernising and has insufficient capacity to meet its future known requirements. The National Roads Telecommunications Project (NRTS) has been developed to remedy this.</p>

The 32 networks have been built over the last thirty years to the Agency's bespoke designs. The NRTS project is to upgrade those existing transmission networks and to combine them into one. As well as providing additional capacity, the new digital network provides resilience: using internet technology, messages will automatically re-route following any break in the network. The new technology is freely available in the market-place, making it easier to maintain.</p>

 On 6 July 2006 the Secretary of State confirmed 16 major road and public transport schemes in the north-east that we expected to fund from regional funding allocations (RFA) between 2006-07 and 2008-09. Three of them are located in the Tees Valley.</p>

Elements of the Tees Valley bus network scheme are located in Hartlepool. Funding will, of course, be subject to schemes securing all necessary statutory powers, demonstrating sufficient value for money, and being supported by a satisfactory business case.</p>

The north-east authorities were awarded a total of &#163;141.382 million to fund capital improvements. The proportion allocated to the Tees Valley authorities is &#163;32.079 million, including &#163;4.459 million to Hartlepool borough council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="70524w0025.htm_para5"><a name="0705258001795">In addition, the Government are supporting both Durham county council (&#163;400,000) and the Tyne and Wear authorities (&#163;1.7 million) with pump-priming funding to support the development of Transport Innovation Fund (TIP) packages that address local congestion problems by combining demand management, including road pricing, with better public transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="70524w0025.htm_para6"><a name="0705258001796">Also, the Department has regular discussions with the Highways Agency about all proposed improvement schemes for the A1 in the north-east and the Secretary of State has recently agreed that they should continue the development work on the A1 Newcastle/Gateshead western bypass scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="70524w0025.htm_para7"><a name="0705258001797">All of the transport initiatives are being developed with a view to delivering the Government&#146;s shared agenda of tackling congestion, delivering improved accessibility, providing safer roads and better air quality, as well as tackling other quality of life issues. Together, these objectives would contribute to facilitating economic growth, reducing environmental damage and widening access to services and opportunities to the population.</p>

 As preparation for its move towards Trading Fund status, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services carried out a rigorous analysis of its business and competitive environment, to identify its strengths and weaknesses and the opportunities and threats it faces as it becomes a commercially-focused organisation.

Very few languages attain this level and productivity is likely to fall below 30 per cent. in most languages with the move to group classes and more in-country training;</p>
</ul><a name="70524w0026.htm_brev3"><a name="07052526002982"><ul><p class="tabletext">a flexible hours and agency model operating on a &#147;pay per use&#148; basis achieves good productivity rates. Most external providers employ this model because of the fluctuations in demand;</p>

 Mr. Maharaj has a part-hearing scheduled today before the aides to the Florida Clemency Board. A second part of the hearing will be heard in August when Mr. Maharaj&#146;s lawyer will put forward his case. An official from our consulate in Orlando will be attending that later hearing. Consular officials only attend court hearings in exceptional circumstances such as these. I have written to the Governor of Florida in support of Mr. Maharaj&#146;s clemency plea.</p>

 It is for primary care trusts to assess locally the level of need and demand for national health services primary dental care. The most recent estimate undertaken by the Department suggested that, in any given two-year period, it is likely that some 60 per cent. or so of the population will seek to access NHS dental services. This estimate took into account levels of patient registrations in the early 1990s, when adult registrations lasted for two years and when there were no significant reported difficulties of access to services. The most recent data show that around 56 per cent. of the population accessed NHS dental services in the two-year period ending December 2006, the same proportion as in the two-year period ending March 2006.</p>

 The Department will be publishing a report later in the summer, assessing the first 12 months of the new arrangements for local commissioning of dental services and the new contractual arrangements. The most recent data show that the proportion of the population accessing national health service dental services in the two-year period ending December 2006 is the same as in the two-year period immediately preceding the reforms. This suggests that access has remained broadly stable during the transition to the new arrangements. The evidence also so far indicates that the NHS is commissioning a steadily increasing volume of NHS dental services.</p>

<i> [holding answer</i><i> s </i><i> 23 May 2007]:</i> Data collected by the Department centrally does not identify the value of units of dental activity (UDAs) or provide a basis for comparisons of UDA values between primary care trusts (PCTs) or dental practices. PCTs set contract values and service level requirements locally. UDA values will vary because of a number of factors, including differences in treatment patterns and treatment needs in different areas, the contract values negotiated locally by PCTs and dental practices, and the degree to which PCTs and practices may have agreed service outputs that cannot be measured through patient courses of treatment.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 May 2007]:</i> To ensure service is maintained at the beginning of August and patient care is not compromised, strategic health authorities are working with trusts and NHS employers are working with the Department to plan now for managing the transition in the period after 1 August. These plans include advertising locum posts on NHS jobs to fill training posts and using extensions to contracts or service posts.</p>

Arrangements for 2007 will reflect current practice as most doctors at the level equivalent to the senior house officer grade will start in the first week of August, while doctors at the equivalent of the specialist registrar grade will have staggered start dates. From August 2007, the European Working Time Directive requires doctors in training to be working a maximum 56 hour week (averaged over the six month reference period). Doctors in training typically work a 56 hour week already, consistent with their new deal contracts.</p>

 Under the Mental Health Act, the decision to offer treatment of a patient presenting with a personality disorder(s) (PD) it is a matter of individual clinical judgement. Until very recently appropriate and evidence based interventions for PD have been very limited and their availability nationally inequitable. The prevalence of PD in the general adult population is between 10 to 13 per cent. and upward of 63 per cent. in the offender population. It is therefore a reasonable assumption that over the years since 1984, when the legislation came into force, that thousands of individual mainstream and forensic patients will not have gained access to appropriate treatments for their PD.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 May 2007]:</i> VAT is already payable on most elements of the Home Information Pack (HIP) in the current buying and selling process. The only new element of the pack is the Energy Performance Certificate which is required as a consequence of European legislation. The Energy Savings Trust has established that Energy Performance Certificates could save homeowners around &#163;300 a year on their fuel bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_585"><a name="70524w0039.htm_para1"><a name="07052526002759">Any additional costs imposed are expected to be broadly offset by savings, including savings made as a result of reductions both in the number of failed transactions and the amount wasted each time a transaction fails.

 Given that a number of estate agents are running promotional campaigns to get sellers to list properties early, it would be no surprise if the number of properties marketed for sale in advance of home information packs were affected. However, short term fluctuations in the volume of new listings are already a common feature of the housing market.

 The Home Information Pack regulations provide that the pack must include a copy of the lease where a leasehold property is marketed for sale. The lease will usually include a description of the property and a plan of its layout. The regulations provide that the lease can be an official copy of the lease obtained from the Land Registry, the original lease or an edited version of the lease if it is only available in that form. Where a potential buyer asks for a copy of the lease, this can be provided without breaching copyright law. As would be the case currently, sellers who wish to provide copies of other information that is subject to copyright restrictions should seek permission to reproduce the material.</p>

 The Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) only came in force on 3 April 2006 so the Department has not yet collected data on its use from local authorities. The Department will be collecting information on housing assessments through the Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix (HSSA) and the Business Plan Statistical Appendix (BPSA) returned by local authorities which will provide data as at April 2007. It is usual for the Department to publish the HSSA and BPSA at the end of the year subject to the data quality.</p>

 Definition and Guidance published by the Department in June 2006 states that the first of the four criteria a decent home must meet is that it meets the current statutory minimum standard for housing.

<i> [holding answer 23 May 2007]:</i> The need to achieve a 2 star rating from the Housing Inspectorate in order to qualify for decent homes funding applies only to arms length management organisations (ALMOs) set up by local authorities that are seeking additional government resources to bring their housing stock up to the decent homes standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="70524w0040.htm_para9"><a name="07052526002830">57 ALMOs have been set up since 2002 under the first five ALMO bidding rounds. 56 of these have now been inspected. 46 have achieved at least the necessary 2 star rating to qualify for funding. Eight have been awarded 0 or 1 star ratings and are preparing for or awaiting the results of re-inspection. Two have recently had initial inspections and are awaiting the results. The following table lists the local authorities involved, and funding provided.</p>
