 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Transport if he will set out with statistical evidence relating as closely as possible to the Croydon Central constituency, the effects of his Department's policies on that constituency since 2005. [325822]</p>

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="10040752000038"><a name="100407w0001.htm_spnew0"><a name="10040752000680"><b>Mr. Khan:</b>
 The Department for Transport does not routinely hold transport statistics on a parliamentary constituency basis. However, the Department provides Transport for London (TfL) with a block grant to fund transport delivery in London. This grant has more than doubled in the last nine years, rising to some £3.3 billion in 2010-11. Drawing on these and other resources, the Mayor is responsible for publishing and, through TfL, implementing a Transport Strategy for London, while the boroughs are required to publish local implementation plans which set out how they will contribute to the Mayor's strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="100407w0001.htm_para0"><a name="10040752000039">Bus services in London have improved. 2,247 million passenger journeys were made in 2008-09 and patronage grew by grew by 40 per cent. between 2000-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="100407w0001.htm_para2"><a name="10040752000041">South London rail routes serving Croydon have also improved. Southern have delivered a new fleet of trains, some of which operate on South London services, and the remaining rolling stock has been refurbished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="100407w0001.htm_para3"><a name="10040752000042">TfL took over operational control of Croydon Tramlink in June 2008. Approximately 27.2 million passenger journeys were made on Croydon Tramlink in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="100407w0001.htm_para4"><a name="10040752000043">On the roads, national targets to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent. and reduce the number of "slight" casualties by 10 per cent. (compared to the period 1994-98) by 2010 were largely exceeded by TfL by 2004, leading to TfL setting themselves new targets of 50 per cent and 25 per cent. respectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="100407w0001.htm_para5"><a name="10040752000044">Various improvements in relation to cycling have also been realised across London. TfL report that cycling now accounts for 2 per cent. of trips in London compared to 1.2 per cent in 2000, and London is the only major city in the world to have achieved a modal shift away from the car. From 2000-2009 the mode share of private motorised transport has fallen by around 6 per cent, levels of cycling have almost doubled and public transport use has risen dramatically. On an average weekday over one million people enter Central London on public transport during the morning peak.</p>

 The principles concerning separate rateability where there is 'exclusive occupation' and 'paramount control' are long established and predate the ports review as well as the end of prescribed rating. The lead case on this subject is a House of Lords decision which dates back to 1936-Westminster Council <i> v.</i> Southern Railway Company and W.H. Smith and Son. There was, therefore no 'implementation' of a new separate ratings policy either after or before 1999. In other words, any property, other than a statutory port authority, that met the separate assessment criteria, even before 1999, should have been rated separately.</p>

 At the time of considering the investment for video conferencing and telepresence facilities for the ex-DIUS Department, a cost benefit analysis was carried out which assessed potential benefits through the reduced need for travel between London and Sheffield, the then Department's two main staff locations. This estimated reduced travel for staff members to (up to) four meetings per day, is equivalent to savings of £440,000 per annum when the facilities are fully utilised. The impact on the carbon dioxide emissions directly related to this reduced travel, compared with the use of video conferencing and telepresence, was not directly factored into the original estimates.</p>

 The Government regret that, despite the support provided through the HMRC Time To Pay scheme, Jarvis Plc was unable to continue to trade. There are two principal parts of the business, the rail businesses and the Facilities Management services for PFI contracts.

This support is to help those made redundant back into the workforce, including facilitating contacts with other employers in the Rail Industry, to ensure that, where possible, their valuable skills are retained.

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="100407w0015.htm_para14"><a name="10040759000625">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which for winter 2009-10 is worth £250 for households with someone aged between 60-79 and £400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than £60 million per year was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-we now spend around £2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In winter 2008-09 (the last winter for which information is available) 19,360 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Croydon, Central.</p>

2. During the next Parliament, we will re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.<br>

<i> Definitions</i><br>
<i> Anti-psychotic drugs</i><br>
Defined as those recorded in paragraphs 4.2.1 (antipsychotic drugs) and 4.2.2 (antipsychotic depot injections) of the BNF. The number of items is given for the two paragraphs combined.<br>
<i> ePrescribing Analysis and CosT (ePACT) data</i><br>
This information was obtained from the ePACT system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the United Kingdom. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals or clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals, dental prescribing and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some BNF sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, "Central Nervous System" has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community-these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br>
<i> Prescription Items</i><br>
 Prescriptions are written on a prescription form known as an FP10. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>
<i> BNF Classifications</i><br>
The Prescription Cost Analysis system uses the therapeutic classifications defined in BNF. No information on why a drug is prescribed is available and since drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition it is impossible to separate the different conditions that a drug was prescribed for.<br>

 Funding for prosthetic and orthotic care and services is provided within the NHS budget and allocated through local determination by individual primary care trusts (PCTs). The current operating framework for the national health service requires commissioners to take account of military personnel, their families and veterans when commissioning services in their area. It is for PCTs in partnership with local stakeholders, including practice based commissioners, local government and the public to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including the provision of prosthetic services for former service personnel.</p>

This is reflected in the data. It remains a high Government priority, as set out in "Investing for the future, protecting the front line: school funding 2011-13" (published on 15 March 2010), to ensure that additional funds go towards children who need extra support to reach their potential, so that the gap between the attainment of disadvantaged children and the rest continues to narrow. Further, many local authorities choose to give additional funding to schools based on low attainment or low prior attainment.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families which schools in Torbay constituency received less funding for sixth form places in their final yearly allocations for 2009-10 than was indicated in their provisional funding figures. [312859]</p>

<p><a name="st_356"><a name="10040765000565"><a name="100407w0022.htm_spnew12"><a name="10040765000774"><b>Mr. Iain Wright:</b>
 All schools (and, indeed, all other providers) have been funded in their 2009/10 allocations to at least the level of recruitment indicated in their provisional funding figures, as discussed with the LSC in early March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_631"><a name="100407w0022.htm_para8"><a name="10040765000566">On 31 March last year, the Department made an interim allocation consistent with the budget set out in the LSC's annual statement of priorities in November 2008. Providers were therefore notified of a minimum working budget by the 31 March 2009 with which to plan for the forthcoming academic year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_632"><a name="100407w0022.htm_para9"><a name="10040765000567">These allocation figures differed from the provisional funding figures that providers had discussed with the LSC at the beginning of March, which were meant to be indicative of the likely level of demand coming through from young people. It was clear that this was well above the budget published the previous November. However, discussions were ongoing across Government at that time on what extra financial support was needed to provide for the increased learner demand providers indicated they could deliver. This additional funding was found and announced in Budget 2009, which provided for a further 54,500 learners in 2009/10 than planned. All providers were notified of their revised allocation, to at least the level of recruitment indicated in their provisional funding figures, as soon as was possible following Budget 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="100407w0022.htm_para10"><a name="10040765000568">The following tables set out the funding and learner allocations for the sixth forms in the Torbay constituency. All the sixth forms learner allocations matched the provisional allocations and all the funding allocations increased from the 31 March 2009 allocations post Budget 2009. Four of the sixth forms saw increases on their provisional allocation in their final funding allocations. Two schools<sup>(1)</sup> did however see slight reductions from their provisional allocations, on account of the necessary changed approach in the application of transitional protection between the two allocation notices. The reductions were 1.5 per cent. and 0.4 per cent. of their provisional allocation. This was to avoid volatility in the data between years producing significantly different out turns in funding levels.</p>

 Young people's substance misuse is markedly different to that of adults, and so is the combination of treatment and support they receive. Addiction to Class A drugs among young people is rare, and although substitute prescribing for heroin dependency does occur, this represents only 1 per cent. of under-18s in drug treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="100407w0023.htm_para2"><a name="10040765000697">Instead, interventions for young people tend to centre on psychosocial counselling-based therapies, which attempt to address the underlying causes and the behavioural consequences of the young person's drug and alcohol misuse. Most young people's substance misuse problems are with alcohol and cannabis, but these psychosocial therapies are also used with young people who misuse crack and cocaine.</p>
