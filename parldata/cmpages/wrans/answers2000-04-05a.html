To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will take steps to ban investment in Burma by United Kingdom-owned companies; and if he will make a statement.  [117508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We do not encourage trade with our investment in Burma and tell business enquirers so; we have also suspended all financial support for trade mission to Burma and for trade promotional activities there as was made plain in June 1997.

 We take every opportunity at bilateral meetings to stress the need for a political settlement to end the conflict in Sri Lanka. We have made it clear that we stand ready to help if both sides ask us to play a role. We welcome the Norwegian Government's efforts to bring the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam together for peace talks.

<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans he has to involve non-Governmental organisations in consultation as part of the preparation of the Government's position for the Social Summit in Geneva in June.  [117326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has provided &#163;25,000 to help the United Nations Environment and Development UK Committee (UNED-UK) co-ordinate UK civil society's input to the Special Session. We have financed an internet website, the creation of a key stakeholders' group, and a conference for non- governmental organisations. The Department for International Development has provided &#163;270,000 for the International Council for Social Welfare to help it enhance the role of civil society groups worldwide (and especially those from developing countries) at the Special Session.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs which department is the lead department for preparing for the Social Summit in Geneva in June; and which other departments are involved in the preparation.  [117325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the lead Department for preparations for the General Assembly Special Session on follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development. All other Whitehall Departments with responsibility for social development issues, both nationally and internationally, are fully involved in the preparatory process.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs who will represent Her Majesty's Government at the United Nations Social Summit in Geneva in June.  [117324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The full composition of the UK delegation is still being considered. The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities, has plans to attend for some of the discussions.

<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the progress of recent negotiations between Israel and Syria.  [117598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The meeting between President Clinton and President Asad in Geneva on 26 March was a demonstration of the efforts being undertaken to achieve the resumption of negotiations between Israel and Syria and progress towards agreement. The Government support these efforts and believe that a settlement remains possible. Time is, however, short. The Government will spare no effort, in co-operation with the United States and our European partners, to help the parties reach agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what effect the creation of the St. Helena Business Forum has had on unemployment levels.  [117797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The St. Helena Business Forum was formed in 1997 at the instigation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1998 it became the St. Helena Focus Group and is now run by the private sector. It is a voluntary organisation that was established to promote St. Helena to the private sector in the UK. One of its members has been appointed as a part-time Commercial Representative to the St. Helena Government. The Commercial Representative and Focus Group have greatly improved the service to potential inward investors and have taken a proactive role in inward investment promotion activities. In 1997 unemployment was 20 per cent., at the end of 1999 it was 15 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans has he to develop employment opportunities on St. Helena in non-governmental areas.  [117799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The St. Helena Government in its Strategic Review 2000-2010 and Country Policy Plan 2000-01, 2002-03 clearly sets out its commitment to promote employment opportunities. These include increasing contracting out of government services; the promotion of tourism and inward investment; and increased export promotion. Many of these activities are undertaken in conjunction with the St. Helena Development Agency (SHDA) which has been instrumental in creating or sustaining well over 120 jobs in 1998 in the private sector. The Department for International Development has funded a &#163;1.386 million project to provide working capital for the SHDA. The SHDA provides grants and loans particularly for small and medium-scale enterprises as well as training and advice.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn11"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many St. Helenians are serving in the Armed Forces; and what percentage of the population that represents.  [117801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Thirty six St. Helenians have joined the UK Armed Forces since November 1997 which represents roughly 0.72 per cent. of the population. Several have returned to St. Helena since recruitment because they have either not completed basic training or for other, personal, reasons. Currently 29 are in the services.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn12"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans has he to assist St. Helena in developing the fishing industry.  [117798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Since 1996, the St. Helena Government (SHG) has been engaged in the establishment of a joint venture with Argos Ltd. On 29 February 2000 Argos Atlantic Cold Store was officially opened at Ruperts Bay in St. Helena. This increases fish freezing and cold storage capacity to 800 tonnes. Quotas placed on the local fishermen during times of high catches will now be eliminated. I understand Argos intend to take immediate steps to increase the volume of fish caught by importing bait and improving fishing expertise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_wqn13"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans he has to assist St. Helena in diversifying its economy.  [117800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The St. Helena Government set out their vision for the future and long-term development strategy in their Strategic Review 2000-10 and Country Policy Plan 2000-01 to 2002-03. This is clearly based on the need to continue to develop the island's private sector and attract inward investment. The St. Helena and British Governments agreed during this January's discussions on a new three-year aid agreement that progress towards a more sustainable economy will remain difficult until access to the island is radically improved. The outcome of the Department for International Development's proposed comparative costs study of future air access versus sea access will be relevant to future tourism development.

<a name="00405w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many persons were prosecuted for involvement in fraud over the procurement of computer equipment in the NHS in each of the last six years.  [116858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records in respect of the number of persons prosecuted for involvement in fraud over the procurement of computer equipment in the NHS in each of the last six years. The information requested could be obtained only by examining each relevant file in every CPS office, at disproportionate cost. The Serious Fraud Office has not prosecuted any persons for involvement in fraud over the procurement of computer equipment in the NHS in each of the last six years.

To ask the Solicitor-General when the report of the inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the case, R. <i>v.</i> Doran & Others, is due to be handed to the Attorney-General; and if the report will be published.  [117318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w02.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I have been informed by His Honour Gerald Butler QC that his report is close to completion, but I am not in a position to provide a specific date by which the finished report will be provided to the Attorney-General. The question of publication is a matter for the Attorney-General and the Chairman of HM Customs and Excise. As the previous Attorney- General, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Sir J. Morris) stated in his parliamentary answer of 22 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 607W, a summary of the report and its recommendations will be made available to the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w02.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I have been informed by His Honour Gerald Butler QC that the inquiry took longer than anticipated for three reasons: (1) there were delays in providing the inquiry with all the relevant 



<P>
<P><I>5 Apr 2000 : Column: 469W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w02.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) is administered by UK Sport for UK governing bodies and includes athletes from all parts of the United Kingdom. Sport England is responsible for the administration of the WCPP for English governing bodies and for the World Class Potential and World Class Start Programmes for English athletes. In addition, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland administer their own elite programmes for their national athletes below the level of World Class Performance.
<P>

<a name="00405w02.html_para0">The Sport England projected budget for 2000-01 will be submitted to its Council for approval on 3 April and is not yet available. The projected funding figures for 2000-01 for the elite programmes for Scotland and Northern Ireland are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for what reason there has been a reduction in funding of the World Class Performance Programme from 1998-99 to 1999-2000.  [115330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w02.html_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 There has been no reduction in funding of the World Class Performance Programme. The information included in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) of 22 February 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 849-51W, provided details of the funding to elite sport by each of the Sports Councils and related to expenditure for the first 10 months of 1999-2000, not to the total value of awards.
<P>

<a name="00405w02.html_para1">The expenditure figures for the financial year 1999-2000 remain incomplete since payments for March have still to be made. The expected outturn for 1999-2000 will be broadly in line with that for 1998-99. I will write to the hon. Member as soon as the full year figures are available.

 The Heritage Lottery Fund can support a wide variety of projects involving the acquisition, repair, conservation and restoration of buildings, sites and collections relating to industrial and technological history, which will include historic engineering projects. To date the Heritage Lottery Fund has committed over &#163;104 million to projects in the industrial, maritime and transport sector, and expects to continue to allocate 9 per cent. of its income annually to this area within the period of the current Strategic Plan.

<P>
<a name="00405w03.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The purpose of giving debt relief is to benefit the poor. I welcome the international agreement that this should be the main criterion for debt relief. Under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, countries will produce poverty reduction strategies which set out policies and programmes to tackle poverty. The strategy will then provide a framework for all poverty reduction resources available to the country--Government revenue, debt relief savings and international development assistance.
<P>

<a name="00405w03.html_para0">I welcome the IMF and the World bank commitments to use the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) as a basis for their programmes of support. In countries committed to poverty reduction, our bilateral country strategies will take their lead from the PRSP, and I encourage other bilateral donors to do likewise.

 The Government have received a number of representations on net metering from industry, particularly solar energy companies, environmental organisations and private individuals. Many of the issues in those representations have been debated in the House--most notably in the Standing Committee debate on Clause 30 of the Utilities Bill, held on 14 March 2000.

 The entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated. Between 1 December 1999 and 24 March 2000, 11 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and one Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL) were issued covering the export to consignees or end-users in Sri Lanka of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly known as the Military List. Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings (and OIELs may also cover a range of countries). Where this is so, the licence is included in the table in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to ensure that low-income consumers using pre-payment meters are charged the same amount for their gas and electricity as those who pay by direct debit.  [117509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Provision of a gas or electricity supply through a prepayment meter (PPM) is inherently more expensive than via a standard meter because the meter itself is more complex and because of the additional payment infrastructure that is necessary. We have, however, encouraged the regulator and the energy supply industry to bring PPM tariffs closer to the cost of standard credit, so as to reduce the burden on those PPM users who may be on a low income. As part of the new price controls on the Public Electricity suppliers, the Office of Gas and Electricity Management (Ofgem) has proposed a new licence condition limiting the maximum additional annual surcharge for a PPM to &#163;15 above the standard credit tariff. For gas, Centrica, which has about 90 per cent. of gas PPMs, has already reduced its PPM prices so that they are the same as those paid by standard credit customers who have not paid promptly enough to receive a discount for quick payment.
<P>

<a name="00405w05.html_para0">I should point out, however, that the use of PPMs should not be taken as a proxy for fuel poverty: a wide range of people use these meters because they like the control it gives them over payment. Many PPMs are in second homes or holiday lettings. About half of those reckoned to be fuel poor are pensioners; and yet less than 10 per cent. of pensioners use a PPM.

 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) published three reports on 18 February. The report of the "team inspection of the control and supervision of operations at BNFL's Sellafield site" requires BNFL to produce a programme within two months to address HSE's recommendations. Their report "into the falsification of pellet diameter data in the MOX demonstration facility (MDF) at the BNFL Sellafield site and the effect of this on the safety of MOX fuel in use" says that the MDF will remain closed until BNFL have met all 15 of HSE's recommendations. The third report, which deals with the storage of liquid high level waste at Sellafield, requires BNFL to produce within six months a strategy to reduce stocks of such waste to a buffer volume by around 2015.

 The proposal for a Directive harmonising droit de suite went to four Internal Market Councils last year but, on each occasion, a decision was delayed to provide more time to explore ways of overcoming UK concerns. Negotiations have continued this year in the Committee of Permanent Representatives where a workable compromise was finally agreed unanimously on 15 March.

 Decisions on expenditure on bus shelters are a matter for each local authority taking account of the availability of resources and the assessment of needs in their area. In developing bus strategies as part of their local transport plans, authorities will need to consider what improvements to bus infrastructure are needed, and what targets are appropriate in this regard. Local partnerships with the private sector can make an important contribution to achieving these improvements.

This is increased to 100 per cent. if the costs are incurred between 12 May 1998 and 11 May 2002 by such businesses on the conversion of minibuses and coaches for use primarily in Northern Ireland.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the basis for the revision of the figure for the expected revenue in 2000-01 from his changes to the tax and national insurance treatment of personal service companies between table 1.11 of the 1999 Budget report and table A2.1 of the 2000 Budget report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The estimate of extra revenue generated in 2000-01 from the pre-announced measure to tackle avoidance of tax and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) through the use of personal service companies is based on new, more up-to-date information which has been collected by the Inland Revenue since Budget 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w09.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what factors underlay his estimate of the fall in revenues resulting from his changes to the tax and national insurance treatment of personal services between 2001-02 and 2002-03, as shown in table A2.1 of the 2000 Budget report.  [117303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w09.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 People using personal service companies are currently able to avoid National Insurance Contributions altogether and pay tax on their income much later than an employee would pay tax through PAYE. The new legislation will ensure that affected personal service companies will pay the correct amount of tax and NICs, at the right time, rather than delaying 



<P>
<P><I>5 Apr 2000 : Column: 495W</I><P>
what they do pay until well after the end of the tax year. The large first year yield in 2000-01 arises because the payments of PAYE and NICs are scored as they accrue whereas the reduction in corporation tax occurs when it would have been paid, nine months after the end of the accounting period. Subsequently, the 2002-03 expected yield is lower than in 2001-02 because the full effect of the corporation tax reduction takes three years to build up.

In addition, the FSA plans to hold regular workshops for research contractors and other scientists to allow the exchange of new ideas and data in this area. The results of these will also be published and further comments invited.
<P>

<a name="00405w11.html_para7">Finally, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes now makes available, on its website, http//www.foodstandards.gov.uk, details of data submitted in support of applications it receives for approval of novel (including genetically modified) foods so that comments can be made on these before decisions are reached.

 As responsibility for food safety and standards matters has now passed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) which reports to Parliament through Health Ministers, I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00405w11.html_para8">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that AgrEvo (now Aventis) submitted an application, to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for voluntary approval of food and feed safety clearance of glufosinate ammonium tolerant maize in 1995. In addition, an application to market AgrEvo's T25 maize for cultivation and importation for processing into food and animal feed was received, via the Department of the Environment, under Council Directive 90/220/EEC from the French competent authority in 1996. Details of the food safety clearance are contained in the annual report for 1996 of the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes. The marketing consent under Directive 90/220/EEC was issued by France in 1998 following publication of the Commission's Decision in the "Official Journal of the European Communities" (L131, 5.5.98). This consent, which authorises the marketing of T25 maize for use in food and animal feed, was agreed by the Member States taking into account the advice of the EC Scientific Committee for Plants. The committee's remit included the consideration of any adverse effects on human health or the environment arising from the placing on the market of this maize. Copies of both documents are available in the Library.

Revised tables with the correct figures have also been placed in the Library.

 The Department uses a wide range of media to communicate with National Health Service staff, including electronic communications via the internet and NHSnet; paper communications such as newsletters, magazines and circulars; and face to face briefings such as conferences, seminars and roadshows. The National Blood Authority uses a similar range of internal media to keep its staff informed about developments both within the blood service and in the wider NHS. This includes intranet technology, written material and face to face briefings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the role of the Information Management Group in terms of advance guidance and direction in the application of information technology in the NHS.  [116856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Information Management Group (IMG) was part of the National Health Service Executive responsible for the development and maintenance of our Information Management and Technology Strategy for the NHS. Its role was to maintain and develop the strategy in consultation with the NHS, professional groups and industry, and to manage national strategic projects.
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para12">It was disbanded in April 1999 in line with the recommendations of "Information for Health" and was superseded by two bodies.
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para13">One is the NHS Information Authority, which was formally established as a special health authority in April 1999. The role of the NHS Information Authority is to manage an agreed and focused work programme to develop those products and standards which can best be developed at national level, in order to support local implementation.
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para14">The other is the Information Policy Unit, a small group within the NHS Executive with overall responsibility for delivery of the strategy. The role of the unit is to review and develop the strategy in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, and to contribute to the NHS Executive's wider policy development and management functions. Part of the IPU role is to support the National Information Partnership and the Information Policy Board, and to commission and monitor national work programmes and projects on information and IT in healthcare (in particular from the NHS Information Authority). The Policy Unit also provides advice and guidance to the NHS on strategic issues, for example guidance on local implementation strategies published as Health Service Circular 1999/200.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures have been introduced in the last three years by Her Majesty's Government to reduce <i>(a)</i> the level of bureaucratic duplication, <i>(b)</i> burdens on professional staff and <i>(c)</i> administrative difficulties in the application and use of information technology at a local level.  [116857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Our consultation on information management and technology in the National Health Service resulted in the publication of the national Information Strategy "Information for Health", which describes a number of national measures that are intended to reduce the administrative burden on NHS staff.
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para15">"Information for Health" is a national strategy for local implementation. Each health community is responsible for developing its own Local Implementation Strategy (LIS). The purpose of the LIS is to describe how each local community will develop its own information systems to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of care, including reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and administrative duplication.
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para16">The national initiatives that are intended to support LISs and local health organisations are wide ranging and include:
<P>

<a name="00405w13.html_para17"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A national procurement review has been undertaken to identify what can be done to ensure that local health organisations do not have to undergo unnecessarily burdensome bureaucratic processes when purchasing information systems.

To achieve this communities are expected to implement nationally agreed standards, and make use of national call-off contracts and supporting documentation.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The NHS Information Authority is in the process of developing, agreeing and implementing a range of national information and information technology standards that will then be implemented as part of LISs. The standards will facilitate a reduction in the number of times patient information is collected; improve the quality of communication between healthcare professionals and the quality/consistency of information available across the health service. Electronic access to this information throughout the NHS will multiply the benefits already experienced by more advanced sites locally and have a significant impact upon the administrative burden.

<a name="00405w13.html_para22"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Information for Health" is underpinned by an education, training and development strategy "Working Together with Health Information". This strategy, published in December 1999, builds upon previous work to develop NHS-wide standards for information proficiency, and will make use of virtual technologies to provide local NHS staff with the access to learning resource that they need. The initiative will ensure that the lessons learned in one health organisation are available to other organisations and thereby allow more informed decision-making about the kinds of intervention required. At the same time the approach will help prevent duplication of effort where effective solutions have been identified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> The number of Fair Employment cases waiting to be heard has remained broadly the same for a number of years. In order to improve the situation, the number of FET panel members was increased from 30 to 90 in 1999, three more tribunal rooms were made available at the end of 1999 and the number of cases listed for hearing was increased by 25 per cent. Work is in hand to appoint three additional part-time FE Tribunal Chairmen. It is hoped that the number of cases outstanding will soon begin to be reduced as a result of these changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> The Northern Ireland Civil Service has had a robust and proactive policy on equality of opportunity since 1984 and has consistently sought to tackle under-representation at all levels of the organisation through programmes of affirmative action. This has delivered significant improvement in the levels of representation of Roman Catholics throughout the workforce and both the extent of change and the measures taken have been reported in the public domain through the regular reports of the Service's Equal Opportunities Unit, copies of which are in the Library of the House.




<P>
<P><I>5 Apr 2000 : Column: 518W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00405w14.html_para1">Under-representation of Roman Catholics among the most senior levels of the Service remains evident and is openly acknowledged. Past trends indicate that a significant contribution to changing the compositional profile among the Senior Civil Service (SCS) can be made by drawing upon the more representative pools of staff at the grade levels below the SCS.
<P>

<a name="00405w14.html_para2">Affirmative action measures to tackle under- representation of Roman Catholics, have been developed in close consultation with the former Fair Employment Commission, and continue to be developed in concert with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Measures more specifically targeted at tackling under- representation among the SCS include setting goals and timetables in consultation with the former Fair Employment Commission which will be reviewed this year with the new Equality Commission, the dropping of seniority and grade level requirements as eligibility criterion in internal promotion competitions and more extensive use of open recruitment for SCS posts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00405w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> Public contracts already require that contractors comply with Northern Ireland and anti-discrimination law on religious and political opinion, sex, race and disability. There are additional provisions under the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 whereby individual employers can be excluded from Government contracts if they have not adhered to specified requirements of fair employment legislation. There are no further plans at this time to extend these requirements.

 Since the Consultative Group reported in December 1998, our priority has been to support the recovery of asylum decision output through the expansion and improvement of advice to caseworkers on country situations.

 Any regulatory proposal likely to have an impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector is subject to assessment.

In addition the Ministerial Panel, which the Prime Minister asked my right hon. Friend to establish last December, has now begun its programme of departmental reviews. In the first of these reviews, DTI and DETR agreed to a package of specific regulatory reforms.
