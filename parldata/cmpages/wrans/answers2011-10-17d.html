 In Ethiopia, DFID's investment to the agriculture sector focuses mainly on building the capacity of Ethiopian Government agricultural implementing agencies. For example, DFID supports the Ethiopian Government's Household Asset Building Programme, which improves the capacity of microfinance institutions in providing access to credit for some of the poorest farmers in Ethiopia. To date, 2,300 households have benefitted. DFID investments in the Protection of Basic Services and the Productive Safety Net Programme are also building the capacity of the agricultural extension workers in the crop production, livestock, and natural resource management and contribute to improving the natural resource base of smallholder farmers. Over five million smallholder farmers received this support. In addition, through DFID's humanitarian programme, 26,000 households received seeds and fertilizer, and 9,000 obtained animal health care support.</p>

Due to agriculture and related trade being the mainstay of the Somali economy, almost all these jobs will be in agriculture directly or agriculture-related.</p>

The Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information, an intergovernmental body with worldwide membership, has been the main means by which G20 objectives have been delivered in this area, for example by encouraging the signing of Tax Information Exchange Agreements and conducting peer reviews of countries' implementation of international standards.

 Convergence is an aim which reflects long-term shared ambitions across all levels of Government to secure regeneration of the area that improves conditions for local people. A wide range of regeneration initiatives have been targeted historically on east London, of which the Olympics is the latest and perhaps most striking example. It is too early in what is a very long term process to assess our contribution but I am confident that we are focusing on areas where we can add most value.</p>

 As set out in the Department's Legacy Plan, published in December 2010, the Government are committed to securing a lasting legacy from the Games which include ensuring that the Olympic Park can be developed as one of the principal drivers of regeneration in East London.

In addition, DCMS Exchequer funding of £2 million will be provided in 2011-12.

The campaign aims to generate at least £1 billion in Olympic business boost and attract 4 million extra visitors. In addition, over the next four years VisitBritain will be running the "You're Invited" programme, which will capitalise on the international interest in the recent Royal Wedding, as well as next year's Diamond Jubilee and Olympic and Paralympic Games, and showcase Britain to the world.

This will include the steps the Government propose to take to address market barriers for local TV including reservation of local spectrum, electronic programme guide prominence and a fit for purpose regulatory regime.</p>

 We have received 1,441 pieces of correspondence relating to funding since 1 June 2010. Some of these letters concern funding for civil sector organisations but also funding for areas such as community clubs, sports, arts and leisure projects and libraries. We are unable to determine the number of letters that are solely related to civil sector organisations, as we do not record the information in this way.</p>

It also provides funding, specific grants, strategic commissioning and the procurement of services to a range of bodies. However, it does not record the status of the bodies that it makes payments to, and to identify those which class themselves as civil society organisations, could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The cost of a visit visa for the UK is significantly below the cost of processing an application. These costs are associated with securing the border and the Home Office only recover just over half of those. The fee charged helps to support the investment we make to ensure visas are issued safely, securely and quickly. Very few people choose their holiday purely on the basis of the cost of a visa, but rather on whether the overall cost of the trip (including much bigger items such as travel or accommodation) represents good overall value. That’s why econometric analysis of available data undertaken by the Home Office has indicated that visa fee levels have a minimal impact on application volumes. None the less it would be wrong to ignore the issue, which is why the Government’s Tourism Policy (published in March) aims to improve productivity across the entire visitor economy and, of course, the cost and convenience of visas are part of this.</p>

I am working closely with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to look at simplifying and improving the process of arranging a visa. For example, from the end of this year, the UKBA is moving to online visa processing and has already published visa application guidance in five key foreign languages.</p>

As a result of existing measures to reduce emissions of particulate matter from these sectors, IIASA estimates that UK emissions will reduce significantly between 2005 and 2020, from 29.1 kilo tonnes to 8.3 kilo tonnes.</p>

 The control and use of all chemicals in the EU, including flame retardants, is regulated by the EU REACH (registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals) regulation. There are many different flame retardant chemicals with varying properties, hazard profiles, uses and modes of exposure. For this reason, it is appropriate to take a risk-based approach to regulation for each chemical, and where there is evidence of particular risk, to consider controls to minimise those risks to human health and the environment.</p>

               <a name="1110187000243"> Litigation matters in the UK are generally dealt with by the Treasury Solicitors Department, and there is little requirement for recourse to external solicitors. Barristers were engaged during the financial year 2010-11 for a variety of litigation matters. The majority of these barristers were appointed from the Attorney-General's Panel or were First Treasury Counsel. On the minority of occasions where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office required the services of specialist barristers not on the Panel, nominations were sought from the Attorney-General's Office. In these cases agreement of their hourly rates must be reached before a nomination is made. Guidance on the Attorney-General's Panels, including details of hourly rates, can be found at:</p>

Legal firms which took part in the tender process will have competed on the basis of the quality of the service offered and the price. There is also scope for further competition on price before a firm is chosen. This process ensures that Government Departments are able to obtain legal advice cost-effectively.</p>

 Political transition in Egypt has opened up the potential for long needed reform to stimulate entrepreneurship and greater prosperity. The short-term impact, however, has been a sharp decline in growth due to disrupted economic activity, a weakened investment climate and a significant decline in foreign direct investment and tourism. Egypt will need to navigate through the economic downturn, with limited room for public spending and rising borrowing costs. The immediate challenge for the Government of Egypt is to fulfil public expectations and build social cohesion while preserving macro-economic stability. Restoring fiscal health and more inclusive growth which generates new jobs will be critical over the medium term.</p>

 The UK has long called for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit's immediate and unconditional release. We welcome the agreement between Israel and Hamas announced on 11 October to release him as part of a prisoner exchange. Holding him in captivity has been utterly unjustified from the beginning and yet it has gone on for five long years. We are pleased that this long overdue development is finally taking place.</p>

Iran’s isolation means its nuclear programme falls short on safety in some key respects. The convention on nuclear safety is as system of mutual oversight that sets international benchmarks on the design, construction and operation of reactors. We are pleased that Russian experts are working to ensure Bushehr is operated safely, but full co-operation with the international community is the key to Iran accessing the best international expertise and realising the full potential of a safe, secure and economically viable nuclear power programme.</p>

 Regional states have played an integral role in the international effort to protect civilians in Libya and will also be crucial to Libya’s economic recovery. The UN, in the form of the UN Support Mission in Libya, has been tasked with co-ordinating the international response to the stabilisation agenda in Libya. We anticipate that the countries of the Arab League will play an important part in providing the support the Libyan Government requires to rebuild the Libyan economy, and the Government will continue to work closely with them, the UN, International Monetary Fund and World Bank on this issue.</p>

 I am deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Malawi. The death of Robert Chasowa, a student activist, comes after a string of arson attacks and death threats against prominent civil society figures and other Malawians who have criticised the behaviour of their President. In discussions with Malawi’s Foreign Minister in London on 12 October, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr O’Brien), and I called on the Malawian Government to do all it can to protect human rights defenders, investigate these crimes and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. We further underlined our serious concern at the dangerous rhetoric President Mutharika has used against civil society, which has the potential to incite further violence. While HMG takes no partisan position in Malawian politics, we will continue to put pressure on the Government of Malawi to respect their international human rights commitments, and we intend to step up our support to civil society organisations in Malawi that promote accountability, transparency and respect for human rights.</p>

 As our travel advice makes clear the FCO's current ability to provide any consular assistance in Yemen is very limited. We currently advise against all travel to Yemen and strongly urge British nationals to leave now by commercial means. It also makes clear that if British nationals do not leave the country now while there are some commercial airlines still operating, it is extremely unlikely that the British Government will be able to evacuate them or provide consular assistance.

 The Department of Work and Pensions keeps in regular contact with the Scottish Government on the subject of welfare reform at both ministerial and official levels. For example, universal credit programme officials are working jointly with both the Scottish Government and with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, as well as wider Scottish stakeholders, on the delivery implications of universal credit in Scotland. The Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are also both members of the Universal Credit Senior Stakeholder Board, which provides advice and guidance to the Programme Board. This enables Scotland to share knowledge, experience and insights to inform the thinking of the Board and to support design, development and implementation. The views and advice of the group are represented at the Programme Board to inform decision making on issues including the delivery model.</p>

As DWP start to build the organisation to deliver universal credit, and we have yet to settle on the precise detail, and select the right people with the right capability it is likely some of those skills will exist within local authorities. We will therefore always look to include local authority staff in our thinking. In relation to the longer term delivery of universal credit, we will continue to work with colleagues in HM Revenue and Customs and Local Authorities to test new ways of working and impact ongoing delivery model design at both a national and local level. Our aim is to work collaboratively to enable the decision making process and deliver optimal value.</p>

If they choose to use 084 or 087 telephone numbers, they need to ensure that they adhere to the Advertising Standards Authority code of practice—this mandates marketers and communicators to advise customers of the potential cost of telephone calls whenever a non-geographical number is referenced.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These figures have been included in the totals.
<sup>(3)</sup> Offences include:
Licensing Act 2003 section 146 Sale of alcohol to person under 18
section 147A Persistently selling alcohol to children
<sup>(4)</sup> Includes both Metropolitan police force area and City of London.
<sup>(5)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(6)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

 The Government are implementing a system of more rigorous inspection of those privately funded institutions that sponsor international students, carried out by independent bodies that already inspect the sectors with the highest levels of compliance. My officials are in discussion with the body with responsibility for the inspection of publicly funded education in Northern Ireland, the Education and Training Inspectorate, and will confirm shortly whether they will inspect privately funded providers in Northern Ireland. If they do not wish to do so, we shall invite the Independent Schools Inspectorate to extend their activity in respect of international students to cover providers in Northern Ireland.</p>

We are also proposing to allow damage-based agreements (DBAs) in civil litigation. CFAs and DBAs will be available for claims for corporate harm.

Financial year 2007-08 falls prior to the existence of Trusts. Figures for Boards and Trusts in financial years prior to April 2010 are not directly comparable.</p>

1. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete.  However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.  As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  2. Some percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.  <i>Source:</i>

 The following table shows the number of offenders sentenced for indictable offences by area and criminal history, 2001-10. These figures relate to separate sentencing occasions and therefore an offender may be included on more than one occasion, either within an area, across areas, or across time. These figures are a further breakdown of table Q7.5 in ‘Criminal Justice Statistics Quarterly Update to December 2010’ which was published on 26 May 2011.</p>

 Suspended sentence supervision orders (under sections 122-124 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000) were repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and none were imposed in 2010-11. They were replaced by suspended sentence orders, introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which enable the court to suspend a prison sentence of 12 months or less while ordering the offenders to undertake one or more requirements in the community, including supervision.</p>

 Without knowledge of the worldwide tax positions of individuals with assets in Switzerland, it is not possible to determine the correct marginal rate of taxation.

 Information to the level of detail requested is not available except at disproportionate cost. HMRC has available the posting date, category and amount spent via Government Procurement Card for transactions over £500, shown in the following tables.</p>

               <a name="11101813001692"> HMRC are not responsible for how the card supplier/merchant categorise goods/services and some descriptions may be misleading, e.g. Catering and Catering Supplies in 2007 was for accommodation; Restaurant and Bars relates in most cases to international business hospitality. Further investigation can be undertaken for specific items where required but not across the whole of the reported spend due to the disproportionate cost of doing so.</p>

 HMRC does not hesitate to pursue a prosecution; however, cost-effective civil settlement procedures are used in the majority of evasion cases. This represents excellent value for the Exchequer, as all undeclared tax is repaid and they also pay a penalty which can be up to 100% of the tax evaded. Every year HMRC collects millions of pounds of evaded tax using these well-established methods.</p>

However, extra-statutory simplified tax arrangements previously available to certain carers ended on 5 April 2011 after the Government introduced qualifying care relief. This new relief extended foster care relief to certain other carers, including those providing kinship care under specified social care schemes, who share their homes and daily family life with an adult or child placed with them.</p>

Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, inquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face-to-face doorstep canvassers. There will also be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission and we are testing data matching to identify people missing from the register and looking at how we can increase the choices people have over how to register, including greater use of online registration.</p>

 It is currently not compulsory to be registered to vote and this will not change under the Government’s individual electoral registration (IER) proposals. It is an offence at present for anyone not to provide information when required to do so by an electoral registration officer (ERO), for example, in response to the household canvass form. The Government propose to retain this offence under the new system, however, it is not proposed to create a new offence for an individual failing to respond to an invitation to register. We believe that the act of registering is one of personal responsibility, and as such there should be no compulsion for an individual to make an application to register to vote.</p>

 The Cabinet Office collated existing evidence on levels of giving which was published in the Giving Green Paper in December last year.

This represented a rise of over £400 million from its 2008-09 level of £10.2 billion.</p>

 The Office for Civil Society is part of the Efficiency and Reform Group which is staffed from a flexible resource pool. This allows staff to be deployed flexibly as priorities change and, as such, we do not keep monthly figures for projects within ERG. At the end of 2010-11, the Office for Civil Society had an agreed headcount of up to 115 and in 2011-12, 86 assignments have been agreed. Projections for future years will be based on the annual business planning cycle.</p>

 As part of the Government's commitment to support the innovation and entrepreneurialism of front-line staff, the Government launched Mutual Pathfinders to be led by public sector staff who wanted to take control of their own services. They are trailblazers for the rest of the public sector helping Government understand, by learning from the front line, what type of support and structures will best enable the development of employee-led mutuals on an ongoing basis.

 The Government are keen to make it easier to run a voluntary group, charity or social enterprise. For example the recently released Unshackling Good Neighbours report by Lord Hodgson has put forward a raft of recommendations to address the level of bureaucracy that civil society organisations and volunteers face. The £30 million Community First programme aims to encourage more social action in neighbourhoods with significant deprivation and low social capital. It will look to help start more neighbourhood groups and revitalise existing groups and be a catalyst for community action. In July we launched the £30 million Transforming Local Infrastructure programme which aims to transform the support provided to frontline civil society organisations by mainly supporting local infrastructure and volunteering infrastructure organisations to rationalise and transform.</p>

               <a name="11101818000390"> We are also working on a completely new legal structure for charities—the first incorporated legal structure designed specifically with the needs of charities in mind. Called Charitable Incorporated Organisation, it will contribute to the Government's aim of making it easier to set up and run a charity, voluntary group or social enterprise.</p>

The Cabinet Office will be in a position to provide those details once they are available later in the autumn. We estimate that up to 8,500 young people took part in NCS this summer.</p>

               <a name="11101818000582"> NCS pilot projects typically run for four to eight weeks in total. Three weeks require full-time commitment from participants; participants then complete a social action project in their communities on a part-time basis, with a total time commitment of approximately 30 hours.</p>

 British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) ceased to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Coal Corporation (BCC) sometime in the early 1970’s and acquired a charitable status. At the time of the BCC privatisation, BCURA was not a wholly owned subsidiary of BCC. The Department has no further information about BCURA’s status at that time.</p>

 The Green Deal will be market-driven so we expect the private sector to develop innovative approaches to creating demand for their Green Deal offers. Government are collaborating with a number of companies to trial the impact of a range of incentives. The Government are committed to the success of the Green Deal and the 2011 Budget confirmed the Government would act to encourage and incentivise take-up ahead of its launch in 2012. An independent telephone and web advice service will also be commissioned to help support potential Green Deal customers.</p>

 The renewables obligation (RO) is currently the Government’s main mechanism for incentivising the deployment of large-scale renewable electricity deployment. Generators are issued renewables obligation certificates (ROCs) for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of eligible electricity they generate which can then be sold to suppliers, allowing them to receive a premium in addition to the wholesale price of their electricity.</p>

               <a name="11101820000156"> The RO is a market-based support mechanism, rather than a direct public subsidy, and ROCs are trade-able commodities which have no fixed price. The amount a supplier pays for a ROC is dependent on bi-lateral negotiations between supplier and generator. The nominal value of a ROC in any given year is equal to the buy-out price (the amount a supplier must pay for every ROC they do not present to Ofgem in order to comply with their obligation) + recycle value (the amount re-distributed to suppliers from the buy-out fund on a pro-rata basis depending on how many ROCs they presented to Ofgem) for that year. The nominal value represents the maximum worth of a ROC to a generator but is not necessarily the amount paid by a supplier. The nominal value of a ROC in 2009-10 was £52.36.</p>

 We believe the role of Government is to create the conditions for business success and to enable businesses to find the information, guidance and advice that will help them to grow and create jobs. That is why we announced in January a series of significant changes to the way information, guidance and advice to business is provided, with more focus on improving small business performance and growth, and with a greater emphasis on further and better private sector provision.</p>

               <a name="11101857000361"> The law establishes a framework of responsibility which higher educations must comply with and also promotes an anticipatory and proactive approach to supporting disabled students, including those suffering from mental illness. This may mean that there will be different approaches taken by different universities on this issue, as they seek to offer provision that anticipates the needs of their students and staff based on the unique circumstances of the institution. Individual institutions will use the law as a baseline standard to establish their own tailored policies, procedures and approaches. The Government have no plans to amend the provisions in the Equality Act relating to higher education institutions' duties towards disabled students.</p>

Universities are subject to the courts in the application of these duties. Any student who feels they have been discriminated can seek legal advice about their situation, and the advice of the Equality and Human Rights Commission which provides guidance on discrimination matters and has a statutory enforcement role (established in the 2006 Equality Act).</p>

 The Department does not set eligibility criteria for cataract surgery. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning services, taking into account the available evidence and the needs of the local population. PCTs are required to make decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments rationally, and following proper consideration of the evidence. If a PCT decides to prioritise funding for alternative drugs or treatments, it should be able to explain its decision and rationale. We have been clear that this should not lead to any blanket bans on procedures, and local processes should ensure eligibility criteria for procedures can take account of individuals' health care circumstances.</p>

 Because of the scientific uncertainties about the incubation period of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and the potential level of unidentified asymptomatic infection in the population the Department focuses on managing the potential risks of person to person transmission. Given the uncertainties, evidence based and cost effective steps are taken to reduce the potential secondary spread.

 The Department's current procedures include several controls to ensure the consultancy requirement is essential and will provide best value for money. Appropriately approved procurement routes are used to engage consultancy services. Each consultancy requirement has a Statement of Operational Necessity and Business Case set out and approved within the Department. Further approvals are then obtained from senior officials and Ministers dependant upon the value of the proposed contract. All approvals procedures are in accordance with the Cabinet Office controls for consultancy expenditure within central Government.</p>

 The information held on the Department's business management system is as shown in the following table. Due to the procedures employed by the Department which score expenditure on the system in the month in which an invoice is processed and paid, the figures do not necessarily relate to the costs incurred in the months in question. The figures show the total spend by Ministers' private offices on hospitality and catering and this will typically include purchases of teas, coffees, lunches and refreshments. The system does not have the facility to report on whether these purchases were for specific events or meetings.</p>

 The Department's central procurement database, which has provided the information in the following table, holds information at the level of purchase order (PO)—these are individual items of expenditure—rather than contract. The category of expenditure is for ‘suppliers’; the majority will certainly be external private suppliers but the figures do include some non-private expenditure (voluntary or public sector).</p>

To gather information for financial year 2008-09 and earlier years would require us to contact all directorates and branches within the Department to check their individual records; this could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Yes. This policy is already reflected in the Health and Social Care Bill.

In March 2011, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published its public health guidance “Increasing the uptake of HIV testing in men who have sex with men” and “Increasing the uptake of HIV testing among black Africans in England”, the groups most affected by HIV in the United Kingdom.

The exact form of public capital funding is not assumed or determined as part of the value for money test as the cost of raising the required capital by the Government is the same for all public capital funding options. Different forms of funding, such as loans under Prudential Borrowing Limits or Public Dividend Capital, used by different Government Departments for differing purposes, will mean different cashflow implications for the public authority concerned, such as an NHS trust. However, this will not affect the overall economic cost to the taxpayer, which is the criteria used in such value for money tests.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The 2010-11 data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest period, ie November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.
2. Data for A&amp;E attendances is not available.
3. Cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in HES. The cause code used was W54—'bitten or struck by dog'.
4. In July 2006, the NHS reorganised SHAs and primary care trusts (PCT) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result, data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result, some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided.
5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
6. In-patients are patients who are admitted to hospital and occupy a bed, including both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases.

 All trusts are aiming to be independent of the Department's direct control by April 2014, i.e. becoming national health service foundation trusts. Accountability for effective procurement will sit primarily with their boards. The Department's strategy on procurement of goods and services (including consumables) is to develop trusts into better informed clients, able to make decisions based on improved and more transparent data and able to make better use of regional and national procurement organisations such as NHS Supply Chain.</p>

 A response to the Government's consultation for a new value based system of pricing branded medicines was published on 18 July. That document explained that the Government's objective is to use society's valuation of treatments and their impacts to inform the development of the value based pricing (VBP) model. In respect of wider societal benefits this entails considering the full range of potential impacts of treatments beyond their health effects, determining which of these ought to be included in VBP and developing a transparent mechanism for reflecting their value as accurately as possible. As we take forward our work in this area, we intend to collaborate with external experts and stakeholders, to ensure that the VBP system is clear, robust and transparent, and that industry, patients, clinicians and all others who have an interest can understand how valuations are made in the new system.</p>

In that document, we set out our intention that value based pricing will apply to new active substances placed on the market from 1 January 2014. However, the vast majority of branded medicines already on the market before 2014 will be considered by the successor arrangements to the current Pharmaceutical Price Regulation scheme.

 An independent Organ Donation Taskforce (ODTF) published its first report “Organs for Transplants” in January 2008 and made 14 recommendations to increase donor rates and make organ donation a usual part of end of life care. Implementation of the ODTF recommendations has seen donor rates rise by around 28%, since 2008. Work continues at a local, regional and national levels to further strengthen the donation infrastructure to reach the 50%, increase in donors by 2013 anticipated by the ODTF. This includes an increase in the number of highly trained Specialist Nurses for Organ Donation, the appointment of Clinical Leads for Organ Donation, and the establishment of Organ Donation Committees driving improvement locally.</p>

Examples include asking people to sign up to the ODR when they register with a new general practitioner (GP), when applying for a new passport or European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), and when applying for a Boots advantage card. The prompted choice scheme, working in partnership with the Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, requires people applying for a driving licence online to make a choice about organ donation. NHSBT publicise the need for more people to register as donors through their public awareness campaigns, via the organ donation website and their national helpline. This includes the annual National Transplant week, this year held between 4 and 10 July.</p>

 The proposed reforms to national health service commissioning arrangements do not in any way alter the existing duties of general practitioners (GPs) as clinicians to provide high quality primary medical care to meet the needs of patients, as required by their contracts and the terms of their registration as doctors. Under the proposed arrangements for clinical commissioning, GPs will also have an enhanced role in protecting the interests of patients, through their membership of clinical commissioning groups that plan and secure the majority of NHS services.

 Registered pharmacies are currently exempt under the 1968 Medicines Act from the need to hold a Wholesale Dealer's licence to wholesale deal licensed medicines. Such dealing should be limited to an inconsiderable part of their pharmacy business. Recent experience of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in investigating cases in which counterfeits have entered the legitimate supply chain suggests that there is a need to strengthen the rules governing trade in medicines not carried out by Wholesale Dealers to limit potential for infiltration of the supply chain by counterfeit medicines. The MHRA has undertaken two public consultations on proposals to address this issue as it relates to pharmacies, and is still considering what measures to introduce.</p>
