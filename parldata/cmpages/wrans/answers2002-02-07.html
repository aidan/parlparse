 To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on the arrangements in place between Crown Prosecution Service, the police and local authorities to ensure that antisocial behaviour proceedings are effective.  [31438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 lays down that there should be local partnerships for crime reduction, including antisocial behaviour. All key agencies, including the police, local authorities and the CPS work according to the "antisocial behaviour protocol". There has been guidance and joint training for all the agencies.

39. <a name="20207w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ian Lucas: </B> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what plans she has to introduce legislation to reform prosecution disclosure in criminal cases.  [31439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Government have consulted on Lord Justice Auld's proposals for reform of prosecution disclosure in criminal cases. Following the consultation period which ended on January 31, we are considering our response and have said that our proposals will be set out in a White Paper in April. Any plans to legislate to reform prosecution disclosure in criminal cases will be made public in April.

<a name="20207w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Civil Service Pension Scheme</center></H4>


<P>
43. <a name="20207w01.html_wqn2"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what assessment has been made of the risk of the Government facing a legal action under the Human Rights Act 1998 regarding the civil service pension scheme.  [31443]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 It is a long-standing convention enshrined in the Ministerial Code, that neither the fact that the Law Officers have advised on a matter, nor the content of any advice which they may have given, is disclosed outside Government other than in exceptional circumstances. This is to protect the confidentiality of the legal advice given to the Government. The Government, like everyone else, should be able to get the legal advice which they need to perform their functions, without having to explain or justify this to outsiders, or indeed to reveal that it has concerns about the legal position. This ensures that the Government seek, and get, frank advice where appropriate without having to worry about any political and presentational implications.

<P>
<a name="20207w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The role of my Department in relation to domestic violence is to promote the safety of victims of abuse and to hold offenders accountable for their actions.
<P>

<a name="20207w01.html_para0">The work needed to address domestic violence issues extends far wider than any one Department's remit. This is why I have established with ministerial colleagues a Ministerial Committee on domestic violence.
<P>

<a name="20207w01.html_para1">We are working closely with colleagues across government to draw up a national strategy addressing domestic violence issues that relate not just to the civil and criminal courts, but also to matters of health, education, child protection, refuges and housing.

<a name="20207w01.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 There have been no arrests of Capita staff employed at the ILA centre. On Friday 23 November the Department called in police to investigate serious potential fraud and theft involving individual learning accounts. Details of the continuing investigations are a matter for the police. However, to date no evidence has been found to support any allegations that Capita employees have been involved in the abuse of ILAs.

 The Government will continue to support high quality research in universities and colleges.

 The Government are determined to maintain a rigorous and high-quality examination system that commands public confidence. We look to the regulatory body&#151;the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority&#151;to ensure that all awarding bodies meet the high standards that students and parents expect.

<P>
<a name="20207w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 My Department has received an application from Derbyshire local education authority (LEA) to the targeted capital fund (TCF) for capital funding in respect of Dronfield School. TCF supports standards-focused projects which might not otherwise be supported through other capital programmes. TCF applications are currently being appraised and allocations will be announced in March 2002.

<a name="20207w02.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Learning and Skills Council is required to disburse &#163;1.35 billion for school sixth form provision in 2002&#150;03. The Secretary of State's Grant Letter to the Learning and Skills Council for 2002&#150;03 said that she expected the Council to secure a smooth transfer to the new funding arrangements for school sixth forms, and that it must ensure that the funding does not reduce in real terms relative to the amount they received in 2000&#150;01, provided pupil numbers are maintained.

<P>
26. <a name="20207w02.html_wqn8"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what proposals the Government have to introduce an entitlement for all adults to paid tuition for Level 2 courses.  [31426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w02.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Within my Department, we are currently conducting a review of financial support for adult learners aged 19 or over outside higher education, alongside our work in the Spending Review. We are looking at targeting financial assistance where it is most needed, and at the most cost effective way of doing this. Entitlement for all adults to paid tuition for Level 2 is one option that is being carefully explored.
<P>

<a name="20207w02.html_para2">We are also developing pilot arrangements that will test how free tuition together with employer compensation for time taken off by employees for learning can act as an incentive. The focus of the learning in these pilots will be basic skills and an initial Level 2 qualification. A small number of pilots will be run by local Learning and Skills Councils in their areas. The pilots will start in spring 2002 with learning opportunities available from September 2002.

<P>
29. <a name="20207w02.html_wqn9"><B> Paul Holmes: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what strategy she has to increase participation in adult learning.  [31429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w02.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government's strategy is to ensure that learning is available in a form and at a time and place that best suits the needs of adult learners; to provide targeted financial support to adult learners; and to extend the information, advice and guidance available on learning. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a statutory duty to encourage adults to learn. It will publish its strategy for work force development by the end of March 2002. The National Target for Participation in Learning has been achieved one year early, with 500,000 additional learners since 1997.

<P>
27. <a name="20207w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement about acts of worship in schools.  [31427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 All registered pupils attending a maintained school should take part in a daily act of collective worship. This must be wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character, though importantly, not distinctive of any particular Christian denomination. Schools of a religious character provide collective worship according to the tenets of their trust deed. They are not obliged to follow the Department's guidance in Circular 1/94, although they may find it helpful to do so.
<P>

<a name="20207w02.html_para3">Collective worship provides an important opportunity to promote pupils' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. We recognise its distinctive and unique contribution in teaching children about the beliefs and values underpinning our understanding of ourselves, what is right and wrong, our sense of belonging and respect for each other.
<P>

<a name="20207w02.html_para4">The Government have no current plans to remove the statutory requirement for a daily act of collective worship in schools as the law already allows much flexibility over the organisation, timing and content of worship.

<P>
28. <a name="20207w02.html_wqn11"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the trends in the numbers of school exclusions over the next two years and the underlying reasons; and if she will make a statement.  [31428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Many factors will affect the number of school exclusions over the next two years. We are taking forward a number of initiatives in this area, including more on-site learning support units; more Learning Mentors; and more Personal Advisers under the Connexions Service for pupils aged 13&#150;19.
<P>

<a name="20207w02.html_para5">During the period from 1996 to 2000 the overall number of permanent exclusions has fallen&#151;from around 12,700 in the 1996&#150;97 school year to around 8,300 in the 1999&#150;2000 school year. However, in the last school year (2000&#150;01) the number of permanent exclusions is estimated to have risen to around 9,200 (provisional figure), though this is still 28 per cent. below the 1996&#150;97 peak. We recently issued for consultation draft revised guidance on the appropriate use of exclusion. While this proposes to expand the categories of behaviour where permanent exclusion may be justified, given all the measures we are taking to bolster schools and headteachers with more resources to help them avoid the need for exclusion, we do not expect the new guidance to result in any significant increase in the numbers of exclusions.

That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to union learning representatives. It will reinforce the invaluable role that union learning reps are currently playing in the workplace to promote work force development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what evidence her Department has collated of civil unrest resulting from water shortages in developing countries in the last 12 months.  [33514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w04.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The DFID strategy paper "Addressing the Water Crisis" identifies the increasing potential for conflict as water demand rises. In areas where water is scarce, increased competition for limited supplies can lead to local tensions, in some cases resulting in violent conflict.
<P>

<a name="20207w04.html_para0">In the past 12 months, DFID has witnessed this problem in Northern Kenya and Uganda. Different pastoralist groups, competing for water and grazing land, inhabit the area. During drought periods, the groups often come into conflict with one another. Since they are well armed this has led to deaths in the past year. Another example is in the Central Rift Valley in Kenya where protesters barricaded a road as a result of horticulturalists upstream depleting their irrigation water supplies.
<P>

<a name="20207w04.html_para1">While water shortage as a single issue does not generally result in large-scale civil unrest, it is important to try and satisfy competing demands for water to avoid local conflict. DFID aims to approach water problems from a livelihoods perspective to help ensure that all competing demands for water, and particularly the needs of the poor, are taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w04.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Unsustainable exploitation of groundwater aquifers, in a number of developing countries, is recognised by the UN relevant agencies. The United Nation Environment Programme's publication "Groundwater: A Threatened Resource" focuses on over- abstraction and pollution of groundwater aquifers. DFID's strategy paper "Addressing the Water Crises" also highlights the issue. We recently funded two World bank publications on sustainability of urban and rural groundwater, drawing on the results of DFID funded research. DFID also currently supports an expert to the World bank to identify groundwater issues in key World bank programme countries.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not had any discussions with European Union Ministers on this particular issue. At official level there is discussion with EC counterparts. DFID has also co-funded the European Commission Guidelines for Water Resources Development Co-operation, "Towards Sustainable Water Resource Management", which recognises the problem and provides guidance on sustainable management of groundwater.

 The Government have played a major role in tackling the unsustainable debt burden of the poorest countries. We led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, which was agreed in September 1999. Up to US$100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries. So far, 24 countries have qualified for this exceptional relief, and these countries will receive more than $54 billion of debt relief, so reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. We hope that at least two more countries&#151;Ghana and Sierra Leone&#151;will qualify for debt relief in the coming months, but substantial further progress will be difficult, as many of the remaining HIPC countries are affected by conflict.
<P>

<a name="20207w04.html_para2">The UK is the second largest contributor ($306 million) to the HIPC Trust Fund to help the Multilateral Development Banks meet their share of HIPC costs. This figure includes our share ($85 million) of the substantial EC contribution of US$661 million for which we pressed. Most of our partner states in the European Union have also made bilateral contributions to the trust fund, on top of their share of the EC contribution. In addition, those member states that are major creditors deliver bilateral debt relief through the Paris Club of Official Bilateral Creditors to countries that have qualified for HIPC relief, with the majority&#151;like the UK&#151;providing 100 per cent. debt relief on their remaining bilateral debts.

<P>
<a name="20207w04.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK works closely with the World bank in implementing the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The revised framework provides faster, wider and deeper debt relief to poor countries committed to eradicating poverty. Up to US$100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries so reducing their debts by around two-thirds, on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction. Last November, I met the World bank president, Jim Wolfensohn, at the annual meetings of the World bank and IMF, in Ottawa, to discuss debt and other development issues. I plan to hold further talks with both the bank and the Fund at the forthcoming spring meetings, in April.
<P>

<a name="20207w04.html_para3">The central focus of the Government's international development policy is a commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, which include universal access to primary education. Debt relief is a key element is meeting these goals. It is now widely recognised that there was a 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2002 : Column 1063W</I><P>
need to strengthen the link between debt relief and pro-poor policies. HIPC countries, and other poor countries, are now developing national poverty reduction strategies, setting out how they will tackle poverty and specifying how the debt relief savings, and other development resources&#151;from multilateral and bilateral sources&#151;will be used. For the 24 countries that have already qualified for HIPC debt relief, social expenditure is projected to rise by some $1.7 billion per year. On average, 40 per cent. of this increased social expenditure is being directed towards education. HIPC countries will spend much more on such priority social investments than on debt relief.

Countries receiving HIPC debt relief have benefited from increased social spending of $1.7 billion in 2001&#150;02, equivalent to 1.2 per cent. of GDP. And spending on education has accounted for 40 per cent. of the savings made on debt, equivalent to nearly $700 million in 2001&#150;02.

<a name="20207w04.html_para6">The Government's commitment to poverty eradication means action beyond debt relief is needed, and they have increased the Budget of the Department for International Development (DfID) to &#163;3.6 billion&#151;a 45 per cent. increase in real terms between 1997&#150;98 and 2003&#150;04.

This figure does not include staff already in the relevant front-line geographical and functional department. It is not possible to give a precise number given the cross-cutting nature of the crisis and the breadth of the FCO's response to it.

<P>
<a name="20207w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Liberia continues to threaten stability in the Mano River sub-region and undermine progress towards lasting peace in Sierra Leone. A UN report published in December 2000 highlighted President Taylor's financial and military support for the RUF rebels trying to overthrow the Government of Sierra Leone. The UN demanded that Liberia cut its links with the armed rebel groups. In May 2001, with strong UK support, the UNSC imposed sanctions on Liberia including a renewed arms embargo, a ban on the export of uncut diamonds and a travel ban on President Taylor and his associates. We believe the sanctions should remain in place until there is clear evidence that Taylor has fundamentally changed his behaviour.

 There are no complete records of companies who have benefited from British Trade International assistance in Turkey. The Turkey Trade Unit (TTU) of Trade Partners UK maintains a database of approximately 3,000 active records compiled initially from those companies who participated in the various activities of the "Turkey: Positioned for Business" promotional campaign, which occurred between 1998 and 2001.

<a name="20207w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 British companies are able to access the full range of Trade Partners UK services when developing their business overseas. Information on these services can be found on the Trade Partners website (www.tradepartners.gov.uk). These services make no distinction between companies which are trading and those which are seeking to invest.
<P>

<a name="20207w07.html_para1">UK trade with Turkey has developed into a two way business of approximately &#163;3 billion a year. Exports were down in 2001 as a result of the Turkish economic slowdown but are still expected to be around &#163;1.2 billion while imports are expected to reach &#163;1.8 billion.

<a name="20207w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The UK has an agreement for the promotion and protection of investments with the Republic of Turkey, which entered into force on 22 October 1996. That agreement provides British investors with certain rights in respect of their investments in Turkey, including the right to treatment no less favourable than that accorded by the Turkish Government to Turkish investments or the investment of the nationals in Turkey of any third state. In the event of a dispute arising between the Turkish Government and a British investor in respect of a British investment in Turkey, the British investor has the right to submit the dispute to international arbitration under the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

<a name="20207w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The British embassy in Ankara has received very few complaints. The embassy and its consulates have, however, given advice and support to a number of British companies and individuals on how best to pursue administrative or licensing problems with the Turkish authorities, and referred such inquirers to independent legal advice when necessary.

 We do not know the numbers of business ventures originally assisted by British Trade International, which are subject to legal proceedings in Turkey, nor could such information be provided, if at all, except at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20207w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 February 2002]:</i> The Outreach Project is run by the Army Cadet Force Association (ACFA) and aims to provide vulnerable and problem youngsters with the chance to develop a better attitude towards themselves and their communities. The programmes are run through the Army Cadet Force, in partnership with schools, local authorities and the police service, and offer challenging, adventure based activities.
<P>

<a name="20207w08.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence is pleased to support such a worthwhile scheme and since its launch in 1996 we have given the project &#163;114,400 annually. We will continue to provide support in the future. Last year the Home Office committed &#163;60,000 annually to the project for at least the next two years and the Youth Justice Board is also giving the ACFA a one-off grant of &#163;60,000 for facilities support. In addition, Army facilities are made available to the project at no cost.

 The Ministry of Defence held 17 focus groups during the initial research phase of the review. These took place in the south-east of England during November and December 1999 and covered all three services. During the consultation period (March 2001 to end July 2001), discussion groups took place at seven Army units, five Navy units and five RAF units throughout the country. Discussions were also held with ex-service organisations, such as the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations (COBSEO), the Forces Pension Society, and the War Widows Association.

 The C-17 aircraft has been used since 18 January to transport cargo into Afghanistan and, under current plans, will continue to do so for the duration of the operation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w09.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In percentage terms, taking the current Adour Mk 104 engine performance as 100 per cent., the upgraded Adour Mk 106 engine provides an increase in thrust generating a performance level of 105 per cent. This increase enables the Jaguar aircraft to operate more effectively in hot climates and improves engine reliability.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2002]:</i> The table shows the number of child pedestrians injured in road accidents, for the local authorities with the 10 highest and 10 lowest casualty numbers. The number of child pedestrian casualties in road accidents in any local authority can vary considerably from year to year, so the figures shown are averages for the most recent three years available.

<P>
<a name="20207w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Board of London Regional Transport has today announced that it is minded to proceed with its plans for the modernisation of London Underground. It will now consult the Mayor of London and Transport for London as required under the terms of S298 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. At the request of the Mayor and Transport for London, London Regional Transport has offered to extend the period of consultation until 8 March.
<P>

<a name="20207w13.html_para1">The Board of London Regional Transport has undertaken a thorough evaluation of the bids to assess whether they are likely to provide value for money. It is confident they would do so and that the proposed contracts would provide an appropriate basis for the future management of the London underground infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="20207w13.html_para2">The contracts envisage a long-term partnership between London Underground and three private sector infrastructure companies who will take over responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the network. The private sector will be committed, under contract, to deliver specific improvements and will be incentivised appropriately. If they fail to do so they will be penalised. Persistent inability on the part of infrastructure companies to meet their obligations could lead to their contracts being terminated.
<P>

<a name="20207w13.html_para3">I have taken separate independent advice from Ernst and Young. Ernst and Young have confirmed to me that the process followed by London Underground's evaluation team has been suitably robust and that London Underground's recommendation that the PPP proposals deliver value for money is a subjective one which is supported by its analysis. A copy of Ernst and Young's report has been placed in the Library of the House and is available on my Department's website.
<P>

<a name="20207w13.html_para4">I will of course take full account of Ernst and Young's findings. In particular, I agree with Ernst and Young that the Arbiter, whom I will appoint in accordance with the Greater London Authority Act 1999, should be resourced to be fully effective, and I will ensure that is the case. And I agree with Ernst and Young that the final decision to go ahead should be conditional upon, among other things, the final prices and risk transfer proposals submitted by the bidders not altering materially prior to financial close.
<P>

 My Department has not made an estimate and the latest available published monthly traffic data from the Civil Aviation Authority, which is the most comprehensive UK source, is October for airports and September for airlines. However, more recent data are available for some airports and airlines, primarily BAA airports and BA. The most appropriate measure of change is that over the same period in 2000. These show that there has been a recovery in passenger numbers, but not air transport movements, in December 2001.

 The information needed to determine the average time for planning applications to be processed is collected centrally only for a small number of applications mainly relating to mineral extraction and waste disposal (known as "county matters").

<P>
<a name="20207w16.html_spnew0"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 I received a letter from the Greek Minister for Culture, Mr. Evangelos Venizelos, in June 2001 to which I replied emphasising the importance of cultural connections between Britain and Greece. In connection with the Parthenon Sculptures I reminded the Minister of the position of Her Majesty's Government, which had recently been restated by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, namely that it is our view that the 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2002 : Column 1106W</I><P>
sculptures were acquired legally and that they are best housed in the British Museum in a multi-cultural context, seen free of charge by up to 5 million visitors a year.
<P>

<a name="20207w16.html_para0">It may also be helpful to be clear about the responsibility of the British Museum for the Sculptures. The Trustees have a statutory duty to protect their collections and this duty could only be over-ridden by primary legislation amending Section 5 of the British Museum Act 1963, relating to the disposal of objects in the collections.

<P>
<a name="20207w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts and DCMS officials use every available opportunity to press for the limits to be updated at least in line with inflation, as provided in Council Regulation (EEC) 3911/92 on the export of cultural goods. We have also welcomed the Commission's new initiatives to contribute to the effective functioning of the mechanisms set up by the Regulation, including making the maximum use of new technologies to improve its implementation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the estimated projected annual increase is in the number of export licences for cultural goods consequential on the decision by the EU Commission to leave the EU monetary threshold unchanged.  [29966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w16.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The effect of the EC Commission's decision to leave the thresholds unchanged has been to increase the number of licences issued by 69 per cent. between 1993 and 2000.

<P>
<a name="20207w16.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> Some 17,000 items were offered for sale by NMEC in an auction organised by Henry Butcher International held between 27 February and 2 March 2001. Henry Butcher valued these items at a total of &#163;2 million. Around 10,500 of these items were sold in the auction and these were sold to the highest bidders in each case. As is the case at many auctions, a small proportion of the items were not paid for, and hence not collected, by successful bidders. Total income received from auction sales which were concluded was &#163;3.5 million. Some 450 items were withheld from the sale because they were felt to be of use to a future owner of the dome. It was subsequently decided to sell these items, and items which had not sold in the auction, by private treaty. It was felt that this was more cost effective than seeking to hold a second auction. Henry Butcher International was retained to advise on the private treaty sales and benchmarked rates against auction prices in order to ensure value for money and tenders were sought for major items. Sales by private treaty realised &#163;1 million. A feature of NMEC's balance sheet was that many assets purchased or developed for the millennium experience were unique to the dome. The costs to develop or buy these bespoke assets were much higher than the subsequent realisable values and it was always recognised that the auction would cover only a fraction of those creation costs. The total received by NMEC for the sale of assets in the auction and by private treaty was therefore &#163;4.5 million. A further &#163;1.3 million was achieved by the 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2002 : Column 1108W</I><P>
sale of certain assets to original suppliers under terms of contracts with NMEC. Not all the detailed information requested about the individual assets is available. The remainder is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20207w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) how many pensioner households in England and Wales receive a free television licence;  [32720]
<P>
<UL>(2) what was the cost of providing free television licences to pensioner households in England and Wales in the last 12 months.  [32718]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 TV Licensing, which administers for the BBC as Licensing Authority the free television licence concession for the over-75s, is not able to provide a breakdown by nation of the number of free licences currently in force in the United Kingdom. However, in the 12 months to December 2001, 3.398 million free licences were issued in England and Wales. The cost of these licences was &#163;335 million, excluding administrative costs.
<P>

<a name="20207w16.html_para1">The cost of administering the concession in England and Wales cannot be disaggregated from the total for the United Kingdom, since much of it is systems-related and applies to the scheme as a whole. The estimated cost of administering the scheme throughout the United Kingdom in the months to December 2001 was &#163;10.1 million.

Special advisers are employed to help Ministers on matters where the work of Government and the work of the Government Party overlap and it would be inappropriate for permanent civil servants to become involved.

 In January last year my Department published social inclusion policy guidance for archives in the document "Libraries, Museums, Galleries and Archives for All" in January 2001. We are now working with Resource, the Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries, and the National Council on Archives to ensure local authority archives recognise their role in achieving greater access and inclusion. With our encouragement, the National Council on Archives has set up a network of Regional Archive Councils which published Archives Strategies for each region in 2001. We have also been working with the Inter-Departmental Archives Committee (IDAC) to create an Action Plan for Archives which will help to encourage greater awareness of and better access to archives. This will be published later in the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what changes he proposes to make to housing benefit when pension credit is introduced.  [35156]

<P>
<a name="20207w19.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government's aim in introducing pension credit is to guarantee pensioners a decent income in retirement and, for the first time, to reward those with savings rather than penalise them. Housing benefit makes a vital contribution to this strategy, by allowing pensioners to access affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="20207w19.html_para3">Under pension credit, most pensioners over 65 will be asked for a statement of their circumstances every five years. Housing benefit awards will follow the same timings. From 2003, we will no longer ask pensioners to make a repeat claim for housing benefit every year.
<P>

<a name="20207w19.html_para4">This will reduce burdens on pensioners, simplify administration and allow local authorities to focus more resources on targeting fraud, rather than processing routine renewal claims.
<P>

<a name="20207w19.html_para5">We believe that it would be wrong to deny housing benefit recipients the extra support that pension credit will provide. We will therefore raise the housing benefit income threshold by the maximum amount of the pension credit savings reward, to an expected level of &#163;113.80 for single pensioners in 2003. In addition, we will treat pensioners' capital more generously, taking into account &#163;1 for every &#163;500 instead of every &#163;250 of qualifying savings.
<P>

<a name="20207w19.html_para6">As a result of these changes, 1.9 million pensioner households will get more help, or help for the first time, through housing benefit.

The Department took additional provision of &#163;334,000 in 2001&#150;02 to meet the cost of electoral publicity associated with the 2001 General Election. The provision for the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Scotland rose from &#163;170,000 in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;300,000 in 2001&#150;02 as the Commission began work on the 5th review of parliamentary constituencies in Scotland.

<P><I>7 Feb 2002 : Column 1123W</I><P>
traffic management schemes; resurfacing roads with low noise surfaces; and addressing noise at the planning stage of new noise generation or noise sensitive developments. Such action has considerably reduced the output of noise from individual sources but has often failed to reduce the overall ambient noise because of other factors, such as the growth in the number of vehicles on our roads. We are developing a strategic approach to build on the progress already made. A consultation seeking views on the first steps towards an Ambient Noise Strategy in England was launched on 20 December last year. A significant part of this strategic approach will be an exercise to build on the noise mapping already carried out of the major transport and industrial noise sources across England. The first stage of this exercise, for which &#163;13 million has been set aside, will start later this year. The strategy will also act as a foundation to the implementation of the forthcoming European directive on the assessment and management of environmental noise which will address ambient noise across the whole of the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 2002]:</i> It is not necessary to reintroduce purposeful activity for young offenders in remand centres, as such activity has not ceased. Prisoners in young offender establishments, including remand centres, spent an average of 23.1 hours a week in purposeful activity in 2000&#150;01. The Government are committed to building on their youth justice reforms to improve the standard of custodial accommodation and programmes for 18 to 20-year-olds. This is expected to increase the purposeful activity available to remand and sentenced prisoners in that age group.

<a name="20207w22.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There are various arrangements for dealing with and monitoring time to deal with complaints in different parts of the Department. These involve a range of time limits and targets. For example, complaints about the service provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department Headquarters are recorded and monitored by the Departmental Correspondence Unit which aims to deal fully with complaints within 20 working days. The Public Record Office and HM Land Registry aim to respond to complaints within 10 working days and five working days respectively. In the Court Service, written customer complaints are recorded by civil courts on the Business Management System and records are kept of those dealt with by Crown courts and at regional offices, and also by Court Service Headquarters. However, from April 2002 a computerised system will be introduced for all courts, regional offices and Court Service Headquarters to record and analyse all complaints from court users. This will include verbal, telephone and e-mail complaints, as well as those in writing.
<P>

<a name="20207w22.html_para6">Details about the complaints procedures produced by the Lord Chancellor's departments and agencies are published on the relevant websites. The procedures make it clear that complainants who are not satisfied with the response they receive can ask for the matter to be reviewed. If the complainant remains dissatisfied following the review then he or she may ask his or her Member of Parliament to raise the matter with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.
<P>

<a name="20207w22.html_para7">The judiciary are of course independent of the Department but the Lord Chancellor, as head of the judiciary, is responsible for investigating complaints about the personal conduct of Judges. He cannot consider complaints about judicial decisions. As a general rule he will investigate any complaint that a member of the judiciary has behaved in a way that falls short of the standards that both he and the public expects.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many publications the Statutory Publications Office has in storage; and if he will list the buildings where they are stored.  [33295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Statutory Publications Office does not hold any publications in storage. All publications held by the Statutory Publications Office are held within the Statutory Publications Office, Lord Chancellor's Department, Selborne House central London. These publications include Acts of Parliament and Statutory Instruments that are used for the purpose of updating the Statute Law Database.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many complaints he has received since taking office concerning the conduct of individual judges.  [33353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The principle of judicial independence, which is central to our constitutional arrangements, means that it is not open to the Lord Chancellor or his Department to consider complaints about judicial decision. However, as Head of the Judiciary the Lord Chancellor does consider complaints about the personal conduct of individual judges and other judicial office holders. The names of the complainant and the judge are confidential. However, in the period between August 1998 



<P>
<P><I>7 Feb 2002 : Column 1134W</I><P>
(when new internal arrangements for handling such complaints came into force) and December 2001, the Lord Chancellor received a total of 6,679 complaints about members of the judiciary. The majority of these related to judicial decisions. Of the remainder, 1,227 related to personal conduct and were taken forward for investigation by seeking the complainant's consent for the complaint to be copied to the judge. In 1,034 cases consent was received and the Lord Chancellor then approached the judge concerned for his or her response to the allegations and relayed these to the complainant. On 23 occasions he saw fit to take further action, either by writing to the judge or by arranging for him or her to be seen by officials. Comparable figures for the period before August 1998 are unavailable.

 Figures relating to the total number of family court cases for the five year period 1996 to 2000 are provided in the table. Figures for 2001 are currently being compiled. The figures represent the numbers of orders made under the Children Act 1989, the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976 and the Family Law Act 1996 (Part IV). In addition the county court figures include the number of petitions for divorce filed.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will provide a breakdown of his estimate in paragraph 11 of his summary of responses to the New Tax Credit Consultation (November 2001) of childless people in households with someone in work with household income below 60 per cent. of the median, between <i>(a)</i> childless couples, <i>(b)</i> single people over 25 years of age working 30 hours per week or more and <i>(c)</i> other single people.  [32611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]:</i> There are around 1 million single people or people in childless couples living in households with incomes below 60 per cent. of the median (after housing costs) who are working 16 hours or more a week. Around half of these are over 25 years of age and working 30 hours or more a week.

<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out the basis for his calculation on replacement rates for childless couples, reported in paragraph 9 of his summary of responses to the New Tax Credit Consultation (November 2001); and if he will provide separate estimates for <i>(a)</i> renters and <i>(b)</i> homebuyers with mortgages.  [32612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The replacement rates referred to are based on a couple with someone working 35 hours a week at &#163;5 an hour. Using this assumption, a couple without children paying rent is around &#163;20 a week better off in full-time work than on benefit. A couple without children with a mortgage is around &#163;55 a week better off in work than on benefit, (assuming they are not receiving any income support to cover mortgage interest). These gains to work correspond to replacement ratios before housing costs of 88 per cent. for the couple paying rent and 63 per cent. for the couple with a mortgage.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what guidance he has given to the Inland Revenue in respect of their compliance work on tax credits.  [25101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue approaches non-compliance relating to tax credits very seriously. It has issued extensive guidance to staff carrying out tax credit compliance work on individual applications and on employers who pay tax credits through the payroll.
<P>

<a name="20207w24.html_para6">The principal guidance on tax credit compliance for Inland Revenue officers is the Applicant Compliance Guide. This Guide has been published and the text is available to the public at all Inland Revenue inquiry centres. Guidance on tax credit aspects of employer compliance is being consolidated in an updated Employer Compliance Handbook. This will be published on completion. Specialist compliance sections within the Tax Credit Office and at Special Compliance Office operate under internal guidance not available to the public.
<P>

<a name="20207w24.html_para7">Inland Revenue officers carry out tax credit applicant compliance and employer compliance work in accordance with the relevant Codes of Practice. A Code of Practice is issued at the opening of an inquiry, explaining why the Inland Revenue inquires into some cases and what happens during an inquiry. It also sets out the rights and responsibilities of both the customer and the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w24.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many appeals have been made to the High Court and the Court of Session under the provisions of <i>(a)</i> subparagraph (5) of paragraph 3 and <i>(b)</i> subparagraph (4) of paragraph 4 of the Tax Credits Act 1999 in each year since the commencement of the Act.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps he is taking to press other Governments to <i>(a)</i> increase their total international aid budget and <i>(b)</i> secure the abolition of education charges in the developing world by 2005.  [33516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In his speech in New York in November the Chancellor called on all rich nations to commit further substantial increases to development assistance.
<P>

<a name="20207w25.html_para0">The Government are committed to the principle that primary education should be made free. No child should be denied access to a basic education because the costs, either direct or indirect, cannot be met by the household. School fees are an example of a direct cost, but there may be indirect charges for books, uniforms and exams, which can make education unaffordable to many.
<P>

<a name="20207w25.html_para1">The equitable financing of education is a key issue for achieving our goal of Universal Primary Education by 2015. In their dialogue with partner governments, the international community, and civil society on poverty reduction and education sector programmes, the Government will continue to argue for the reduction of financial barriers that exclude large numbers of the poorest children.

<i>Note:</i><P>

Table C shows a forecast of the estimated payments for services flowing from new private investment over the next 25 years. Payments may be lower than estimated because of deductions from the service payments, caused either by the supplier's failure to make the service available or by a failure to meet the required performance standards. In addition, variances may occur because of changes in the service requirements agreed during the course of the contract. Payments may also vary as a result of the early termination of a contract triggering contractual arrangements for compensation on termination. <P>

The outstanding requests relate to either security vetting issues which have only recently been solved, or to 'all records' requests which have necessitated lengthy paper as well as electronic searches.
<BR>
<i>Customs and Excise</i>
<BR>
These figures relate to a period when HM Customs and Excise was undergoing fundamental restructuring and was introducing, as a consequence, revised procedures for dealing with subject access requests. The new procedures, coupled with further measures to increase staff awareness, should have a beneficial effect on future response times.
<BR>
<i>Inland Revenue</i>
<BR>
Of the 41 outstanding subject access requests under the Data Protection Act 1998, 39 requests are within the 40 day time limit set out in the Act. In two cases, clearances are awaited from the Inland Revenue's medical advisers for the release of sealed medical records covered by doctor/patient confidentiality. All other records were released to the individuals within 40 days.

<i>HM Treasury</i>
<BR>
The Department's policy is to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, and wherever possible to respond with the information requested well within the 40-day time limit. Under the Data Protection Act 1984, when virtually no requests were received, annual test-requests were processed to make sure that the system was compliant. Since the 1998 Act came into force, there have been a few occasions where open-ended demands for information have exceeded the normal channel's ability to respond promptly. The Department is currently resourcing a team to ensure timely responses to all requests for the Department's information.
<BR>
<i>Customs and Excise</i>
<BR>
The Department's policy is to comply with the requirements of the Act. Following its recent restructuring it has been necessary to introduce revised procedures for dealing with subject access requests. The new procedures, coupled with further planned measures to increase staff awareness, should have a beneficial effect on future response times. The Department has also increased the staffing of the central unit whose role is to co-ordinate responses to subject access requests. This unit acts as a focal point for incoming requests, initiates the necessary searches, collates the information received and issues a single response to the applicant.
<BR>
<i>Inland Revenue</i>
<BR>
The Inland Revenue is very conscious of its obligation to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Department aims to respond to requests for information under the Act well within the 40-day time limit. The Department has in place a small central unit whose role is to co-ordinate, manage and oversee the response to all requests for information under the Data Protection Act 1998. supported by an extensive structure of data protection officers across the Department, the unit collates the relevant electronic and paper records to produce a single response to the data subject on behalf of the Inland Revenue. Staff are provided with detailed guidance, and where necessary, training to ensure that the Inland Revenue fully complies with its legal obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.

<P>

<a name="20207w27.html_para6">The NSF also sets out the policy for the prescribing of statins. The first priority is to ensure that people with established CHD are treated with statins to lower their cholesterol level.

<P>

<a name="20207w27.html_para7">Insulin-resistant metabolic syndrome is an underlying condition in many people with Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> companies, <i>(b)</i> voluntary organisations and <i>(c)</i> public sector organisations based in the Buckingham constituency have signed up to the Healthy Workplace Initiative; what information they have received, and at what cost to public funds.

<a name="20207w28.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Nationally to date approximately 30,000 small and medium size enterprises have "signed up" to the Healthy Workplace Initiative. Members receive a free newsletter four times a year and join the national on-line community at www.signupweb.net, which provides access to information and support on occupational health. In addition, several regions have set up local networks of businesses to share information and experiences. The total cost of the initiative from its launch in 1999 to date has been approximately &#163;1.4 million. Registrations to the database are not sorted by parliamentary constituency so isolating membership figures for Buckingham would involve disproportionate costs.

(3) how many environmental appraisals have been published by his Department since 1 January 2001; and if he will list the last four;  [29023]

<P>
<a name="20207w28.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Departmental guidance on environmental policy appraisal (including a screening tool) is available to all staff on the department's intranet. This is linked to the Cabinet Office policy maker's checklist. In raising staff awareness of sustainable development attention has been drawn to the importance of carrying out environmental policy appraisals. This has also been drawn to the attention of agencies and arm's length bodies.
<P>

<a name="20207w28.html_para4">The Department is assisting the Cabinet Office in developing an integrated appraisal tool. This is a good practice tool designed to assess the impact&#151;including environmental impacts&#151;of policy proposals.

<P>

<a name="20207w28.html_para5">The civil service college course on "Environmental Appraisal and Integration into Policy" has been advertised widely in the Department and one person has attended the course. There are a number of bodies that provide environmental training and staff will choose a course that best meets their overall needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the Government plans to set a minimum number of hours to be spent by dentists on NHS patients.  [30387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Dentists who are independent contractors are free to choose how much time they wish to devote to the provision of national health service dental services. There are no plans to introduce a requirement for a minimum number of hours that dentists should spend providing NHS treatment. We are committed to the provision of NHS dental care, and have invested &#163;100 million over two years in the form of incentives and grants to modernise services and encourage increased commitment to the NHS. We will continue to work with the profession and other stakeholders on future arrangements for NHS dentistry.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w29.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what incentives the Government plans to encourage the establishment of new NHS dentists' practices in North Shropshire;  [30403]
<P>
<UL>(2) what local initiatives the Government plans to increase <i>(a)</i> recruitment and <i>(b)</i> retention of NHS dentists in North Shropshire.  [30402]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w29.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are no immediate plans to alter existing arrangements for dentists joining the general dental service. However, discussions are underway nationally, with the profession and other stakeholders, to consider future arrangements for national health service dentistry. Workforce issues are included in those discussions.
<P>

<a name="20207w29.html_para6">Historically Shropshire has had difficulty attracting sufficient dentists offering NHS treatment. In partnership with the two Staffordshire health authorities and the local NHS Workforce Confederation, the HA is commissioning an extensive review of the key employment issues facing local dental teams. This review will also identify local solutions.
<P>

<a name="20207w29.html_para7">Every HA in England has in place a dentistry action plan. These identify local issues and develop solutions. In 2001&#150;02 Shropshire HA was allocated, from national funds, &#163;50,000 to enable general dental service practitioners to register and treat more NHS patients. More recently, an additional &#163;50,000 has been allocated to provide support to practitioners who wish to establish, or expand, NHS practice. Since June 2001 HAs have had powers to use their own resources to address shortfalls in local availability of NHS dentistry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are two important safeguards in place.
<P>

<a name="20207w29.html_para11">First, from 1 April 2002 the National Care Standards Commission will take over from health authorities the regulation of private health care services, including private hospitals. For the first time they will be required to comply with regulations and meet national minimum standards. Also for the first time, owners, managers and others registered as being responsible for the day-to-day running of the hospital will be held responsible for the quality of care and treatment provided.
<P>

<a name="20207w29.html_para12">Second, national health service commissioners are responsible for ensuring that all services and treatment provided for patients are high quality. Patients receiving treatment in private hospitals paid for by the NHS remain NHS patients. Therefore, when commissioning treatment from the independent sector, NHS commissioners must be satisfied that the treatment will be of a high standard, for example, by paper evidence of performance and visits. Quality requirements can also be set out in contracts between the NHS and the independent sector.

<P>
<a name="20207w30.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Better Hospital Food programme, announced in the NHS Plan, is designed to improve the quality and availability of food in hospitals for all patients and is a long-term programme. An additional &#163;38.5 million has been made available to support this programme.
<P>

<a name="20207w30.html_para0">The first stage is to ensure that all sites are brought up to the required level. As the 31 December 2001 target date for implementation has only just passed, precise information will not yet be available, and will vary from site to site according to historic levels of investment, the type of system in operation and patient choice. We expect that detailed costings information will be available as the programme becomes established.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include: the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission health care or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities; and some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

2. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms and accounts which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

3. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. This affects the results for 2000&#150;01 in particular but the effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>

4. Cambridgeshire and Norfolk health authorities were established on 1 April 1999 from the merger of three former health authorities. Expenditure figures for 1997&#150;98 have been calculated from the relevant proportions of the three health authorities in the new bodies.<P>

 The new National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) will register residential children's services when its powers, as set out in the Care Standards Act 2000, come into force on 1 April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how the Government's proposals stemming from <i>(a)</i> the White Paper on Mental Health, and <i>(b)</i> the policy statement on mental capacity, Making Decisions, will address the House of Lords judgment in the Bournewood case which relates to patients who lack capacity to consent;  [32754]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20207w31.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The ruling of the House of Lords in the Bournewood case upheld the lawfulness of the current position whereby patients who lack capacity to consent to treatment for their mental disorder, as long as they do not show resistance, can be treated without the use of formal compulsory powers in the Mental Health Act 1983. Concerns, however, were raised about these patients.
<P>

<a name="20207w31.html_para0">We are committed to reforming the 1983 Mental Health Act and a Bill will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows. As proposed in the White Paper, Reforming the Mental Health Act (December 2000), new legislation will provide the following safeguards for adult patients who have a long-term incapacity to consent and who are in a hospital or nursing home receiving treatment for a serious mental disorder:

the right to go to the new mental health tribunal to challenge lawfulness of detention or for review of the care plan; and

the right of access to independent specialist mental health advocacy.

<a name="20207w31.html_para1">We are also committed to bringing forward legislation on mental incapacity as soon as Parliamentary time allows. The 1999 policy statement "Making Decisions" proposes a range of measures aimed at clarifying the decision-making process on behalf of mentally incapacitated adults, including the introduction of a new system of continuing powers of attorney. These proposals will be complementary to those for mental health legislation.

 Local authorities will have to pay in 2002&#150;03 registration fees of &#163;1,100 for each home they own and registration fees of &#163;300 for each home manager. This is to bring local authority owned homes on to the same charging basis as homes owned by voluntary or private organisations. The total cost of this is for the East Riding of Yorkshire council to calculate themselves. Currently their own registration unit should be charging themselves annual fees for the local authority owned homes they are inspecting. In 2002&#150;03 the National Care Standards Commission will not be charging any annual fees for homes that have to be registered for the first time as part of the transition process under the Care Standards Act. Annual fees for such homes will be introduced in 2003&#150;04.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:<P>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission health care or fund training on behalf of other health bodies;<P>

asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities; and<P>

some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area.<P>

Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

2. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

3. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 2002]:</i> The national health service provides care for women during pregnancy and childbirth in various types and sizes of maternity units. This will vary from large units in hospitals to small midwife led units. It is for local health authorities, trusts and communities to decide on the pattern of service provision taking into account the needs of local service users, evidence of effectiveness and available resources.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales have asked the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) to appraise Herceptin for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, and to issue guidance on its use to the national health service in England and Wales. NICE expects to issue guidance on Herceptin in spring 2002.
<P>

<a name="20207w32.html_para6">Data on the number of health authorities in England and Wales currently authorising the use of Herceptin are not collected. However, as with all newly licensed treatments in advance of a NICE appraisal, the Department's advice is that funding authorities should consider the clinical evidence available for a specific treatment before making any decision.
