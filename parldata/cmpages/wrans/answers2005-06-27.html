 In May last year the House agreed to the proposal made in the joint Report from the Accommodation and Works and Administration Committees for a new Visitor Reception Building to be sited at the north west corner of Westminster Hall. The House of Lords endorsed this proposal in July last year.

<a name="50627w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The construction of the new facility will in any event involve some disruption to Westminster Hall as well as the facilities on the west side of the Hall. To avoid such disruption being spread over a number of years, the opportunity is being taken to undertake at the same time a number of maintenance and repair projects in Westminster Hall itself, including replacement of the guttering and repairs to the south stairs and floor. As a result, Westminster Hall, the Grand Committee Room, the Jubilee Cafe, the Jubilee Room, the meeting rooms off Westminster Hall, and the IPU and CPA offices and reception rooms will be inaccessible from the end of December 2005 until October 2006.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_4">As a temporary measure to replace the W meeting rooms off Westminster Hall, Committee Room 21 on the Upper Committee Corridor will be divided into two separate meeting rooms. The Serjeant at Arms will shortly be circulating further details of arrangements for other meeting rooms.

 The decision whether to initiate a prosecution of a case in the courts may be taken either by the police or by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). How the procedure to initiate proceedings operates depends on the nature of the offence and, currently, where an offence was committed. When the roll-out of statutory charging is completed (planned for April 2006), a standard procedure will apply throughout England and Wales.

 This Government are concerned about the contribution that UK aviation makes to global warming, which by 2030 could amount to about a quarter of the UK&#039;s total contribution to climate change. We are working hard domestically and in the EU to reduce the impact of aviation on climate change. Defra Ministers and officials worked closely with colleagues at the Department for Transport to ensure that this vital issue was addressed in the Government&#039;s Air Transport White Paper which was published in December 2003. As a result, the Government&#039;s long term aviation policy has repeated our commitment to taking a lead on climate change and recognises the need for aviation to take its share of responsibility for tackling the impact of air transport on global warming.

<a name="50627w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_15">The preferred Government option for tackling the contribution that aviation makes to global warming is through a well designed emissions trading scheme. For an international industry, an international trading regime is the best solution, and we are working with the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) to achieve this. Within the EU we will be pressing for the inclusion of aviation into the EU emissions trading scheme, and have made this a top priority for the UK presidency of the EU, with a view to aviation joining the scheme in 2008, or as soon as possible thereafter. Officials from DfT and Defra have already approached other member states on the matter and are working closely with the European Commission.

However, these transfers cannot be counted as efficiencies, as the individuals continue to work on DEFRA&#039;s account.

 The Government have donated over &#163;7 million directly to aid relief and recovery in Sri Lanka in the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami. DFID funded seven flights for the Disasters Emergency Committee, seconded four staff to help with relief work and made direct grants to United Nations Agencies and international non-governmental organisations to provide shelter, water sanitation equipment, food and other essential help to Tsunami victims. The secondments involved providing an air operations co-ordinator, two shelter advisers and an adviser to the United Nations Humanitarian Information Centre. DFID also provided a member of staff as part of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination team. Sri Lanka has also benefited from some of the &#163;26.5 million disbursed as regional support to the UN, and the &#163;50 million that the Treasury estimates will be given in tax relief on public contributions to the Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal.

<a name="stpa_51">In addition to providing relief assistance, DFID has agreed to meet the cost of 10 per cent. of the interest on Sri Lanka&#039;s debt repayments to the International Financial Institutions over the next 10 years. This support is expected to be worth some &#163;41 million and will be used for post-tsunami and poverty-reduction work. Further financial support for longer-term reconstruction is under consideration. DFID stands ready to assist in the establishment of a Post Tsunami Operational Management Structure and a Post Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Plan.

<a name="stpa_52">The initial relief operation did go well, largely in all areas. However more needs to be done to allow the numerous donors to start reconstruction and to more actively involve affected communities in the planning of that process.

On my recent visit to the east and south of Sri Lanka I met with many families affected by the tsunami disaster and numerous national and international non-governmental organisations, United Nations and government officials working to support them.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">In its Strategic Area Review, the LSC for Hertfordshire recognises that the depth and breadth of vocational learning in Hertfordshire is limited. It is working with partners to develop vocational provision for 14&#150;16 year olds. For example, the Increased Flexibility Programme offers young people the opportunity to undertake vocational qualifications, usually undertaking some work at the local College. Nearly 1,500 Hertfordshire young people are currently on the programme. The LSC is also supporting collaboration between schools and colleges for 16&#150;19 year olds, with Colleges leading on developing the vocational elements. Excellent examples of this work can be seen in Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage, with encouraging developments in Hemel Hempstead, Broxbourne and St. Albans.

How such education is organised is a matter for the county council. Its Adult Education Service is in regular dialogue with LSC Cumbria about how its provision can contribute to local, regional and national priorities. These include supporting adults to improve their literacy and numeracy skills and to engage with learning locally, so that in due course they can progress towards gaining a Level 2 qualification.

 &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, our SEN strategy, provides a clear long-term vision for improving support and outcomes for children with SEN. It sets out action to ensure that children with SEN receive the help they need as quickly as possible, from schools and other services. The SEN strategy was informed by a review of special schools.

 We want to see strong links between extended schools and children&#039;s centres. Children&#039;s centres provide holistic services, including access to integrated early learning and care, health and family support for children under five and their families. They are being established across the country in every community by 2010. We also expect all schools to be offering extended services by that date.

<a name="stpa_106">It is up to local authorities to determine where children&#039;s centres should be located in order to best serve their communities&#039; needs. However, where possible we expect children&#039;s centres to be developed from existing services which will include nursery, primary and secondary schools. Children&#039;s centres may wish to consider co-locating with schools, especially primary schools and offering joint services, to provide a more streamlined service to parents and families, providing services for all those with children aged 0&#150;11 in one place. This would particularly benefit those parents with pre-school children and children of primary school age.

 The UK&#039;s Carbon Abatement Technologies strategy was launched on the 14 June. This sets out the work programme needed to support the development of sustainable fossil fuel technologies mainly using coal and natural gas. It recognises that fossil fuels will continue to be a major source of energy for decades to come and that technologies need to be developed and deployed which will radically reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from the use of these fuels. Improved combustion efficiency and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are seen as the key technologies for achieving this aim.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50627w13.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_109">The Government have announced funding of some &#163;25 million towards demonstration of carbon abatement technologies as part of a &#163;40 million package of support for clean energy technologies. Also, in his Budget statement this year the Chancellor undertook to assess support for the development of CCS in the Climate Change Programme Review (CCPR), including the potential for economic incentives.

<a name="stpa_110">In addition to this we will continue to fund research and development in this area under the DTI&#039;s Technology Programme. Under the Cleaner Coal Technology R and D Programme from 1999 up to 2008, the Government will have committed some &#163;13.5 million in supporting UK industry to develop cleaner coal technologies. In addition to this we are also committing some &#163;3.5 million for UK industry and academia to collaborate with the USA to develop these technologies.

<a name="stpa_125">The UK has long fought for the withdrawal of subsidy for the growing of tobacco and the lack of controls highlighted by the report of the Court of Auditors serves to reinforce this view. We are concerned at the failures by member states to apply the required controls and unsatisfactory monitoring by the Commission. While the reform of the tobacco regime agreed at the Luxembourg Council in April 2004 will result in full decoupling of the tobacco subsidy by 2010 we expect every effort to be made to ensure that the controls required by existing legislation are followed and, if necessary, corrective action taken. We will continue to take every opportunity to press the Commission for updates on the progress it is making to ensure member states are applying the required controls and on how it is addressing the issue of financial corrections.

An initial six month work programme has been set up to reflect the priorities of Heads of State as set out in the ED Action Plan on terrorism. This cross-pillar work programme incorporates justice and home affairs priorities, as well as those issues highlighted by external policy working groups. As such, it includes for example, assessments on threats to modes of transport; threats to critical national infrastructure targets in EU member states; and an assessment of trends in terrorist financing.

<a name="stpa_157">The data collection exercise undertaken to facilitate the development of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), which ended in December 2004, identified 26 schemes (with some 7,000 members) which started to wind up between 14 May 2004 and 1 December 2004. Of those schemes, six (with some 1,400 members) appear to be sponsored by employers that had not undergone an insolvency event at that time. However, given the information provided before and during the exercise on the likely scope of the FAS, it is probable that some schemes connected to solvent employers did not provide returns.

Notes:<br>

1. All expenditure is in current (2005&#150;06) prices and represents UK expenditure. Expenditure expressed in &#163; million, rounded to the nearest &#163;50 million.<br>

2. The expenditure given for winter fuel payment does not include one-off age-related payments.<br>

3. In 2005&#150;06 the winter fuel payment per household where householder(s) are up to age 79 is &#163;200. For those 80 years and over this is &#163;300. These allowances are reduced to &#163;150 for all households after 2005&#150;06.<br>

4. After 2005&#150;06 the winter fuel payment is a fixed annual payment of &#163;150 in cash terms. As a result&#151;despite increases in the 65+ population between 2005&#150;06 and 2050&#150;51&#151;there is a downwards trend in expenditure when quoted in current prices.<br>

5. Housing benefits include both housing benefit and council tax.<br>

 It is difficult to derive a direct causal relationship between the presence of roadside advertisements and other potential distractions to road accidents because accidents do not happen very often, and when they do, are the result of a number of factors.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">Death rates in England and Wales vary seasonally, being lower in summer than in the winter months. However, analyses of urban populations indicates that all-cause mortality rises during heatwaves. In most summers, temperatures do not get high enough to raise mortality from the usual seasonal low. The main exceptions in recent years were 1995 and 2003. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has carried out special analysis into excess deaths during the 1995 and 2003 heatwaves. The analysis of the 1995 heatwave, published in the &quot;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&quot; in February 1998, found that there were an estimated 619 extra deaths in England and Wales between 30 July and 3 August compared to the expected number of deaths based on the 31-day moving average for that period. The analysis found that excess deaths were apparent in all age-groups. The analysis of the 2003 heatwave, published in &quot;Health Statistics Quarterly 25&quot; in February 2005, found that there were 2,091 excess deaths in England between 4 and 13 August compared to the average for the same period in the previous five years. The analysis found that the elderly (aged 75 and over) were most affected by the heatwave.</p>

 Since the 2004 consultation exercise, the implementation of the new EU public procurement Directive has been, and will continue to be, discussed in numerous seminars, conferences and meetings involving the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). These occasions are normally requested and arranged by other interested parties, including other Government departments, the devolved administrations, local authorities and the wider public sector, the legal community, suppliers and NGOs, and are separate from OGC&#039;s formal consultation process. Article 45 often features in such discussions, along with all other main provisions of the new Directive. On 20 June 2005 OGC began a further 12-week consultation on the draft Regulations implementing the Directive, including Article 45. OGC is in discussion with the Criminal Records Bureau on the practical implementation of this Article.

The preliminary conclusions of it are that the switch from grants to loans is proceeding at a relatively slow pace but that the majority of local authorities are now actively considering such a change.

 The pilot rapid transit scheme known as &quot;EWAY&quot; is included in the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan 2015, which was published in November 2004. This is a large, complex and expensive scheme and as with all such schemes, it is dependent on funding being available and is subject to a range of evaluation and statutory processes. Due to other higher priorities at present, it has not been possible to provide funding for EWAY in the Budget period to end 2008.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50627w41.html_spnew6"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 We intend to set out our vision for the future of legal aid, outlining the Department&#039;s long-term strategy for reform, including work to control high cost criminal cases, and summarising the key findings of the Fundamental Legal Aid Review, in due course. In addition the Legal Services Commission has made a number of detailed reforms to the way it purchases services in high cost cases, including the introduction of individual case contracts to control expenditure.

 The Bar Council does not hold information centrally about the earnings of barristers in their first tenancy or those who have been qualified for one year. This information is difficult to collect since barristers are not salaried, they are self-employed and their earnings will depend on where they work and the work they carry out. Many junior barristers will have a varied caseload that can include civil and criminal work. The Bar is considering the possibility of collecting such data.

 We are committed to reducing inequality of outcomes in all cancers. We have a commitment to reduce death rates from cancer in under-75s by at least 20 per cent. by 2010, with a reduction in the inequalities gap of at least 6 per cent. between the fifth of areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators, the spearhead primary care trusts (PCTs), and the population as a whole.

<a name="stpa_86">Statistics for women diagnosed between 1996 to 1999 showed that five year survival rates for women with breast cancer in the most affluent areas were 5.8 per cent. higher than those in the most deprived areas.

<p>
<a name="50627w43.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_87">It is not clear precisely why survival rates vary. However, women in more deprived areas are more likely to have advanced breast cancer at the point of diagnosis. Work is under development to encourage people, especially in less affluent areas, to seek help from their general practitioner earlier. We will be piloting programmes in some spearhead PCTs, looking at knowledge and attitudes towards cancer, as well as working with the voluntary sector to learn from previous awareness-raising campaigns.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are based on the numbers of dentists with open GDS contract.<br>

2. GDS gross fees cover a dentist&#039;s individual earnings as well as their practice expenses.<br>

3. The dentists include principals, assistants and trainees.<br>

4. A dentist will be counted more than once if he/she works in more than one PCT.<br>

5. Prison contracts have not been included in this analysis.<br>

6. In view of the boundary changes from health authorities to PCT&#039;s in 2002 the areas have been defined using practice postcodes.<br>

7. The figures provide a snapshot of the number of individual dentists with an open contract at 31 March.<br>

8. A dentist with a GDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses.<br>

9. The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

10. Care should be taken when analysing this data due to dentists changing contracts from GDS to PDS, particularly the later years.<br>

11. The earnings figures are based on whatever the definition of London was at the time, in particular the earlier figures are based on Health Authority boundaries.<br>

12. Dentist numbers are on a headcount basis&#151;no estimate of whole-time equivalent is available.<br>

 No central records are kept of laptops provided specifically to previous Ministers and special advisers. However, current Ministers and special advisers have been assigned a laptop each, where they have a requirement for one. In the last financial year, there were six Ministers, three of whom had a requirement and in this financial year, six Ministers, of whom four have laptops. Three special advisers had laptops last year. Two of the three special advisers this year have been allocated a laptop, with potential for a third adviser also to have one. This reflects the situation since 1995 where laptops have been assigned as required.

Notes:<br>

Malaria:<br>

Malaria is defined by a primary or secondary diagnosis of:<br>

B50 Plasmodium falciparum malaria<br>

B51 Plasmodium vivax malaria<br>

B52 Plasmodium malariae malaria<br>

B53 Other parasitologically confirmed malaria<br>

B54 Unspecified malaria<br>

Patient counts:<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis):<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary Diagnoses:<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (6 prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Ungrossed Data:<br>





Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

 Patients registered with a general practitioner in England and patients resident in England who are unregistered or who are registered with a GP in Wales should be treated within the standard maximum waiting time for England. The current maximum standard for all in-patient and day case treatment is nine months. The target maximum waiting time by the end of December 2005 is six months.
