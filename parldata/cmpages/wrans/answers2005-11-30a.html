 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the impact upon the Tees, Yorkshire and Humberside Ambulance Service of the recent reconfiguration.  [30317]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51130w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 There has been no reconfiguration in this geographical area since the Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust was formed in 1999.

<p>
<a name="51130w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">In order to deliver the benefits of the recent review of ambulance services, Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services, ambulance trusts need to be of a size that enables investment in people and resources to underpin advanced services. We are therefore proposing that there should be fewer, bigger ambulance trusts and will be undertaking public consultation on these proposals this winter. These proposals will ensure resources are targeted at improving patient care and supporting front-line services.

<i>(a)</i> co-infection within a single human host of a human-adapted influenza virus and H5N1, with a consequent interchange of genetic material between the viruses and <i>(b)</i> random mutation giving rise to a new pandemic influenza virus;  [23988]

<p><a name="qnpa_0">(2) what assessment she has made of whether there are human influenza strains which could combine with an H5N1 strain giving rise to mutagenesis from which a virulent, human host adapted strain could emerge. [25463]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51130w01.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There are little data available on this issue. There is good evidence that the 1918 pandemic virus arose from random mutation giving rise to a new human virus. There is also good evidence that the 1957 and 1968 pandemic viruses arose from reassortment between a human virus and an animal virus. At this time, it is impossible to determine how a new human pandemic virus might be created and which influenza strains might be involved in the reassortment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the evidential basis was for the statement on page 44 of the UK pandemic influenza contingency plan, published on 19 October, in relation to pneumococcal immunisation preventing some of the complications due to secondary pneumococcal infection following influenza infection; and whether the evidence indicates that this is an effective course of action for <i>(a)</i> adults over 65 years and <i>(b)</i> children.  [28705]</p>




<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51130w02.html_spnew4"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Both pneumococcal vaccines used to vaccinate children and older people in clinical risk groups, including adults over 65 years have been shown to provide protection against pneumococcal bacteraemia. In the case of the vaccine that is recommended for children under five years who are in a risk group, the vaccine also provides protection against non-bacteraemic infections such as pneumonia and ear infections.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51130w02.html_para2">
<a name="qnpa_8">It is well documented that secondary bacterial infection follows influenza infection during seasonal flu epidemics. It is reasonable to assume that there may be an increase in pneumococcal disease during a pandemic. It would be prudent to ensure that there is high vaccine coverage among the risk groups recommended pneumococcal vaccine.

Apart from the changing patterns of migration, other factors for increasing rates of TB include increased opportunities for international travel; homelessness in inner cities and increasing alcohol and other substance misuse. Also, HIV infection weakens a person&#039;s immunity to TB, although this only accounts for a small proportion, around 3 per cent. of the total.

In addition, funding a retirement incentive scheme could mean having to close down or shrink other grant schemes, which are providing valuable public benefits such as the agri-environment schemes.

<a name="qnpa_60">However Defra is supporting an industry-led initiative called fresh start. Fresh start aims to secure a sustainable future for farming in England through encouraging new entrants into farming. A further element of the fresh start initiative is to stimulate existing farmers to think about how they might respond to the changes brought about by CAP reform, whether this means expanding their business, diversifying into other activities or retiring from the industry. Such choices will serve to create opportunities for new entrants wishing to develop their careers in the industry.

<a name="qnpa_61">As part of fresh start, Defra has produced a detailed information pack designed to support professional agricultural advisers when discussing retirement and other exit options with their farmer clients.

<sup>(4)</sup> Figures are for deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> The cause of death for accidents was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E800-E869 and E880-E928 for the year 2000, and, for the years 2001 to 2004, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes V01-X59.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> The cause of death for suicide was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E950-E959for the year 2000, and, for the years 2001 to 2004, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X60-X84.<br>

<sup>(7)</sup> The cause of death for injury of undetermined intent was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes E980-E989 excluding E988.8 for the year 2000, and, for the years 2001 to 2004, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes Y10-Y34 excluding Y33.9 where the coroner&#039;s verdict was pending. It is assumed likely that most of these deaths at ages 13 and over are cases where the harm is self-inflicted but there was insufficient evidence to prove 



that the deceased deliberately intended to kill themselves. As there were no intentional self harm deaths in children under the age of 13, data for injury of undetermined intent have not been included.<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed as follows:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

2. The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

All duty rates listed are given in terms of pence per litre. Before the introduction of biodiesel rates in 2002, biodiesel was liable at the ultra low sulphur diesel rate and biodiesel used off-road was liable at the same rate as red diesel. Before the introduction of a separate bioethanol rate in 2005 bioethanol was liable at the same rate as ultra-low sulphur petrol.<br>

<a name="qnpa_79">HMRC is preparing business plans to meet its efficiency savings for 2005&#150;08. These targets include a net reduction of 12,500 in its staff and moving 1,950 posts out of London and the South East under the Government Relocation programme. Delivering these targets means that the Department will be reviewing its estate on an ongoing basis to ensure that it remains in line with its needs. When HMRC takes any decision to close offices in future, letters will be sent to the Members of Parliament for the constituencies in which those offices are located and these letters, and the accompanying press release, will be placed in the Library of the House.

<sup>(29)</sup> The adjusted defence budget was used when the department reported under a cash regime to provide consistent figures for defence spending. For further details please refer to Footnote 6 of table 1.1, UK Defence Statistics 2001.<br>

<sup>(30)</sup> During 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;03 the Department introduced resource accounting and budgeting (RAB) in two stages. To provide roughly comparable figures with pre and post full RAB the net cash requirement to represent the &quot;defence budget&quot;. The net cash requirement (NCR) is the actual money that MOD requests from the Government in order to fund its activities. The NCR takes account of movements in working capital levels (debtors, creditors, stock) whilst excluding ail non-cash costs.<br>

<sup>(31)</sup> Following the full introduction of RAB, the &quot;Defence Spending&quot; line from UK Defence Statistics Table 1.1a has been employed (UK Defence Statistics 2005, page 14).<br>

Figures for 2005&#150;06 will be collected as part of our next Race Equality Scheme (RES) data monitoring exercise and published in our 2005&#150;06 RES report.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what estimate she has made of the number of schools in <i>(a)</i> West Yorkshire, <i>(b)</i> Wakefield district and <i>(c)</i> Normanton constituency that will be delivering extended services in (i) 2006, (ii) 2007 and (iii) 2008; and to how many children and parents such provision will be available;  [32437]
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_117">(2) how much has been allocated to <i>(a)</i> the local authority and <i>(b)</i> local schools in Wakefield to develop and roll out the extended schools programme in (i) 2005&#150;06, (ii) 2006&#150;07, (iii) 2007&#150;08 and (iv) 2008&#150;09 financial years.  [32438]</p>




<p><a name="st_115"><a name="51130w15.html_spnew0"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 This Government wants all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of all primary and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality child care; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer through schools. This will include determining how many primary and secondary schools develop access to the core offer in each year. On 29 September 2005 my Department published its report on the baseline survey of extended services in schools which it commissioned earlier in the year. The survey showed that nationally the vast majority of schools were providing access to some form of extended activity. The survey did not provide figures at local authority level.

<a name="qnpa_118">On 13 June 2005 Ruth Kelly announced funding of &#163;790 million over 2005&#150;08 to support the development of extended schools. &#163;110 million of this was allocated in 2005&#150;06 and Wakefield received &#163;815,005. Of the &#163;680 million to be allocated across 2006&#150;08, &#163;250 million will go direct to schools through the School Standards Grant and the formula for calculating each school&#039;s allocation for 2006&#150;07 will be announced in the near future. The remaining &#163;430 million will be distributed to local authorities through the Standards Fund and the General Sure Start Grant. Of this Wakefield will receive &#163;1,203,051 in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;1,453,835 in 2007&#150;08. Funding will be released to schools in accordance with each local authority&#039;s extended schools strategy. My Department wrote out to each local authority on 13 June 2005 detailing what their extended schools allocation, excluding the School Standards Grant, will be over the period 2005&#150;08.

However, we are not able to provide details of capital spend for schools sixth forms as capital allocations for investment in schools have not separately identified funding for sixth form provision. Decisions on priorities for capital investment in schools have been taken locally in accordance with local asset management plans. The new 16&#150;19 Joint Capital Fund will combine schools and post-16 budgets bringing greater coherence to investment decisions on projects requiring investment in new post-16 education and training provision.

<a name="qnpa_124">Before the LSC took on the responsibility, in 2002&#150;03, of funding for sixth-formers in schools, local authorities were provided with allocations for these pupils through the &quot;post 16&quot; and &quot;Other&quot; sub-blocks of the Education Standard Spending Assessment. Further funding for schools with sixth forms has been provided to authorities through grants such as the School Standards Grant and the Standards Fund. However, it is not possible to determine how much of the funding through formula or grants has been directed towards sixth forms since it is for the authority to decide how much funding an individual school receives, and a school to direct appropriate resources towards its sixth form. Any apportionment is likely to be inaccurate.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_128">I should begin by explaining that there are a number of limitations on the information that the Learning and Skills Council can provide in response to your question on funding. Firstly, as the LSC was established in April 2001 I cannot provide information prior to April 2001.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51130w15.html_para12">
I should like to follow up some of the related questions put to Chris Banks and me by your colleagues on the Select Committee last week.
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_142">We discussed the findings of the Learning and Skills Development Agency&#039;s research into the funding gap for full-time 16&#150;18 year old learners in schools and colleges. The report found that had FE colleges been funded on the same basis as school sixth forms, they would have received an additional 13%.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_143">However, it did not suggest that simply uplifting college funding rates is the way to level the playing field, as the gap in the actual funding rate is only just over 2%. A large part of the difference is caused by technical issues such as special pensions arrangements for teachers in schools, differences in the way that data (particularly learner number information) is collected and used, and the impact of the Government&#039;s &#039;real terms guarantee&#039; which stated that no school that maintained its student numbers would receive less funding in real terms under the LSC funding formula than under the previous LEA arrangements.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_144">Today around one in seven schools still benefits from this guarantee by receiving more than they would under the LSC formula.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_145">As Chris and I said last week, the funding inequity is one of the issues that the LSC&#039;s &quot;agenda for change&quot; programme aims to address. When Sir David Normington and I gave evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts in October, Sir David reiterated the Government&#039;s commitment to narrowing the gap, but he noted that any changes must be carefully planned and rolled out so as not to destabilise the school system by simply taking money away from them to give to the colleges. By its very nature this process cannot be a quick one, but with our new funding arrangements we will make progress.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_146">Finally, I should like to touch briefly on your concerns about funding for adult learning. I know that Liz Davis has written to you to explain the funding issues and I understand that Warrington Collegiate has historically taken a very inclusive approach to fee setting in order to ensure that those who are most in need of learning continue to be able to access it. Colleagues at the local LSC, together with the two colleges and Warrington Borough Council&#039;s community services department, met recently to discuss the best way to manage the impact of future changes and developments in adult learning in Warrington.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_147">Although this group&#039;s discussions are at an early stage I have asked Liz to ensure that you are kept informed of progress over the coming weeks.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_148">If you would like to discuss this or any of the matters in this letter in more detail I know that Liz would be pleased to meet with you at your convenience. Liz can be contacted on 01606 320022.</p>
