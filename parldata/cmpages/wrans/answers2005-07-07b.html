<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="50707w01.html_wqn0"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement on the work of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat.  [9575]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jim Murphy: </b> 
 The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) was set up in 2001 to improve the UK&#039;s resilience against disruptive challenges, working in partnership with others at the national, regional and local levels to enhance arrangements for anticipating, assessing, preventing, preparing for, responding to and recovering from all types of disruptive challenge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50707w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The CCS drives the delivery of improved resilience across the government and the public sector by making sure that the Government can continue to function and deliver public services during a crisis. It achieves this through risk assessment and horizon-scanning activity to identify and assess potential and imminent disruptive challenges to the domestic UK, and by working with others to improve the capability of all levels of government, the wider public sector and the private and voluntary sectors to manage potential challenges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50707w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">A key focus of the CCS&#039;s work over the last year has been the Civil Contingencies Act which received Royal Assent in November 2004. The Act and supporting regulations, guidance and non-legislative measures will deliver a single framework for civil protection in the United Kingdom. Part 1 of the Act establishes a clear set of roles and responsibilities for organisations with a role in emergency planning and response at the local level. As enabling legislation, this part of the Act is heavily reliant on supporting regulations and guidance, which are currently under development. Part 2 of the Act modernises the United Kingdom&#039;s emergency powers framework and is already in force.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will take steps to ensure that English wine is served <i>(a)</i> exclusively and <i>(b)</i> at the request of guests at meals, parties and receptions hosted by his Department during the EU presidency; and if he will make a statement.  [8872]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 In planning presidency events, the Cabinet Office&#039;s principal objective is to source the most suitable venue for each event in terms of facilities, accessibility and overall value for money. Wherever possible, conference organisers will make arrangements to serve British produce, including English wine.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will list the examiners at the British Board of Film Classification; what the professional background of each is; and if she will make a statement.  [10386]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew2"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) is an independent company and my right hon. Friend has no locus to provide the information the hon. Member requests. Examiners employed by the BBFC make recommendations on film classification to the BBFC&#039;s director, David Cooke, who has the responsibility for all such decisions. Ultimately, it is for local authorities to decide whether to accept the classification awarded by the BBFC to films for cinema release or to impose their own.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that the interests of the most vulnerable consumers are protected during digital switchover and have proposed that the BBC help establish and fund appropriate support. We will announce details of the scope of this assistance in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50707w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">As part of the process of detailed scheme design, we and the BBC will run a trial later this year in the Bolton ward of Hulton, in association with SwitchCo and Bolton metropolitan borough council. The aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of various forms of assistance, with leaflets, telephone helplines and support from carers and social workers among the methods being piloted.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew4"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 Since 16 May, my Department has received 22 letters from sports clubs via their constituent MPs, one letter from the National Golf Clubs Advisory Association and another from the English Golf Union, and two letters from individual sports clubs. Most of the letters have concerned the impact of the 2003 Act&#039;s fee structure on the running of sports club bars. My Department recently announced the Independent Review Panel, chaired by Sir Les Elton, which will review fee levels and associated costs, including those payable by amateur sports clubs.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew5"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The Government estimate that during the transitional period, 65 per cent. of all applications to convert existing licences into new premises licences will include some form of variation. We have no estimate on what proportion of variations would involve live music. The Government established the Live Music Forum to promote the take-up of reforms in the Licensing Act 2003 relating to the performance of live music.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50707w01.html_spnew6"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 The Office of Communications (Ofcom) is a public corporation, operating independently from Government, principally under the terms of the Communications Act 2003 and the Office of Communications Act 2002. The Office of Communications Act requires Ofcom to report annually to the Secretary of State on the carrying out of their functions during the financial year and a copy of this report is laid before each House. In addition, DCMS and DTI Ministers and their departmental officials meet regularly with the Ofcom chairman and senior officials to discuss issues relating to the exercise of Ofcom&#039;s statutory functions.

<a name="stpa_25">Announced as part of the Government&#039;s Rural Strategy in July 2004, the pathfinders were formally-launched on 14 March 2005 and will run through to April 2007. It is too early to expect outcomes from the work to date but the pathfinders have been working closely with their local and regional partners to develop a shared agreed business plan to tackle local priorities and identify practical solutions to gaps, blockages or failures in service delivery to rural customers.

<p><a name="qn_48"><a name="50707w05.html_wqn6"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the terms of reference of the Rural Pathfinder for the Peak District are; which other agencies are involved in its work; and if she will make a statement.  [10416]</p>








<p><a name="st_48"><a name="50707w05.html_spnew6"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 As set out in the &quot;pathfinders prospectus&quot; published in March 2005, a copy of which has been made available in the Library of the House, the overall aim of the rural delivery pathfinders is to explore and test opportunities for more joined up, flexible and effective approaches to rural delivery at a local level. This includes innovation in rural development and delivery of services in rural areas, and better prioritisation of existing resources, in line with local priorities, towards areas, communities and people with the greatest needs. The prospectus sets out in more detail the overarching framework within which all pathfinders, including the one in the Peak District Rural Action Zone, are operating.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50707w05.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_26">In the Peak District RAZ pathfinder, the focus is on access to services with particular emphasis on access to support a sustainable rural economy and community regeneration. Local priorities for action include affordable housing, sustainable tourism, promoting local distinctiveness, learning and skills, and enhancing and sustaining a high quality environment. More detail can be found in the outline business plan published at the pathfinders launch on 14 March 2005 (and to be found at http://wwwdefra.gov.uk/rural/ruraldelivery/pathfinders/default.htm)
</p>


<p>
<a name="50707w05.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_27">From the outset the pathfinder has aimed for an inclusive approach; the cross-border nature of the area makes this imperative. The steering group formed to oversee the preparatory work for the pathfinder involves two Local Strategic Partnerships (Derbyshire and Staffordshire), six local authorities, a National Park Authority, a sub-regional Strategic Partnership, the voluntary and community sector, representation from the Natural England confederation, a Rural Community Council, a Government Office and RDA. further linkages are being developed with other partners within the East and West Midlands.

<a name="50707w05.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_28">The pathfinders represent a key element of DEFRA&#039;s agenda to ensure that decisions on service delivery can be taken closer to the customer. We have allowed local areas to set the agenda for what they tackle. This is critical because we are embarked on a radical process of improving the way in which we support rural delivery, as outlined in Rural Strategy 2004. The pathfinders provide us and our delivery partners with an opportunity to recognise and respond to difficulties and opportunities and better meet rural needs.

We welcome the fact that all candidates have now accepted the results of the poll and encourage all parties in Guinea-Bissau to continue to respect the democratic process when the second round of elections takes place on 24 July.

Finished admission episodes<br>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

 The only limitation placed on free speech by the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill is the prevention of words or material that stir up racial or religious hatred. The Government believe this is a proportionate measure, a view shared by the Joint Committee on Human Rights who, in their report on the proposed measures published in March 2005, accepted the existence of a serious, albeit limited, problem of incitement to hatred on religious grounds. The report considered that the measures proposed in the Bill were unlikely to give rise to any violation of the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Remote provision of a service then is where the provider remains in one member state while providing his service to a recipient in another member state; it would include services provided over the internet or telephone and also mail order services.

<a name="stpa_55">Definition of Services of General Economic Interest and Services of General Interest. The term &quot;Services of General Interest&quot; is not found in the Treaty (which only refers to services of general economic interest), but it is often used to mean both economic services and non-economic services in which there is a public service element. While the term &quot;Service of General Economic Interest&quot; is referred to in the EC Treaty it is not defined. The Services Directive only covers economic services where there is economic consideration provided by or on behalf of the recipient.

 New measures are not necessary.

Powered vehicles (whether internal combustion or electric) are motor vehicles within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended. Any powered vehicle used on the public highway must comply with all aspects of road traffic law, including construction requirements, registration, road tax, insurance etc. The rider/driver should hold an appropriate licence and, where required, wear a suitable helmet.

<sup>(16)</sup> Mansfield Ashfield Regeneration Route affected Fowlevil Brook which runs into Rainworth Lake SSSI. However, measures were taken to ensure the water quality in the brook was not affected (and hence the SSSI was not affected either) so I have assumed this does not need to be included.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> Wyre Piddle Bypass in Worcestershire was completed in 2002. Although the bypass did not affect any SSSIs, AONB or national parks, it did affect Piddle Brook, a site of special wildlife interest.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> While the scheme avoided direct affect on the adjacent SSSI&#039;s, it skirted the boundaries of the Biddulph Pool and No Man&#039;s Heath SSSI and the Chasewater Heaths SSSI.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> The Broome-Ellingham Bypass affected the area of the Norfolk Broads, which has the status but not the designation of a national park, and this was taken into account when the scheme was considered and approved.<br>

DVLA&#039;s own database of vehicles for which there is no current keeper contains some 2.9m records, both taxed and untaxed. Whilst the majority of these vehicles will no longer be on the road (but DVLA has not been notified that they have been scrapped), DVLA makes the database available to police forces for use in conjunction with their Automatic Number Plate Reader system.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50707w17.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Government issues gilts at a range of maturities in order to fulfil its commitment to long-term minimisation of debt servicing costs while taking account of risk. The Government issues gilts in economic conditions that differ from those faced by the Eurozone countries when issuing in euros. Therefore, it would not be meaningful to base the costs of financing the Government&#039;s borrowing needs on Eurozone interest rates. In particular, the UK economy is growing more rapidly than the Eurozone and is, therefore, at a different point in the interest rate cycle. It would also be misleading to compare debt-servicing costs based on financing borrowing through 10-year bonds only because this would not take account of the range of maturities and yields at which governments issue bonds.

The Government issue gilts (denominated in sterling) in economic conditions that differ from those of other sovereign issuers (for example the United States that issues in dollars or Eurozone countries that issue in euros). In particular, the UK economy is growing at a different rate from the Eurozone and US economies and is, therefore, at a different point in the interest rate cycle. It would not be meaningful to assess the costs of financing the Government&#039;s borrowing needs by looking at the level of interest rates in other countries.
