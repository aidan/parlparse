<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 May 2000]:</i> The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has the unenviable task of reconstructing a devastated province and reconciling a polarised population. To this end UNMIK's operations have divided up under four pillars, covering civil administration, humanitarian relief, democratic institution-building and reconstruction.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para0">We fully support UNMIK's efforts to carry out its mandate and have provided UK personnel to assist in local government, 60 civilian police officers with a further 90 promised and &#163;119 million in humanitarian relief and reconstruction aid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many claims for compensation by British nuclear test veterans have been <i>(a)</i> made and <i>(b)</i> settled to date.  [121304]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 My Department has recorded 144 claims for compensation from British nuclear test veterans. As there is no evidence of excess illness or mortality among British nuclear test veterans as a group which could be linked to their participation in the nuclear tests, no compensation claims from them have been settled. In any event, prior to May 1987, Service personnel were prevented from pursuing claims for compensation from the Ministry of Defence by section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act 1947. The repeal of section 10 by the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 was not made retrospective and claims arising from injury or illness caused before the repeal are barred by law.

<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 No representations have been made to me on this matter other than from my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry). Having regard to all the issues, including the difficult position for the relatives if the deaths were not investigated in public, I have agreed that inquests should take place and directions have been sent to the coroner accordingly. The directions give the coroner authority to hold inquests. However, the detailed handling arrangements are matters for the coroner to determine.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> other Government Departments, <i>(b)</i> the Fire Service, <i>(c)</i> the Ambulance Service and <i>(d)</i> the Police concerning the Radio Replacement Scheme.  [121336]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I have received various representations from police forces, the Association of Police Authorities, individual Police Authorities and other interested organisations in England and Wales about the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP). The project represents an important part of our commitment to ensure that the police have access to the modern facilities they need to play their key part in tackling crime and disorder and improving community safety. Concern has been expressed about the cost of the project. I recognise those concerns. Over the three year period starting from the 1999-2000 financial year, the police service will receive an additional &#163;1.24 billion in central Government funding. The annual charges for the PSRC Service will be reduced by the &#163;50 million that I obtained from the Capital Modernisation Fund, specifically for the PSRCP. Consideration of the financial pressures on forces will also be taken into account in the overall level of resources to be provided to the police service in future years as part of the year 2000 Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para1">I have received, also, various representations from the fire services about future radio communications and control room requirements, including views on cost and on participation in the PSRC Service. All fire authorities in England and Wales are now required to undertake Best Value reviews of their communications requirements in 2000-01. I am making available to fire authorities this week the results of a consultancy study to assist consideration of their future control room needs. This strongly confirms the benefits of a joined-up approach in exploring technology to create new possibilities for improving cost-effectiveness and service delivery. This will be followed by guidance on take up of the PSRC Service.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para2">The PSRC Service represents a positive approach to options to radio replacement programs within the Ambulance Services. The NHS Executive is reviewing this.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the conduct of the Metropolitan police in relation to protesters during the Chinese Head of State's visit in 1999.  [121298]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The policing arrangements for the State Visit of the President of China were fully reviewed by the Metropolitan police after the visit, and a copy of the review placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para3">Since that time, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has accepted, in the context of court proceedings, that the removal of some flags and banners from protesters was unlawful.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the role of Europol in co-operation with the Russian Federation authorities combating organised crime in the context of the EU Action Plan.  [120851]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In its meeting on 27 March 2000, the Justice and Home Affairs Council approved the European Union Action Plan on common action for the Russian Federation on combating organised crime. In that meeting, the Council also adopted a Decision authorising the Director General of Europol to enter into negotiations on agreements with certain third states, including the Russian Federation, and non-European Union related bodies. The Government welcome this Council Decision which, in the context of the Action Plan, enables Europol to play a full part in supporting co-operation between the member states and the Russian Federation in combating the common threat from organised crime to mutual advantage.

<a name="00509w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Schengen Agreement</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on Government policy on acceding to elements of Schengen in lieu of a third state agreement, as set out in the Council Decision of 27 March, 2000/C106/01; what elements of 



<P>
<P><I>9 May 2000 : Column: 332W</I><P>
information may not be shared under the latter agreement; and what assessment he has made of the additional benefits from direct partial accession.  [120850]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Government have applied to participate in the law enforcement and judicial co-operation aspects of the Schengen acquis, including the Schengen Information System (SIS), in order to enhance co-operation at European Union level in the fight against organised and international crime.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para4">The purpose of the Council Decision referred to is a limited one: it authorises the Director of Europol to enter into negotiations on agreements with third States and non-European Union related bodies. The United Kingdom is, of course, already a full member of Europol.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para5">The Decision does not cover the broader police and judicial co-operation arrangements provided for in the Schengen Convention, nor the opportunity to participate in the SIS.
<P>

<a name="00509w01.html_para6">Europol and the SIS were established for entirely different purposes: the Europol Convention specifically excludes exchanges of information between the two databases. The Government's application to participate in parts of the Schengen acquis is complementary to its existing participation in Europol.

<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hurst: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the cost to the probation services in England and Wales consequent upon the closure of magistrates courts from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1999.  [121030]

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much his Department spent (i) directly and (ii) indirectly on asylum seekers in <i>(a)</i> 1995, <i>(b)</i> 1996, <i>(c)</i> 1997, <i>(d)</i> 1998 and <i>(e)</i> 1999; and what estimate has been made of expenditure in the year 2000.  [119485]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> The following amounts have been directly spent on supporting asylum seekers. Expenditure is recorded by financial year and it is not possible to give figures for calendar years.

<P>
<a name="00509w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Section 577A, Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988 denies tax relief for any payment the making of which constitutes the commission of a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="00509w02.html_para2">This effectively denies relief, inter alia, for any bribe which is contrary to the Prevention of Corruption Acts. There is also a general provision (section 577 ICTA) which denies tax relief for any form of business entertainment, hospitality or gift--so some payments which might be in a grey area might in any event be denied relief without the need to show that they were in any way corrupt payments.
<P>

<a name="00509w02.html_para3">As far as enforcement is concerned, the Inland Revenue examines a proportion of tax returns every year, to ensure that taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. Most of the returns that are examined in detail are selected after a risk assessment, which identifies those cases where errors are most likely, and where the amount at stake is greatest. Tax inspectors are trained to discover evasion, avoidance and technical errors, by establishing the full facts and applying the correct interpretation of tax law. As part of this process they will, where appropriate, make inquiries about claims for expenditure, to ensure that they are allowed under tax law.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> Remicade has been authorised for the treatment of Crohn's disease. The authorisation was obtained through the European Centralised Procedure which is co-ordinated by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. If the marketing authorisation holder applies for a new clinical indication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products at the European Medicines Evaluation Agency will review the available data and transmit its scientific opinion to the European Commission. European marketing authorisations are published in the form of a commission Decision in the official Journal of the European Communities. Presently, remicade does not form part of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's (NICE) work programme for this year. However, NICE's work programme is continually being re-assessed and a number of possible additional topics for appraisal by NICE during the year 2000-01 are currently being considered. An announcement will be made shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the provision of specialist staff through Ethnic Minority and Travellers Educational Achievement Grant funding.  [121253]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00509w04.html_spnew11"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Ethnic Minority and Traveller Achievement Grant (EMTAG) is designed to raise standards for those ethnic minority and traveller pupils at risk of under-achieving and to meet the particular needs of pupils for whom English is an additional language.
<P>

<a name="00509w04.html_para0">We are making available more money than ever before as part of our drive to raise the academic achievements of those ethnic minority groups at risk of under-achieving. For 2000-01, &#163;162.5 million will be available to local education authorities and schools to improve the attainment of ethnic minority, traveller and refugee pupils--an increase of 7 per cent. on the amount available for these purposes in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00509w04.html_para1">A key element of the grant programme is that the funding should largely go direct to schools, so that head teachers can use it where it is most needed--to employ more teachers and teaching assistants and to work with their local communities. Specialist teachers, bilingual assistants and other classroom assistants supported through the grant have a vital role to play in raising standards for ethnic minority pupils. We expect that, depending on local needs, a large proportion of the grant will be spent on teachers and classroom assistants. As a requirement of the grant, local education authorities are required to provide information about their plans for spending the grant and details of actual expenditure. We will also monitor the numbers of specialist staff employed by EMTAG through an independent evaluation of the grant.

 It is unclear what reliability data are referred to in this question.
<P>

<a name="00509w05.html_para0">Test reliability relates to how a test question is answered by children or pupils and how consistently it is interpreted in the way anticipated. This aspect of the test question performance is dealt with by means of pre-testing the questions--a process which occurs twice during the life-cycle of a test question. The Government are satisfied that the quality control procedures for the test development and the marking process is thorough and rigorous. This was reflected in the findings of the Rose Review, an independent cross-party panel set up last year to consider the test development and assessment arrangements at Key Stage 2. The data are not published 



<P>

as they form part of the overall process of judging how well a question performs--which takes into account other, judgmental factors.
<P>

<a name="00509w05.html_para1">Reliability in marking relates to the construction of the mark scheme and how markers interpret the answers to questions. Absolute reliability is achieved when any marker, trained in the use of a markscheme, marks a question and gives it the same mark as any other marker who may mark the same question. Marker training is intended to ensure that marker reliability is as high as possible. Data are collected from markers and analysed each year in relation to the degree of variation from absolute reliability which occurs. The data are used to manage the marking process and remove any markers which may not be performing satisfactorily. As the data relates to individual teachers, they remain confidential.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is currently working with the awarding bodies to develop advice on the list of approved GCSE titles to be offered from 2001. QCA is seeking the views of interested organisations before submitting final recommendations. No decisions have been reached at this stage. There is a wide range of vocationally-related qualifications in agriculture and horticulture already available, including GNVQs in land and environment. We shall ensure that there continues to be an appropriate range of qualifications in all three areas in the future for young people.

 The Department does not collect administrative data on 16-year-olds in education by the type of school attended the previous year. However, estimates of the proportion of 16-year-olds in full-time education in the Spring following Year 11, with a breakdown by school type, are available from the Youth Cohort Study.

We have announced details of the new Connexions Service which will provide advice, guidance, information and support service for all 13 to 19-year-olds, whatever their needs and circumstances. Five Connexions Service pilots were announced on 3 February 2000 evaluating various aspects of the new service.

 The Department does not collect this information. However, using data on school meals take-up, we estimate that the cost of providing free school meals in England in the 1999-2000 financial year was over &#163;300 million. The Department did not collect statistics on the take-up of free school meals before 1989, so we cannot estimate their cost in 1970 and 1980. Under education legislation, local education authorities and schools must offer free school meals to those pupils whose parents receive income support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. We do not collect data on the numbers of eligible pupils from broken homes.
<P>

<a name="00509w06.html_para7">Local education authorities have discretionary powers to offer clothing grants and other miscellaneous subsidies to children in cases of hardship. It is for each authority to set its own eligibility criteria for grant, in the light of local needs and circumstances. The Department does not collect data on these grants.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> The table sets out the number of maintained special schools which have closed in each local education authority area since 1995. It does not include those authorities where no such closures have taken place. It includes closures which have been approved but which have not yet taken place. But the closure of some special schools is usually followed by the opening of others, or by the establishing of special units within mainstream schools.
<P>

<a name="00509w07.html_para1">While there are some special schools which cater for pupils wholly of primary school age, or wholly of secondary school age, there are many others which cover both phases, so it is not possible to split the figures between primary and secondary.

<a name="00509w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much money has been provided to each local education authority, on a ring-fenced basis, for the provision of nursery places for four-year-olds, since May 1997; and what criteria are used by his Department for the expenditure of that money.

<a name="00509w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2000]:</i> The following table shows the estimated amount of specific grant this Government have provided to each Local Education Authority, since May 1997, for four-year-old early education places, amounting to &#163;631.2 million.
<P>

<a name="00509w07.html_para2">The criteria for the provision of this funding is set out in the "Requirements of Nursery Education Grant" which is issued to all Local Education Authorities annually. I have placed a copy of this in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00509w07.html_para3">In addition to this specific grant funding, the table also shows the level of funding provided, since April 1997, for the Under Fives Education Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) sub block, which has increased from &#163;1,089 million in 1997-98 to &#163;1,342 million in 2000-01, an increase of &#163;253 million.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> The report "The Impact of the Human Rights Act on Disabled People" was prepared for, and recently published by, the National Disability Council and The Royal National Institute for Deaf People. The NDC has sent copies to the Chairs of the Disability Rights Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission and to Northern Ireland's Equality Commission and Human Rights Commission and to a range of disability and other organisations, as a contribution to the debate on the human rights legislation.

<a name="00509w08.html_para1">Our latest figures show that in England, over 117,000 accounts had been opened by the end of March 2000. This is against a UK target of 100,000 accounts opened by April 2000, and we are on track to achieve the target of 1 million accounts opened in the lifetime of this Parliament.

Anyone aged 19 or over can open a learning account and claim the incentives. When deciding eligibility for the incentives, we will take into account the type of learning people plan to undertake and any Government financial support they already get for their chosen learning. Child care and transport costs will not be eligible for the incentives.

 We developed an interim evaluation and performance monitoring framework for the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) prior to their establishment on 1 April last year. This framework included a set of core indicators that reflected the purposes for which the RDAs were set up, to be used by the RDAs in developing their regional strategies.
<P>

<a name="00509w08.html_para4">We undertook to review the interim framework within 18 months of the establishment of the RDAs, and we have recently started to take this review forward.

The outcome of the study will inform consideration of transport infrastructure requirements in preparing Regional Planning Guidance, including the need for improvements to the trunk road network.

<a name="00509w09.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A record 130 countries attended the Conference, which took place in a positive and friendly atmosphere in the excellent facilities provided at UNEP HQ.
<P>

<a name="00509w09.html_para14">The Conference considered 62 proposals to amend the species covered by CITES, which are listed in two Appendices. Appendix I lists highly endangered species which are prohibited in international commerce. Appendix II lists other endangered species in the table, which includes details of the final position taken by the 



<P>
<P><I>9 May 2000 : Column: 364W</I><P>
UK (in accordance with the EU's common position) on those proposals which were put to the Conference for decision.
<P>

<a name="00509w09.html_para15">The UK achieved its main objective on the key proposals for elephants, turtles and whales. Our own proposal to list the basking shark on Appendix II achieved 61 per cent. support--the highest vote for any of the three shark proposals before the Conference. Unfortunately a two-thirds majority was required and the majority of states which use basking shark fins voted against our efforts to ensure that fisheries were managed sustainably and trade levels monitored.
<P>

<a name="00509w09.html_para16">We were particularly disappointed that representatives from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) intervened in the debate on behalf of overseas fishing industry interests, and partly disowned their own technical report which showed that species like the basking shark are particularly suitable for CITES management. Given the continuing threat to this species, and the strength of our scientific case which was widely acknowledged, the Government intend to work with our European Union colleagues to list the basking shark on Appendix III of CITES as soon as possible. If agreed, this would make any transaction between the EU and other states in basking shark products subject to the EU CITES Regulations.
<P>

<a name="00509w09.html_para17">Another major UK proposal at the Conference--to establish a working group to address unsustainable trade in bushmeat--has been strongly endorsed. Initially, the working group will focus on the management of bushmeat harvesting and trade in six African countries with particular problems such as dislocation caused by irresponsible forest exploitation by international timber companies and unsustainable demand for bushmeat from urban areas. My Department is making &#163;50,000 available in the current financial year to support this initiative, and we look forward to contributions from other CITES Parties and non-Governmental bodies.
<P>

<a name="00509w09.html_para18">I would also like to highlight two other UK achievements at the Conferences. First we ensured that most of the tough recommendations made in the recent CITES Tiger Missions, led by the UK, were endorsed and that countries which fail to implement them can as a last resort face wildlife trade sanctions. As a potential consumer state, the UK will continue to maintain a vigilant profile through education, detection and prosecution to prevent any revival in the use of tiger products for traditional medicine in this country. Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to representatives of HM Customs and Excise and the Police who organised a widely praised exhibition of the UK's work to enforce CITES. Two recent convictions in the UK for illegal trade in shahtoosh and parrots have demonstrated the increasing commitment of statutory enforcement agencies to tackle wildlife crime. I hope that the proposed Wildlife Crime Unit, which I announced on 16 February, will enable us to build on these achievements.

 Offences which are taken into consideration in Great Britain when assessing "fit and proper person" status are those set out in regulation 3 of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994 No. 1056) (as amended). Convictions in other countries are not currently taken into consideration when assessing applicants' fit and proper person status for the purpose of these provisions and waste management licensing. However, we are considering whether the list of relevant offences should be extended to take into account convictions in other EU countries, although there is at present no EU-wide mechanism to support such a system.

<P>
<a name="00509w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As stated in our recently published Road Safety Strategy "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", we believe that the anticipated European Commission proposal to make all new car fronts safer would be the best way of preventing particularly dangerous bull bars being fitted to vehicles. We are currently awaiting the opportunity to examine the details of the Commission's draft proposal. We had expected this to be put forward in mid-March, and were disappointed when this proved not to be possible. We are now urging the Commission to bring forward their proposal at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="00509w10.html_para1">We are keen to see bull bars tackled as soon as possible, on an effective Europe-wide basis. We are therefore also submitting a scientific proposal to the Commission for bull bars to be controlled by an amendment to the external projections directive as an interim measure.

 20 per cent. of London Underground stations have wheelchair access to at least one direction of travel on at least one line. It is anticipated that the number of tube stations with disabled access will increase to 45 per cent. through the PPP contracts.
<P>

<a name="00509w10.html_para2">22 per cent. of Railtrack stations have wheelchair access from the street.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No. The Government set out their policy towards dealing with the problems of traffic noise arising from motorways and other roads managed by the Highways Agency in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England". We expect considerable benefits to be achieved by the increased use of quieter surfaces both for new trunk roads and for those needing maintenance. In addition, we have asked the Highways Agency to consider the case for providing noise mitigation in the worst cases where no other action was being taken to provide relief for residential properties. The Government are also supporting the implementation of a proposed EU Directive that will require vehicle tyres to meet noise emission limits.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Highways Agency is required to assess the potential adverse effects on the environment of any modifications to existing motorways which involve physical alterations. With regard to noise, the effectiveness of any existing sound barriers will be taken into account and proposals for upgrading them or for alternative measures to be provided in conjunction with the alteration will be considered.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00509w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Health and Safety Executive inspectors carry out routine preventative inspections of workplaces according to the hazards and risks of the workplace. With open-cast coal mines such inspections are normally made once per year. In addition an inspector may visit for other reasons, e.g. to investigate an accident or complaint.
<P>

<a name="00509w10.html_para3">As of 31 March 2000 there were 106 open-cast coal mines registered in Scotland of which 28 were operational. All the operational sites were inspected during 1999-2000. Over the last three years a total of 254 inspection contacts were recorded at open-cast sites in Scotland by inspectors. These included visits to non-operational sites to check their status.
<P>

 Action included numerous meetings with the French Ministry of Transport and with the Interior Ministry, initially to clarify the scope of the French compensation code, the legal and administrative procedures for submitting claims and the basis on which claims should be prepared. Subsequent meetings dealt with the lack of consistency among Prefectures in the application of the rules; their application in particular circumstances, including in respect of lorries that were blocked in more than one Departement and those that were prevented from entering France; the delay in processing claims and the revised arrangements introduced to speed up the process. The trade associations were also represented at some of the meetings.
<P>

<a name="00509w10.html_para5">Officials also spent a great deal of time giving guidance to claimants and assisting them in lodging claims. However, claimants are under no obligation to inform the Department of the outcome of their cases. We are therefore unable to provide information about amounts of compensation paid and refused.

 Local traffic authorities have the powers to introduce 20mph speed limits and associated signing without seeking consent from the Secretary of State. For the pilot home zones in England, we will consider authorising the use of advisory 10mph maximum speed signs. This will depend on the effectiveness of engineering measures or 20mph speed limits in reducing vehicle speeds.

 The Department assessed levels of passenger demand for Croydon Tramlink prior to the Concession Agreement being signed in 1996. In line with the PFI nature of the project, assessment of passenger demand for Tramlink is now a matter for the concessionaire Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. (TCL).

 As the hon. Member is aware, an early retirement scheme is one of the discretionary measures provided for under the Rural Development Regulation. However, such a scheme would be expensive. It would benefit relatively few people and would have to be paid for by many others. Given the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development's existing budget and current commitments, it is simply not affordable at present. As a result, an early retirement scheme has not been included as one of the measures to be introduced in Northern Ireland in the period 2000-06 under the Rural Development (Accompanying Measures) Plan. However, a scheme has not been entirely ruled out and can be considered in the later years of the Plan period when modulation receipts are at their maximum. It is, however, a very costly option and it would need to be demonstrated that such a scheme would offer value for money.

<a name="00509w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Compulsory agrimonetary compensation totalling up to &#163;88 million will be payable in 2000 to the UK arable, beef and sheep sectors. The Prime Minister's announcement of 30 March 2000 made available further optional compensation totalling &#163;66 million to the beef, sheep and dairy sectors. This balanced the difficulties faced by the agricultural industry with the impact on the UK Exchequer. Drawing down agrimonetary compensation (which must be paid on a UK-wide basis) has considerable public expenditure implications: once the Fontainbleau rebate is taken into account, the cost of the 30 March agrimonetary package to the UK Exchequer is approximately &#163;50 million. Expenditure of the magnitude involved must be judged carefully against the many competing demands on the public purse.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Question about the flying of the Union Flag at the Roads Service Maintenance Depot, Ballinahonemore Road, Armagh.
<BR>
I can advise that a Union Flag has been provided at the Depot and that the Premises Officer for the building is responsible for flying the flag on the designated dates. Regrettably, due to an oversight, the flag was not flown on St. Patrick's Day or Easter Day this year. I have, however, reminded relevant staff of the instructions for flags to be flown on designated dates.

I hope you find this information helpful.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00509w12.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 A Swiss company, Prionics, has developed a test for the post mortem diagnosis of BSE in cattle, the Prionics Check Test. In a recent evaluation of selected BSE screening diagnostic tests conducted under the auspices of the European Commission, the Prionics Check Test detected all clinically affected animals which were histopathologically positive. Prionics have also published the results of a validation of their test on clinical cattle. Swiss authorities have used the test to survey healthy cattle slaughtered for human consumption, casualty animals also slaughtered for human consumption and fallen stock. They have identified a small number of positive animals, especially among the casualty and fallen stock categories.




<P>
<P><I>9 May 2000 : Column: 376W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00509w12.html_para0">This test was employed in a survey of British cattle more than five years of age slaughtered under the over-thirty- months scheme. The survey involved the examination of a systematic sample of 4,136 cattle. The Prionics Check Test was not found to be more sensitive than conventional histopathological examination of brain samples. The comparative data obtained by histopathological diagnosis at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency indicate that the Prionics Check Test is capable of detecting BSE-infected animals only three months or less before the onset of clinical signs and, at present, cannot be regarded as being capable of detecting BSE-infected animals at an earlier stage.

 A "gentlemen's agreement" has been reached with Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands--welcomed by the UK industry--on the withdrawal of beam trawlers until 1 May from the northern part of the Irish sea closed to protect spawning cod. In the context of arriving at that agreement, the UK undertook to transfer 190 tonnes of North Sea plaice and 5 tonnes of sole in ICES Areas VIId and VIIfg to the Belgian authorities for them to allocate.




<P>
<P><I>9 May 2000 : Column: 377W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00509w12.html_para1">This transfer was in recognition of the good will shown by the Belgians, who have substantial flatfish quotas in the Irish sea, in reaching agreement with us and of our on-going co-operation with them in matters of quota management including assistance with quota transfer to ourselves. The transfer was not the subject of prior consultation with the industry but it came from stocks that were underfished in 1999, particularly North sea plaice where the underfish exceeded 10,000 tonnes.
<P>

<a name="00509w12.html_para2">No British fisherman will suffer a reduction in fishing opportunities as a result of this arrangement. 50 tonnes of North sea sole obtained through economic link license conditions has also been allocated to the inshore sector.

 Winter Fuel Payments are provided to older people who are ordinarily resident in Great Britain to help towards their winter heating costs. Where someone is already receiving public assistance with their heating costs it is inappropriate for a Winter Fuel Payment to be made. For example, payments are inappropriate for people living permanently in residential care or nursing homes who also receive help through Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. It is also inappropriate for Winter Fuel Payments be made to people who do not contribute towards their heating costs, such as those serving a prison sentence or those who have been receiving free hospital in-patient treatment.
