<p><a name="41018w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress is being made in reducing poverty in the Palestinian territories.  [190654]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2004 : Column 431W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="41018w01.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Little progress is being made in reducing poverty in the Palestinian territory. Palestinian poverty has increased dramatically since September 2000. According to the latest World Bank report, approximately 50 per cent. of Palestinians are living in poverty on less than $2.1 per day. 16 per cent. of the total population currently live in deep or absolute poverty on less than $1.5 per day. While international aid has not prevented the increase in poverty, it has prevented even more Palestinians falling into extreme poverty and desperation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w01.html_para1">
Poverty reduction is unlikely to be achieved without a major reform of the Israeli imposed closure regime. This would allow the Palestinian economy to grow again and humanitarian aid to be delivered effectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what measures his Department is taking to encourage transparency and accountability in <i>(a)</i> European and <i>(b)</i> international funding to the Palestinian Authority.  [190655]</p>




<p><a name="41018w01.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Substantial progress has been made since 2002 in improving the transparency and accountability of the Palestinian Authority&#039;s (PA) financial management systems. This has largely been the result of work by the Palestinian Finance Minister with donor encouragement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w01.html_para2">
DFID supported a World Bank Country Financial Accountability Assessment that endorsed the major improvements made. It also identified action needed to further improve systems. The World Bank Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund has encouraged further financial reform. Disbursement of funding is conditional on the PA&#039;s achievement of agreed benchmarks, including on financial control management, auditing, and procurement. DFID and the EC have contributed to the Trust Fund. The World Bank and donors are carefully monitoring the use of donor funds. This benchmark approach was also successfully used by the EC in its earlier budget support to the PA. Allegations about the misuse of these funds have been looked at in great detail, but no conclusive evidence has been found that EC funds have been used for anything other than their original purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w01.html_para3">
OLAF, the independent EU anti-fraud office, has also been investigating these matters for over a year. OLAF&#039;s provisional assessment of 10 August stated that, to date there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted EU Direct Budget Assistance to the Palestinian Authority have been used to finance illegal activities, including terrorism. This is a provisional assessment. The investigations are still on-going.

 Network Rail advises that it aims to contact relevant statutory bodies such as English Nature and Scottish Natural Heritage, well in advance of operations in order to ensure that any necessary permissions or licences are obtained. If environmental surveys have identified that operations may have significant environmental impact, communication with these statutory bodies and their experts will then take place to identify procedures that may reduce the impact while still ensuring the safety and reliability of the railway.

<p><a name="41018w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Emissions from new equipment, including lawnmowers, powered by small petrol engines under 19kW engine power are regulated by the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (Emission of Gaseous and Particulate Pollutants) Regulations 2004 (S.L 2004 No. 2034). These Regulations transpose EU Directive 2002/88/EC into UK law and take effect for new engines being placed on the market from 11 February 2005.

<p><a name="41018w02.html_spnew7"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority compared the British Airline Pilots Association survey results with its mandatory occurrence reports. Much of the survey data related to low level events, often with inconclusive connections to contaminated air. Inclusion of the survey data in the Authority&#039;s database would not have advanced or improved the formal intervention action taken to mitigate the threat to safety posed by impairment of pilot performance through exposure to contaminated air. BALPA&#039;s data aligns with the CAA&#039;s assessment that there is a downward trend in the number of air contamination events now being reported.

 Examiners routinely seek to maintain professional and mutually beneficial working relationships with driving instructors. Many local driving instructor organisations hold regular meetings.

<p><a name="41018w03.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what role he foresees for <i>(a)</i> driving instructors and <i>(b)</i> the Driving Standards Authority in enhancing road safety.  [191027]</p>




<p><a name="41018w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The government&#039;s Road Safety&#151;&quot;Tomorrow&#039;s Roads Safer for Everyone&quot;&#151;was published in 2000. It identifies key roles for the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) and driving instructors in improving road safety.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w03.html_para0">
The contribution of skilled and well-motivated driving instructors is central to delivering higher standards and improved road safety. Their input is significant, not only in terms of initial driver training but also in encouraging novice drivers to further develop their skills (eg by taking the &quot;Pass Plus&quot; course).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w03.html_para1">
DSA&#039;s primary aim is to promote road safety through improving driving standards. Initially this centred on driver testing and the regulation of instructors that provide tuition in the driving of motor cars. However, the Strategy envisages a significant increase in DSA&#039;s road safety remit, including raising the standards of all driver training both pre- and post-test. The Government want to raise the quality and expertise of all driving instructors to that of the best.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to make the Driving Standards Authority more accountable; and what continuing professional development is available to driving test examiners.  [191036]</p>




<p><a name="41018w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) is responsible to Parliament via the Secretary of State for Transport. Ministers set the agency demanding targets on performance, efficiency and service delivery and require regular updates on progress. Key priorities are contained in DSA&#039;s Business Plan and Annual Report and Accounts. The latter also reports performance against targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w03.html_para2">

<p><a name="41018w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 15 October 2004]:</i> The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) administers a Trainer Booking Scheme. This enables those organisations providing training in riding a motorcycle or driving a lorry or bus to book practical test appointments up to 10 weeks in advance. Neither the name of the candidate nor the vehicle details are required at that time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w03.html_para4">
Candidate and vehicle details must be provided shortly before the date of the test to enable DSA to confirm that the candidate has the necessary driving licence entitlement to take the test, that the appropriate test has been booked for the category of vehicle concerned and that the vehicle meets the minimum test requirements for that test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w03.html_para5">
For lorry and bus tests, the test centre manoeuvring area has to be set out to accommodate vehicles of differing lengths. Having vehicle details in advance of the test saves DSA time in setting up the area and reduces inconvenience to the candidate.

<p><a name="41018w04.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Boxing&#039;s governing bodies, under the guidance of Sport England, are required continuously to research and implement new safety measures. In amateur boxing, such measures have included the reduction in the duration of rounds of boxing from 3 to 2 minutes, a reduction in the weight categories from 3 kgs to 2 kgs for Junior Competition (Under 15) and an increase in the size of competition gloves from 8oz to 10oz. Amateur Boxing is also the only sport which requires and provides a comprehensive and updated medical history card for every participant which is completed by a doctor every time a competitor participates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w04.html_para1">
The introduction of these safety factors throughout the UK has seen a marked reduction in the number of bouts stopped by a referee. Evidence of this can be gained from the recent Olympic Games in Athens where out of 276 bouts contested, only one was stopped and this involved Great Britain&#039;s Amir Khan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w04.html_para2">
The Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABAofE) recommended the introduction of the &quot;Kid Gloves&quot; programme (a non-contact form of boxing). The programme offers a disciplined and controlled environment where young people can learn to box in a drug and alcohol free environment.

 It is widely accepted good practice for employees to have the right of appeal against any dismissal, disciplinary or grievance decision. This has always been reflected in the ACAS Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures and the revised Code does not differ from the previous version in this respect.

 The chemicals industry is rightly a highly regulated sector. This regulation is there to protect health and the natural environment.

In order to enable us to address this balance in a more systematic way in line with the Government&#039;s Principles of Good Regulation, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the 2004 Budget Statement the establishment of a Chemicals Regulatory Forum. This forum is designed to provide both Government and industry with a better grasp of the cumulative impact and inter-relationship of existing regulation, and to offer the opportunity for an improved dialogue on emerging policy and regulatory proposals emanating from both the UK and the EU.

<p><a name="41018w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 In order to reduce the ratio between relevant calls received and those referred to Legal Services Directorate (LSD), the message on the Enforcement Hotline was amended in April 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w06.html_para0">
The message now clearly states the purpose of the Hotline and refers callers to the DTI Companies Investigation Branch or Office of Fair Trading if their query concerns a trading company; and to the Insolvency Service Central Enquiry Line for general insolvency queries. This has had the effect of reducing the number of invalid calls to the Hotline and will therefore reduce the ratio between the calls received and cases subsequently referred to LSD. Cases are referred to LSD by the Insolvency Service when there is an allegation of a criminal offence contrary to insolvency legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w06.html_para1">
Decisions to investigate criminal allegations are taken by lawyers within the DTI. A lawyer will consider all the information or evidence available at the time and if it is considered that there is sufficient information or evidence then the complaint is passed to the Departments own Investigation Officers Section to conduct a criminal investigation into the complaint. Once the investigation is complete the lawyer will then consider whether in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and whether it is in the public interest to institute criminal proceedings.
</p>


<p>

 The public expects high standards of conduct by members and officers of local authorities. To help ensure them, the Government established a new ethical framework for local government under the Local Government Act 2000 and subsequent Regulations. Every local authority was required to adopt, by May 2002, a local code setting out the standards of conduct expected of its members. Such codes must include all the provisions of the Model Code issued by the Government. An independent body, the Standards Board for England, was established to investigate allegations that members have breached the code, and local authorities&#039; standards committees were given a role in promoting high standards of conduct locally. Regulations have recently been put in place to provide for local investigation and determination of less serious allegations of misconduct.

The Government&#039;s commitment to the provision of green space, including allotments, is laid out in Planning Policy Statement 1 which states that well designed public and green spaces are required as part of building sustainable communities. The Government states in Planning Policy Guidance 17 that open space standards are best set at a local level, as national standards cannot cater for local circumstances. Local authorities are expected to carry out assessments of the needs of their communities that will be used to set robust standards for the provision of all types of open spaces. This applies equally to the Thames Gateway as elsewhere in the country. Planning Policy Guidance 3 (PPG3) emphasises the value open spaces such as allotments can add to a community and classes allotments as open spaces so that they can be protected from the priority given to development on brownfield land.

The document recognises the importance that allotments can play in helping to contribute to a diverse greenspace network across the Thames Gateway as well as offering a way for local people to take gentle exercise and have more direct contact with a supply of healthy food.

 The work to rule by health and safety inspectors has had no effect on the efficiency of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). Although the work to rule continues to cause some internal management difficulties and has reduced the level of some activities, I am assured by the Health and Safety Executive that there has been no impact on health and safety standards. Senior managers in the NII are re-prioritising work to ensure inspectors focus on significant safety issues with less urgent work being postponed.

 Following the entry of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union on 1 May 2004, Cypriot nationals like all other EEA nationals may exercise free movement rights in the UK including the right to enter the UK on production of a valid passport or identity card. This right of movement includes the right of movement as a worker. To exercise these rights they must be in possession of a passport or identity card issued by the Republic of Cyprus.

Documentation that has been issued by the so called &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot; (&quot;TRNC&quot;) would not be accepted as evidence that the individual has the right of free movement as an EEA national or for travel to the UK. The holder of a &quot;TRNC&quot; document would need to obtain a visa if coming to the UK and that visa would be endorsed on a declaration of identity issued to them by the British visa issuing post. The declaration of identity is valid for travel to the UK.

Turkish Cypriots are EU citizens. They can apply for Republic of Cyprus passports and travel freely within the freedom to work on documentation in the same way as other Cypriot nationals. The suspension of the acquis in the north of Cyprus does not affect that right.

Sight tests provide the ideal opportunity to review all aspects of eye health, including investigations for signs of disease. Those at risk of specific eye disease, for example, diabetic retinopathy, may be asked to attend regular screening.

We have also invested an additional &#163;73 million to deliver shorter waiting times for cataract patients so that no patient will wait more than three months by December 2004.

3. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<br>

4. Three month vacancy rates for non-medical staff are calculated using staff in post from the vacancy survey, March 2003.<br>

5. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>

6. &#039;&#151;&#039; = zero.<br>

7. Staff in post data is from the non-medical workforce census, September 2002.<br>

8. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

9. Calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<br>

 My Department has not undertaken a review of beneficiaries of an estate being appointed as sole executors, nor does it plan to do so. The current law relating to the powers of sole executors who are also beneficiaries under the will, is clear and appears to be working well. Executors are under a statutory duty to administer the deceased&#039;s estate according to law, and under a statutory duty of care to exercise reasonable care and skill in administering the estate. A beneficiary may seek legal redress should an executor breach any such duty. In addition, measures exist which allow beneficiaries under a will to check that a sole executor is administering the estate properly. When the grant of probate is made to the executor, the will becomes a public document and is available for inspection by anyone at the Principal Registry in London, or the relevant District Probate Registry. Any person interested in the deceased&#039;s estate may also apply to the court for an order requiring the executor to produce a full inventory of the estate as well as an account of the administration of the estate.

These provisions apply to assured tenancies in the social and private rented sector. The court must make an order for possession where a notice is correctly served under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988, provided the requirements laid down by legislation are met, i.e., the proceedings for possession should have been brought within the time limit specified in the notice; nothing in the terms of the assured tenancy prevents it from being brought to an end on ground 8 of Part 1 of Schedule 2; and, both at the date of the service of notice under section 8 relating to the proceedings for possession and at the date of the hearing, rent which is payable weekly or fortnightly, has been unpaid for at least eight weeks.

 Where a successful party (the claimant), decides to enforce non-payment of money due from the losing party (the defendant), the claimant will instruct the court on the form of enforcement they wish to pursue.

<p><a name="41018w21.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Paul Murphy: </b> 
 There are three Government Departments, along with the Police Service of Northern Ireland that are currently taking action directly relevant to the safety of older people within Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para5">
The Office of the First Minister Deputy First Minister has, on 21 June 2004, launched a consultative document on &quot;Ageing in an Inclusive Society&quot;. Within a broad range of objectives, the safety of older people is highlighted, with a number of recommendations made to improve their personal security and address the fear of crime being experienced by them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para6">
The Northern Ireland Office, through its Community Safety Unit, has implemented a wide range of initiatives specifically to address crime and the fear of crime experienced by older people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para7">
Major programmes of work such as the Stay Safe Stay Secure Campaign will spend &#163;2.58 million over the next few years through a range of initiatives including providing home security measures in more than 10,000 older persons homes through the Lock Out Crime Scheme. It will also raise safety awareness among older people through innovative media and communication initiatives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para8">
The provision of significant funding to 20 local community-based projects aimed at addressing the community safety of older people and vulnerable adults, the recent launch of the Neighbourhood Watch NI Programme, the putting in place of Community Safety Partnerships in each council area and their development of local community safety strategies, the forthcoming release of a consultative document on the Community Safety of Older People, and the imminent introduction of Anti-Social Behaviour Order legislation, will have major impacts on the safety of older people including countering the attacks on older people which all right minded people acknowledge is so abhorrent in a civilised society.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para9">
The Department for Social Development has, through the Northern Ireland Housing Executive&#039;s delivery of the Lock Out Crime Scheme, on behalf of the Northern Ireland Office, and the 10 Estates Project, also contributed to Government&#039;s efforts in relation to the safety of older people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para10">
Finally, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has, in addition to dealing with crimes of assault and robbery of older people, more than 70 local initiatives aimed at providing crime prevention advice and measures to older people across Northern Ireland.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2004 : Column 507W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para11">
The Police Service held a major conference in Belfast this year, the second day of which was specifically aimed at addressing the concerns of older people. It has also set up an Older Persons Independent Advisory Forum with which to discuss policy matters specific to them including the Policing Strategy for Older People currently being drafted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41018w21.html_para12">
I believe that the breadth and extent of the actions being taken by Government Departments and the Police Service in relation to the safety and security of older people will have major and positive outcomes in relation to the quality of life experienced by them. In particular, they will help prevent those mercifully few but totally unacceptable attacks on older people, which we hear and see in the media.

 Between 1965 and 1998 three exhibition construction companies appealed to a tribunal. In two cases the appeals were successful as the tribunals decided that the employers&#039; main activity was not the erection or dismantling of exhibition stands. The third case concerned the amount of the levy assessment and the appeal was lost because the employer failed to show why a lower assessment should have been made.

Since 1999 a small number of employers initiated appeals but they were withdrawn before a hearing began.

<p><a name="41018w29.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Suitable and stable accommodation is one of the most important influences on the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged. The provisions in the Children Bill followed the consultation on the Every Child Matters Green Paper, which itself outlined the steps the Government has been taking in the wake of the Homelessness Act 2002. As that consultation acknowledged, it is important that planning and decisions on housing and accommodation are influenced by the wider needs of children across an area, whether the responsibility sits with the top tier authority or not. That is why the Government has included in the Children Bill powers to make district councils one of the statutory partners in local children&#039;s service co-operation arrangements. The Bill also places them under a duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in carrying out their functions, including housing. The Bill allows for the remit of the Director of Children&#039;s Service to be extended to cover any housing duties the authority has, where the makes sense locally.

<p><a name="41018w29.html_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 For the two year period, 2004&#150;06, we have given local authorities &#163;129.9 million to help recruit, train and develop their early years&#039; work force. We have also encouraged them to work closely with their local Learning and Skills Councils to put in place shared targets for training new and existing workers to Level 2 and 3. We do though recognise the crucial role that leaders can play in motivating and developing staff, and improving outcomes for children, within early years&#039; settings. To this end, we have developed a national programme, leading to a professional qualification, to meet the needs of leaders within integrated centres. We are also now consulting on the key elements of effective early years practice to inform future training and so equip practitioners with the key skills and the confidence necessary to support all children to reach their full potential. We believe these developments will help to improve staff retention and, in turn, raise the quality of provision within the sector.

We recognise that a clear career structure is important if we are to improve retention rates among the early years&#039; work force. This is one of the things our pay and work force strategy for the children&#039;s work force, due to be published this autumn, will address. The strategy will contain action to make working with children, including those under five, a more attractive career option. This will include developing flexible career and training pathways, developing a common core of skills and knowledge that promotes professionals in different sectors working together, and establishing a Children, Young People and Families Workforce Council which will represent the interests of the sector.

The capital funding available for investment in all Voluntary Aided (VA) schools is a fair share of the total capital budget for school buildings.

Once fully qualified, all teachers are expected to continue to develop their knowledge and skills according to their personal needs and the needs of those they teach.

 At Budget 2004, the published forecast for inheritance tax receipts in 2004&#150;05 was &#163;2.8 billion based on a threshold of &#163;263,000. Taking each of the regimes <i>(a)</i> to <i>(l)</i> as a separate and independent system applying from April 2004, then I estimate that the receipts would have been those that appear in the table.
