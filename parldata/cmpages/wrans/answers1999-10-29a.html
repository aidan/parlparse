To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on what date the Highways Agency agreed to postpone the widening of the A1 Western Bypass between North Gosforth and Ponteland Road interchanges consequent upon the development of the Northern Development Area, Newcastle; who were the parties to this agreement; and what size of development will be permitted prior to widening.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question. You asked "on what date the Highways Agency agreed to postpone the widening of the A1 Western Bypass between North Gosforth and Ponteland Road interchanges consequent upon the development of the Northern Development Area; who were the parties to this agreement; and what size of development will now be permitted prior to widening".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only widening of the A1 between North Gosforth and Ponteland Road that the Highways Agency has considered is as a consequence of the development proposals for the Northern Development Area. If the development had been granted planning permission, the timing of the widening would have depended on the implementation of the development. No decision has been made on this; it would have been the subject of discussion and agreement with the developer had planning permission been granted.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The application for the Northern Development Area was withdrawn on 3 September 1999. A new application was submitted on the same day for Newcastle Great Park that proposes similar improvements to the A1 Trunk Road.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new traffic impact assessment has been produced and is currently with the Agency for consideration. As part of those considerations, the size of the development that will be permitted prior to widening will be discussed.</FONT></UL>

<a name="91029w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were the traffic flows along the A1 Western Bypass of Newcastle and Gateshead at <i>(a)</i> the Metrocentre interchange, <i>(b)</i> the Tyne River crossing, <i>(c)</i> the Ponteland Road interchange and <i>(d)</i> the North Gosforth interchange in (i) 1995, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998 and (iv) 1999; and what flows are projected for (1) 2002, (2) 2005 and (3) 2010 (x) with and (y) without, the development of the Northern Development Area, Newcastle.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question. You asked for the traffic flows along the A1 Western Bypass of Newcastle and Gateshead from the Metro Centre to North Gosforth, including the Tyne Crossing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The attached table, Annex A, sets out the information you requested at the locations where we have traffic counters for the years 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999 together with projected flows for the years 2002, 2005 and 2010 without the development of Northern Development Area, Newcastle.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A copy of the traffic flows with and without the development for Northern Development Area at assessment year 2013 at Annex B has been placed in the library. In considering planning applications, developers are only required to assess traffic flows for 15 years after the development is brought into use (the assessment year). We do not therefore have the figures for intermediate years. You will note that these are peak hour flows as these are the flows we have used in making our assessment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you may be aware, the application for Northern Development Area was withdrawn on 3 September 1999 and a new application submitted on the same day for Newcastle Great Park that proposes similar improvements to the A1 Trunk Road.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new traffic impact assessment has been produced and is currently with the Highways Agency for consideration. We have asked for more traffic-forecast information from the developer with a revised date of opening of 2000 with the assessment year of 2015. Our initial impression is that the traffic impact will be different from the Northern Development Area application, but until we have this further information and have studied it, we cannot be sure. I am sorry therefore that we do not yet have the information that you have requested in relation to the Newcastle Great Park development.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps the Government are taking to encourage the use of public transport by children travelling to and from school.  [95766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91029w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In December 1998 we established the School Travel Advisory Group (STAG) to promote best practice and develop a more coherent approach to school travel issues.
<P>

<a name="91029w01.htm_para3">STAG oversees a programme of research which includes a project, due for completion in Summer 2000, to identify good practice in increasing bus use for journeys to and from school. This will lead to the publication of a guide for local authorities and operators.
<P>

<a name="91029w01.htm_para4">STAG has also overseen the preparation of two guides published in June, one for local authorities and one for parents, teachers and school governors, which include guidance on increasing the use of public transport by children travelling to and from school. Both guides also include guidance on increasing levels of walking and cycling.
<P>

<a name="91029w01.htm_para5">I have arranged for a copy of both guides to be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91029w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) is prepared by regional planning bodies made up of the local authorities in the region, working with other stakeholders. A Panel, appointed by the Secretary of State, then holds a Public Examination into the draft guidance. Draft Planning Policy Guidance note 11: <i>Regional Planning</i> advises the Panel to consult local planning authorities, through the regional planning body, in drawing up the list of participants and matters selected for examination by the Panel. The Guidance also advises that the regional planning body should be represented at the public examination. Individual local authorities may also participate at the examination (as they have done at the recent examinations into draft RPG for East Anglia and the South East). Once he has considered the Panel report, the Secretary of State will publish draft changes to the regional guidance for a further short public consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends <i>(a)</i> to publish the findings of the National Speed Policy Review and <i>(b)</i> to begin wider public consultation on national speed policy; what representations he has already had with regard to the national speed policy; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91029w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Review of Speed Policy is nearing completion and the conclusions and recommendations will be published shortly. Recommendations requiring changes to legislation will be developed into proposals, and consultation on these will take place. A large number of representations covering wide ranging interests and views has been made about the review, including more than 100 replies in response to the discussion document which was circulated by my Department during the summer.

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1999]:</i> There are no immediate plans for further bus or priority lanes on national motorways: on all purpose trunk roads they will continue to be considered as an option to address transport problems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91029w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The term "community transport" covers a wide range of different services and organisations. The cost of extending the scope of the Fuel Duty Rebate scheme would depend on the precise definition of eligibility adopted.
<P>

<a name="91029w02.htm_para0">Changes to the scope of the scheme will shortly be considered by the Commission for Integrated Transport as part of its study of value for money for public support for bus services.

 The Oxford Transport Strategy has been implemented as a rolling programme since its adoption in 1993, supported by a specific central Government funding from 1994-95 onwards. Oxfordshire County Council has established a programme of continuous monitoring to assess the impact of the Oxford Transport Strategy. They estimate that car flows into the central area of Oxford have decreased by about 4.5 per cent. from 1991 to 1998. The Government will continue to assess the results of this monitoring as part of the Local Transport Plan funding regime.

As indicated last year, the scheme will operate cumulatively. For each authority, we will use its previous year's council tax at guideline as the starting point.

<P>
<a name="91029w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I expect to be able to announce to the House full details of the proposed Revenue Support Grant distribution in late November. However it would be helpful both to hon. Members and local authorities to announce now what I am minded to do in terms of grant distribution, phasing in or changes, and consultation.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para1">This year, I propose to set considerable store by stability in the grant system, to help councils plan ahead. In our July 1998 White Paper, "Modern Local Government--In Touch With The People", we said that we would not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs,) except, for example, where there are changes in the functions of councils, or the financing of particular services. We said that the SSAs of individual councils would change to reflect changes in demand for their services as reflected in the data used to calculate the SSAs.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para2">The totals of SSAs will change this year to reflect the increased funding announced last July in the Comprehensive Spending Review. There will be changes to reflect new functions or financing arrangements. The &#163;150 million from the Service Development Fund which we had put in the Education SSA total to help meet the costs of implementing the pay reforms proposed in the Teachers' Green Paper will now be paid as part of a special Grant for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para3">Our present intention is that, subject to consultation, and approval by the House, we shall not make any changes to the method of grant distribution generally. We shall need to make some limited adjustments to SSAs to accommodate the establishment of the Greater London Authority (GLA) and related changes, most notably those arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan Police area and the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey police areas.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para4">We intend to adopt similar rules for Central Support Protection Grant and the SSA Reduction Grant as for this year. This would mean that no authority would receive less central support in 2000-01 than in 1999-2000, and every education authority would receive at least a 1.5 per cent. increase in central support. In both cases, the comparisons must make allowance for the changes connected with the creation of the GLA. The SSA Reduction Grant would operate in the same way as in 1999-2000 but with comparisons moved on a year as necessary.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para5">I am sure that this early indication of our intentions will be welcomed by most authorities for the extra certainty which it gives them in the early stages of their budget decisions for next year.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para6">Given the degree of stability that we propose this year, I do not intend to invite local authorities to hold meetings with Ministers during consultation on the settlement. I expect authorities to put any points in writing; they will all be considered before I finalise my proposals. I shall meet the local authority associations so that they can put any points directly to me. Individual local authorities of course can channel their comments through the associations.

 As my predecessor explained in her answer to my hon.

<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para7">We have received an application from Serco Metrolink relating to the new trams they wish to introduce on the Manchester Metrolink extension to Eccles via Salford Quays. The exemptions, which are of a very minor nature, have been discussed with our statutory advisers the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. An exemption Order relating to the exemption of these trams has been laid in Parliament today. Copies are available from the Library.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para8">Applications for exemption from certain aspects of the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 have also been received from both South West Trains Ltd. for their Class 458 rail vehicles and ScotRail Railways Ltd. for their Class 170/4 rail vehicles. The exemptions sought were also discussed with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. Exemption Orders relating to the South West Trains vehicles and the ScotRail vehicles were laid before Parliament on 3 September and 13 September respectively. Copies are also available from the Library.
<P>

<a name="91029w03.htm_para9">The exemptions will not prevent disabled people from using the new trams or trains. Indeed, we believe that their introduction will make a significant contribution to improving mobility opportunities for disabled people.

The Government Actuary's Department is responsible for certifying that any new scheme they join offers broadly comparable benefits to those offered by the PCSPS. Staff will be treated fairly and in line with the Government's Statement of Practice for Staff Transfers in the Public Sector which sets out comprehensive guidance for the treatment of staff in PPP deals, including new guidance on the protection of staff pensions.

 The Biological, Radiological and Chemical Information System (BRACIS) is a computer-based prediction system. If a Biological, Radiological or Chemical hazard were detected, the system would assist commanders in the field to understand the implications of the hazard, and take appropriate action.

<a name="91029w04.htm_para0">BRACIS was acquired in 1995 and is used by all three Services. An updated version of the software was acquired

<P>

<a name="91029w04.htm_para2">In the event of marital breakdown, the Marital Category of the Service person is changed from married to single. At this point, unless the Service person has custodial responsibilities for a child, they are no longer entitled to occupy a Family Quarter and are consequently required to move into single living accommodation. The estranged family is also required to vacate the Family Quarter, but is given a 93 day notice period in which to do so. However, individual circumstances are given consideration consistent with service requirements.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 1999]:</i> We treat the issue of school security very seriously and support measures which make schools a safer and more secure environment for pupils and staff. The Department's Working Group on School Security, which includes a representative from the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), has specifically highlighted public rights of way across school premises an issue to be addressed, and is aware of some local cases. The recent DETR consultation paper, Improving Public Rights of Way in England and Wales, accordingly invited views on proposals to enable highway authorities to divert or close public highways where to do so would protect the safety of the public. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, will announce decisions in the light of the consultations on this in due course. The Department also continues to provide specific grant for school security measures under the Standards Fund : a total of &#163;22 million per year is available specifically for school security improvements, which may include security fencing and other access control measures in order to prevent intrusion.

Many of the reforms that the Government have introduced--such as moving the focus of the Lottery from buildings to people and allowing distributors to delegate their functions--should help to facilitate this.

databases have been interrogated and the following results were obtained. Between 1 January 1994 and 12 October 1999, 57 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) were issued for the export to consignees or end-users in Tunisia of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly known as the Military List. Between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1998, 71 Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) were issued for the export to Tunisia of such goods; no OIELs were issued for the export of such goods to Tunisia between 1 January and 12 October 1999.
<P>

<a name="91029w06.htm_para1">Details of all SIELs and OIELs issued between 2 May and 31 December 1997 were set out in the Government's Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls, published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in March 1999. This Report gives details of the military equipment licensed for export during the period as well as the ratings of these goods. Similar details of the military equipment licensed in later years will be set out in the relevant Annual Reports.

Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings (and OIELs may also cover a range of countries). Where this is so, the licence is included in the Table in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

 The Department has monitoring processes in place to assess progress against the targets set in its Public Service Agreement on the basis of the CSR settlement for 1999-2001. This work covers the economy as a whole, for example through targets to narrow the productivity gap and improve performance against competitiveness indicators; there are also specific targets covering for example the small firms sector, exporters, uptake of e-commerce, energy and inward investment. Good progress is already being made; for example I have recently increased the target for the number of SMEs wired to the digital market place from 1 million to 1.5 million. Performance against all our targets will be considered in preparation for the next spending review, to set budgets to 2003-04.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 1999]:</i> By a Common Position, adopted on 16 September, EU member states decided to impose an arms embargo to Indonesia for four months. In accordance with this decision, the Government decided that all individual licences covering the export or transhipment to Indonesia of military goods or technology should be suspended for four months and that, because the embargo is time-limited, their period of validity should be extended by four months also. The UK and other EU member states are monitoring closely the situation in Indonesia and East Timor and will take whatever action becomes necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to widen the opportunities for the judiciary to impose suspended sentences of imprisonment.  [95474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91029w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Suspended sentences may be imposed only in "exceptional circumstances". Widening the opportunities for their use was one of the recommendations in the Home Affairs Committee's Report on Alternatives to Prison Sentences, published in 1998. As the Government's Reply to the Report noted, we are considering this issue, taking account of the Committee's views.

 Given the uncertainty surrounding the number of officers who take early retirement on medical grounds or who leave the service before normal retirement age for other reasons, it is not possible to project actual wastage in the future. However, the actual wastage over the last three years has been running at around five and a half thousand per year. The hon.

<a name="91029w09.htm_para4">Research is currently in progress to study the effect of the Road Traffic Act 1991 on prosecutions for dangerous driving. The project, which is being undertaken for the

<P><I>29 Oct 1999 : Column: 1025</I><P>
Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions by the Transport Research Laboratory, began in May 1998 and is due to be completed in October 2000.
<P>

<a name="91029w09.htm_para5">Issues covered by the study include: whether there is sufficiently clear guidance on the law and its purpose, and how this affects the choice of penalty; comparison of sentencing trends before and since the 1991 Act; and how the changes in the definition of "bad driving" offences have been implemented by police and courts.
<P>

<a name="91029w09.htm_para6">The aim is to obtain an understanding of what leads prosecutors and courts to select one offence or one penalty rather than another. By examining the whole procedure from charging to sentencing, it may be possible to identify ways of improving practice, so as to deter poor driving more effectively.

The HAZ has developed plans to address this issue which include locally developed interventions whereby each district on Merseyside is developing their own schemes to deal with alcohol, linking to the Drug Action Team Plan and Health Improvement Programmes. The "Arrest Referral Scheme" is a Mersey-wide proposal that will work closely with Merseyside Police and the Safer Merseyside Partnership single regeneration budget to provide support to individuals who have been arrested and to put them in touch with relevant services relating to drugs, alcohol, housing, debt and benefit advice and health care services.

 Ensuring equal access to quality services is a main theme of the Merseyside Health Action Zone. Schemes are being developed and implemented to tackle these major causes of ill health. HAZ funding is being used in an innovative way to set up "Community Cardiology Teams" that will help optimise the care of the estimated 600,000 coronary heart disease sufferers on Merseyside.

The Health Act 1999 provides new opportunities for health and local authorities to work together in partnership to improve the health of individuals and communities.
<P>

<a name="91029w10.htm_para1">We are developing a National Service Framework for Older People to drive up quality and reduce variation in health care for older people. The National Service Framework is being developed with the assistance of an external reference group which, amongst other things, is considering transitions to, from and within hospitals.
<P>

<a name="91029w10.htm_para2">We have allocated &#163;887 million over three years to local authorities to help them work with the NHS to develop services which prevent admission to hospital and facilitate early discharge, which help local authorities and NHS bodies to provide more seamless care and which help and support carers.

<a name="91029w10.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Traditionally, junior doctors are contracted for duty hours in excess of the standard working week in order to provide continuity of patient care and also to meet their professional and career training needs. These additional duty hours reflect the hours for which the doctor is contracted to be available to work and not the number of hours actually worked.
<P>

<a name="91029w10.htm_para3">We have now reached agreement with the junior doctors' negotiators on the principles and structure of a new contract which will replace the old, over-complicated arrangements for next year. We propose a three-year deal to modernise junior doctors' pay, which promises greater rewards for those in the hardest working posts. This will mean that posts will be defined and rewarded according to agreed intensity criteria. Officials are currently negotiating these definitions with the junior doctor negotiators.

Contributions paid by employers towards eligible learning for employees who hold individual learning accounts will qualify for a deduction from taxable profits.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister announced on 20 September 1999 that the Government would not now be proceeding with their proposals to charge for cattle passports. In the current depressed state of the market this would be an additional burden on farmers. The Government will continue to meet the running costs of the Cattle Tracing System and will not impose charges before 2002-03 at the earliest.

 <i>[holding answer 21 October 1999]:</i> MAFF received a number of responses from retailers and consumer representatives in response to the recent EC Commission proposal on thresholds for GM material in food. The vast majority of these supported the threshold of 1 per cent. contained in the proposal as being a practical upper limit taking into account the current situation with regard to analytical methods and supply chain. It was recognised that this threshold would apply to food ingredients so that the level in the final food would be much lower.
<P>

<a name="91029w14.htm_para2">The proposal was agreed in Brussels on 21 October with only minor changes.
<P>

<a name="91029w14.htm_para3">In agreeing to the 1 per cent. figure we made clear that actual levels of GM material in non GM soya and maize ingredients should be kept as low as possible and that the threshold itself should be reviewed within two years. The Commission will be drafting a statement to accompany the Regulation to cover this point.
<P>

<a name="91029w14.htm_para4">We shall be continuing to press strongly for clear EC rules to be agreed on GM free labelling and the labelling of animal foods containing GM material as quickly as possible.

Commission inspectors verify compliance with residue testing plans when they carry out periodic checks on third country slaughterhouses authorised to produce meat for export to the Community.
