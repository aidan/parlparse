<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much was spent on aid to Sierra Leone by her Department in 1997-98; and if she will make a statement.  [46733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department provided &#163;3.439 million to Sierra Leone in the 1997-98 financial year.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para0">Of this, &#163;250,000 was spent on Sierra Leone refugees in neighbouring countries and &#163;250,000 for Government and civil society outside Sierra Leone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what changes have been made to the 1998-99 cash and running costs limits for expenditure by her Department.  [47538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, the cash limit for Class III, Vote 1 will be increased by &#163;2,261,000 from &#163;1,618,439,000 to &#163;1,620,700,000 and the Department for International Development running cost limit by &#163;2,261,000 from &#163;59,874,000 to &#163;62,135,000.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para1">The increase is in respect of a running cost transfer of &#163;2,261,000 from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Class II, Vote) for the costs of development staff in London and abroad.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para2">The increase will be offset by a reduction in the FCO's Vote and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list, for each of the last four years, all departmental inquiries and reviews instigated by ministers which have been chaired by individuals outside her Department; and in each case if she will give the date of establishment and the name of the chairman.  [46835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has not undertaken any departmental inquiries or reviews instigated by ministers which have been chaired by individuals outside the department in the last four years.

 Both the Government and the Jubilee 2000 Coalition recognise the important part debt relief can play in the eradication of poverty. We seek the same overall objective--the remission of the unpayable debts of the world's poorest countries. Her Majesty's Government welcome the work that Jubilee 2000 and its associates have been doing to raise public awareness of these issues, and thus keep debt relief firmly on the international political agenda. This has helped us to get agreement at last month's G8 Summit in Birmingham to one of the main aims of the Government's Mauritius Mandate--to ensure that by the year 2000 all eligible highly indebted poor countries will have at least begun the process which will lead to debt relief.

 The Audit Commission's press and public affairs functions have been provided externally for more than nine years. These services are market tested every three years in accordance with relevant EC Directives and, following the last market test, two companies--Citigate Westminster and Lawson, Lucas and Mendelsohn--were appointed. Whilst details of the contractual terms are commercially confidential between the Audit Commission and individual contractors, the Commission has incurred the following expenditure on these services in each of the last five years:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to encourage businesses to improve their environmental practices.  [46226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1998]:</i> This Government's long term goal is sustainable development. Under the legally binding targets agreed at Kyoto, the European Union agreed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, on average, by 8 per cent. Under the UK Presidency, we have secured agreement with other Member States on how to meet this European Union target. The UK contribution is to reduce emissions by 12.5 per cent. This, together with the Government's own manifesto commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent., has to be planned for. These are challenging targets and all sectors--business, domestic and transport--need to play their part in meeting them.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1998 : Column: 431</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para3">The Government currently have a wide range of existing programmes and initiatives to encourage business to improve its environment practices beyond the minimum standards set by regulation. These include: the Best Practice Programmes for Energy Efficiency and Environmental Technology; the promotion of environmental management within business; energy and environmental labelling schemes; codes of practice covering environmental claims on products and services; producer responsibility for the recovery and recycling of waste; promoting waste minimisation; voluntary agreements with industry sectors; and promoting the wider take up of environmental reporting.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para4">As part of the wide ranging <i>Opportunities for Change</i> consultation on a revised UK Sustainable Development Strategy, we have just launched a <i>Sustainable Business</i> consultation paper. This sets out and seeks views on the particular challenges posed by sustainable development for business. A further element of the strategy, the Government's recently issued consultation paper on the waste strategy for England and Wales, <i>Less Waste: More Value,</i> stresses the importance of industry action to reduce the environmental impact of their waste, and seeks views on what further action is needed to encourage this.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para5">Business is taking these matters seriously. In their Climate Change report, the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment suggested that some form of tax on industrial energy may be necessary. In response the Government have set up a task force, chaired by the President of the CBI, Lord Marshall, to examine the role of economic instruments, such as an energy tax.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para6">In the light of these various developments the Government will be looking across the array of measures they can deploy--regulation, voluntary agreements and economic instruments--to see what else they can do to encourage better environmental performance from business.

<a name="80623w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Air Quality</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to improve air quality.  [46225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1998]:</i> The UK National Air Quality Strategy sets out national air quality objectives for eight key air pollutants to be achieved by 2005. These objectives have been set with reference to air quality standards which represent no or minimal risk of health effects to the public. The Strategy also describes a range of policy options for achieving the objectives and the contribution to be made at international, national and local levels. We announced last year that we would review the Strategy urgently to look at the options for delivering improved air quality more quickly. The review is due to be completed by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="80623w01.html_para7">The Government are also taking action on a number of other fronts to improve air quality. At the European level we reached agreement at the Environment Council earlier this month on tough new air quality limit values under the Air Quality Daughter Directive and improved fuel quality standards under the Sulphur Content of Liquid Fuels Directive. We have also made significant progress in negotiating tighter fuel quality and emission standards under the Auto-Oil programme. At the national level we 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1998 : Column: 432</I><P>
are implementing the Industrial Pollution Prevention and Control Directive and taking forward fiscal incentives for low emission buses/lorries, alternative fuels and legislation on vehicle emissions. At the local level we have introduced a system of local air quality management and are piloting a scheme for local transport emissions enforcement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Conditions were attached to the planning permission granted by Eden District Council requiring the provision of new traffic signals at the junction of the M6 and A66, together with additional road markings. With regard to the cost of complying with the conditions and which organisation paid, the information is not readily available but I will provide a written response with details as and when they become available.

<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Osborne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when talks will resume on the United States of America-United Kingdom Air Services agreement.  [46429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 No UK/US air services talks are currently planned. We would expect to resume talks when the outcome of the examination of the British Airways/American Airlines alliance by the competition authorities is known.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when LCR expects to complete the Channel Tunnel Rail Link if Railtrack fails to exercise its option relating to the second phase of construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.  [46470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Any such assessment would depend on when Railtrack chose not to exercise its option in respect of the second phase of construction. Railtrack, however, has made clear its expectation to commit to the second phase and LCR expects work to be completed in 2007.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions within what timescale LCR will have to find a third party or complete phase two itself if Railtrack does not exercise its option relating to the second phase of construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.  [46469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Railtrack has an option until July 2003 to construct and purchase Phase 2, but should it decide not to exercise that option, LCR remains, in any event, contractually obliged to complete the second phase to St. Pancras. LCR's current expectation is that the second phase of construction should be completed by 2007.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 11 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>637,</i> relating to the future of NATS, if he will make a statement on the powers attaching to the golden share.  [46474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The precise details of the golden share are for consideration as the proposal is developed, but it will provide additional rights to the Government to maintain the public interest while allowing the private sector freedom to run the business.

<P>
<a name="80623w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Contract negotiations for a new air traffic control centre at Prestwick to replace the existing Scottish and Oceanic Air Traffic Control Centre are underway between National Air Traffic Services (NATS) and Sky Solutions, the preferred bidder. NATS will consult with the airlines before seeking CAA Board and Government approval to a contractual commitment. NATS currently envisage that operations will transfer from the existing Prestwick centre to a new one (the New Scottish Centre) during the winter of 2004/2005.

 The Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 is not yet in force. However, guidance to local authorities on implementing the Act was issued in draft earlier this year for consultation. This stated that local traffic authorities would be expected to produce, by 31 July 1999, reports containing assessments of levels of local road traffic in their area and forecast growth in those levels, together with targets for reducing those levels or their rate of growth. The draft guidance also stresses the importance of local authorities monitoring traffic levels in order to determine whether they are on course to achieve any such targets. It is too soon to judge when it will be possible to assess the likely impact of the Act on traffic levels.

Included in this value is a sum of &#163;5,200 for the cost to public funds for medical costs and the costs of police and courts. The lost production element includes social security costs but these are not separately estimated.

 The total car fleet in the UK emitted 19.33 million tonnes of Carbon in 1996. Given that the total car fleet was made up of 22.24 million cars, this translates into an average of 0.87 tonnes of Carbon per car in that year.

 None of the trains operating on the West Coast Main Line is of the same design as the Great North Eastern Railway train which was derailed on 16 June.

<a name="80623w03.html_para5">This is a major organisational change and it will take time for the RDAs to get to grips with their new tasks and establish themselves as influential and credible organisations on the regional, national and international scene.

 All radioactive waste disposals, including discharges into the sea, are closely regulated under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. Government departments and the environment agencies carry out monitoring of marine environmental media and foodstuffs around nuclear licensed sites that discharge radioactive waste into the sea. This ensures that any doses to the public are well below internationally agreed limits and that such discharges pose no risk to the environment.

 A number of Home Office policies and programmes contribute to tackling aspects of social exclusion. These include, within local communities, its work to promote voluntary and community activity and to support a healthy and cost effective voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="80623w04.html_para0">The Home Office has been working closely with the Social Exclusion Unit on the Unit's first three priorities of rough sleeping, school exclusions and truancy, and worst estates. In its recent report to the Prime Minister, the Social Exclusion Unit recognised that rough sleeping and related problems such as begging might be identified as local issues of concern by the crime and disorder audits required under the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>]. They would therefore need to be addressed within the local crime reduction strategy.

<a name="80623w04.html_para1">The approach required by the Bill of local agencies and the local community working in partnership to address identified local problems with clear priorities and targets is particularly appropriate for tackling issues of social exclusion.

<P>

 None. Representations have been received recently from Professor Wilkinson proposing that the International Criminal Court should have jurisdiction in relation to terrorist crimes. The United 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1998 : Column: 442</I><P>
Kingdom Government's position is that the Court should not have such jurisdiction. The policy was revisited in the light of Professor Wilkinson's comments but confirmed.
<P>

<a name="80623w04.html_para3">There are several reasons for the view that the Court should not be able to deal with terrorism. Paramount among them is the need to protect confidential sources, which would be compromised if an international body were to investigate and prosecute terrorist incidents. In practical terms it would be very difficult for the Court to act in terrorist cases, countries naturally having a predilection not to volunteer sensitive national security information.
<P>

<a name="80623w04.html_para4">In any event, the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in this area is unnecessary given the range of terrorist conventions in place, including the recently concluded United Nations Terrorist Bombing Convention. These require their parties to co-operate against terrorism and, in some cases, to take extraterritorial jurisdiction over terrorist crimes. Indeed, the involvement of the Court could even undermine or set back progress in combating terrorism, on which there is increasingly effective international co-operation.

 Under the tariff-based scheme, effective for all claims received on or after 1 April 1996, 190 claims had been refused by 31 March 1998 by reason of their exclusion from the scope of that scheme under paragraph 7(b). Precise data for the identical exclusion applied in the former scheme based on common law damages are not available. However, I understand from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board that between 1,000 and 2,000 claims in this category would have been refused in the period 1 April 1980 to 31 March 1996. The number of victims who have never made any application in recognition of the exclusion is unquantifiable.

Change has been rejected on grounds of cost, and because it would represent a departure from the general principle that changes in the law, rules and procedures are not normally made retrospective. We believe those arguments remain compelling, and have no plans to review further this aspect of the compensation scheme.

<P>
<a name="80623w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 None directly. However, police grant is allocated by means of a formula which predicts police authorities' relative need to spend. Formula components are weighted to take account of both resident and daytime population in a force's area. Any increase in Kent's population as a result of its geographical situation would in time be reflected in its police grant allocation.
<P>

In deciding whether to initiate criminal proceedings and to refer a case to the Crown Prosecution Service, the police will look carefully at the circumstances surrounding each case and will take into account the Code for Crown Prosecutors. However, the police have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to place the welfare of the child as their first priority, and this is detailed in the guidance "Working Together Under The Children Act" which sets out the arrangements for child protection in England and Wales. The Government are consulting on proposals for drawing up revised guidance.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what basis he made his assessment of the amount that local authorities will be able to realise in annual asset sales; and over what period he expects these to be realised.  [47038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Local authorities are projected to realise &#163;2&#190; billion in asset sales in each of the next three years and in line with recent experience.

<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Amess: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer at what proportion of average earnings <i>(a)</i> a sole earner in a married two-parent, two-child family and <i>(b)</i> a single person with no children would start paying income tax in (i) April 1998, (ii) October 1998 and (iii) October 1999 taking into account family credit and the proposed working family tax credit; and how these figures compare with the position taking account of the equivalent benefits in 1968-69.  [45994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In 1998-99 a single person will start paying income tax at earnings of &#163;81 per week, 24 per cent. of median full-time earnings (&#163;337 per week). A married couple with one earner and 2 children under 11 will start to pay income tax at earnings of &#163;108 per week, 32 per cent. of median full-time earnings. With the introduction of WFTC a married couple with one earner and 2 children under 11 will start to pay income tax at earnings of &#163;245 per week. Additional help with child care is available to working families through the child care tax credit within WFTC. For example, a 2 earner couple on median earnings with 2 children and child care costs of &#163;80 per week will gain &#163;46 per week to this cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There is no VAT on safety helmets worn by motorcyclists. There is also no VAT on pedal cycle helmets designed for young children and not suitable for older persons.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what action <i>(a)</i> the Government and <i>(b)</i> the Bank of England are taking to assess whether they will be able to make their computers millennium compliant at the same time as making them euro compliant.  [45453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Government Departments have investigated the impact of the introduction of the euro on their operations. Where these occur steps are in hand to make the necessary preparations. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster carries out quarterly reviews across Government on the state of preparedness for the century date change. Copies of the returns from Departments have been placed in the Library. The Bank of England has been undertaking IT preparations necessary for both EMU and Year 2000 for over 2 years. It was decided at an early stage that where there was an overlap in EMU and Year 2000 work and, where it was practical to do so, the Bank would address both issues at the same time.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the outcome of the experiment involving the private sector undertaking work in the rating and council tax fields.  [47413]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The 1995 Next Steps Review of the Valuation Office Agency recommended that experiments be held to establish the feasibility and capability of the private sector to undertake work in the rating and council tax fields. Experiments were held during a 12 month period beginning 1 July 1996 involving contractors in four locations (two performing functions related to council tax and two to non-domestic rating). The results were compared with control offices in the Valuation Office Agency. The experiments have now been evaluated and the conclusions are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that it is feasible for private firms to meet particular operational requirements of valuation for rating and council tax; but</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that there is no clear financial or operational advantage in the permanent use of the private sector in the work concerned.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>23 Jun 1998 : Column: 456</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80623w08.html_para0">The Government have therefore decided not to take any steps at this stage to contract out rating and council tax valuation work. But if at any time they require valuation work which cannot easily or quickly be delivered within the capacity of the Valuation Office Agency they will look positively at involving the private sector.
<P>

<a name="80623w08.html_para1">I am very grateful to the private sector firms involved in the experiments for an effective example of public sector/private sector partnership.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes are proposed to the cash and running costs limits for Her Majesty's Treasury in 1998-99.  [47550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary summer Supplementary Estimate, the running costs limit for Class XVI, Vote 1 will be increased by &#163;6,400,000 from &#163;59,930,000 to &#163;66,330,000 and the cash limit will be increased by &#163;6,400,000 from &#163;56,665,000 to &#163;63,065,000. The increase will be charged to the Reserve and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.
<P>

<a name="80623w08.html_para2">The increases are necessary to provide for the costs of a new service providing information to business about the introduction of the euro in January 1999 and will be offset by foregoing the equivalent amount of unused end year flexibility carryover.
<P>

<a name="80623w08.html_para3">Pending Parliamentary approval of the Supplementary Estimate, urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;1,400,000 will be met by a repayable advance from the Contingencies Fund.

The increase will be offset by a transfer from the Department for Education and Employment, class IX, vote 1 and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

The standards laid down for regular armoured reconnaissance units are different from those set for the Territorial Army and therefore it is not possible to make objective comparisons.

<a name="80623w09.html_para0">If, after consideration, a conscientious objection is not assessed to be genuine, it will be rejected. Unsuccessful applicants are, however, advised that they may appeal to the Advisory Committee on Conscientious Objectors. This Committee is independent of the MOD and its members are appointed by the Lord Chancellor. It conducts its hearings in public and tenders its advice to the Secretary of State for Defence's representative. A successful appeal to the Advisory Committee is invariably accepted by the Department and the applicant will immediately be granted a release from the Service.

 <i>[holding answer 22 June 1998]:</i> The UK is already party to a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United States and Canada on chemical and biological defence. Under the auspices of this MOU, my Department embarked upon a programme to develop a joint approach to chemical and biological defence and collaboration across a full range of defensive measures, including systems for the detection of chemical and biological agents. As part of this programme, we have undertaken joint tests and field trials

<a name="80623w09.html_para1">I have recently agreed with the US Defence Secretary that we should increase co-operation to combat chemical and biological weapons. This will further deepen the existing close collaboration in this area.

<a name="80623w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The survey to which the hon. Member refers was conducted by the Radiation Protection Services section (DRPS) of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Arrangements were made last June, through the Parliamentary Branch of the Ministry of Defence, for an updated list of all unclassified DRPS reports to be placed in the House of Commons Library. The list includes details of published reports of the most recent environmental and radiological survey undertaken at and around the Dundrennan test range in Kirkcudbrightshire. These are DRPS Report No 6/97, "1996 Environmental Depleted Uranium Baseline Survey Report DTEO Kirkcudbright" and DRPS Report No 10/97, "1996 Marine Environmental Survey Report DTEO Kirkcudbright". It was decided at the time that it was not a practical option to place reports (including DRPS Reports 6 and 10/97) themselves in the House Library but that copies would be available on a case by case basis on request. I understand the hon. Member has made such a request and that arrangements are in hand for him to receive copies of the reports in question.

 The creative industries can be a powerful economic driving force in local and regional economies, but detailed statistics on the scale of their economic impact in particular parts of the country are not currently available. The Creative Industries Task Force has collated data which show that the creative industries nationally generate revenues of around &#163;55 billion, contributing 4 per cent. to GDP, and employ some 1.5 million people. The Task Force is now turning its attention to assessing the position in different regions.

<a name="80623w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 1998]:</i> We are in the process of developing a comprehensive strategy for tourism. We want to see quality tourism development which is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable, and which supports the Government's employment objectives and their wish to see a more inclusive society. Our aims and objectives for tourism will be set out in more detail when we publish the new strategy later this year.
<P>

<a name="80623w09.html_para2">Achievements since last May include the establishment of an expanded, fully representative Tourism Forum; and the establishment of new Working Groups on Strategic Planning, Widening Access and Domestic Tourism, with sub groups on Quality, Distribution and Sustainability. These have now reported, as have the Working Groups on Communications, Business Tourism, People and Visitor Attractions. In addition, we have launched <i>Tourism--Towards Sustainability</i>, a nationwide consultation exercise on sustainable tourism and have held the first sectoral conference on New Deal for the tourism, hospitality and leisure industry, which has led to a very positive response from the industry.

The reduction is the net effect of a machinery of government change in policy responsibility whereby &#163;1,130,000 of provision for early years is being transferred from Class XI, Vote 2 (the Department of Health), offset by a transfer of &#163;4,000,000 to Class XI, Vote 1 (the Department of Health) to take account of changes arising from the Dearing Review. The transfer is part of an overall transfer of &#163;6,600,000 to the Department of Health, the remainder of which is being found from the Department's non-cash limited expenditure. &#163;4,300,000 is also being transferred from our non-cash limited provision to Class XIV, Vote 2 (the Welsh Office) as a result of the Dearing changes.<P>

We believe that the Court should have jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. We also believe that the Court should have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression where the UN Security Council has determined that an act of aggression has taken place, and provided that the crime is properly defined in the Statute.

 We have reserved our position on whether the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should have the power to initiate investigations on his or her own authority in circumstances in which a situation has not been referred either by the UN Security Council or by a State Party to the Court. Irrespective of how an investigation is initiated, however, we believe that the Prosecutor should be independent of Governments in the conduct of his investigations. The consent of the State where an alleged crime had taken place should not be required before an investigation or prosecution in respect of that crime can take place, if that State is a Party to the Treaty establishing the Court. Nor should the approval of the Security Council be necessary for an investigation or a prosecution to take place.

ECGD has negotiated over 100 debt rescheduling agreements with 45 countries since January 1990. It should be noted that many debts originated in the seventies and eighties and have been rescheduled several times. Consequently details of debt rescheduled for the first time under each agreement are not readily available. To aggregate the debt under all agreements with each debtor country would result in a high degree multiple counting.

 None. Jordan, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Nicaragua, Uganda and Senegal have approached the Paris Club for debt reduction and/or rescheduling since 1 May 1997. Agreement has been reached in all cases. No other debtor countries have formally sought rescheduling through the Paris Club during this period.

<a name="80623w14.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what <i>(a)</i> amount and <i>(b)</i> percentage of the United Kingdom's electricity supply were supplied by renewable sources in each year since the non-fossil fuel obligation was introduced in 1989.  [43224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 June 1998]:</i> The following table shows information on electricity from renewable sources for the years since 1989. Generation from all renewable sources is included, not just those sources supported by the non-fossil fuel obligation. The amount of electricity available from hydro sources in a particular year depends on rainfall in the preceding period. Dry weather affected output from hydro stations in 1991, 1993 and 1996. When hydro electricity is excluded, other renewable sources are shown to be providing an increasing proportion of generation in the UK, and their contribution in 1997 was 4&#189; times that in 1989.
<P>

<a name="80623w14.html_para0">Since coming into office I have repeatedly stressed my commitment to renewable energies. Indeed within weeks of the election I announced a review of renewable energy policy including consideration of what would be necessary and practicable for the UK to achieve a 10 per cent. contribution from renewable resources towards electricity generation by 2010. I can confirm that we remain committed to the 10 per cent. target and expect to make a further announcement in due course. The announcement of policy proposals for the fifth non-fossil fuel obligation round which I made on 25 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>507-10</i>, will be the first step in our new and strong drive for renewables and I expect NFFO-5 will contribute substantially to reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging internationally competitive industries. I expect to make this Order later this year.

<P>
<a name="80623w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The Government will continue to encourage the provision of greater access for public angling consistent with sound management and conservation. We have also made it clear that action will be taken when access proposed as part of Protection Orders granted under the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 fails to materialise or is withdrawn.

<a name="80623w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 To classify all approved pesticides as systemic or non-systemic pesticides would incur disproportionate cost. Pesticides are approved only if they can be used safely and any resulting residues in crops are at an acceptably low level.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1998]:</i> Central records are not kept which show the numbers of route plans returned. The arrangements in place are designed to follow up instances of non-return of route plans, so that either the returned plan is held at the Animal Health Divisional Office that issued it in case queries subsequently arise, or the failure to return the plan is logged against the record of the transporter concerned to enable enforcement action to be considered. We attach importance to making these arrangements as effective as possible and have recruited a local authority enforcement officer to assist us in this.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will report on the results of the Thornbury experiment.  [46763]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The policy employed in the area around Thornbury was not conceived as a scientific experiment but as a means of controlling the spread of tuberculosis from badgers to cattle. This involved the systematic removal of badgers from a defined geographical area around Thornbury, Gloucestershire during the period from 1975 to 1981, after which re-colonisation was allowed. The average incidence of TB in cattle herds fell from 5.6 per cent. in the 10 years prior to the clearance, to 0.45 per cent. in the 15 years following the clearance.
<P>

<a name="80623w16.html_para3">Professor Krebs' recent report on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers concludes that, whilst the policy applied in the Thornbury area provides strong circumstantial evidence to suggest that badgers represent a significant source of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in cattle, it does not prove a causal link, nor does it constitute a proper experimental basis to enable conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness, of different badger culling strategies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The purpose of the experiment proposed by Professor Krebs is to provide the data needed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of badger culling as a means of controlling TB in cattle. I am awaiting advice from the Expert Group which is working on the detailed design of the experiment, including the data which must be collected.

<a name="80623w16.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A number of such objections have been raised, and have been referred to the Expert Group to be taken into account during the work of designing the experiment. The objections featuring most frequently in correspondence have concerned the risks that denial of access to private land, or interference by badger rights activists or farmers illegally culling badgers, could undermine the statistical validity of the experiment; the numbers of badgers which could be killed; the possibility that lactating sows might be culled; and the fear that snares could be used to trap badgers. There have also been claims that the experiment is unnecessary both because badger culling has been shown not to work, and because it has been proved effective.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what measures are taken to ensure that poultry meat imported into the United Kingdom meets EU and United Kingdom rules and legislation; and what steps he will take to ensure fair competition in the UK poultry meat market.  [46977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80623w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All fresh meat, including poultrymeat, imported into the UK, whether from other Member States or third countries, must have been produced in accordance with harmonised Community rules. These rules require all meat which is intended for sale for human consumption to fulfil the required public health standards. This means that it must be produced in EC approved establishments and, to signify this, must be stamped with a health mark before leaving the plant.
<P>

<a name="80623w17.html_para0">Ensuring that all Member States comply with their Community obligations in properly implementing and applying Community rules is the responsibility of the European Commission, whose Office of Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection carries out regular programmes of inspections visits to all Member States. The inspection, approval and monitoring of poultrymeat slaughterhouses in third countries are also the responsibility of the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="80623w17.html_para1">In addition, meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by agreed animal and public health certification which is issued at the plant of origin and must take place via approved Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they undergo veterinary checks to ensure that they comply with EU animal and public health legislation.

This information was derived from data held by the Prescription Pricing Authority which cover only prescriptions written by general practitioners. There is no national scheme for gathering drug usage in hospitals; hence the estimate for the use of Roaccutane has been derived from sales figures. The majority of prescriptions for Roaccutane are written in hospitals; therefore the previous estimate of 11,000 prescriptions underestimates the true usage.
