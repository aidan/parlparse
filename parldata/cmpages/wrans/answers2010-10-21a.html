 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the decision was taken to engage O'Brien and Associates to advise the British Embassy in Washington in respect of arms sales by UK companies to the US administration; how much has been paid to O'Brien and Associates from the public purse to date; and to whom in his Department the company reports for the purposes of this contract.

 The British embassy defence staff in Washington DC has contracted with O'Brien and Associates since January 2006 to source specialist advice to the UK Ministry of Defence on a variety of US defence acquisition issues, including trade and countering so-called 'protectionism', in Congress. O'Brien and Associates has not been contracted to influence defence exports by UK companies to the US Administration, but rather to provide regular advice and information on major US defence equipment programmes and relevant budget issues, principally as they pass through Congress. The current contract started in January 2010 and expires in December 2010 and fees are paid by the hour for services provided, based upon tasking by embassy staff. Total fees paid to O'Brien and Associates from 2006 are approximately $500,000.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence regularly discusses the UK-US Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty with the US Administration. The treaty is evidence of the close defence relationship between our countries and achieved a major milestone when it was approved by the US Senate on 29 September 2010 allowing preparations for implementation to begin. By simplifying export licensing arrangements, for items destined for UK or US Government end-use, the treaty will help improve interoperability and the support provided to our armed forces. We envisage that the detailed preparations required to bring the treaty arrangements into effect will take up to 12 months and will be conducted in close consultation with the US Administration and with UK and US industries.</p>

 Since October 2004, DEFRA has led communications targeted at black and minority ethnic (BME) communities where the rules have been particularly relevant. The target audiences have mainly been defined by the number of animal product seizures made from countries outside the EU, but other issues, such as the independent research carried out, have also been considered.</p>

 Oral health needs assessments and the epidemiological surveys on which they are based are public health functions, which are normally led by consultants in dental public health employed by primary care trusts (PCTs). The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' refers to creation of a new public health service, to integrate and streamline existing health improvement. It also indicates that PCT responsibilities for local health improvement will transfer to local authorities, who will employ the Director of Public Health jointly appointed with the public health service. We will be publishing a White Paper on public health later this year, which will cover the transitional arrangements, required to implement these changes. Health and well-being boards within local authorities will be ideally placed to provide feedback on the quality and accessibility of national health service dental services in their areas.</p>

 The Browne review proposes that student loan borrowers do not start to make repayments until their income rises above £21,000 per annum, at 9% of the excess, and with an interest rate rising to RPI plus 2.2% for higher-earning graduates. It proposes that no student loan borrower makes repayments after 30 years, because any outstanding sum at that date would be written off. Based on projections of graduate earnings, and time out of the work force, we estimate that, if the Browne proposals were implemented, 75% of women leaving university with a student loan of £30,000 would benefit from such a write-off. A further 5-10% will have their balance written off during the 30 years due to death or disability. 15-20% will repay fully within the 30-year period.</p>

 I understand this question to refer to postal operators in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="101021w0002.htm_para68"><a name="10102163000033">At present there are around 51 licensed postal operators in the UK, including Royal Mail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="101021w0002.htm_para69"><a name="10102163000034">VAT is a matter for the HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs. I am however advised that under current UK VAT legislative provisions, all postal services provided by Royal Mail, as the universal service provider, are treated as exempt, including stamped, bulk and express mail. All other postal service providers are, in principle, required to charge VAT at the standard rate. However, other postal operators who make use of Royal Mail's facilities to deliver post for the 'final mile', can take advantage of special VAT arrangements to treat this element-which accounts for a significant proportion of the onward charge to their customer-as a 'disbursement' and only charge and account for VAT on the remaining amount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="101021w0002.htm_para70"><a name="10102163000035">Royal Mail's exemption from VAT for postal services in the UK is currently the subject of legislative amendment as part of the Finance Bill which is progressing through Parliament. This follows a European Court of Justice decision which confirmed that Royal Mail, as the sole operator providing the universal postal service, is the only postal body in the UK eligible to exempt postal services from VAT. However, it also ruled that exemption does not apply to all Royal Mail's postal services and as such, those services which are either individually negotiated or not subject to price and regulatory control (such as Parcelforce and Mailmedia) will become liable to VAT at the standard rate. These changes are due to come into effect from 31 January 2011.</p>

 The Government are supporting the manufacturing industry, both nationally and in the West Midlands, by creating a stable business environment that will give businesses the confidence they need to plan and invest for the future. We are doing this by creating a more supportive tax environment, freeing up credit through the banking system, reducing regulation, maximising the flexibility of the labour market and focusing on training and apprenticeships. For example, we have already redirected £150 million to create up to 50,000 extra apprenticeships, which will be workplace-based and employer-led.</p>

This will ensure a focussed targeted delivery of policy/services in areas where it can have the most benefit, and believe this approach will provide the best support for manufacturing in the West Midlands by creating the conditions for local businesses to grow.</p>

 Solicitors are regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the regulatory arm of the Law Society.

The code provides that firms are generally free to advertise their services, subject to the requirements of rule 7. Rule 7 of the code permits solicitors to publicise their firms in a number of ways-ensuring that clients and the public have appropriate information about the firm and the way it is regulated, but prohibiting misleading or inaccurate publicity and inappropriate approaches for business.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has no record of the number of prisoners granted face to face interviews with journalists since 1997. Prior to a change to the policy in July 2010, decisions to allow prisoners to have interviews with journalists were made by governors and no central records were collated. It is not possible to provide information on the number, date and cost of interviews or the type of prisoners granted face to face access to journalists. The new policy requires governors to refer all requests for face to face interviews to the Ministry of Justice Press Office for approval on behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice. No decisions on whether to allow an interview have been made since July 2010.</p>
