 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on what date meetings have taken place between her Department andrepresentatives of Asda, including Asda&#039;s parent company, Wal-Mart, in the last 12 months; and if she will list the participants.  [59959]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60424w01.html_spnew0"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 Given the very wide range of goods and outlets involved, the retail sector is affected by more regulations than any other sector. Consequently, major retailers will have regular contact with many departments and may also be involved in working and consultative groups. To list every meeting would involve disproportionate cost, so the following information relates to key meetings only.

In addition, a meeting with DEFRA Ministers took place on 8 December 2005. Data privacy legislation makes it inappropriate to list the participants in those meetings.

 The eighth Conference of Parties to the CBD was held in Curitiba, Brazil from 20&#150;31 March 2006. I attended the High Level Segment (HLS) from 26&#150;28 March. During this period I co-hosted, with the Brazilian Deputy Environment Minister, Claudio Langone, a breakfast with business representatives attended by over 40 Ministers.

Total UK greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation are also shown, but do not contribute towards the UK total in accordance with international guidelines.

Chief Crown Prosecutors continue to take the lead at a local area level in setting up arrangements with the police and courts to improve the efficiency of prosecution of magistrates court cases&#151;for example, optimising the deployment of designated caseworkers at the magistrates court, a more focused approach to case progression, and an internal CPS structural exercise seeking to get the best match between the size of police divisions and magistrates court catchment areas in order to develop a more efficient model of CPS administration for standard application across all operational units and provide proper oversight of cases.

 The Crown Prosecution Service is involved at a local and national level in a number of projects and programmes to improve the effectiveness of trials and other court hearings.

<a name="stpa_5">Due to performance improvement flowing from the joint police/CPS charging initiative, and changes to the process applied by the court at the start of proceeding, it is intended that many more cases will be ready to proceed at the first hearing. This will rely on the right charge having been preferred; victim and witness needs assessments having been undertaken; witnesses&#039; dates to avoid having been obtained should they be required to give evidence; any special measures having been identified; and advance information having been served on the defence and the court.

<a name="stpa_6">The revised process is about to be trialled at four magistrates court centres, prior to wider roll-out, following evaluation. The process should incentivise the guilty defendant to enter a plea at the earliest possible stage. In those cases where the defendant intends to contest the allegations, the process should also enable the court to isolate the triable issues with the parties and adjourn the case for trial, with the shared expectation that it will proceed to trial on the date fixed without further adjournment.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60424w02.html_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The National Audit Office report estimated that ineffective trials and hearings cost the criminal justice system &#163;173 million. Of that sum it is suggested that the CPS was responsible for &#163;24 million, the defence for &#163;96 million, the police for &#163;24 million, the courts for &#163;21 million and the police and the CPS together for a further &#163;8 million. Criticisms about the CPS&#039;s management and handling of cases are being addressed. The NAO found examples of good practice and the recommendations will help improve performance. The CPS is working with the police and the courts to improve performance in magistrates courts.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he has taken to ensure that British holidaymakers are able to seek some form of financial redress in appropriate instances where travellers are not undertaking a traditional package holiday; and if he will make a statement on the responsibilities of travel operators providing non-package holidays to ensure that compensation is made available for customers in the event of problems with that provision.  [64395]</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60424w04.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/3288) place certain liabilities on businesses which fall within the regime for the proper performance of the contract, and requires them to provide sufficient evidence of security for the refund of money and repatriation in the event of insolvency. The regulations apply to businesses which organise, or sell, or offer to sell, at an inclusive price a pre-arranged combination of at least two of the following elements: travel; accommodation; and, other tourist services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w04.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_36">The regulations implement the Package Travel Directive (90/314/EEC) which is one of eight consumer facing directives currently undergoing review by the European Commission. We have not yet received any proposals for change to this directive from the Commission.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Apr 2006 : Column 825W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w04.html_para13">
Holidaymakers who choose to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation as separate items do not benefit from the provisions of the regulations, as there is no third party putting together a package of arrangements for them. However, those individual businesses with whom the holidaymaker contracts for services are obliged to meet their contractual obligations to the holidaymaker in the normal manner.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w04.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_37">The Air Travel Organisers Licence (ATOL) scheme provides financial protection for package holiday travellers, including protection against airline bankruptcy. ATOL does not cover independently booked flights. For these flights, several airlines have agreed voluntary repatriation measures to ensure that stranded passengers are returned home at moderate cost. As regards refunds, several airlines now offer insurance against insolvency, and include notices on their websites highlighting the benefits of such insurance. The Government have also recently stressed the need for travellers to take out insurance against a range of misfortunes or expenses which can occur abroad.

 The organisation for Search and Rescue (SAR) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is an amalgam of separate Government Departments, the emergency services and other organisations. A significant number of charities and voluntary organisations dedicated to SAR also play a significant role. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has responsibility for civil maritime search and rescue in the UK which is undertaken by HM Coastguard. The Coastguard primarily makes use of rescue resources from the MOD (RAF and RN helicopters and aircraft) and lifeboats from the RNLI and other volunteer lifeboat providers. In addition, land based search and rescue is led by the police service. Their statistics are not collated centrally.

The areas are divided into a total of 64 Coastguard Sectors around the UK and within each sector there are a number of volunteer Coastguard Rescue Teams (CRTs). A table has been placed in the Libraries of the House showing the breakdown of teams and locations. The CRTs carry out coastal rescue operations (cliff and shoreline) and act as mobile lookouts when called out by their controlling MRCC to investigate reports of incidents, etc. In the UK there are 397 Coastguard Rescue Teams based around the UK coastline.

 Seatbelt messages have been included in the Department&#039;s road safety campaign for over 35 years. Having achieved very high wearing rates by good publicity and appropriate enforcement, the Department now believes it needs to be more targeted in reaching those who are most resistant to its messages. Seatbelt messages, along with other THINK! road safety issues, will in future be promoted through engagement strategies, currently under development, which will target young drivers and those who drive for work.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60424w08.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The independent four-year evaluation report of the national safety camera programme, which is available in the Libraries of the House and on the DfT website, included an assessment of the effectiveness of both fixed and mobile cameras at the Essex Safety Camera Partnership level using the criteria of reductions in speed and casualties at camera sites.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Apr 2006 : Column 838W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w08.html_para1">
The evaluation concluded that both types of camera were effective in both respects. Fixed cameras had, on the whole, a greater effect in reducing speeding than mobile cameras, reflecting the fact that fixed cameras affect driving behaviour all the time, whereas mobile cameras operate periodically at each location.

[64596]</p>








<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60424w08.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The casualty criteria that must be met before a fixed or mobile speed camera is installed are set out in the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales for 2006&#150;07, which is available in the Library of the House, and on the Department&#039;s website. For fixed camera sites it is at least three killed or seriously injured collisions per site kilometre in the 36 months that forms the baseline period.

 The Ministry of Defence routinely monitors emerging information on the potential health effects of exposure to depleted uranium (DU) and has studied the authoritative assessments by the Royal Society and others. All the reliable scientific and medical evidence shows that the likelihood of ill health as a result of battlefield exposure to DU is extremely low. Nonetheless, urine testing has been made available to current and former personnel concerned about possible exposure. To date, with the exception of a small number of personnel who suffered shrapnel injuries in a friendly fire&quot; incident involving DU munitions, none of those tested has been found to be excreting DU.

<i>[holding answer 30 March 2006]:</i> To be eligible under the military part of the ex-gratia scheme, a claimant must have been a member of the UK armed forces and have been captured and detained by the Japanese. An individual&#039;s service record and capture cards&quot; provided by the Japanese have normally contained sufficient contemporary evidence to establish Prisoner of War status without the need to prove 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Apr 2006 : Column 847W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
detention in any particular camp. Lists of qualifying camps have not therefore been necessary to prove eligibility for military claimants.

<p>
<a name="60424w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_74">To be eligible under the civilian part of the scheme, a claimant must have been detained within a specifically designated area, under the direct control of the Japanese. Civilian personnel who were held in the camps listed as follows and who met the other criteria for the scheme have received a payment. These camps have been verified as meeting the agreed internment definition through information obtained from a number of sources which include the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Imperial War Museum, the National Archives and ABCIFER. The list includes the main internment camps but is not exhaustive. Claims from former civilian internees who were held captive in other camps would be considered in accordance with the aforementioned internment definition. A small number of claims have been paid to civilians who were not detained at locations directly under the control of the Japanese. These payments were made in error, largely in the initial phase of the scheme. This happened either because eligibility decisions were based on lists of those who had benefited individually or as a family member under the 1950s compensation scheme based on liquidated Japanese assets where the family member may not themselves have been interned, or because the status of some locations had not been fully established.

<p><a name="st_138"><a name="60424w15.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The UK has made regular representations to the King and Government of Nepal, calling on them to restore democracy and to pursue a negotiated political settlement to the conflict involving all of the main actors. Most recently, on 5 April officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) met with the Nepalese ambassador to the UK. We told him that the King and Government were to a large extent responsible for the current impasse: the King&#039;s offer to talk to the parties did not amount to a substantive move towards restoration of democracy. We conveyed our concerns about the dangers of a heavy-handed crackdown in response to demonstrations, including the announcement of a shoot to kill policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_140">In February FCO officials visited Kathmandu and met with the Home Minister. They conveyed our concerns about continuing arrests and detention of political activists, restrictions on the media and the absence of consultations involving all sides in Nepal leading to a full return to democracy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w15.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_141">From 18&#150;24 March the hon. Member was part of a delegation of British parliamentarians which visited Nepal, funded by the FCO under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool. That visit aimed to support the democratic movement and put pressure on the King to restore democracy. The first objective was achieved. The delegation held high profile meetings, both individually and in joint seminars, with all the main party leaders except Madhav Kumar Nepal. The delegation encouraged party activists in Biratnagar, Nepal&#039;s second largest town, in the Terai. The second objective proved more difficult. The King avoided meeting the delegation. The delegation did meet the King&#039;s most senior advisor, Tulsi Giri, and the Chief of Army Staff. They also had dinner with a number of the King&#039;s advisors.

<p>
<a name="60424w15.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">On 11 April, the presidency of the European Union issued a statement deploring the escalating violence and excessive use of force by all sides and calling upon those concerned to exercise restraint. The statement also called on the King of Nepal to take an urgent initiative to resolve the present problems by restoring democracy and by reaching out to all political forces to initiate a dialogue for peace.

<sup>(12)</sup>Rates per 100,000 population standardised to the European Standard Population.<br>

Directly age-standardised rates have been supplied rather than Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) to allow comparisons between 1997 and 2004, between York and North Yorkshire and between the sexes.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup>The causes of death for 2004 were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)<br>

All cancers (malignant neoplasms)&#151;ICD-10 C00-C97<br>

Breast cancer&#151;ICD-10 C50<br>

The causes of death for 1997 were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).<br>

The codes used are listed below:<br>

All cancers (malignant neoplasms)&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208<br>

Breast cancer&#151;ICD-9 174<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in England and Wales in 2001 means that data for all cancers and female breast cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from these causes is described in a report published in May 2002:<br>

Office for National Statistics. Results of the ICD-10 bridge coding study, England and Wales, 1999.<br>

Health Statistics Quarterly 14 (2002), 75&#150;83.<br>

For all cancers (malignant neoplasms) the introduction of ICD-10 caused an increase of 2.5 per cent. and 2.2 per cent. for males and females respectively and for female breast cancer an increase of 2.7 per cent. in the number of deaths coded to these conditions in England and Wales. Death rates for 1997 from these causes have been adjusted to make them comparable with those for 2004. The numbers of deaths have not been adjusted.<br>

 The child trust fund is designed to give more to those children in low-income households. If a child born before the introduction of child tax credit in April 2003 was part of a household receiving a specified income-related benefit when child benefit was first awarded, an additional payment will be credited to the child&#039;s account. Statutory maternity pay is not an income-related benefit. Receipt of statutory maternity pay does not necessarily indicate that a household is on a low income.

<p><a name="qn_198"><a name="60424w21.html_wqn14"><b> Mark Durkan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will estimate the number of jobs likely to be affected by the end of PEACE funding; and what steps each Department is taking to ensure that work and services provided through PEACE funding can be sustained in the long-term.  [63122]</p>








<p><a name="st_197"><a name="60424w21.html_spnew14"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 Many projects will end naturally in line with original plans. For all projects it was a condition of their assistance that they would sustain their activities when PEACE funding ended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_175">The European Council agreed in December 2005 to allocate a further 200 million to the EU PEACE Programme for 2007 to 2013 and the funding would not end until that time. For Northern Ireland the annual amount available will, however, be approximately half current levels. How this will be allocated will only be determined after a consultation process later this year and it is not yet possible to say what activities will not continue and to estimate precisely the impact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_176">The primary purpose of PEACE funding is to promote peace and reconciliation outcomes and not solely the creation or maintenance of job opportunities where different sectors will be affected differently by any reductions in expenditure levels. Employment in successful private sector and social economy enterprises will continue. For the voluntary and community sector it is estimated that EU funding currently supports an estimated 1,500 jobs and at half annual funding levels this would suggest that up to 750 of these could be at potential risk. Any expenditure areas that are brought within mainstream expenditure will mitigate this. For example employment in children&#039;s projects is, following the recent announcement of the Children&#039;s and Young Peoples funding package, ensured until March 2008.

 DFID has not provided funding specifically to the Action for Southern Africa Sanitary Appeal. DFID has, however, provided funds to the International Organisation for Migration to assist the most poor and vulnerable households displaced as a result of the Government of Zimbabwe&#039;s urban clean-up operations and land reform programme. Sanitary products are included in the pack of non-food items which to date have been distributed to nearly 12,000 families, many of whom are affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis in the country.

We expect these to remain our priorities in the coming year, with a planned expenditure of approximately 30 million channelled through UN Agencies and non-governmental organisations.

<p><a name="st_203"><a name="60424w22.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The low availability and high cost of purpose-made female sanitary products for menstrual protection means that they are generally not used by poor women and girls in developing countries. In general, strips of old cloth are used to provide protection during menstruation. Critically, to ensure hygiene, comfort and to lessen vulnerability to reproductive tract infections these cloths must be clean and dry. However, a lack of basic infrastructure such as toilets and clean water combined with social taboos means that it is often difficult and embarrassing to wash and dry these cloths. Women and girls also face problems bathing due to lack of facilities that provide privacy. Consequently damp or even dirty rags are re-used.

 The Department&#039;s policies and actions have had a significant impact on west Lancashire since 2 May 1997.

Here is a non-exhaustive outline of the effects on the constituency.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Apr 2006 : Column 902W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para2">
In sport, over &#163;3 billion has been invested from the lottery and Exchequer since 1997 to help us achieve our vision of an active and successful sporting nation. We have put in place the first ever comprehensive national school sport strategy which will have benefited from &#163;1.5 billion of joint investment from DCMS and DFES by 2008. To help achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested heavily in our local and community sporting infrastructure, including thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. In west Lancashire, sports facilities have benefited from nine Sport England lottery grants totalling &#163;2,347,120.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_212">In addition, west Lancashire has received &#163;192,501 from Awards for All, supporting 51 projects benefiting sport. The Glenburn School Sport Partnership, comprising four local secondary schools and 31 primary schools, has also received &#163;185,063, and an award to the value of &#163;674,259 for September 2005 to August 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_213">In the arts sector we have increased national funding, in real terms, by 60 per cent. from &#163;199 million in 1998&#150;99 to &#163;367 million in 2004&#150;05. Between 1998&#150;99 and 2003&#150;04 Arts Council England investment in the north west region, through Exchequer funding, increased from &#163;7.6 million to &#163;19.6 million, with a total investment of &#163;34.8 million in 2005&#150;06 (2005&#150;06 includes lottery figures). West Lancashire has benefited from grants to arts projects, organisations and individuals, including &#163;17,000 to the Chapel Gallery&#039;s education and outreach programme; and &#163;5,000 to Open Arts, based in Skelmersdale.

<a name="stpa_214">In the museum sector we have supported the leading north west museum services through the Renaissance in the Regions Programme&quot;, that will invest &#163;1.7 million regionally in 2006&#150;07. West Lancashire also benefits from its geographical proximity to National Museums Liverpool and the free access for all visitors that is on offer.

<a name="stpa_215">In heritage, English Heritage offered grants worth &#163;257,555 to a combination of St Thomas the Martyr, Upholland; St John the Baptist, Burscough; Scarisbrick Hall, Ormskirk; and St Michael and All Angels, Dalton, Skelmersdale. In addition English Heritage also gave &#163;75,000 to a Heritage economic regeneration scheme in Ormskirk.

<a name="60424w26.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_216">In libraries, in common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in west Lancashire are connected to the internet through the People&#039;s Network which was funded through a &#163;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom&#039;s public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &#163;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage overall improvement across the public libraries sector in England.

<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_219">In the creative industries, since 2004 funding has been given to help finance film projects in Ormskirk, Parbold and Merebrow, enabling the production of short films, screenings and digitisation projects, and travel bursaries to international film festivals for sales opportunities. The awards have been in excess of &#163;4,500.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_220">In tourism, west Lancashire has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including the North West RDA. These changes, together with VisitBritain&#039;s successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including west Lancashire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_221">The Government have also implemented the Licensing Act 2003, the biggest overhaul in licensing law for 40 years. It contains vital measures in the battle against alcohol related crime and disorder while allowing the majority of responsible adults the freedom to enjoy their leisure time. It gives police and local authorities the power to take tougher action against under-age drinking, antisocial behaviour, and to protect residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and noise. It will also provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration, and increased employment opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_222">The Gambling Act 2005 will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local licensing authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licences and local licensing authorities will be able to decide not to issue licences for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in west Lancashire, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w26.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_223">Finally, information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since 2 May 1997 west Lancashire has benefited from over 246 awards totalling over &#163;7.9 million.

<a name="stpa_226">As the trend in inflation has been steadily downwards since the 1970s the previous methodology introduced a bias towards those with the biggest pension pots in the 1970s, who are those retiring earliest in the data series.

Notes:<br>

1.Lump sums and weekly pensions are all in 2004 earnings terms.<br>

2.The tables above present results from a hypothetical analysis of pension fund investment. The model is based on the following assumptions and underlying data:<br>

A person contributes to a pension fund for 31 years (this is an individual pension fund as opposed to an occupational one). The investment generates returns for 30 years.<br>

Contributions are made at 5 per cent. of gross earnings.<br>

Individuals earn average earnings (&#163;22,000 in 2004 terms) for the entirety of their working life (Annual survey of hours and earnings, Office of National Statistics).<br>

Contributions are made annually at the end of each year.<br>

The return on equities is based on an average of UK equities (FTSE All-Share Index) and Overseas equities (Composite index for representative overseas markets, and FT/S&P World Ex-UK Index from 1987). To be published in Pension Fund Indicators 2004, UBS Global Asset Management.<br>

The return on bonds/gilts is based on an average of UK bonds (FTA Over 15-year Index, and UBS 25-year index up to 1975) and Overseas bonds (JP Morgan Global Bond Index, ex UK). To be published in Pension Fund Indicators 2003, UBS Global Asset Management.<br>

1 per cent. of the value of the fund at the end of each year is deducted from the fund, in order to account for charging/fees.<br>

Upon retirement at the end of the final year of investment, an annuity is purchased at a prevailing market rate. The annuity rates are as at December each year, for a level annuity (for &#163;100,000), male aged 65, single life, guaranteed five years. These have been supplied by Annuity Direct.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Benefit expenditure figures are rounded to the nearest &#163; million. The figures do not include administration expenditure.<br>

2.Administration percentages (of benefit expenditure only and not the sum of benefit expenditure and administration expenditure) been obtained from previously published departmental reports (see source). The social fund percentage is of expenditure and loan recoveries, whereas the social fund benefit expenditure figures shown in the tables are net of recoveries. The percentage of income support includes 



expenditure on the over 60&#039;s age group. The 1996&#150;97 administration percentage of income support paid to the unemployed is shown separately. (Jobseeker&#039;s allowance-income based replaced income support paid to the unemployed in October 1996. Jobseeker&#039;s allowance-income based administration expenditure figures are not shown in the table).<br>

3.Information on the costs (and therefore percentages) of administering benefits from 1999&#150;2000 onwards is not currently available in the format requested. In accordance with the requirements of Resource Accounting and Budgeting the Department now accounts for its administration and benefit expenditure by Strategic Objective, as set out in its public service agreements (PSA), and by individual Requests for Resources (RfRs), as set out in the Departmental Estimates and Accounts.<br>

Sources:<br>

Table 3 DWP expenditure tables published on the internet at http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp. All figures are consistent with the pre-Budget report (5 December 2005).<br>

Administration percentages are from Department for Social Security Departmental Reports, published in April 1998 (1996&#150;97 figure), March 1999 (1997&#150;98 figure) and April 2000 (1998&#150;99 figure).<br>

Notes<br>

1.To place these figures into context, it should be noted that, whilst only 42 per cent. of non resident parents paid their maintenance liability in full over the quarter ending December 2005, the Agency obtained some form of payment from 70 per cent. of cases in which maintenance was due via the collection service. Where any such payment was obtained, on average, 90 per cent. of the amount due was collected.<br>

2.Data is not available prior to 1995.<br>

3.&#039;u/a&#039; indicates that data is unavailable due to limitations in management information.<br>

4.Numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole per cent.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Figures are provided using a three-year average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide at regional level. Hence, figures may not be consistent with previously published single-year estimates.<br>

2.It is not possible to present estimates from the FRS below Government office region level due to small sample sizes, and the survey design not being fully representative at this level.<br>

3.Regional figures for the north west and Merseyside are rounded to the nearest 10,000 rather than the usual 100,000 as presented in the HBAI publication. This is because the standard approach does not give an informative view of changes over time at this level of disaggregation.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps he plans to take to reduce disincentives for unemployed people to return to work resulting from higher effective marginal deduction rates; and if he will make a statement.  [64011]</p>








<p><a name="st_254"><a name="60424w31.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s policies in recent years have already gone a long way to ensuring work pays, for example through the introduction of the national minimum wage and working tax credit, as well as the introduction of the 10p starting rate of income tax.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_253">Since 1997, the number of people facing marginal deduction rates of over 70 per cent. has fallen by half a million and the new increased income disregard in tax credits, of &#163;25,000 from April 2006, means that families receiving tax credits where someone moves into work keep the same entitlement for the rest of the tax year, rather than seeing tax credit payments reduced, even if the job is paid at the average wage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_254">The Government have also piloted the use of additional transitional support for targeted groups making the move off benefit and into work. We have developed an effective strategy for helping more lone parents make the transition from benefits and into work which combines child care assistance, financial support for those entering work and provision of work focused advice and support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_255">The &#163;40 in work credit for lone parents has been piloted in a number of Jobcentre Plus districts since 2004, providing support for the first year in employment. The child and working tax credits are helping to tackle child poverty and make work pay for all families, including lone parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_256">For incapacity benefit claimants, the Pathways to work pilots include a similar &#163;40 per week return to work credit. The Welfare Reform Green Paper announced in January our intention to rollout Pathways to the remaining two-thirds of the country by 2008&#150;09.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w31.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_257">Our analysis shows that many more people are already better off in work than on benefit as a result of tax credits and we believe this and other policies designed to make work pay have contributed to record levels of employment&#151;now at the highest level since records began.

Islington has set up an Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO) and is receiving additional funding through this for investing in its housing stock. It also has two housing PFI schemes tackling almost 5,000 street properties below the decent homes standard.

A person whose employment has been restricted by the Secretary of State may only work in a post which does not contravene the terms of their restriction. I should also point out that further checks, in addition to List 99, should be undertaken before a teacher is appointed. The fact that an individual is not barred cannot in isolation imply their suitability for a post.

 We understand that there are several British expatriates living in China and wanting to adopt through the Chinese domestic system. The Chinese Government has asked for a certificate confirming that these persons are suitable to adopt. In the absence of an assessment completed by an adoption agency in accordance with UK law, it is not possible for the Government to confirm to the Chinese authorities the suitability of such a person to be an adoptive parent. If a certificate were issued without a thorough assessment, this might result in the placement of a child with a person who has not been assessed and approved to adopt&#151;and who could be manifestly unsuitable. Without a certificate, however, the Chinese Government will not allow British expatriates to adopt.

 In almost all circumstances the dismissal of a head teacher is a matter for the governing body of the school. However, in exceptional circumstances, there is limited scope for this decision to be taken in conjunction with the local authority, or at their suggestion. This may happen when the school&#039;s delegated budget has been suspended or it is determined that the head teacher has failed to secure the National Professional Qualification for Headship within set limits. Additionally, in the most extreme circumstances the Government can become directly involved. Where it can be clearly shown that a governing body has acted illegally in not dismissing a head teacher, the Secretary of State has the power under Section 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996 to intervene and direct the Governing Body to dismiss the head teacher.

 Evidence on the effectiveness of pupil referral units is available, as for other schools, from inspections undertaken by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). The latest Ofsted Annual Report, published in October 2005, found that 25 of the 38 pupil referral units inspected in 2004/05, 25 were good or better, providing effectively for the young people they serve. Of the remaining 13 units, 10 were found to be satisfactory and three were unsatisfactory. Ofsted also found that the quality of teaching was good or better in 29 of the units, and unsatisfactory in only one, that the units generally provided a curriculum that meets the particular needs of their pupils, and that the quality of accommodation in units continues to improve. Subject to parliamentary assent, the measures within the Education and Inspections Bill will require local authorities to take faster and more decisive action to turn round schools in special measures or requiring significant improvement. These expectations will also apply to pupil referral units which fail an Ofsted inspection.

 We have made no specific assessment of the effect on schools of losing funds when children are permanently excluded. The principle is well established that funding must follow a permanently excluded pupil to their new education provider to ensure that the pupil&#039;s education continues. The amount that transfers from the school is calculated according to a formula which is set out in regulations. Local authorities, however, may deduct an additional amount in accordance with discretionary arrangements made under their local funding formula. The Department does not control these local arrangements. The total amount that a school loses will depend on the factors included in any funding formulae and the date in the financial year when the exclusion takes effect.

The overall increase in resources is now forecast to be more than 40 per cent. for the three-year period, equating to spend on primary medical care services of around &#163;7.6 billion in 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the impact on patients&#039; prognoses of delays in the commencement of radiotherapy treatment; and what steps she plans to take to speed up the commencement of treatment for those patients requiring radiotherapy.  [64480]</p>








<p><a name="st_377"><a name="60424w44.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally, nor is the impact of delays in radiotherapy treatment. We know from a recent audit by the Royal College of Radiologists, that waiting times for radiotherapy in some parts of the country are unacceptably long but that the situation is improving. The NHS Cancer Plan sets out maximum waiting time targets for cancer treatment which may include radiotherapy where this is given as a first definitive treatment. From December 2005, there is a maximum two-month wait from urgent referral to treatment and a maximum one-month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w44.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_361">To tackle radiotherapy waiting times, we are increasing the numbers of therapy radiographers in post and in training, making better use of existing staff, making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy equipment, and streamlining the patient journey. Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, is also currently working with Royal Colleges, professional bodies, cancer networks and trusts through the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group, who are looking into radiotherapy provision and will be reporting in the summer on recommendations for long-term solutions for the future.

<p><a name="st_378"><a name="60424w44.html_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 High salt intakes are associated with high blood pressure, which is one of a number of risk factors that contribute to the incidence of cardiovascular disease. There are also other risk factors which contribute to high blood pressure such as being overweight, physical inactivity, and excess alcohol consumption. It is difficult to accurately separate out the impact of salt reduction, from other factors, on the incidence of strokes and heart disease and my Department has not made an evaluation of this type.

 Achievement of the Government&#039;s targets for reducing salt intakes of adults and children will be dependent upon a range of factors. In addition to the Food Standards Agency&#039;s (FSA) voluntary salt reduction targets, changes in consumption patterns and reductions in the amount of salt added to foods by consumers will have an impact. It is not possible to predict accurately exactly when the targets for dietary intakes will be met for adults and children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60424w44.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_362">The FSA&#039;s salt reduction targets, however, cover those foods that contribute most of the salt in the diet of both adults and children, and have been set at levels that are both challenging and will have a real impact on consumers&#039; intakes. The FSA aims to monitor reductions in consumers&#039; salt intakes using urinary monitoring and will review the salt reduction targets in 2008 to ensure continued progress towards the dietary intake targets.
