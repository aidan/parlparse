In the &#145;Hepatitis C Action Plan for England&#146;, there are two national outcome indicators, drawn from epidemiological surveillance by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), intended to track increased testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para0"><a name="07021932000624">The first indicator is the total number of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C infection reports. There has been a significant increase in hepatitis C diagnoses in England reported to the HPA through national surveillance from around 4,700 in 2001 before initial hepatitis C awareness-raising activities begun, to around 7,600 in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para1"><a name="07021932000625">The second indicator is the proportion of those attending treatment and support agencies for injecting drug users who are aware of their hepatitis C infection. This proportion has increased from 41 per cent. in 2001 to 52 per cent. in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para2"><a name="07021932000626">Other surveillance sources also indicate that hepatitis C testing and diagnosis is increasing. For example, in the unlinked anonymous prevalence monitoring programme, the proportion of injecting drug users attending specialist services who self-report a previous hepatitis C test has increased from 55 per cent. in 2001 to 71 per cent. in 2005. Sentinel surveillance of hepatitis C testing in nine laboratories from 2002-2005 indicates that overall the number of individuals tested for hepatitis C increased by nearly 40 per cent. Testing by general practitioners and in genitor-urinary medicine services both increased by over 50 per cent. and in prisons by around 65 per cent.</p>

This means that 0.11 per cent. of the population of England has been diagnosed with hepatitis C and reported to the national surveillance system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para3"><a name="07021932000629">There is some indication from comparison of the number of hepatitis C diagnoses reported through sentinel surveillance in certain parts of the country against those reported to national surveillance that there may be significant under-reporting by laboratories. The HPA's view is that it may be possible that under-reporting of hepatitis C diagnoses to routine surveillance could be significant. This could mean that approximately 100,000 people in England might already have been diagnosed.</p>

Both companies are manufacturing to their full available capacity but they are unable to produce sufficient to meet historic levels of demand. We have been in close and ongoing discussions with the suppliers to increase the levels of the drug supplied to the NHS and believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks patient care is not being compromised. This is in part because we arranged for the increased production and availability of other alternative drugs such as morphine when the problem arose in December 2004.</p>

Afghanistan (MISFA) management to assess the current status of the Afghan microfinance sector and MISFA&#146;s role in developing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70219w0013.htm_para14"><a name="07021932001106">The review found that the Afghanistan Government&#146;s MISFA has made significant progress in helping Afghans to invest in income generating activities. Rapidly increasing the number of people receiving loans over a short period has been successful in helping to build the microfinance sector. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women. So far, over &#163;83 million worth of small loans have been given to 234,000 families, shopkeepers, tailors, farmers, builders and others to invest and increase their savings. The review suggested that with continued support and an enabling environment, there is potential for many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to become financially sustainable over the next three years. To date, the role of the MISFA to support the sector has been successful, and justifies a clear need for its continuation to channel funds to the MFIs to improve their capacity, outreach and sustainability. The MISFA&#146;s design and implementation can serve as a good example for building microfinance sector in conflict affected countries.</p>

It should provide duty and quota-free access into EU markets and simpler and more liberal rules of origin to ensure effective market access. It should allow ACP countries maximum flexibility as regards their own market opening and an effective safeguard mechanism for countries to use in the face of subsidised EU products.

By late 2007, DFID projects will have improved access to water for around a million people in southern Iraq.</p>

These included the Prime Minister's Office, the Council of Ministers Secretariat, and the Government Communications Directorate. The team of technical experts advised the Iraqi government on institutional structures and staff roles and responsibilities.

Our 2006 assessment of the support to the centre of government project showed that despite changes in Government personnel, the project has met its objectives. The organisational structures set up under the Iraqi interim government were successfully built upon when Prime Minister Maliki took office in May 2006. In an environment beset by political and security challenges, efforts to build institutional capacity take time; now staff are more effectively trained and able to develop policy. We expect to continue our support to these institutions during the course of 2007, to consolidate the gains made in public sector management practices at the heart of government.</p>

Grants of &#163;5,000 to &#163;300,000 were made to organisations for activities such as workshops to educate voters and written pamphlets to explain the functions and responsibilities of different parts of government.

The pilot lasted for two years, between September 2003 and September 2005. 347 offenders volunteered for testing, 33 per cent. of whom (116) were tested on two or more occasions. In total, 483 polygraph examinations were carried out. The majority of offenders tested had been convicted of offences against children: 166 (48 per cent.) of contact offences against children, 111 (32 per cent.) of internet related offences, with 70 (20 per cent.) for offences classified as other sex offences. Rapists were not separately classified but were among this 20 per cent. of the sample. The main aim of the study was to assist Offender Managers in risk assessment and risk management based on new disclosures made by offenders during the examination. Overall new disclosures relevant to treatment or supervision were made in 70 per cent. of tests. However, the report does not provide information on differences between offence types and, as the sample was of volunteers, no firm conclusions may be drawn from it as to whether the disclosures are attributable to the polygraph tests.

Youth Justice Board and the Prison Service, which contains a specific service specification for the service's five dedicated girls' units. The PSO requires that staff working with under-18s should receive specialist training as specified in the SLA. Training is currently provided through the Juvenile Awareness Staff Programme, which contains elements specific to young women. The SLA sets a level of at least 10 hours a day for time out of cell. The under-18 version of the Offender's Learning Journey (OLJ), the specification for the learning and skills delivery service, requires each learner to receive 25 hours learning a week. The SLA reinforces this with the requirement that young people in young offender institutions receive an average of 25 hours of education, training and personal development activity each week. The OLJ requires that every young person should have an Individual Learning Plan, which the learning provider is required to pass on as young people transfer between custodial institutions and, through the youth offending team, to the responsible learning provider following release.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
 1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is underway to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>

This includes strengthening institutional capacity to address forced labour and the worst forms of child labour. It is critical that the underlying poverty that is at the root of trafficking and child labour is tackled. Stopping child labour without ensuring alternative income for the family or appropriate, good quality education opportunities for the children is likely to be ineffective and may drive children into more hidden and harmful jobs.</p>

the last century it was recorded from various sites in the Norfolk Broads and Lincolnshire fens but, since 1910, it has been known from only a single site, Pashford Poors Fen in Suffolk. It has not been seen since 1986.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="70219w0035.htm_para20"><a name="0702205000211">Pashford Poors Fen is probably not an ideal location for this species, as it comprises a series of small wetlands in a matrix of dry Breckland grassland. The area has not been subject to the extensive sallow scrub invasion that the beetle needs, and may be too small to support a thriving population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70219w0035.htm_para21"><a name="0702205000212">A study in 2006 found that, in Britain, the Sussex Diving Beetle, <i> Laccophilus poecilus</i> (also called the Puzzled Skipper), has mainly been associated with grazing fen in richly vegetated ditch margins. However, this species can also occupy a wide range of stagnant habitats. Occasional captures of specimens in Yorkshire suggest that there is as yet an undiscovered colony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="70219w0035.htm_para22"><a name="0702205000213">The RSPB has recently acquired a large area of land at Lewes Levels, which includes the last known recorded locality for this species. Over a year ago a site visit was undertaken by representatives from the RSPB, Natural England and the Aquatic Coleoptera Conservation Trust to determine what site management could be carried out for the species. The issue of water quality was also raised. It was considered that the construction of on-site water bodies (ponds) that were not linked to the main water system of ditches (and hence isolated from eutrophication) would be beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"><a name="70219w0035.htm_para23"><a name="0702205000214">Circumstance permitting, it is expected that the RSPB will undertake work to create suitable ponds in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="70219w0039.htm_para12"><a name="0702205000551">We recognise that service parents may find it difficult to maintain the continuity of their children's education, due to the nature of their employment and the unique demands of military life. It is for this reason that there are various educational allowances available to eligible service personnel to help meet some of the costs of ensuring continuity of their children&#146;s education. Continuity of education for their children would not otherwise be possible in the state maintained day school sector if these children accompanied their parents to postings in both the UK and overseas. However, the Ministry of Defence does not reimburse the full cost of school fees and parents are required to pay a minimum 10 per cent. parental contribution for each child when they claim a service education allowance. Also, when assessing each claim, any grant or scholarship made by the school, official benefactors, local education authorities or other public bodies, and any discounts offered to the service parent by the school, is deducted from the fees before the 10 per cent. minimum parental contribution is calculated. It is a matter for the service parent to decide which state or private sector boarding school they wish their children to attend. In doing so, service parents will consider the full cost of their child's education, a significant part of which will be schools fees, for which all parents must pay a minimum 10 per cent.</p>

Following my announcement to the House on 29 January 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 4WS, a joint Army and Navy working group is taking forward the planning and implementation of the attachment of 1 Rifles to 3 Commando Brigade from 1 April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="70219w0043.htm_para5"><a name="0702205001424">There is no requirement for 1 Rifles personnel to attend a pre-course or to undertake the full all arms commando course in order to carry out their role as the fourth manoeuvre unit for 3 Commando Brigade. Individuals may in the course of their individual career development, apply for and attend the all arms commando course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_504"><a name="70219w0043.htm_para6"><a name="0702205001425">The attachment of 1 Rifles to 3 Commando Brigade will enable the Brigade to be both on standby for contingent operations while simultaneously providing units to the Current Operational Commitments Plot. This will increase the overall delivery of military capability in line with Defence Strategic Guidance. The integration of an Infantry Battalion into a strong coalition amphibious structure that includes the US Marine Corps and the Royal Netherland Marine Corps units will have wider Defence benefits. In addition, the co-operation and co-ordination of effort between the Army and Navy will bring benefits in terms of resource and information sharing in the training and education of soldiers and single service tactics, techniques and procedures. Army understanding of operations in the littoral environment will also be broadened.</p>

An impact of the Order is that the boundaries of the new Assembly Constituencies will differ from those of the parliamentary constituencies until coterminosity is restored at the date of the next General Election. I understand that an equivalent order for parliamentary constituencies in England will be laid in due course and much of the following reply applies equally to such constituencies.</p>

The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev2"><a name="07022015002898"><ul><p class="tabletext">The tables below show the average annual payment of income tax and national insurance contributions expressed as a percentage of gross household income, for household in each income decile. The income deciles are based on a ranking of households using equivalised disposable household income (rather than taxable income). This is the standard measure of income used for distributional analysis.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev3"><a name="07022015002899"><ul><p class="tabletext">The percentages are reasonably comparable over time. The figures in the annual analysis are not deflated or expressed in real terms because the main focus of interest is in the income distribution and how this distribution changes over time. However, even if the figures used to calculate the percentages appearing below were adjusted for average price changes using the Retail Prices Index, the percentages would be the same, since both gross household income, and tax payments would be adjusted by the same factor.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev4"><a name="07022015002900"><ul><p class="tabletext">There was a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards, which has some effect on the estimates of income tax payment. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev5"><a name="07022015002901"><ul><p class="tabletext">From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev6"><a name="07022015002902"><ul><p class="tabletext">So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change is to reduce the estimate of income tax as a proportion of gross income by 0.4%.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0052.htm_brev7"><a name="07022015002903"><ul><p class="tabletext">The percentage payments reflect both the number of households paying each tax, and the size of the payments.

national index in 150 local authorities by the end of 2008. We are now nearing completion of the design phase which will include agreement of the proposed build and implementation plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_548"><a name="70219w0053.htm_para3"><a name="07022015001930">The index will contain a limited and basic record for all children in England up to the age of 18 including basic identifying information&#151;name, address, gender, data of birth, and a unique identifying number based on the existing child reference number/national insurance number; contact details for the child&#146;s parent of carer; contact details for services involved with the child; a means for practitioners to indicate that they have information to share, have taken action, or have undertaken a Common Assessment Framework in relation to the child; and other information, included solely for the purposes of identifying and managing the quality of data in the index, for example the date of the last update to the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="70219w0053.htm_para4"><a name="07022015001931">Section 12 and the supporting regulations specifically prohibit the inclusion of any case information on the index.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_551"><a name="70219w0053.htm_para6"><a name="07022015001933">A recent public consultation, which concluded on 14 December 2006, sought views on a number of additional data items for inclusion on the index including the addition of name and contact details of the child&#146;s health visitor, school nurse and named midwife and, where appropriate, the date of death. Inclusion of the date of death will help to ensure that practitioners who had been working with the child become aware that the child has died and, where approaching the family is necessary, can do so sensitively. It will also enable a timely closure of the record.</p>

Data sources are yet to be confirmed but officials are in discussions with a number of national organisations. Draft regulations set out those organisations and bodies who we expect to be required and those who we expect to be permitted to supply information to the index. Wherever it is possible, securing data from existing practitioner systems will avoid the need for double data entry on the part of practitioners. Where direct data feeds are not possible, practitioners may be required to enter the information directly into the index via a web browser or indirectly via an authorised index user.</p>

increasing the penalty for those who misuse personal data from a fine to imprisonment for up to two years. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 provides that unauthorised access, or attempted unauthorised access, to a program or data held on a computer may be punishable by imprisonment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_554"><a name="70219w0053.htm_para9"><a name="07022015001936">The draft regulations made under section 12 specify the types of practitioners in the children&#146;s work force whose role would make it appropriate for them to have access to the index including practitioners from health, education, social care and youth justice. Access will be granted according to the role of the practitioner. For example, in a school a small number of named designated staff, such as teachers of children with special educational needs or those with pastoral or child protection responsibilities will have access. Before being granted access to the index, all practitioners will have undergone an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, any other relevant checks and relevant training in the safe and secure use of the index.</p>

I expect to be in a position shortly to make an announcement.</p>
