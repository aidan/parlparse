Split by Ministry, the largest share (39 per cent.) went to the Ministry of Education.

We have also issued guidance on methods of keeping domestic birds separate from wild birds, if housing is not practical, by feeding and watering domestic birds under cover where possible. Bird feed and any standing water should be kept free from contamination by wild birds and other animals. Poultry owners should make sure that hands, clothes and footwear are clean before and after contact with birds. Owners need to be vigilant and monitor their birds frequently.</p>

Eligible prisoners are not granted HDC unless they pass a careful risk assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para10"><a name="0702212000447">These figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and although shown to the last individual, the figures may not be accurate to that level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para11"><a name="0702212000448">As noted in the footnote to table 10.19, investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded on this system do not relate to the offence they were released on HDC for, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence. Our inquiries have shown that this is the case with the two offenders classified as sexual offenders in table 10.19.</p>

3. Data represents children dependent on a parent or guardian claiming one or more of the following benefits: incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance, jobseeker&#146;s allowance, income support or pension credit.<br>
4. Due to the introduction of child tax credits in April 2003, information on child dependents are not reliably completed on the benefit computer system. Therefore children have been merged onto IS/JSA/IB/SDA/PC claims from child benefit with permission of HMRC.<br>

Figures for the regions and countries are presented using a three-year moving average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes. Hence, figures are not consistent with any previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. In circumstances such as a change in trend, moving averages will show less variation than single-year estimates.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="70219w0018.htm_para4"><a name="0702212001971">In practice, very few pensioners who face a 100 per cent. withdrawal rate at some point will do so over the whole of their retirement; by 2050 just 2 per cent. pensioners will receive the guarantee credit only when they first reach state pension age. Even then, we would expect many to be able to reduce the interaction between additional private saving and benefit entitlement by taking some or all of their private pension income as a lump sum. &#145;Less than 10 per cent. of pensioner households&#146; can therefore be considered a cautious estimate.</p>

Our Diversity Equality Scheme has provided us with a framework to ensure that the FCO meets its statutory duties and promotes inclusive management practice so that all staff of whatever background are encouraged to fulfil their potential.</p>

This has included surveys, Gender Equality Workshops and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis of FCO gender equality issues. With the assistance of the Women and Equality Unit at the Department for Communities and Local Government, a detailed action plan is being drawn up.</p>

Every book includes notes on how to complete the MCCD. These make clear that doctors are required to complete the MCCD to the best of their knowledge and belief. They are asked to include on the death certificate every disease or condition which, in their clinical judgment, contributed to the death either directly or indirectly.</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0027.htm_brev1"><a name="07022131003506"><ul><p class="tabletext">Updated guidance to certifiers was published on the GRO website in July 2005 (www.gro.gov.uk/medcert). The updated guidance specifically draws attention to health care associated infections (HCAI). HCAI, including disease due to clostridium difficile, should be treated exactly the same as any other disease when it comes to death certification. If, in the certifying doctor's clinical judgment, it was part of the sequence leading directly to death, it should be written in part I of the MCCD. If the doctor thinks that it was not part of the direct sequence, but did contribute to causing the patient's death indirectly, he should write it in part II of the MCCD.</p>

Identifying the exact allocations made to places of safety or PICUs is not possible because some of the successful bids combine development of PICUs and places of safety as single bids, not as separate projects.

Secondly, further statutory requirements would run counter to the overall aim of current curriculum reform to give schools greater flexibilities to plan and deliver the school curriculum.

The Learning and Skills Council (LSC), partnered by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) and the Department for Education and Skills are working closely with the FE sector to develop the framework. Through consultation, piloting, testing and trialling they will continue to explore a range of options to help decide the best and most appropriate measures to assess quality of outcomes&#151;including those for non-accredited learning.</p>

This means that all providers can aspire to, and achieve, an excellent standard measured against set criteria rather than achieving excellence relative to others. So it will be theoretically possible for all LSC-funded providers to achieve excellence under the framework.</p>

As a result of that process, we are considering what additional support may be included in family literacy, language and numeracy provision to meet the language needs of families and in particular of women who are parents. We are also considering how women can demonstrate an entitlement for free ESOL where they have no access to either benefits documentation of their own or to family funding. These groups are among the highest priority learners for Skills for Life provision.</p>

The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals but stresses that all cases must be considered on their individual merits. The factors include: the overall impact on local standards of provision, the demand/supply of school places, the impact on the local community and the views of interested parties. Decision making arrangements will change in May, when we aim to introduce the new provisions of the Education and Inspections Act.

However the average migrant worker (across all countries of origin) makes a positive contribution to the UK economy. Migrants (defined as people not born in the UK) constitute 10.5 per cent. of people above the age of 16 in the UK. Migrants (including family reunification and refugees) typically have lower employment rates than the UK average, around 5 per cent. lower, but typically earn 8 per cent. more. Assuming that the higher earning signify that migrants are, on average, more productive, this would indicate that migrants contribute around 11 per cent. to total gross domestic product, and cause a small but positive increase to gross domestic product per capita.</p>

 (a) Prior to 31 March 2004 HRA Subsidy included a rent rebate element. Figures provided are for the housing element only, which equates precisely with HRA Subsidy system since 1 April 2004.<br>
(b) The Major Repairs Allowance was introduced in 2001, providing substantial additional funds to counter depreciation of housing stock.<br>
(c) 2004-05 saw a 47 per cent. increase in West Lancashire&#146;s maintenance allowances as part of the initial effects of rebasing took effect. There was, in the same period, a reduction in assumed rental income following a small reduction in housing stock levels over the previous year. Together these factors reduced the level of negative subsidy generated by the authority substantially.<br>

At this stage, options for housing development in Solihull are between 11,000 and 18,000 new homes, however, it is possible that the final figure for Solihull may be different from these figures depending on the outcome of the consultation. The location and level of housing are a matter for the regional and local planning process.

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="70219w0056.htm_para4"><a name="07022140000102">I would like to refer the hon. Member to the measures the Government are taking forward to improve consumer protection in the doorstep selling market. This is further to the announcement I made on 7 September 2006 which stated that in response to the OFT's market study on doorstep selling and cold calling, and the subsequent public consultation, we would:</p>
<a name="70219w0056.htm_brev0"><a name="07022140001180"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) extend cancellation rights and a cooling off period to consumers for sales concluded in their home following a solicited visit, similar to those they currently enjoy for unsolicited visits;</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0056.htm_brev1"><a name="07022140001181"><ul><p class="tabletext">(b) require traders to include cancellation rights within contracts so consumers are more aware of their rights; and</p>
</ul><a name="70219w0056.htm_brev2"><a name="07022140001182"><ul><p class="tabletext">(c) encourage greater transparency on prices and greater willingness to provide written quotes, through industry self-regulation, with traders operating under Codes of Practices approved by the Office of Fair Trading's Consumer Codes Approval Scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="70219w0056.htm_para5"><a name="07022140000103">As the hon. Member will know, the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill is currently going through Parliament and the doorstep selling provisions will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations that provide cancellation rights for solicited sales visits to the consumer's home (and workplace). Later this year we intend to publicly consult on the draft regulations, which will extend cancellation rights to all sales concluded in a consumer's home and require cancellation rights be incorporated within contracts. We expect these measures to come into force in April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="70219w0056.htm_para6"><a name="07022140000104">I would also like to refer the hon. Member to the unfair commercial practices directive. This will be implemented this year. The new provisions will protect consumers against the physical or non-physical use of harassment, coercion or exploiting undue influence. This is also the first directive that recognizes that vulnerable consumers need a greater level of protection. Practices which would not be unfair to the average member of the shopping public can still be unfair if they are likely to adversely affect a group of vulnerable consumers in a way that a trader can reasonably foresee. For example, elderly consumers are much more likely to succumb to intimidating sales tactics than able-bodied consumers.</p>

Its findings were inconclusive. It did note that, as the new rating system is not a new tax but the redistribution of an existing tax, in the unlikely event that any measurable impact should emerge it could affect the market unevenly and in either direction, depending on location and sector. This work did not extend to examining the impact of Water Reform and no specific study has been carried out.</p>

This exceptional growth continues and it has included the period that the Valuation and Lands Agency were advising individual householders in NI of their new capital values, together with an indication of their new rate liability.
