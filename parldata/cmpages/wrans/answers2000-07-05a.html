<a name="00705w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for <i>(a)</i> Great Britain and <i>(b)</i> each local authority the percentage of waste recycled in (i) 1997 (ii) 1998 and (iii) 1999.  [127207]<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 June 2000]:</i> Recycling levels in Scotland are a matter for the Secretary of State for Scotland. For England and Wales the national household recycling rates for 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 were 7.5, 8.2 and 9.4 per cent. respectively. I have placed a list in the House of Commons Library setting out ranges of household recycling rates for local authorities in England and Wales. All figures are based on data from the annual DETR Municipal Waste Survey.

<a name="00705w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the outcome was of the Transport Council held in Luxembourg on 26 and 27 June; and if he will make a statement.  [128333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on 26 June. I represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para0">At the opening of the Council, the Netherlands made a statement expressing regret at the recent incident at Dover and stressed the need for EU action on traffic in human beings. I welcomed and endorsed the Dutch statement.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para1">The Council debated a draft directive on interoperability of the conventional rail network. The only outstanding issue was the UK and Spain's request that derogations to allow the retention of existing track or loading gauges would be automatic rather than requiring Commission approval. I am pleased to say that, following the debate, a revised text was agreed which allows the automatic derogation we had been seeking and enabled the Council to agree a common position.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para2">The Council debated proposals arising from the loss of the oil tanker "Erika" (the 'Erika 1' package). These are revised directives on ship inspection organisations and on port state control of shipping; and a new regulation on accelerating the introduction of double hulls in oil tankers. The Council reached political agreement on the first of these, which would give the Commission responsibility for recognising member states' appointed ship inspection organisations. The Commission gave a progress report on the port state control proposal. There was a debate on double-hulled tankers, during which I noted the need for a proper economic and regulatory impact assessment. I agreed with the Commission and a number of member 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 180W</I><P>
states that IMO action at global level would be preferable, but that otherwise EU legislation would be acceptable. These issues will be debated again at the October Council. The Council agreed conclusions, stating that further progress should be made towards the "Erika 2" package, foreseen at the Feira European Council. France stated that Erika 2 would be a priority of its Presidency.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para3">There was a further progress report from the Commission on the Galileo satellite navigation project. The Commission said it would submit a final report on the definition phase and an economic analysis in time for the December Council, at which a final decision would have to be made on whether to go ahead with the project. At the October Council, there would be an orientation debate on structure and funding. I joined other member states in stressing the need for full cost benefit analysis and for private sector funding to make the project viable. Conclusions were agreed, urging that the Council be provided with sufficient information early in the autumn to allow it to take a decision on Galileo's future.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para4">The Commission gave a further presentation of its Communication on air passenger rights, underlining the need for progress with legislation or voluntary action in various areas of passenger protection, including the setting of minimum contract requirements for ticket purchase. Further work will be done to prepare for a discussion at the October Council.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para5">The Commission gave its view of progress on work to create common EU structures for air traffic management (ATM). This might include the establishment of bodies to regulate European ATM. The Commission noted that separation of provision and regulation of ATM services was vital, to implement the conclusions of the European Councils at Lisbon and Feira.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para6">The Council agreed that the Commission proposals on cabin crew qualifications in civil aviation should be re-examined in the light of the recent proposal to transpose standards drawn up by the Joint Aviation Authorities into Community law.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para7">The Presidency presented a paper describing recent discussions on the establishment of a European aviation safety authority (EASA). The point at issue is whether the Commission should work up detailed proposals for an EU agency, rather than an international organisation. The Presidency presented a paper which analysed whether an EU agency could effectively promote air safety across Europe. I said that the UK was open to the idea of an EU agency, but that such an agency would have to have sufficient power to take safety decisions effectively, involve member states and national safety regulators fully in its work, and involve non-EU states as fully as possible. It should not initially cover safety of airports or air traffic management. The Council invited the Commission to make a formal proposal for an EU agency.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para8">The Council also discussed the Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA). The Commission is seeking a mandate allowing it to negotiate a TCAA agreement with the US on behalf of the EU. The UK has on previous occasions made clear that it gives priority to its bilateral negotiations with the US, which are continuing. Technical work on the likely shape of a Commission mandate has been taking place, and the UK has been participating in that. The Presidency concluded that the Council was 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 181W</I><P>
satisfied with the technical work, and asked for further work to be done by COREPER, to allow a decision on the mandate to be taken in December.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para9">The Commission reported on developments in the area of aviation noise standards. They noted the good progress in defining new standards within the ICAO CAEP process.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para10">The Council agreed a wide-ranging Resolution on road safety, following the Commission Communication presented to the March Council. Among areas identified for legislative action are: further development of the European new vehicles crash testing programme (EuroNCAP), use of speed limiters on larger vehicles, higher levels of seatbelt and child restraint usage, safer car fronts, and targeting of accident blackspots. The Resolution also refers to the Commission's intention to bring forward a recommendation for member states to introduce a maximum blood alcohol level of 0.5 milligrams per millilitre.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para11">Two road transport issues were debated: a proposed Regulation on transit quotas ("ecopoints") for lorries passing through Austria; and a proposal on the allocation of Swiss transit permits for heavy lorries. The former concerns a proposal to reduce the ecopoint quotas of five member states, a legal requirement under the terms of Austria's Act of Accession. The member states affected (which do not include the UK) expressed their opposition to this measure and the Presidency instructed COREPER to re-examine the proposal. The Commission noted that unless an alternative proposal emerges, and is agreed upon, the Commission regulation will automatically come into effect on 20 September. The Commission also introduced its amended proposal for the distribution of permits for heavy goods vehicles travelling in Switzerland. The permit allocations for individual member states were in the process of being revised in the light of recently completed analyses of trade and traffic statistics in the Alpine region. The Presidency asked for further work to be done by COREPER to prepare for decision at the October Council.
<P>

<a name="00705w01.html_para12">Under other business the Commission presented its new "Communication on safer and more competitive quality road transport in the Community", covering such issues as working and driving time for lorry drivers, conditions for employment of non-EU hauliers, and driver training. This will be a priority issue for debate during the French presidency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the national transport plan and local transport plans will give priority to slower speeds for vehicular traffic on roads where the risk of injury to other road users is significant.  [128547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Our guidance on local transport plans makes clear that authorities should ensure that safety is a key element in all aspects of their plan. Authorities are required to prepare a road safety strategy, which must contain local casualty reduction targets for 2005 and annual milestone targets. While the precise package of measures used to achieve these targets is a matter for 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 182W</I><P>
individual authorities, we would expect to see many making use of traffic management measures and lower speed limits.

<a name="00705w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>PSV Provisional Licences</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the average processing time is for PSV provisional driver licences; and if he will make a statement.  [128448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Since April the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has processed 95 per cent. of PSV provisional driving licences within five working days of receipt. Allowing three days for delivery of the licence by Royal Mail this means the overall turnaround is eight days from the date of receipt. This is an improvement on last year's turnaround, which was nine days overall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bennett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much money his Department has awarded to <i>(a)</i> Stockport MBC and <i>(b)</i> Tameside MBC to celebrate beacon status; and what guidance he has issued on how the money is to be spent.  [128879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 This year we are providing &#163;700,000 for beacon councils. Subject to approval by the House of the Special Grant Report (number 64) which was laid on 27 June, this amount will be distributed as specified in the report among the 33 successful applicants for beacon status, including Stockport and Tameside, as a contribution to the costs they incur as beacons in disseminating their good practice.
<P>

<a name="00705w02.html_para0">Guidance on the special grant was contained in the Beacon Council Application Brochure published in May 1999, and in the draft Special Grant Report circulated to each of the beacon councils earlier this year.

<a name="00705w02.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what percentage of planning decisions made in the last year resulted in brownfield development.  [128634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Information on the number of planning decisions resulting in development on brownfield sites is not available centrally. However, the latest estimates show that, in 1994, 48 per cent. of land changing to urban uses (as defined for DETR's Land Use Change Statistics) was previously developed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 19 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 6W, concerning the provisions of European Community treaties affecting the expenditure of London Underground, what communications he, or his predecessors, have received from the Commission of the European Communities, <i>(a)</i> based on Article 88 of the Treaty of European Union and <i>(b)</i> under any other title of that or any other Community or Union Treaty, relating to public 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 183W</I><P>
borrowing or revenue support, or the manner of its subsequent expenditure; and what arrangements are made for any such communications to be inspected.  [128850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have received no such communications concerning London Underground.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Pollard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action his Department is taking to improve the transport infrastructure in the St. Albans constituency.  [128893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In last December's Local Transport Plan Financial Settlement Hertfordshire County Council received a total block allocation of &#163;9,467,000. This consisted of &#163;5,000,000 for integrated transport, an increase of 19 per cent. from the previous year, and &#163;4,467,000 for maintenance and bridges, an increase of 83 per cent. from the previous year reflecting the poor condition of some of the County's roads.
<P>

<a name="00705w02.html_para1">It is of course for the County Council to decide how this funding should be used and which schemes to promote and we must leave these local projects to the responsible authorities to develop in conjunction with local partners and interests. The local transport plan process emphasises the need to work with the full range of transport providers, businesses, communities and interest groups.
<P>

<a name="00705w02.html_para2">Hertfordshire County Council will be submitting their full Local Transport Plan in July and I understand that they will be including an Area Plan for mid Bedfordshire. Within this is a programme of improvements for St. Albans which includes, among other elements, improving bus infrastructure, cycling and pedestrian facilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what standard penalty clauses are included in private finance initiative contracts for roads; and how many of these have been invoked.  [128589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Penalties in contracts are not enforceable at law. My Department's privately financed contracts for roads include provisions for ensuring proper performance. In all these contracts performance defaults may lead to the accumulation of points which, through a hierarchical structure, could lead to increased monitoring at contractor expense and ultimately, to contract termination. A number of such points have been awarded on seven of the eight privately financed trunk road contracts in England.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what his latest estimate is of the comparative rent levels of council tenants and housing association tenants.  [129122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The latest period for which both Local Authority and Registered Social Landlord rent figures in England are available is the financial year 1998-99. Average Local Authority rents for 1998-99 were &#163;42.33 per week and those for Registered Social Landlord rents in England were &#163;51.65 per week. Registered Social Landlords are former housing associations that are officially registered with the Housing Corporation.
<P>

<a name="00705w02.html_para5">The average rent figures for local authorities and RSLs are not directly comparable because they do not take into account differences in the composition of stock, e.g. size and type of dwellings, their age and condition.

 Advance copies of "Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control: A Practical Guide" have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The guidance describes the main provisions of the new Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime to be set up under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, a draft of which was laid before Parliament on 15 June. The guidance will set out how the Secretary of State expects to see the regulatory regime applied, and how certain terms are to be interpreted. It will complement the Environment Agency's package of technical guidance.

 <i>[holding answer 7 June 2000]:</i> The benefits of vaccination are the prevention of illness and death from infectious diseases. These benefits are assessed from clinical trials and epidemiological studies, prior to authorisation for clinical use. Following the introduction of a vaccine, there is ongoing monitoring of disease incidence rates and, where appropriate, outcomes.
<P>

<a name="00705w03.html_para0">The risks of immunisation to the individual are those of adverse reactions from the vaccine. These risks are evaluated both before and after authorisation using a range of data sources including clinical trials, spontaneous adverse reaction reports from health professionals, epidemiological studies and the published scientific literature.
<P>

<a name="00705w03.html_para1">The Department publishes full information on the benefits and serious adverse reactions to vaccination in the book 'Immunisation against infectious disease', copies of which are available in the Library. Vaccine-associated paralytic polio is the only serious reaction where evidence supports the suggestion of a causal association and there are demonstrated long-term consequences; this occurs in one out of approximately every million immunisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what powers he has to control the prices of <i>(a)</i> parallel-traded branded medicines, <i>(b)</i> branded medicines dispensed against generic prescriptions and <i>(c)</i> branded generic medicines.  [126666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The prices of branded medicines derived from parallel trade follow those not so derived. The price of a branded medicine is unaffected if it dispensed against a generic prescription.
<P>

<a name="00705w03.html_para3">The prices of branded medicines, whether generic or not, are controlled indirectly though the operation of the 1999 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), a 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 187W</I><P>
voluntary arrangement which aims to secure the provision of safe and effective medicines for the National Health Service at reasonable prices. Whether the prices are reasonable is determined by the level of profits which manufacturers make from sales to the NHS. The operation of the PPRS is described in detail in the "Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme: Third Report to Parliament December 1999", copies of which are available in Library.
<P>

<a name="00705w03.html_para4">Section 34 of the Health Act 1999 allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to limit the prices of branded medicines supplied to the NHS by companies which are not members of the 1999 PPRS. This power has not been exercised because all major manufacturers of branded medicines are members of the 1999 PPRS.

<P>
<a name="00705w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 In most cases dental services to prisoners are provided by visiting general dental practitioners working under NHS general dental services arrangements. Some individual prisons contract for dental services with another provider, usually the Community Dental Service, but sometimes with an individual dentist.
<P>

<a name="00705w04.html_para0">As part of the prison health care reforms now under way, all prisons and the health authorities in which they are situated are assessing prisoners' health needs and drawing up health improvement plans, which include dentistry. These assessments will help inform how dental services can best be delivered in the future.

 Many carers will not have access to the Internet and will therefore be more likely to use other sources of information (such as: telephone helplines, carers' centres, leaflets in general practitioners' surgeries etc.). However, on-line services are an increasingly important element of information and support to carers as "Caring About Carers", the report of the National Carers Strategy, makes clear.

<a name="00705w04.html_para1">The Department launched the Government's carers' website (www.carers.gov.uk) in February 2000 to allow the increasing numbers of carers who are on the Internet (or those supporting them such as carers' workers) easy access to a range of relevant Government information. There are links to National Health Service, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Social Security, Department for Education and Employment and Employment Service sites as well as those of carers' organisations. The Department of Health controls and updates the website to co-ordinate the links to make them easy for carers to use. The process of assessing the availability of on-line information is therefore an on-going one. The website has been very well received by carers and professionals.
<P>

<a name="00705w04.html_para2">The Department does not conduct detailed evaluations of all available on-line information services for carers. Starthere receives funding under s64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 and is being monitored and evaluated accordingly.

 Our guidance on the reorganisation of schools makes it clear that there should be a presumption against the closure of rural schools, and we are encouraging community use of school facilities. Our recent booklet "Raising Standards: Opening Doors" encourages imaginative approaches to community use of schools, and a manual is being developed to support schools in their work with the community. We recently introduced a new Standards Fund grant for small schools to help reduce the administrative burden on heads and teachers, and from September an additional Small School Support Fund will encourage small schools to consider and pilot new ways of working with others.

Research on the environmental impact of organic farming has concluded that organic regimes can benefit biodiversity at the farm-level although, the impact is farm-specific and dependent on the management of the farm both before and after conversion to the organic system.

 Baltic Sea fisheries are managed by the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC), of which the EU is a member.

General CFP conservation measures are also applicable in the Baltic Sea to the extent specified in individual regulations.
<P>

<a name="00705w07.html_para1">Coastal states in the Mediterranean Sea have not generally extended their exclusive fisheries limits beyond 12 miles, reflecting the narrowness of the continental shelf in the area. This has restricted the extent to which general CFP provisions have been applied. The EU has, however, implemented various conservation measures under the CFP covering Mediterranean fisheries, including tuna management measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) and a limited number of technical conservation measures.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> I keep the operational effectiveness of the sea fisheries committees under regular view. The introduction of a restrictive shellfish licensing scheme, which is now in preparation, should usefully add to existing action at EU, national and Sea Fishery Committee level on the management of shellfish stocks. A cap of 100 VCUs (vessel capacity units) has applied to the aggregation of under 10m fishing vessel licences since February 1996 and earlier this year arrangements were made to link the registration and licensing of all fishing vessels to the declaration of maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power. From 1 January 2001 it will no longer be possible to aggregate licences from vessels under 8m onto vessels between 8 and 10m and a cap of 70 VCUs will apply to the aggregation of fishing vessel licences onto vessels below 8m.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the operation of the legislative framework under which sea fisheries committees operate, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> consistency of approach to minimum landing sizes, <i>(b)</i> the evidence required to achieve a prosecution, <i>(c)</i> the management of charter fishing vessels and <i>(d)</i> the impact of high-powered under 10m vessels.  [128574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> Under the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1966, Sea Fisheries Committees (SFCs) have powers within their districts to control the size and power of vessels fishing and to set minimum landing sizes for fish and shellfish, provided these do not fall below those set by EU regulations. The Government are aware of SFC concerns about the inland extent of enforcement powers and is considering appropriate action. SFC bylaws apply as appropriate to the activities of under 10m fishing vessels and charter fishing boats. Responsibility for the registration of fishing and other vessels rests with the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen and vessels fishing for profit must hold a valid licence issued by one of the four Fisheries Departments in the UK.

<a name="00705w07.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what assessment he has made of the trade in fishing licences and quota in the last three years;  [128838]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to ensure that the trade in fishing entitlements <i>(a)</i> does not undermine the prospects of poor fishing regions, <i>(b)</i> does not worsen the prospects for new entrants to the industry, <i>(c)</i> is not sold to foreign or flag of convenience vessels and <i>(d)</i> does not result in a concentration of quota in the hands of fewer owners.  [128839]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> Trade in fishing vessel licences and the fishing opportunities associated with them have been initiated by fishermen themselves. The trade enables new entrants to join the industry and gives fishermen the opportunity to restructure their operations to meet their own business needs. All licensing transactions and exchanges of quota between groups with quota management responsibilities must be conducted in accordance with the rules on licensing and quota management drawn up by the Fisheries Departments in the UK.
<P>

<a name="00705w07.html_para4">These arrangements are the subject of regular consultation with the fishing industry and are currently under review by two working groups comprising representatives of industry and the Fisheries Departments. A report on possible modifications to the quota management rules, including arrangements for adjusting the fixed quota allocation units attached to fishing vessel licences to take account of transfers between fishermen, is expected shortly and a further report on licensing is expected towards the end of the year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the advantages and disadvantages of a renewable 10-year derogation for national fishing rights within 12 miles of the United Kingdom shore, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> the length of the derogation, <i>(b)</i> its operation by his Department, <i>(c)</i> its operation by the sea fisheries committees, <i>(d)</i> the exercising of historic rights of other EU member states, and <i>(e)</i> the ability to conserve stock for the future benefit of the fishing industry.  [128575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> As I have already made clear, the Government wish to maintain national 6/12 mile limits when the current EU derogation (under which they operate) expires at the end of 1992, together with current access arrangements based on historic rights under the Common Fisheries Policy. Restrictions on access to waters between six and 12 miles, together with the setting in the EU of Total Allowable Catches and quotas for commercial stocks and EU national, and local technical conservation rules assist, in conserving fish stocks for the future benefit of the fishing industry and of consumers. I shall shortly be discussing with the Association of Sea Fisheries Committees a paper they are preparing entitled "2002 and Beyond" which will, I understand, argue for change in the extent of Sea Fisheries Committee jurisdictions from their present limit of six miles.

<a name="00705w07.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what assessment he has made of the efficiency and probity of giving producer organisations in the fishing industry opportunities to manage the distribution of some quota allocations to their members;  [128840]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> amounts and <i>(b)</i> proportions of the United Kingdom's fishing quota are not directly allocated to licensed vessels for each year since 1995 and for the current year.  [128841]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w07.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> In the UK, annual quotas are allocated to groups of fishermen rather than individual vessel owners. The groups are producer organisations (POs), the non-sector (all vessels over 10 metres not in membership of a PO) and the under 10 metre fleet. The quota allocations for the non-sector and the under 10 metre fleet are managed directly by the Fisheries Departments in the UK in consultation with the fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="00705w07.html_para5">Producer organisations have played an active part in managing quota for more than 10 years. It is for each PO to decide how to manage its allocations in the interests of its members. Before a PO is recognised for the purposes of quota management it must satisfy the appropriate Fisheries Department that it has the necessary systems in place to manage its quota allocations, to monitor landings by its members and to penalise any members who exceed their quota allocations. PO's management of quota is subject to the overall supervision of Fisheries Departments who prohibit further landings of fish by a PO's members once its quota allocations have been taken in full.

 A decision was taken in October 1997 to replace MAFF's oldest fisheries research vessel, RV Cirolana, which is used to collect essential data on the state of fish stocks and the marine environment. A comprehensive business case explored all options, including the Private Finance Initiative and the consequences of not replacing the ship. Investment in a new vessel was agreed as a priority in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review, and the procurement process is under way.
<P>

<a name="00705w08.html_para0">In accordance with EU procurement rules, expressions of interest in the contract to construct the new vessel have been invited, and the responses will be evaluated in order to identify a short list of bidders who will be given the opportunity to tender for the contract. The planned schedule allows for negotiation and award of a construction contract by the end of December 2000. The vessel is expected to be ready for service in March 2003.

 In 1995 Jaguar received an offer of &#163;48 million Regional Selective Assistance (RSA), plus a &#163;32 million package of local support measures to attract the X200 (S-Type) project to Castle Bromwich. Following discussions with the European Commission, the RSA element of the &#163;80 million package was subsequently revised to &#163;40 million. However, the Commission subsequently agreed in principle that additional aid up to the original &#163;80 million total might be provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he has reached conclusions following his consultation on proposals to amend the Electricity (Class Exemptions from the Requirement for a Licence) Order 1997.  [129580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In order to reduce the regulatory burden on generators which are not subject to central despatch at present I am proposing to make changes to the de-minimis level above which a generation licence is required. Subject to final comments, I propose to lay an order to exempt for a period of one year all generators which are not capable of exporting more than 100 MW to the total system and which have energised connections on the date of the order coming into force. Additionally a small number of stations which exceed this limit but are not presently subject to central despatch will be included within this exempt class.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para0">The change will allow generators which are currently connected to the public network and do not presently have to submit to central despatch the freedom to aggregate their output with suppliers when the new electricity trading arrangements come into effect. This will be of particular help to those plants which do not have predictable or flexible output, including renewables and CHP operators.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para1">The Government propose to lay the order in August. It will come into force before the commencement of NETA trading in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para2">This order will be an interim arrangement pending the coming into force of new legislation and will apply in England and Wales. During this interim period, generators who wish to connect new plant capable of exporting between 50-100 MW or who plan to increase the size of their plant so that it comes within this category may apply to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for an individual exemption. In deciding whether or not to grant and in determining the date of the granting of such exemptions, the Department will take into account the views of interested parties--including those of Ofgem and the relevant transmission and distribution network operators.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para3">It is my intention within the coming year to lay a further, final order replacing this interim order. Further orders will cover the de-minimis rules to govern exemptions from the need for licences to generate, supply and distribute electricity.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para4">The generation exemptions covering plant of this size will be subject to periodic review. It is the Government's present intention that they will be reviewed approximately every three years.

<a name="00705w09.html_para5">I intend to consult further on possible changes to the rules governing supply exemptions. These changes, which I would propose to bring into effect within the coming year, would help small and industrial on-site generators, including renewable and CHP operators to serve their customers more effectively.
<P>

<a name="00705w09.html_para6">I am therefore seeking views on a proposal to allow suppliers who generate electricity themselves to supply an aggregate of up to 5 MW of power, of which 2.5 MW may be supplied to domestic customers. The class would be required to supply at prices not exceeding those set out in the order, and would be required to alert customers being recruited as to their status as exempt suppliers.
<P>

Accurate assessment of the numbers who would be affected is now being made as a result of a detailed survey. This work is being carried out by SEMOR, a firm that has experience of carrying out social assessment projects for the World bank. Dr. Ayse Kudat, an eminent environmental sociologist, who was until recently a senior staff member at the World bank, has been appointed by the Swiss Export Credit Agency to assist in this work; the expertise of Dr. Kudat will help ensure that the resettlement programme will reflect internationally accepted practice.

UK export statistics are produced by Customs on the basis of declared final country of destination. Goods whose destinations are declared as non-European but which transit other member states after clearing UK customs are recorded as third country exports. Some trade in goods recorded as exports to EC destinations may subsequently be shipped to other countries including non-EC destinations--for instance, as part of further commercial transactions.

The Government have taken time to consider the situation in Pakistan and the wider region following the coup in October 1999 before deciding on a number of licence applications.

 Iraq took four years to admit it had a biological weapons (BW) programme. Even after a further three and a half years work, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) could not compile a comprehensive technical, industrial and scientific assessment of Iraq's BW programme. This was because of Iraq's failure to provide a credible full, final and complete disclosure of its programme, as required by the United Nations, or to co-operate with UNSCOM in clarifying its declarations. There have been no UN weapons inspections in Iraq since December 1998, hence the importance we attach to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) gaining access at the earliest opportunity.

 Although the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was able to destroy, remove or render harmless large quantities of chemical weapons (CW), their components, precursors and major production equipment, there remain significant gaps in their understanding of Iraq's CW programme. Even accepting the figures for CW agents and precursors unilaterally destroyed by Iraq in contravention of United Nations Security Council resolution 687, there are discrepancies in Iraq's declarations on the number of weapons filled with chemical agents and the number used during the Iran/Iraq war or lost after the Gulf War. Questions remain on the production and weaponisation of VX, CW production equipment and CW precursors. There have been no UN weapons inspections in Iraq since December 1998, hence the importance we attach to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) gaining access at the earliest opportunity.

 Britain supported this project in the bank board meeting in June 1999 because it would bring significant benefits to 1.7 million of the poorest people in China. They represent four different ethnic minorities, they live in very remote and inaccessible villages and many of them are barely scratching a living. It will give poor people from a range of ethnic groups the opportunity to meet their basic needs. It will deliver a wide range of benefits such as increasing food production, providing safe water and improving access to basic social services. We also supported the Board conclusion that no funds would be disbursed on the Qinghai component of the project until an independent inspection panel had conducted an investigation, and pending further environmental and social assessments.

 Britain has a large and growing programme of development assistance to India: we expect to spend about &#163;125 million this year, rising to &#163;140 million in 2001-02. This reflects the fact that about a third of the world's poorest people live in India, and we see good opportunities to work with reforming states to tackle poverty more effectively. We are supporting programmes of fiscal and public sector reform, to help improve accountability and access by the poorest to basic education, health, water and sanitation, and to promote better management of the natural and physical environment. Our programme is currently focused on Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal, and we are collaborating closely with the World bank, the Asian Development bank, UNICEF and other major development agencies.

We are providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Economy and Trade, to strengthen its capacity to develop and apply economic policy, particularly with regard to trade with the EC and the region.

<a name="00705w13.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 So far, only six countries have qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. A further three are expected to do so later this month. But it is disappointing that so few have reached their decision points. Some countries who could benefit from HIPC debt relief are involved in war and civil strife, or have failed to demonstrate their commitment to tackling poverty. At the spring meetings of the World bank and the IMF in April, the Government's proposal to establish a joint World bank/IMF committee to oversee the implementation process was agreed. The committee has begun its work and should provide a focus for efforts to meet the target that three quarters of eligible countries start to receive debt relief before the end of 2000.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of her Department's aid to countries in sub-Saharan Africa to combat the spread of AIDS and HIV.  [127759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w13.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Along with conflict, the HIV/AIDS epidemic poses the greatest threat to development in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV/AIDS has affected people of every class and culture in Africa. However, it is the poor who have felt the worst of the impacts because they are more vulnerable to the economic and social difficulties the epidemic brings.
<P>

<a name="00705w13.html_para5">We are heavily engaged in work to combat HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, both in seeking to prevent new infections and in supporting improved care for people whose lives have been affected by the disease. We currently allocate about &#163;25 million per year to HIV/ AIDS prevention and care activities in sub-Saharan Africa and this is set to rise.
<P>

<a name="00705w13.html_para6">In the face of such a devastating epidemic, we cannot afford to be complacent and there is an urgent need to intensify action. In Uganda and Senegal we have seen how sustained political commitment by African Governments and a co-ordinated response in partnership with the international community has controlled and even reduced infection rates. This must be replicated elsewhere in Africa.

 We are making good progress in helping developing countries achieve the international development target of universal primary education (UPE) by 2015. But much remains to be done; it is unacceptable 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 226W</I><P>
that in the year 2000 more than 113 million children, a large majority of whom are girls and those from socially vulnerable groups, have no access to primary education.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para0">The bulk of spending on education by most developing countries remains directed to higher education. The reason is that elites are powerful in very poor countries. It is difficult political task to get a commitment to spending on the poorest children in rural areas. We are working hard on this task through the international system, and by contributing more funds. We have committed &#163;300 million over the past three years to UPE programmes and will do more. We are working to persuade governments and their civil societies to prioritise the education of poor children. Progress is being made and we need sustained interest through to 2015.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para1">Our strategy for achieving the UPE target is set out in the Department for International Development's consultation document "Education for All: The Challenge of Universal Primary Education". Copies are available in the House of Commons Library.

 When the Prime Minister met the Japanese Prime Minister last month, they agreed the importance of discussing debt issues at the G8 Summit in Okinawa.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para4">It was at the Cologne Summit last year that the G7 agreed a very substantial improvement to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which was agreed by the boards of the World bank and IMF at the annual meetings in September 1999. The enhanced HIPC initiative provides faster, wider and deeper debt relief to poor countries committed to eradicating poverty.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para5">The emphasis now is on implementing the enhanced initiative, so that the target of three-quarters of eligible countries starting to receive debt relief before the end of the year can be achieved. At the spring meetings of the World bank and IMF in April, we persuaded the bank and the Fund to establish a joint committee to oversee the implementation process. The Government are committed to keeping up the momentum not only in the run up to the G8 Summit but also beyond it.

<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para6">The decision whether to charge for costs of policing at local events is for the local police authority and the Chief Constable.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police forces have achieved the requirement of year-on-year efficiency savings of 2 per cent.; what monitoring is undertaken of how forces are achieving the efficiency savings and what guidance is issued by his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [128536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There are two elements to the achievement of the 2 per cent. efficiency targets set for the police each year between 1999-2002. The first is to plan and deliver savings, either cashable, non-cashable or both; the second and most important element is to deliver 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 2000 : Column: 229W</I><P>
levels of performance to a required standard. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported in May 2000 that all 43 forces were on track to deliver the required efficiency gains subject to performance levels being assessed as satisfactory. I expect HMIC to report on police performance levels later this month.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para13">The efficiency process is subject to rigorous inspection by HMIC with support from the Audit Commission and external auditors. This ensures that only permissible savings are counted. The police authority and force must also ensure that a link between resources and performance outcomes is established.
<P>

<a name="00705w14.html_para14">The Home Office issued guidance on efficiency planning to police forces and authorities in November 1998, when the process was launched, and again in December 2000 to support planning for the second year of efficiency gains.

<a name="00705w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As of 30 June the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) had placed 3,028 destitute asylum seekers into accommodation. The process of accommodating destitute asylum seekers is of course demand led. The exact number of units available changes day by day as providers notify the service of properties. We are continuing to negotiate with both the public and private sector for further accommodation, but it was always the intention that accommodation providers would be asked to provide accommodation on a basis of need.

The responses to that public consultation exercise are still under consideration, and we hope to be in a position to announce our intentions shortly after the summer recess.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he expects to produce an anti-suicide strategy relating to women in prison; and if he will make a statement.  [128740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00705w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service's current suicide awareness strategy came into effect from April 1994. Its main principles apply equally across all types of prisons and prisoners whether male/female, adult/young offender or remand/sentenced. This approach to caring for the suicidal is based upon sound research and draws upon best practice from within other organisations.
<P>

<a name="00705w16.html_para1">Strategies for reducing the risk of suicide are kept under continual review. The publication of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons thematic review: "Suicide is Everyone's Concern" last year provided a key impetus for this work. Work is in progress to examine how existing strategies can be better tailored to the needs of women prisoners. Guidance and good practice will be incorporated in a Prison Service order due for issue later this year.

 The Prison Service is currently testing prototype improved window ventilators at Holloway prison. These will be evaluated to assess all potential benefits, including the effectiveness of their anti-ligature properties. Following the assessment, funding will be sought through the Prison Service's normal capital appraisal process for installation of the most appropriate ventilators. Assuming these funds (likely to be of the order of &#163;8 million) are forthcoming, a rolling installation programme for all cells at Holloway will be developed. Completion of such a programme could take three to four years.

 It is the intention of the Football Association, with the strong support of the Government, to seek life bans from their home grounds for any individual convicted of offences involving hooliganism at Euro 2000; this cannot, however, apply to the majority of those detained and deported, since it has been acknowledged by the Belgian authorities that many of those detained or deported were not guilty of any criminal offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the out-of-court settlements agreed to by police forces in the UK since 1 January 1998, broken down by police force, indicating in each case the recipient, the amount agreed and the reason for the settlement; what process exists for police forces to make a decision to settle out-of-court; how the public are informed of such decisions; and if he will make a statement.

liability". The available information has been placed in the Library for each force in England and Wales by type of action. 1998-99 was only the second year in which forces were requested to supply this information and the information provided is not complete.
<P>

<a name="00705w17.html_para0">The process by which a force agrees to settle a case out of court is one for the force and its insurers (where it has employer and public liability cover). This will be based on an assessment of the cost and likelihood of successfully defending an action. Forces are accountable to their police authority for their handling of these cases. The Government's response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's report in 1998 on the Confidentiality of Police Settlements of Civil Claims supported the view that forces should publish information about civil actions in their annual reports.
