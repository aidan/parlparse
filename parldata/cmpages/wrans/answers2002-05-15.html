 Sport England published the study on Wembley stadium athletics prepared by Sports Concepts and Citex on 8 May. I placed a copy in the Library of the House on the same day. The full council of Sport England considered the conclusions of the report at its meeting on 7 May. The report concludes that the athletics platform will take a total of 11 weeks to build and install and a further six weeks to remove at a total cost of &#163;12.2 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for what reasons the proposed contents board was not included in the original Bill to set up the Office of Communications; what the composition of the contents board will be; and what the remit of the contents board will be in relation to radio.  [56031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government published a draft of the Communications Bill on 7 May for consultation. This draft Bill includes a proposal to require Ofcom to establish a 'Content Board' which will have the principal function of ensuring that the public interest in the nature and quality of television and radio programmes is sufficiently represented within Ofcom's overall structure.
<P>

<a name="20515w01.html_para0">The OFCOM Act 2002, which established Ofcom earlier this year, dealt with the basic framework of Ofcom at the main board level and was intended to allow the process of establishing Ofcom as a body to get under way while the substantive Communications Bill, which will give it regulatory responsibilities, is debated. The structure and remit of the content board are best seen in 



<P>
<P><I>15 May 2002 : Column 634W</I><P>
conjunction with Ofcom's functions, in particular the detailed broadcasting functions which are set out in the draft Communications Bill and particularly in relation to broadcast content including radio.
<P>

<a name="20515w01.html_para1">The structure of the content board is set out clearly in the draft Bill. It will consist of a chairman, who will be a non-executive member of Ofcom (but not the chairman of Ofcom), and as many other members appointed by Ofcom as Ofcom shall think fit. Ofcom is specifically required to ensure that there is a different member of the content board capable of representing the interests and opinions of persons living in each of the nations of the United Kingdom.

<a name="20515w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government's role is to set the legislative framework within which audio description and other services for people with sensory impairments can be provided and proposals were included in the recently published draft Communications Bill (Cm 5508&#150;1). We are aware of the current difficulties with the production and distribution of the module necessary to receive audio description services on digital terrestrial television. On 30 April I chaired a constructive meeting with the interested parties which identified a number of ways to help them resolve these issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment her Department has made of the losses suffered in each of the past five years by the British film, music, retail and rental industries as a result of internet piracy and the production and distribution of illegal copies of film and music; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="20515w01.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20515w01.html_para2">Accurate figures for losses due to internet piracy are difficult to gather and distinguish from other misuse of copyright material on the internet. However, a survey carried out by the industry body, the Alliance Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, which broadly represents British interests, estimated losses of &#163;180 million to cinema and home entertainment and &#163;20 million to the music industry in 2000 as a result of piracy generally. We are not aware of any music piracy figures yet for 2001, but industry figures show a 5 per cent. increase in legitimate recorded music sales in the UK in that year. The industry estimates for the years 1997 to 1999 are as follows:

 The temporary buildings on Speaker's green were erected originally for use by the project teams responsible for the new Westminster station and Portcullis house and by the Refreshment Department while their accommodation was being refurbished. Subsequently they have been used by contractors engaged on major projects in the Palace during the summer recesses. They will be used in this way again this summer, after which they will be demolished and the green restored to its former condition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Gulf War veterans <i>(a)</i> are suffering and <i>(b)</i> have suffered from renal cancers.  [50538]

<a name="20515w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Comprehensive data provided by the Office for National Statistics' NHS central register (NHSCR) on cancer registrations in England and Wales are only currently available up to 31 December 1998 and currently up to 31 December 2001 for registrations in Scotland. These data show that up to 31 December 1998 for England and Wales and up to 31 December 2001 for Scotland that seven Gulf veterans have been diagnosed as suffering from renal cancer or malignant neoplasm of the kidney as classified by International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9th Revision code 189.0 and ICD 10th Revision code C64. The Ministry of Defence's Gulf veterans' medical assessment programme had seen a further two veterans with renal cancer as at 13 May 2002. One veteran has, sadly, died. The current health status of the remaining eight veterans is not known to the MOD. The MOD is conducting an analysis of the incidence of all cancers in Gulf veterans with the aim of making the findings available later this year.

<a name="20515w01.html_wqn11"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Gulf War veterans <i>(a)</i> are suffering and <i>(b)</i> have suffered from scarring to the (i) kidneys and (ii) liver.  [50539]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The total number of Gulf veterans who have kidney and or liver scarring could only be established if all Gulf veterans were to undergo medical examination. It is the practice of the Ministry of Defence to examine only those veterans who wish to be examined and are referred by their GP or service medical officer to the Ministry of Defence's Gulf veterans' medical assessment programme (GVMAP). All patients seen at the GVMAP receive abdominal ultrasound examination which can detect kidney and liver scarring. In the absence of other indicators of kidney or liver damage, such scarring is of no clinical significance. Neither is described either in standard medical textbooks or classified by the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revisions. Kidney and liver scarring is therefore an incidental finding, does not cause any suffering and in itself is of no clinical significance in respect of suggestion of a link between ill health and the Gulf conflict. For these reasons, no centralised records are kept of such scarring. However, in a randomly selected anonymised sample of 1,000 patients examined at the GVMAP, one patient had a kidney scar and none had liver scarring. The GVMAP physicians do record kidney and livery damage where the damage is of clinical significance.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2002]:</i> Training in leadership skills is an extremely important part of development activities in the Ministry of Defence, for both military and civilian staff. Its importance&#151;emphasised within the "Modernising Government" initiative&#151;was reflected in the recent defence training review. As a result the defence leadership centre has been established as part of the new defence academy to provide a nationally recognised centre of excellence. In addition, there are many other areas of the MOD where leadership features in both general management and more specific training. The Defence Procurement Agency, for instance, has provided leadership masterclasses and the important new area of smart acquisition has introduced a specific scheme designed to help develop integrated project team leaders.
<P>

<a name="20515w02.html_para1">I am not aware of any training undertaken by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts on behalf of Ministers or officials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence fully supports the Government's commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy technologies by utilising "through life value for money" renewable energy supply opportunities. The current MOD policy on the development and siting of different kinds of renewable energy generation plant is to assess options on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="20515w02.html_para5">No central register is kept of the locations of solar panels installed in or on buildings on the defence estate. However, recently publicised examples include two active solar thermal systems at RM Norton Manor camp, Taunton, and a new "ambient energy" heat pump system at the Works Services office and stores at Royal Marines Condor, Tayside, Scotland. In addition, the Defence Procurement Agency building at Abbey Wood, Bristol, which has been in service for a number of years, makes use of a passive solar thermal system in order to minimise energy consumption.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2002]:</i> The overall cost of the seven-year lease and all supporting arrangements for the four C-17 aircraft is in the order of &#163;750 million. The detailed lease costs and the underlying aircraft price are commercially sensitive and I am withholding this information under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government information.
<P>

<a name="20515w02.html_para7">The lease contract does not specify either a target number or a limit on flying hours. However, funding for support of the aircraft was modelled on a total of 3,000 flying hours per full year for the fleet of four aircraft. In the first part year of operations the C-17 fleet exceeded the modelled hours by about 60 per cent. The additional support costs arising from this level of flying were in the order of &#163;4 million. There are no additional lease costs associated with increased levels of flying activity. Future support costs will vary in line with the operational demands made of the aircraft over the lease period.

 Work undertaken over the last few years has established that the effects a weapons explosion would have on a submarine and its surroundings is not as extensive as previously thought. This led to a revised safety assessment which has shown that the improvements to safety that RAFT would have provided for submarines can be met through the existing berthing facilities at Devonport naval base. The project has therefore been suspended.
<P>

<a name="20515w03.html_para0">Some &#163;15 million has been spent over the 10-year life of the project. Further costs relating to the cancellation of planned work may be payable and will be subject to negotiations with the contractor.

<P>
<a name="20515w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No landing fees are charged for RAF aircraft landing at RAF airfields. In the financial year 2001&#150;02, &#163;2.08 million was authorised for payment for handling and landing in respect of RAF aircraft landing at commercial airports in the United Kingdom and &#163;2.23 million for those services outside the United Kingdom.

 Royal Ordnance Defence (ROD) is a private company that is wholly owned by BAE Systems. It has been operating against a background of sharp decline in the worldwide demand for defence equipment. The Ministry of Defence is aware that ROD is currently carrying out a manufacturing strategy review to optimise its business such that it will remain viable and competitive in the defence sector. Any decisions that emerge from this review are a commercial matter for the company. ROD has also indicated that it intends to invest substantially in a number of sites across the United Kingdom. The MOD remains confident that ROD will continue to be a major producer of munitions for the United Kingdom armed forces, particularly through the framework partnering agreement that has been established between ROD and the MOD.

 The tethering or 'picketing' of horses is the military method of tying horses to a rope or peg in the open in order to prevent injury. The recommended method is to use a single long rope, stretched along the ground, or preferably suspended 3 to 4 ft high, to which each horse is separately tied with a head rope. Heel ropes tied to pegs may also be used in order to prevent a horse kicking the next horse. Details of the preferred methods to be used are laid out in the "Manual of Horsemanship, Equitation and Animal Transport" (WO Code 7193, 1937) and "Animal Management" (HMSO 1956).

 As announced on 8 May in a QinetiQ press release about Sir John Egan's decision to step down, Dame Pauline Neville-Jones has been appointed as the chairman of QinetiQ, having previously been the senior non-Executive Director. Dame Pauline has worked extensively in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and

has been chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. She is currently a BBC governor, with special responsibility for the World Service, and chairman of the Information Assurance Advisory Council. She also is a member of the Council of City University and hon. treasurer of the charity Refuge. The change of chairman will not affect the transaction timetable, which remains on track.

<a name="20515w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Yes. As with all competitive bidding processes, the Ministry of Defence seeks to take into account all relevant factors, including commercial, industrial and strategic, when assessing competitive bids to ensure that the MOD meets its objectives and obtains the best value for money.

<a name="20515w04.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As at 1 May, 354 members of the Army, 93 of the Royal Navy and 223 of the Royal Air Force had notified pregnancy or were on maternity leave. The rules governing maternity arrangements for servicewomen in the regular Armed Forces are contained within Defence Council Instructions and other service publications. Upon notification of pregnancy, restrictions may be placed upon a servicewoman's employment to ensure that the services can fulfil their legal obligations and responsibilities for her health and safety and that of her unborn child and to preserve operational effectiveness. For example, aircrew will not be permitted to continue their flying duties once pregnancy is confirmed, servicewomen on operations will be withdrawn, and women serving in ships will be landed at the earliest convenient opportunity.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have not carried out any separate cost assessment of their own. They have before them the cost assessment carried out by the Environment Agency, as set out in the agency's proposed decision published in September 2001. The agency's document sets out in some detail considerations of costs for the various technetium-99 abatement techniques that have been considered, and for a range of schemes to partially or fully replace the B211 facility where medium active concentrate (MAC), containing technetium-99, is stored. Costs are given both as undiscounted costs and present value costs, and they are further broken down into capital, operating and decommissioning costs. Where appropriate, the costs of combining abatement techniques with each other and with new storage facilities are also considered.
<P>

<a name="20515w05.html_para0">The undiscounted cost of introducing so-called "TPP abatement" would be in the order of &#163;3 million, whereas "MAC Diversion" costs would be in the range &#163;14&#150;90 million. The so-called "end of pipe" abatement techniques that have been identified by BNFL are estimated to cost in the range of &#163;76&#150;256 million. Replacement of the B211 storage facility to include replacement of the current MAC storage capacity would cost in the order of &#163;450 million. BNFL are also assessing options for refurbishing the B211 facility, which would be notably cheaper.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him by my right hon. Friend the President of the Council on 2 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 949W.
<P>

<a name="20515w06.html_para0">4,372 (97 per cent.) of the 4,500 written questions tabled up to 30 April this Session, have received a substantive reply. 40 questions (1 per cent.) tabled in April have not been answered, and are not overdue. However, the remaining 88 questions (2 per cent.) have yet to receive a substantive reply, and we are actively seeking to provide Members with replies to these shortly.

<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Further to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's reply of 30 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 662W, I have replied to Tom Flood, chief executive of the BTCV, expressing my concern about the difficulty in obtaining public liability insurance for BTCV's associated local community groups. I have also discussed the issue with the chief executive of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, who has offered to discuss with BTCV what might be done.
<P>

<a name="20515w06.html_para1">I understand that there is a general issue about the availability and cost of public liability insurance cover for voluntary organisations which goes beyond DEFRA's remit. However I have told BTCV and NCVO that I would be very willing to work with colleagues in so far as there are issues for DEFRA. To assist with this process I have raised the issue with ministerial colleagues. I have also suggested that a meeting with representatives of the insurance industry might be helpful.

<a name="20515w06.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures have been introduced since 1997 to reduce the amount of poisonous fumes people breathe in, with specific reference to those in urban areas.  [55403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's policies on improving air quality are set out in detail in "Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and 



<P>
<P><I>15 May 2002 : Column 652W</I><P>
Northern Ireland", published in January 2000. The strategy explains the measures that are in place to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from all sectors, including road transport and industry. Copies are available via the DEFRA website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ airquality.
<P>

<a name="20515w06.html_para2">Air quality in urban areas has improved significantly over the last decade, as a result largely of the progressively tighter European Union standards for new vehicles and fuels, and of the continuing reduction in total emissions from industry. The air quality headline indicator, published annually, shows that the average number of days of moderate or poor air quality in urban areas of the UK has reduced from 59 days in 1993 to 21 days in 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of how the production of an integrated assessment of the state of the seas, as proposed in the Government's first marine stewardship report, will contribute to the conservation of the marine environment.  [56045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 An integrated assessment of the state of our seas will enable us to gain a better overview of the competing pressures on the marine environment and the full range of impacts. This will help us target our actions to achieve improved conservation and sustainable development. The assessment will also provide a yardstick against which we can measure our progress. The report will be available in 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps have been taken in the Government's marine stewardship reports to balance social, economic and environmental interests in the marine environment; and if she will make a statement.  [55185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The first marine stewardship report reflects the principles of sustainable development, integrated management, the conservation of biological diversity, robust science, the precautionary principle and stakeholder involvement. We have adopted an ecosystem- based approach to integrate better marine protection objectives with sustainable social and economic goals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government conduct an annual pesticide residues surveillance programme for fruit and vegetables and other produce.

<a name="20515w06.html_para3">Typically around 4,000 food samples are tested each year for a range of pesticide residues at a cost of &#163;2.2 million. The objectives of the programme are threefold:

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of farms taking part in the countryside stewardship scheme staff from the <i>(a)</i> Rural Payments Agency and <i>(b)</i> Rural Development Service visit after the first year of taking part in the scheme; and how regularly individual farms have been visited by the agency.  [55295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Staff from the Rural Payments Agency carry out compliance monitoring inspections of countryside stewardship scheme agreements in accordance with EU and our own audit requirements. EU rules require at least 5 per cent. of agreements to be inspected each year. The agreements to be visited are selected using risk-based criteria, which are not specifically related to the year of the agreement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on Forest Enterprise procurement procedures for forestry harvesting and transport equipment.  [55819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise procurement procedures for forestry harvesting and transport equipment follow HM Treasury guidelines and EU regulations and directives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the value is of contracts awarded by Forest Enterprise to Mechanical Engineering Services in each of the last three years.  [55814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Mechanical Engineering Services is part of the Forestry Commission's Forest Enterprise Agency. It is responsible for supplying and maintaining the agency's fleet of machinery and vehicles. There is, therefore, no requirement for a contractual relationship. However, the value of this service to Forest Enterprise for the last three years has been &#163;15.7 million (2001&#150;02), &#163;15.6 million (2000&#150;01) and &#163;15.7 million (1999&#150;2000).
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what procedures are in place for ensuring fair competition for contracts issued by Forest Enterprise.  [55820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise follows HM Treasury guidelines and EU regulations and directives when letting contracts.

<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what procedures are in place in Forest Enterprise for ensuring best value in <i>(a)</i> procuring and <i>(b)</i> disposing of forestry capital equipment contracts.  [55815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise follows HM Treasury guidelines which are designed to ensure best value for use of public funds. The procurement of forestry capital equipment is subject to European Union procurement directives, and Forest Enterprise requirements are therefore advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i>. Disposal of forestry capital equipment is carried out by open tender and public auction.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many vehicles operated by Forest Enterprise are <i>(a)</i> cars and vans and <i>(b)</i> other forestry vehicles; and how many are obliged to have a valid current tax disc.  [55813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise currently operates 1,718 cars and vans and 320 other forestry vehicles. Most of these vehicles (1,852) are used exclusively in the service of the Crown and hence are exempt from vehicle excise duty under section 183 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The remainder (186 cars) are subject to vehicle excise duty due to an element of private use for which each user makes a payment.

<a name="20515w07.html_para3">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) and parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland implement these targets in the UK. The regulations place recovery and recycling obligations on producers to enable the UK to attain the directive recovery and recycling targets. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment Agency have reported that one compliance scheme and a number of individually registered businesses failed to meet their tonnage recovery obligations under the packaging regulations&#151;a total shortfall of 263,832 tonnes against a combined total obligation of 823,003 tonnes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will calculate the number of ewes with lambs at foot slaughtered under <i>(a)</i> disease control restrictions and <i>(b)</i> the livestock welfare disposal scheme during the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  [35537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not possible to calculate the number of ewes with lambs at foot slaughtered either for disease control purposes or under the livestock welfare disposal scheme because lambs at foot have not been recorded separately. For the purposes of disease control it is only necessary to record animals by species ie cattle, sheep, pigs goats, deer and other. Lambs at foot have therefore simply been included in the sheep category.
<P>

<a name="20515w07.html_para4">We are aware that to date not all the lambs at foot, slaughtered for disease control purposes, have been included in the figures on DEFRA's disease control system database (DCS). In the early stages of the outbreak, in line with normal husbandry practice, a number of ewes with lambs at foot were recorded as one unit (ie one animal). It was quickly recognised that each animal should be separately recorded and, as staff resources became available, an exercise to amend the DCS began.
<P>

<a name="20515w07.html_para5">This exercise is now well under way and many of the lambs at foot are already reflected in the total slaughter figure of around 4 million for disease control purposes. Information describing this exercise has been on the DEFRA website for some time, where it is also noted that the data on the DCS are being validated and may result in figures being revised.
<P>

<a name="20515w07.html_para6">Slaughtering under the livestock welfare disposal scheme took place at abattoirs and it was consequently more likely that lambs at foot were recorded in the slaughter figures. These figures are therefore very unlikely to change.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> The average number of staff days lost per staff year through sickness absence in the DTI Group in 2000 (the most recent figure available) was 7.5. The figure is taken from the annual report on public sector sick absence commissioned by the Cabinet Office each year. The DTI Group, in addition to DTI HQ, consists of: ACAS, Companies House, Patent Office, Insolvency Service, National Weights and Measures Laboratory, Employment Tribunals Service, and the Radiocommunications Agency.

 Following consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved a licence to export laboratory equipment to UNESCO for use by higher education institutions in northern Iraq.

Potassium cyanide is also subject to the Dual-Use Items (Export Control) Regulations 2000 as amended. The conclusion that this export does not represent a proliferation threat has been reached after careful assessment.

 The transport trans-European network (TEN) Financial Assistance Committee is established under the provisions of Article 17 of the TEN financing regulation (Regulation (EC) 2236&#150;95). The Committee is composed of representatives of member states and is chaired by the European Commission. The remit of the Committee is to consider&#151;and, where appropriate, to vote upon&#151;budgetary measures proposed by the Commission. The Committee has met twice in the last 12 months. The UK is represented by officials from my Department and the annual cost of its work to public funds is about &#163;2,000. The Committee will next consider a proposal from the Commission for the allocation of the 2002 transport TEN budget.

 This Committee was established under the provisions of article 6 of the 1970 regulation on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway (Regulation (EEC) No. 1107&#150;70). The remit of the Committee is to assist the Commission in its examination of aids granted for transport by rail, road and inland waterway. When it met, the Committee was composed of representatives of member states and was chaired by the European Commission. But, as far as we are aware, the Committee has not met for several years. Were it to meet, the UK would be represented by officials from my Department. There have been no costs to public funds in recent years. No items are currently under consideration by the Committee.

 The Committee on the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of legislation concerning the transport of dangerous goods is established under the provisions of article 9 of Council directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (the so-called ADR framework directive), as amended. It also deals with the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of the technical annexes to Council directive 96/49/EC on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail (the so-called RID framework directive), as amended; Council directive 95/50/EC on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road, as amended; Council directives 96/35/EC and 2000/18/EC on the appointment and vocational qualification and minimum examination requirements of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterways; and Council directive 99/36/EC on transportable pressure equipment, as amended.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information is based on data held by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR). It relates to final salary schemes only. There is a large minority of schemes on the Register where the scheme type is unknown, there are also some schemes offering a mixture of salary related and money purchase benefits. None of these schemes are included in the table.<P>

2. Closed schemes do not admit new active members, but allow existing members to continue to accrue benefits. Frozen schemes do not allow any future accruals. Schemes starting to wind up are also frozen. Schemes that have completed wind up have no members&#151;all assets are realised and all liabilities are discharged.<P>

3. The information relates to schemes, not employers. Some employers operate several schemes. Closure of a scheme may be due to a bulk transfer of members to another scheme.<P>

4. The PSR system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status and the effective date of the change. Because of the way the data is held a later change will overwrite an earlier change, so data for earlier years become increasingly inaccurate. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there is likely to be a lag before the data reflects what is happening currently.<P>

A copy of this latter research report has been placed in the Library. The general conclusions to emerge from this work are that the presence of screens tends to make communication between staff and customers seem more unfriendly and uncaring, which is, in turn, more likely to predispose agitated or anxious people towards aggression.

The remaining 62 per cent. will be generated by corporate and NGO membership fees and a small amount of trading income from services provided to non-members, such as for training. The corporate membership fee total over the period is expected to be &#163;1.92 million, or 56 per cent. of total income. However, ETl's "learning by doing" approach is very demanding on members' time and other resources and this contribution has been conservatively valued as a further &#163;1.8 million over three years.

 So far, 26 out of a total of 42 countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and by the autumn, Cote d'lvoire could be added to the list of countries benefiting from the Initiative. Relief of more than US$60 billion will be provided to these countries, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. Of the 26 countries, 21 have reached decision point and are receiving interim debt relief on their 'flow' of payment, and five have completed the HIPC process, and have received an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. We hope that a further three will reach their completion point this year. The prospects for the remaining eleven unsustainable countries are not good. Six&#151;Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan&#151;are still affected by conflict; Togo has governance problems; Central African Republic, DR Congo and Comoros might go through next year and Lao PDR is undecided as to whether to opt for HIPC relief. Angola, Kenya, Vietnam and Yemen are regarded as sustainable cases, eligible for relief from the Paris Club.

<P>
<a name="20515w14.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Good progress is being made with the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Interim Afghan Authority has prepared a national development framework and draft budget. Major investment and advisory projects are being designed in key sectors. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund has been established. Preparations are well advanced for the Emergency Loya Jirga next month that will appoint a Transitional Authority for the coming two years. Meanwhile, humanitarian assistance continues to be provided. Recovery activities are gathering pace, although it will take some time for the benefits to be felt by ordinary Afghans. Refugees are returning to Afghanistan in increasing numbers. But the security and political situation is still fragile. Much remains to be done: reconstruction will require a long-term effort.
<P>

<a name="20515w14.html_para4">At the Tokyo conference in January, donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid over the next two and a half years. The agreed objective was to support the establishment of a secure and stable sovereign state based on the rule of law, able to absorb returning refugees, no longer a haven for international terrorists and drug traffickers, and in stable relationships with its neighbours based on mutual respect and non-interference. The continuing necessity of humanitarian relief was recognised.
<P>

<a name="20515w14.html_para5">The conference also emphasised the need for close coordination between international donors and the Afghan Interim Administration. Donors have participated in 



<P>

<P>

<a name="20515w14.html_para6">The UK is playing its part, in the political, military and development arenas. Our leadership of the International Security Assistance Force has helped to bring stability to Kabul, establishing the authority of the Interim Administration. We have provided support for poppy crop eradication. We have disbursed around &#163;60 million since 11 September through direct contributions to multilateral agencies and quick impact projects. We have plans in hand for further expenditure of about &#163;40 million this financial year. It is clear that this year, and perhaps next, the majority of this assistance will need to continue to fund humanitarian and recovery programmes. As now, this will include direct contributions to UN agencies and NGOs, quick impact projects to kick-start the recovery process and to underpin the Interim Administration until the Emergency Loyal Jirga, practical support to the political process, and help to establish the Afghan Authority for Assistance.
<P>

<a name="20515w14.html_para7">For the longer term reconstruction effort, we believe it will be important to avoid overburdening the Transitional Authority with many bilateral programmes, each funded by different donors with their own procedures and reporting mechanisms. For that reason we will channel much of our assistance through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. We intend to commit at least half of our Tokyo pledge&#151;&#163;100 million&#151;to the fund. We have already paid in our first contribution&#151;the first donor to do so. We are encouraging other donors also to maximise their contributions to the fund, which we believe should be the main source of funding both for the reconstruction programme and for any quick impact recovery work.

 The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains serious.

 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimate that approximately 820,000 people have returned to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan in the last six months: 145,000 from Iran and 675,000 from Pakistan. Approximately 535,000 (65 per cent.) of those have returned with assistance from UNHCR as part of their assisted voluntary return programme. As well as transportation, returnees taking part in UNHCR's programme receive plastic sheeting, a repair kit, blankets, kitchen equipment and other relief items.

 According to WHO, Malawi's recent cholera epidemic was one of the worst that the country has experienced with 981 deaths resulting from 33,510 cases. The epidemic started last October and reached a peak in March 2002, since when case numbers have returned to pre-epidemic levels. The average cholera case fatality rate was particularly high this year because the outbreak coincided with food shortage. In these circumstances, reduced attention to hygienic practices in food preparation and consumption led to increased infection rates; these contributed to higher death rates. A national shortage of intravenous fluids contributed to the difficulties in treating the abnormally high case load. The Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) only presented a situation report and appealed for assistance in mid-March, by which time it was too late to co-ordinate an external response and the epidemic was already waning. The MOHP and development partners in the health sector are planning support for improved disease surveillance and response to avoid the same situation arising next year.

 We are currently examining a range of options for discussions about the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative at the Annual Meeting of the World bank and IMF this autumn.

<P>
<a name="20515w15.html_spnew11"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government has been working to try to ensure that countries exit the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative process with sustainable debt levels. At the Annual Meetings of the World bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked the World bank staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HlPCs. The IMF and World bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens as a result. Following UK pressure, the World bank and IMF boards have agreed to provide additional relief to countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the Spring Meetings last month, and Burkina Faso became the first HIPC country to benefit from 'topping up' at Completion Point. We are also pressing the Bank and Fund to take more concrete action to encourage non-Paris Club creditors that have not yet delivered debt relief, to do so.
<P>

<a name="20515w15.html_para4">Debt relief is, however, not a panacea and further measures, including sound economic and debt management by HlPCs themselves, will be required beyond HIPC, to enable countries to maintain debt sustainability levels. To this end, the UK is co-financing a multi-donor funded project to help strengthen the debt management capacity in HIPC countries.

 In 2000 only 38 per cent. of EC official development assistance payments went to poor countries down from 52 per cent. in 1999. Accurate figures for EC spending in 2001 will be available early next year. However, it is likely that the share of EC spending in low income countries will have risen since expenditure from the European Development Fund in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries-most of which are low income-is reported to have increased significantly.

 The UK recognises that, even with the preferential trade access available to many developing countries, the highest tariffs continue to fall on historically sensitive products of interest to developing countries, particularly agricultural goods, textiles and clothing. In order to tackle the substantial barriers to trade, a new trade round was launched at the fourth WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November last year with a pro- development agenda.

 With an adult HIV infection rate of 35 per cent., it is estimated that AIDS claims the lives of over 2,000 Zimbabweans weekly and that up to 900,000 children have lost one or both parents.

 It is for the Government of Zimbabwe to provide leadership in improving food security in Zimbabwe. As yet there is no credible national plan to tackle the problems, which continue to deteriorate.

I want to ensure that after nearly 20 years PACE is still a useful tool supporting the police and, if changes are needed, I will have no hesitation in making them.

 In June 2000, my right hon. Friend Jack Straw, the then Home Secretary, called for the international community to examine how better the 1951 Geneva Convention could be operated to deal more effectively with issues caused by large mixed flows of migrants. Later that year, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) launched a series of global consultations on the legal framework, operation and gaps in the 1951 convention. The consultations will conclude this year. I reaffirmed, on 12 December 2001, the United Kingdom Government's commitment to the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol at a commemorative meeting to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its signing.

The Government's view of this draft regulation can be found in the Home Office Explanatory Memorandum dated 23 October, deposited in the Library.

 A three-year strategy was launched in February 2001 following the Prison Service's review "Caring for the Suicidal in Custody", which recommended a radical move from awareness to prevention, including a commitment to reduce self-inflicted deaths in prison. The strategy embraces targeted, preventative measures within a holistic approach that seeks a supportive prison culture based on good prisoner/staff relationships; a physically safe environment with reduced opportunities for self-harm; and strong multi-disciplinary partnerships within prisons, with the courts, police and other criminal justice partners and with voluntary agencies particularly the Samaritans. Related work is tackling bullying and violence.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> The Home Office neither sponsors safety tests involving the use of animals, nor does it set any requirements for data produced by any such procedures. Examples of specific legislative requirements under which procedures on animals may be carried out include the Medicines Act 1968, the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations, the Control of Pesticides Regulations, European Union Pesticides Directives, and the Food Safety Act. These requirements are matters for the relevant sponsoring Department.

<P>

<a name="20515w20.html_para3">Where testing using animals is required, we ensure that the 3Rs are rigorously applied (the use of alternatives which replace animal use entirely, reduce the numbers of animals used, or refine the procedures to minimise suffering). In deciding whether to grant a licence for any regulated procedure, the 1986 Act also requires that the likely benefits of the programme are weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="20515w20.html_para4">In addition, in August 2000, we announced an interdepartmental concordat on data sharing to enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals. The concordat commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourage data sharing between clients and thereby reduce animal tests.

<a name="20515w20.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that regulated procedures can only be authorised and performed if there are no scientifically suitable alternatives that replace animal use, reduce the number animals needed, or refine the procedures used to minimise suffering. The likely benefits to humans, other animals or the environment must be weighed against the likely welfare costs to the animals involved.
<P>

<a name="20515w20.html_para5">Although it has been suggested that information derived from procedures on animals cannot be extended to humans, these views do not reflect the consensus in the wider scientific community. This recognises that while there are physiological or bio-chemical differences between species, there are greater similarities. Species differences are taken into account within the design of research projects and the results of testing a new drug, for example, on animals can be used to predict the effect on humans.
<P>

<a name="20515w20.html_para6">Animal procedures are, in any case, only one element of the tests carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of products. Before animals are used, they will also have been subjected to a variety of other screening processes including the use of computers, cell cultures and other non-animal tests. Clinical trials in humans also play an important part. It is not justified, therefore, to single out animal experiments for criticism when unexpected results are seen in full-scale clinical use. The simple fact is that biological science is not exact. However, until other suitable alternatives are developed, animal tests will continue to play an important part in minimising the adverse effects to humans caused by unexpected reactions during clinical trials and use.

<P>
<a name="20515w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The consultation document, "Making Decisions: Helping People who have Difficulty Deciding for Themselves" seeks views on a series of leaflets which offer practical guidance and set out the current legal position with regard to decision-making on behalf of mentally incapacitated adults. As part of the compilation of this guidance, the Voluntary Euthanasia Society commented on factual information that was to be provided on advance directives.

 During the 2001 calendar year, 579,157 summonses were issued by the Jury Central Summoning Bureau. 175,644 (30.3 per cent. of those summoned) people were excused from jury service, of which 32,321 (5.6 per cent. of those summoned) were excused as of right.
<P>

<a name="20515w21.html_para0">We do not collect statistics of the individual reasons why people are excused by right. We have however taken a three week sample in eight courts to obtain an estimate of the number of excusals. The sample showed that 1.3 per cent. of those summoned were excused on the grounds of their profession. If this figure is accurate then nationally this would equate to under 7,500 of the 579,157 summoned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I have no knowledge of any 10-year rule concerning the pulping of ministerial papers. Ministers' official papers are public records and, in common with all public records, are reviewed for disposal or preservation in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act 1958 and the 'thirty-year rule'. The Public Record Office has recently published guidance entitled 'Management of Private Office Papers', which is available on the Public Record Office website at http://www.pro.gov.uk/recordsmanagement/standards/ privateoffice.htm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Court Service is constantly seeking to improve Crown Court accommodation to meet modern standards and changing requirements. Various options are being considered for replacing the current Crown Court accommodation in Buckinghamshire. We have concluded that the existing accommodation cannot be refurbished to meet modern standards. The options, including the possibility of entering into a Private Developer Scheme, need to be developed further and the appropriate funding secured.

 Consensia have taken particular account of the need to attract more women and members of ethnic communities in both the design and publication of advertisements for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

 Health service circular 2001/001: local authority circular (2001)/1 Intermediate Care, issued on 19 January 2001, explains that, as part of the extra &#163;900 million made available by 2003&#150;04 for intermediate care and related services to promote independence, around &#163;255 million is specifically for national health service investment in intermediate care. This is on top of the extra &#163;150 million available recurrently from 2000&#150;01, and a further &#163;64 million is for community equipment services.
<P>

<a name="20515w24.html_para1">The circular also confirms that &#163;100 million will be available in 2003&#150;04 for a personal social services (PSS) performance fund, focusing initially on development of intermediate care. Beyond that, a substantial component of the &#163;900 million relates to resources being provided to local government, mostly through the PSS standard spending assessment. Deployment of those resources remain a decision for councils to make in the light of local circumstances.

 Quality Protects is the Government's flagship programme to improve the management and delivery of children's social services. Participation of children and young people underpins the Quality Protects programme and is a priority area for special grant funding. In September 2000, the Department formed a Quality Protects young people's reference group to ensure the contemporary views of children and young people inform the development of the programme. The Department meets with this group three times a year. The last meeting took place on 6 April 2002. Topics discussed included the Department's review of foster care (Choice Protects) and draft advocacy standards.
<P>

<a name="20515w24.html_para3">In addition to the Quality Protects reference group, the Department meets regularly with A National Voice&#151;a young people's organisation which exists to enable young people currently or previously in care to have an effective voice in consulting and developing policies that will bring about positive change for young people. A National Voice is unique in that it is managed and staffed by young people with experience of having been in care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason it was decided to establish a national stockpile of smallpox vaccine; who took the decision; and on what date.  [53930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has held a substantial stockpile of smallpox vaccine for contingency purposes since smallpox vaccination ceased in the 1970s. The existing stock of vaccine is nearly 30-years-old. Although the vaccine has retained its potency, the technology underpinning these stocks is now also 30-years-old. In the aftermath of the events of September 11, we reviewed our ability to deal with terrorist attacks involving biological weapons. We have decided that the sensible course of action is to up-date our existing smallpox vaccine supplies with new supplies of cell based vaccines to reflect advances in vaccine development and safety standards.
<P>

<a name="20515w25.html_para6">Ministers took the decision to proceed to purchase smallpox vaccine on 11 March, and a contract was signed with PowderJect on 11 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department is not putting information about the size of its smallpox vaccine stock or its deployment in the public domain as this is information that might be useful to terrorists. As smallpox has been eradicated since the 1970s, its re-introduction into the UK is only likely if there is a terrorist attack on the United Kingdom. This therefore raises issues of national security. The cost of the current procurement is &#163;32 million.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> The expert sub-group, under the chairmanship of the chair of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI), was convened by the Department. The sub-group was comprised of those core members of the JCVI with experience relevant to smallpox vaccine issues, other experts with related expertise in virology, communicable disease control, smallpox eradication, intensive clinical care, smallpox research, and vaccine production and licensing. The Ministry of Defence and the Department were also fully represented at the meeting. In the interests of national security, the discussions were confidential as they related to the nation's preparedness to deal with a bioterrorist attack, and the experts gave their individual views on this basis. The names of the participants are therefore not being made public.
<P>

<a name="20515w25.html_para9">A declaration of interests and their academic affiliations is required of all members of the JCVI and a full list of members and their interests is shortly to be placed in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> As smallpox has not occurred naturally in the world since the 1970s, its re-introduction into the UK is likely to be as the result of a direct terrorist attack on our country. This raises issues of national security as well as public health. For this reason the Department is not making public details about the quantities of vaccine stocks or vaccine deployment, as this might be information that could be useful to terrorists. The Department issued guidance to all health authorities and regional directors of public health on the procedures to be followed in the event of a deliberate release of smallpox and other biological agents, on 17 October. At the same time, guidance for medical and laboratory staff was issued by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) concerning the precautions to be adopted in the event of an outbreak of smallpox. This advice is available on the PHLS website: http:// www.phls.co.uk/advice/smallpox&#151;guidelines.pdf

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what rights an NHS patient has to demand treatment overseas as a result of the recent European Court ruling.  [54896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20515w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Following the Decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the cases of Garaets-Smits/ Peerbooms (C157/99) and Vanbraekel (C368/98), my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State announced last autumn that he was removing the obstacles in domestic legal provision to allow health care commissioners in England to purchase care elsewhere in the European Economic Area (EEA) for English residents.
<P>

<a name="20515w26.html_para10">These arrangements for direct purchase of care operate alongside the provisions of European Community law in Regulation (EEC) 1408&#150;71. This allows referral of patients from the country of residence to the state medical sector in any of the member states of the EEA specifically to receive treatment for a pre-existing medical condition,

using EC Form E112. The procedures for obtaining this document are set out in the Department of Health leaflet 'Health Advice for Travellers' available from Post Offices (copy available in the Library).
<P>

<a name="20515w26.html_para11">In considering the national legislation of the Netherlands at issue in the Garaets-Smits/Peerbooms case, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that their system which required prior approval from the patient's sickness insurance institution for treatment in other EEA states, was contrary to the freedom to provide services provisions of the treaty establishing the European Community. However, the ECJ said that, provided certain conditions were met, such a rule was justified in the interests of maintaining the financial stability of the Dutch national health system.
<P>

<a name="20515w26.html_para12">In the light of the ECJ rulings, the United Kingdom continues to operate a requirement that prior authorisation for treatment elsewhere in the EEA must be obtained. In the case of E112 referrals responsibility for this prior authorisation rests with the Department. Direct commissioning of health care services by national health service bodies by its very nature requires prior authorisation by the referring NHS organisation. Patients arranging treatment elsewhere in the EEA without obtaining the appropriate prior authorisation are personally liable for the costs involved.

<a name="20515w27.html_para0">In recognition of the longer length of medical training courses and the need to guarantee the increased future supply of medical staff, the Government have already introduced special financial support arrangements for undergraduate medical students. English domiciled pre-registration medical students who joined their courses from 1 September 1998 onwards, qualify for NHS bursaries in their fifth and subsequent years of study. NHS bursaries are also available to English-domiciled students undertaking the new four-year graduate-entry medical courses. These students qualify for NHS-funded support in years two to four of the course.
<P>

<a name="20515w27.html_para1">Medical and dental students receive the same package of support as other health professional students studying at degree level and are therefore eligible for a means tested NHS bursary of up to &#163;2,640 for students studying in London (rate for academic year 2002&#150;03), supplemented by a non-means tested reduced rate student loan. In addition all NHS-funded students have their liability for a tuition fee contribution (&#163;1,100 for academic year 2002&#150;03) met in full, and without means testing. Additional allowances are available for older students, individuals with disabilities, single parents and others with dependants, and also to take account of the longer academic year attended by health professional students.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> Eastern Cheshire Primary Care Trust (PCT) is working closely with East Cheshire Hospice and is investing significantly in the services it provides. This follows a comprehensive review of cancer services, including palliative care, by the former South Cheshire health authority, which developed a four-year strategy in consultation with all relevant partners, including the hospice itself. Funding has risen in real terms over the last year. We have pledged, in the NHS Cancer Plan, that the national health service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care will increase.

 There is no one standard model for a children's commissioner. The models that have been adopted in other countries vary considerably, and arise from the specific needs and individual circumstances of each country. While only Wales, among the devolved Administrations, has established the role of a children's commissioner, the possible forms of such a role within Northern Ireland and Scotland, now being considered in those countries, show both similarities and differences to the model introduced in Wales.

These services include those provided by children's homes; independent fostering agencies; local authority fostering services; the welfare aspects of boarding schools; and, in due course, residential family centres, voluntary adoption agencies, and local authority adoption services.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> It has been estimated that up to 9,000 multiple sclerosis patients in England and Wales may be eligible to receive treatment under the risk-sharing scheme, which started on 6 May 2002. Some centres have now started prescribing under the scheme, though the guidance in HSC 2002/004 recognises that appropriate NHS infrastructure may not yet be in place in some localities. It may take 18 months or longer before all potentially eligible patients are assessed under the scheme. The list of locally agreed prescribing centres is not yet finalised. The scheme co-ordinator, whose appointment will shortly be announced, will collect information on progress and activity under the scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> In July 2001 the chief medical officer was asked to set up an advisory group to look at the reform of clinical negligence in the national health service. It has not yet been possible to publish proposals for reform, because of the complexity of the issues raised by potential reforms, the need to consult widely (including through the Lord Chancellor's Department on how compensation is paid) and also to consider how potential proposals sit alongside a concurrent review of the NHS complaints procedure. Nevertheless, the chief medical officer has now held the last of his advisory group meetings and will shortly publish the findings along with recommendations for reform.
