 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 will be the biggest multi-sport event ever held in the United Kingdom. They will leave a lasting sporting, economic and social legacy.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para0">The Minister of State, Cabinet Office explained, in evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on 20 March 2001, that Manchester City Council, with the Government, had arranged a review of the finances and organisation of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester next year as a build up to the Games moves from the planning to the implementation phase.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para1">Following the review, conscious of the benefits the Games will bring to the nation as a whole, the Government have agreed to provide from existing resources up to &#163;30 million to support the Games. Sport England has agreed to provide up to &#163;30 million to support the Games' costs in addition to its existing contribution to capital facilities, and Manchester City Council will make available a further &#163;45 million. &#163;25 million of these funds will be held jointly by the three parties as a contingency fund. This support is additional to the &#163;10.5 million which the Government have already made available towards the costs of the opening and closing ceremonies for the Commonwealth Games, and marks the full extent of the financial support that the Government are prepared to make available.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para2">The Government consider that this package should give the Games' organisation sufficient certainty to deliver the Games. Manchester City Council continues to retain ultimate financial responsibility for the Games.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para3">Discussions continue about the make up and timing of the package of financial support. The Government, Manchester City Council and Sport England will be working with the Games' organisers to strengthen the management arrangements for the control of expenditure.

<a name="10709w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government support the expansion of sport and leisure facilities through various means including direct funding from the Sports Lottery Fund, Space for Sports and Arts and the New Opportunities Fund. Our Plan for Sport sets out how we aim to encourage local authorities to carry out research into the existing sport and leisure facilities in their areas and recommends that each local authority should develop a sports strategy over the next five years which, through consultation with the relevant agencies, ensures that new and enhanced indoor and outdoor facilities provide equal opportunity for participation.

<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para4">11,496 overseas electors were registered as of 15 February 2001. But there is no requirement on electoral administrators to provide information about how long overseas electors have been resident outside the UK. Hence the figures requested are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the outcome was of the Transport Council meeting held in Luxembourg on 27 to 28 June.  [1746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on 28 June. I represented the United Kingdom, together with Sarah Boyack MSP, Minister for Transport in the Scottish Executive.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para5">The Council opened with debates on a number of maritime issues.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para6">A common position was adopted on the draft regulation putting into Community law the recent agreement reached in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on the accelerated phasing in of double hull oil tankers.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para7">The Council reached a common orientation on a draft directive which seeks to improve controls on shipping movements, notably for vessels with hazardous cargoes. Two outstanding issues were debated. Firstly, the Commission introduced a new proposal giving a precise timetable for the retrofitting of Voyage Data Recorders (VDRs) to cargo vessels if no agreement was reached in the IMO. I was among Ministers unable to accept such a precise text. On the second issue, that of restrictions on ships leaving port in exceptionally bad weather or sea conditions, I joined others in expressing concern that legal uncertainties could arise. I also sought to clarify that a member state could only enforce reporting requirements on vessels in areas where it had jurisdiction in international law. A revised text was produced on which Ministers were able to reach common orientation, although I maintained a reserve on the VDR text.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para8">Common approaches were agreed for member states to negotiate in the IMO on the retrofitting of VDRs to cargo vessels, and in the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) on an increase in the limits for compensation to be paid in cases of major oil spills.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para9">A common orientation was also agreed on a draft directive on the harmonisation of reporting formalities for ships. The aim of the proposal is to simplify procedures for ships arriving at and departing from Community ports, through the acceptance of a common set of IMO forms.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para10">The French Minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, and I presented a joint proposal urging the Community to bring into force a number of International Conventions relating to marine liability and compensation and pollution from ships. We had, prior to the Council, jointly signed a letter on this issue to our EU counterparts.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para11">The Commissioner reported on the principal elements of the forthcoming White Paper on a strategy for the Common Transport Policy. She hoped that the White Paper would be adopted soon. It is expected to outline 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2001 : Column: 323W</I><P>
some 60 separate measures to address traffic congestion, increased mobility and demand, and sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para12">Council Conclusions were adopted on the Galileo satellite navigation project. I joined other Ministers in noting that more work was needed on the selection of services, the cost-benefit analysis and the securing of private sector finance. The Commission also presented a draft regulation on management of the development phase of Galileo by a joint undertaking.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para13">Over lunch, there was a discussion of the Commission's Single European Sky proposals, aimed at improving air traffic management in Europe and reducing delays.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para14">The Council discussed aircraft noise issues. The Commission reported on ongoing discussions with the US on hushkits, and said that, subject to developments at the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in September, a proposal would be brought forward to replace the Hushkits Regulation.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para15">The Presidency presented a progress report on the proposed regulation to establish a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It sought agreement on two of the outstanding questions: coverage of third country aircraft, and the mechanism to appoint the Executive Director. The Council agreed that the Commission should bring forward proposals on application to third country aircraft, where justified, as part of future work on essential requirements for airline operations. The Council accepted that the executive Director of the EASA should be appointed by four-fifths majority of the Management Board, on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. There will be further discussion under the Belgian Presidency, notably on institutional aspects.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para16">The Council discussed an amendment to Regulation 2027/97 on air carrier liability, and political agreement was reached on a common position. The amendment will have the effect of increasing the levels of carriers' liability to passengers. The Council has already signed the Montreal Convention, with a view to ratification, and the two measures together significantly strengthen the protection afforded to air passengers in the Community.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para17">The Council agreed Conclusions affirming the voluntary agreements reached with airlines on air passenger rights.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para18">There was a progress report from the Commission on proposals to update the state aid rules and procurement procedures for public transport services by rail, road and inland waterway. The Commission indicated that there were difficulties in agreeing the proposal. Sarah Boyack noted the United Kingdom's support for the general principle of the regulation, but pointed out that its application to traditional and complex underground railway systems needed careful reflection.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para19">There was also a progress report on a draft directive on training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para20">The Commission presented its proposals on three issues in the "road package": an amendment to Directive 91/439 on driving licences; an amendment to Regulation 3820/85 on drivers' hours; and an amendment to Directive 92/6 on 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2001 : Column: 324W</I><P>
the use of speed limitation devices, extending compulsory fitting of them to vehicles above 3.5 tonnes. No decisions were taken.
<P>

<a name="10709w01.html_para21">Under other business, the Commission presented a new proposal on airport slot allocation. It also reported on the implementation of the package of rail transport measures adopted by the Council last year, noting its intention to propose a second package of measures, including a directive on rail safety regulation and the establishment of a European Rail Agency. Also under other business, the Commission reported on progress in aviation negotiations with Central and Eastern European countries and with Cyprus; co-operation with Euro-Mediterranean partners on transport and energy; and discussions with Russia on the issue of charges imposed for Siberian overflights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of deregulation on securing a comprehensive network of public bus services.  [1730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The historical impacts of bus deregulation in 1986 were studied closely in the policy review which preceded the 1998 Transport White Paper. In the decade after 1986, operated bus mileage outside London increased overall by 25 per cent. The position necessarily varies from place to place. It is primarily for local authorities, in developing their bus strategies within local transport plans, to assess the adequacy of the bus network and to take appropriate action within the framework of their new powers in the Transport Act 2000. We are making additional funding available through the rural bus grant and the rural and urban bus challenge schemes.

 Under the provisions of the Transport Act 2000, elderly and disabled people in England and Wales are entitled to half fare&#151;or better&#151;on local bus services, and the necessary travel pass must be issued free of charge. Local authorities may offer greater concessions&#151;for example less than half fare, and cheap travel on train or ferry services&#151;if they wish, and many do.
<P>

<a name="10709w02.html_para2">The Transport Act 2000 also requires the Secretary of State to issue guidance to local authorities advising on how the eligibility criteria for disabled people should be applied when applications for travel passes are considered. My Department issued such guidance to local authority associations, the bus industry and disability interests on 31 May. It is available on my Department's website at www.dtlr.gov.uk/itwp/consult/cf/disabled/index.htm.

<a name="10709w04.html_para2">In setting these standards we listened to the concerns of providers and produced a sensible set of standards which give providers a reasonable time to adapt, and achieved the support of national organisations representing consumers and providers. We made a number of specific changes to the proposed standards in response to the concerns raised in the comments we received. I am confident that these decisions will ensure that any improvements in the quality of care homes necessary will be achieved smoothly, and that stability in the care homes sector and sufficient capacity is maintained while changes are made.

 <i>[holding answer 28 June 2001]:</i> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advise that the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom does not pose a threat to the safety of milk and milk products from animals infected with the disease. In addition, the FSA advise that the current evidence indicates no increased public health risk from dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls released from foot and mouth pyres for the vast majority of people who consume milk or dairy products produced on land within two kilometres of the pyres. Farmers and their customers who consume milk exclusively from such a source have been advised that there may be a slightly higher, although still very small, additional risk. This advice is precautionary until the results of the FSA's testing programme are available.

 We understand that the European Commission is actively continuing development work on the draft directive to regulate those traditional herbal products which are classified as medicines. In particular, we are aware that the EC has recently been considering written comments made by European Union member states following a meeting of the European Pharmaceutical Committee in April 2001. The detailed terms of various possible provisions to safeguard public health are likely to feature prominently in the ongoing discussions on the draft directive. The Medicines Control Agency will continue to consult the United Kingdom natural health sector as work on this initiative progresses.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> The introduction of strategic health authorities is an important element in our proposals to decentralise power in the National Health Services. We will shift the balance of power in the NHS so that primary care trusts take the responsibility and resources for developing health services and improving health. Front-line staff are best placed to understand patients' needs and have the skills and experience to improve services. Empowering front-line staff and organisations to use these skills will help deliver faster and more responsive services and improve the patient experience.

 The NHS Cancer Plan set out our commitment to increase National Health Service investment in specialist palliative care by &#163;50 million by 2004 to ensure that the inequalities in access to specialist palliative care ends. Health authority allocations in 2001&#150;02 included a total of &#163;255 million to support the first year of local implementation of the NHS Cancer Plan. Priorities for this year include the development of costed strategic plans for palliative care.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 13 March that there would be a substantial increase in bursary support for all national health service-funded students, including nurses.
<P>

<a name="10709w06.html_para1">With effect from 1 September this year the basic rate of bursary will be increased by 10.4 per cent. This is the biggest increase in bursaries since their introduction in the late 1980s and provides diploma level students (who make up the majority of the student nurse population) with an extra &#163;500 per year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service bursaries provide a level of support which compares favourably with that available to other students in higher education. They will increase by 10.4 per cent. from September 2001. However the level of bursary support is only one factor influencing the recruitment and retention of student nurses.
<P>

<a name="10709w06.html_para3">Applicants to pre-registration nursing and midwifery training course increased by 87 per cent. over the last three years, to 34,953 in 1999&#150;2000, the latest year for which complete data are available.
<P>

<a name="10709w06.html_para4">The National Audit Office earlier this year reported that attrition form training was currently 17 per cent., lower than in previous years and in line with attrition from higher education generally. 'Academic failure' was the most common reason for nurses dropping out. The Department has commissioned further research on factors influencing drop out. This will report later in the summer.

 The current national health service support package available to degree level students comprises 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. student loan. In addition the student's tuition fee contribution is paid in full. This support is more favourable than that available to other United Kingdom students studying at degree level.
<P>

<a name="10709w06.html_para5">Students studying at diploma level receive a non- means-tested bursary and have their contribution to tuition fees paid in full.

 The Hospital Discharge Workbook, issued in 1994, gives guidance to the national health service, social services and other agencies on hospital discharge procedures. The workbook emphasises that the patient and carer should be made fully aware of arrangements for discharge and understand fully what is going to happen. Before an individual is discharged, checks should be made by the discharge nurse to ensure that discharge arrangements take place as planned. The chief executive of the hospital trust is responsible for ensuring that discharges take place appropriately. Work will begin soon on revising the hospital discharge workbook.
<P>

<a name="10709w07.html_para0">The NHS Plan acknowledged that health and social services need to do more to shape services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers. During 2002, older people, and where appropriate their carers, will be involved in agreeing a personal care plan, which they will hold. The personal care plan will document their current package of health and social care, their care co-ordinator, monitoring arrangements, and a list of key contacts for rapid response at home and in emergencies.

One of its aims is to ensure that older people gain maximum benefit from their medication and do not suffer unnecessarily from illness caused by excessive or inappropriate consumption of medicines. One of the milestones set in the NSF is that, by April 2002, people over 75 will have their medicines reviewed at least annually, and those taking four or more medicines will have a review six-monthly. And, by 2004, every primary care trust (PCT) will have schemes in place so that older people get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines.

 The formula for setting health authority resource allocation targets is based primarily on resident population.

These adjusted resident populations are referred to as health authority relevant populations. These exclude transient populations and tourists.

 The Government will continue to promote human rights in bilateral and multilateral forums.

At the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane in October, the Government will try to ensure that the Commonwealth takes an even more active role in promoting human rights. A key element will be trying to expand the remit of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) so that it can recommend action where a Commonwealth member seriously or persistently violates human rights. Currently, CMAG comes into play only when an elected Commonwealth Government have been overthrown.

 This Government have been at the forefront of international efforts to bring about good governance, respect for human rights and a return to democracy in Burma. Sanctions have been a significant aspect of this effort. We believe multilateral sanctions are the most effective and we were instrumental last year in securing a strengthening of the EU Common Position on Burma that includes an asset freeze and visa ban for members of the Burmese regime, an arms ban and a ban on non-humanitarian aid. In the UK, this has been implemented through the Burma (Sale, Supply and Export of Goods) (Penalties) Regulation (SI 2000/1408) and Burma (Freezing of Funds) Regulation 2000 (SI 2000/1472) and the Immigration (Designation of Travel Bans) (Amendment) Order 2000. We have given a cautious welcome to recent positive developments in Burma, such as the release of some political prisoners and the lessening of the restrictions on pressure on the National League for Democracy. But we will not soften our position until there is evidence of real change in Burma.

The Government do not welcome the imposition of charges for access to cash but where such charges apply this should be made clear to the user. Wherever possible, Post Office Network seek arrangements for ATM machines at sub-post offices to be free of transaction charges but in some locations it would not be financially viable to install ATMs without a transaction charge being made.

<a name="10709w10.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Our view of the Commission's original proposal was that it was too prescriptive and paid insufficient regard to subsidiarity. By contrast, the text agreed by member states at the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 11 June avoids a rigid "one size fits all approach" which would be inappropriate for the UK given our diverse practices in this area. In particular the draft provides that the practical arrangements for information and consultation shall be defined and implemented in accordance with national law and industrial relations practices in individual member states.

 The US Administration are considering a range of options for missile defence both in the short and long-term. These include airborne and sea-based options, as well as options similar to those considered by the previous US Administration.

<P>
<a name="10709w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is very difficult to provide an accurate quantification of the energy savings expected from the provision of energy efficiency advice. However, figures from the Energy Saving Trust's Energy Efficiency Advice Centres suggest that 60 per cent. of their customers act in some way to advice given. They estimate that this has resulted in energy savings per home of &#163;26 per year, or around 1,600 kiloWatt hours.
<P>

<a name="10709w15.html_para6">As my hon. Friend may know, as part of our proposals to improve the home buying and selling process, the Government propose to require sellers to include an energy efficiency report, prepared by an approved home inspector, in a new seller's pack. The purpose is to put information in the hands of the buyer at the time they are most likely to be taking decisions about expenditure on a property.
<P>

<a name="10709w15.html_para7">Assuming that savings are similar to those resulting from advice given by the Advice Centres, we estimate that energy efficiency advice in the seller's pack could save around two TeraWatt hours per year. This is based on around 1.3 million home transactions per year in England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations <i>(a)</i> she and <i>(b)</i> her predecessor received about extending the date limit on harvesting potatoes on set-aside land in Northumberland following exceptionally wet weather; and if extensions have been granted.  [1173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w17.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 June 2001]:</i> The date limit for harvesting potatoes, or other crops, from set-aside land is designed to ensure that farmers cannot receive both an EU payment for taking land out of production and revenue from agricultural operations during the set-aside period. In a normal year any previously planted crops must be harvested by 15 January at the latest in order to comply with this condition, which is laid down in implementing legislation for the EU's Arable Area Payments Scheme. In view of a number of representations from the industry at the time, the UK twice successfully applied to the European Commission to have the date postponed, initially to 31 March and subsequently to 30 April, in order to allow sufficient time for harvesting to be completed where field conditions resulting from exceptionally wet weather had earlier made this impossible. We also secured a derogation allowing failed crops to be ploughed in at any time before the 15 May claim deadline, without prejudicing eligibility for set-aside payment.
<P>

<a name="10709w17.html_para0">Notwithstanding these changes, my predecessor did receive some subsequent representations asking for a further postponement of the harvesting date limit beyond 30 April. The European Commission were not prepared to agree to this, pointing both to the practical difficulties of ensuring that crops harvested so late had genuinely

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The EU Employment and Social Policy Council is not seeking to impose a specific limit on tractor use. However, it has been discussing the proposed Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive which would, among other provisions, set a mandatory limit for exposure to whole body vibration. Limiting whole body vibration would affect tractor driving time but the impact will depend on the magnitude of the vibration in individual cases. The Council agreed on a maximum dose of 1.15 metres per second squared (a measure of acceleration) averaged over an 8-hour period for whole body vibration exposure. In the case of tractor use, the impact would vary, depending on factors such as seating and cab design.

 The Government believe that decisions concerning the organisation and supply of school places are best taken locally&#151;by the main partners in the provision of education who have knowledge of local needs. It is the responsibility of Local Education Authorities (LEAs) to ensure that there are sufficient school places within their area.
<P>

<a name="10709w19.html_para1">Should a borough council propose new housing developments as part of its local plan, we would expect the LEA's School Organisation Plan (SOP) to reflect any projected increases in the pupil population. All LEAs are required to produce a SOP, which sets out how they propose to deal with deficits and surpluses of school provision over a rolling five year period. The SOP sets the context for proposals to change school organisation in the area, and may include proposals to establish new schools or enlarge existing ones.
<P>

<a name="10709w19.html_para2">If, as a result of housing developments, the LEA identifies a need for additional primary and secondary school places, we would consider any future capital bids from Essex that meet the published criteria for support.

 Higher education institutions have submitted their human resource strategies to the Higher Education Funding Council for England so that it can allocate the extra &#163;330 million the Government are providing over three years to support increases in academic and non-academic pay. To gain their share of this funding institutions need to demonstrate that their strategies include clear and practicable equal opportunities policies. The Equality Challenge Unit set up by the higher education funding councils and representative bodies will work directly with institutions to help them deliver the improvements in monitoring and performance they have promised in their equal opportunities policy statements.

<a name="10709w20.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the budget is in their first year of operation for teachers' threshold payments; and how much has been spent on the preparation and implementation of and training for the scheme <i>(a)</i> from her Department's budget and <i>(b)</i> from other public education budgets.  [2928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w20.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 To the end of June 2001, the Department has paid about &#163;350 million to local authorities to cover the additional salary costs of teachers passing the threshold. The Department has a contract with Cambridge Education Associates (CEA) for the provision and deployment of threshold assessors and external advisers to governing bodies on heads' performance. It also has a contract with the Centre for British Teachers (CfBT) for training in threshold assessment and performance management. The value of these contracts depends on the volume and quality of activity. To June 2001 we estimate that total CEA contract costs have been about &#163;22 million&#150;&#163;24 million and CfBT contract costs about &#163;12 million&#150;&#163;14 million.
<P>

<a name="10709w20.html_para3">The Standards Fund for 2000&#150;01 provided &#163;40 million to help schools introduce performance management and threshold assessment. &#163;32 million of this came from the Department and the rest from local education authorities. &#163;28 million is available through the Standards Fund for 2001&#150;02 to help schools operate performance management and threshold assessment. This is 100 per cent. funded by the Department.

<P>
<a name="10709w20.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The National Union of Teachers has suggested in response to consultation that the proposed regulations contain provisions in relation to appraisal results and pay determination which are outside the Secretary of State's powers in relation to these regulations.

 The Secretary of State is satisfied that the provision permitting appraisal results to be taken into account in the exercise of pay discretions, which has been in regulations governing teachers' appraisal since 1991, is within the law.

 Details of the scheme were first published in the Green Paper "Teachers, meeting the challenge of change" in December 1999. Details of the scheme were published in a DfES leaflet (DfEE/0159/2000) issued September 2000 and can also be found on the scheme website at www.dfes.gov.uk/teachingreforms/rewards/ schoolachieve.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The names of the award-winning schools were announced on 15 March. About 7,000 schools have won awards, equivalent to 30 per cent. of maintained schools in England. A full list of the award winning schools was posted to the House of Commons Library at the time of the announcement.
<P>

<a name="10709w21.html_para2">The Department had always planned to check the value of every award before paying the money to schools. In some cases we found that schools would be getting less than they should, so we topped up their awards to the correct level. This means that every award-winning school will either receive the amount it was initially told it would receive or a larger amount. The figures placed in the House of Commons Library reflect these recalculations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to the answer of 26 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 363W, what financial penalties are levied on schools for non-compliance with the Department's exclusion reduction target.  [3105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The latest permanent exclusion figures for 1999&#150;2000 indicate that exclusions have fallen to around 8,600, nearly a third less than the peak of 12,700 in 1996&#150;97. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is satisfied that the level of exclusions we have reached is sustainable and, therefore, she does not intend to set fresh exclusion targets for reducing permanent exclusions further. My right hon. Friend has also announced new measures to: change the law on exclusions to reflect the interests of the school community; consult on extending Parenting Orders and maximising support to schools in dealing with disruptive children and violent parents; produce a positive package of preventive action to promote good behaviour; make Admissions Forums, whose role will include the re-integration of excluded pupils, mandatory.
<P>

<a name="10709w21.html_para4">We have significantly increased the resources available to schools and local education authorities to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils, from &#163;17 million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;131 million in 2000&#150;01 and again to &#163;174 million this year&#151;a tenfold increase. Before April 2000 most of this money was held centrally by local authorities to support authority-wide initiatives to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils. For the first time in April 2000 the majority of this funding was devolved directly to schools so that they could decide how best to tackle poor behaviour. Schools have, therefore, benefited by an additional &#163;100 million in 2000&#150;01 and &#163;126 million this year. Where a child has to be excluded some of the money previously held by local authorities which is now in schools reverts back to the local authority. This money can be used by the authority to provide education outside school or to support a re-integration package at a new school. This procedure follows the principle introduced by the last Conservative Government of money following the excluded pupil. By September 2002 all permanently excluded pupils must be offered full-time education and not the 2&#150;3 hours per week all too typical in the past.

The United Kingdom performs better than some of our international competitors, including the United States, but has ground to make up to achieve the higher levels of literacy skills in countries such as Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.
<P>

<a name="10709w21.html_para5">The Government have recognised the vital importance to individuals and the economy of improving adult literacy and numeracy. Research suggests that improved literacy and numeracy skills can help people earn up to &#163;50,000 more over their working life. The benefit to society of better skills has been valued at &#163;10 billion a year. Our strategy, "Skills for Life", launched by the Prime Minister in March, will improve the basic skills of 750,000 adults by 2004. Many of these will come from groups we have prioritised for our support, including the unemployed, those in low-skilled jobs and those living in disadvantaged areas. By helping them improve their literacy and numeracy skills, we aim to create a more prosperous and more equal society. As we set out in the Labour manifesto, this is the first of our 25 steps to a better Britain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the total cost is of introducing the teacher trainee tests.  [3115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The cost of the introduction of the ITT skills tests up to April 2001 was &#163;4.7 million. This included the development and delivery of the paper-based numeracy skills tests in summer 2000; the development and delivery of the computerised ITT skills tests in numeracy and literacy introduced in February 2001; and the development of the skills tests in ICT, which will be introduced in September 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many teachers who completed their trainee skills tests last year and are now in their induction year in schools have <i>(a)</i> not passed the skills tests and <i>(b)</i> applied for an extension to their induction period in order to retake the tests.  [3117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The requirement to take a numeracy skills test during the induction period was only introduced for teachers awarded qualified teacher status last summer. These newly qualified teachers have not yet completed their induction periods.

<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We have not received any representations about the modularisation of GCSEs. Modular specifications represent approximately 8 per cent. of the total of new GCSE specifications to be taught in schools from September 2001.

 We have no plans to amend the present arrangements in which the interval between school inspections varies between two and six years, consistent with the principle that intervention should be in inverse proportion to success.

<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2001]:</i> In Budget 2000, the Government reduced the rate of VAT to 5 per cent. on the grant-funded supply and installation of window and door locks, bolts and security chains, spy holes and smoke alarms in homes of those aged over 60 who are in receipt of specified benefits. The reduced rate was targeted at these grant-funded supplies to ensure that extra help goes where it is most needed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government will continue to steer a course of economic stability by maintaining fiscal discipline, consistent with the fiscal rules, and by supporting the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee in continuing to meet the inflation target. Budget 2001 (HC 279) included latest forecasts for the economy and the public finances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Decisions on individual areas of taxation are considered on an annual basis as part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's overall Budget judgment. The Government have renewed their pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares for the duration of this Parliament.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to compensate the National Insurance Fund for the loss of contribution income from employers resulting from the introduction of <i>(a)</i> the Landfill Tax, <i>(b)</i> the Climate Change Levy and <i>(c)</i> the Aggregates Levy.  [2386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 None. The reductions in employers' National Insurance contributions were and are to be recycled through the proceeds of the Landfill Tax, the Climate Change Levy and the Aggregates Levy, thereby protecting UK competitiveness and employment while helping the UK to achieve its environmental objectives.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer by how much the National Insurance Fund balance at the end of the year 2000&#150;01 exceeded the minimum level recommended by the Government Actuary.  [2387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The estimated balance of the National Insurance Fund at the end of 2000&#150;01 is likely to have exceeded the minimum level recommended by the Government Actuary by around &#163;10.6 billion.

The corresponding figure for 1999&#150;2000, which is the latest available on a comparable basis, but which pre-dates the auction of the third generation mobile telephone licences, was 0.23 per cent.

 The People's Panel is not intended to raise revenue for the Government. For clients other than the Cabinet Office, the costs of research undertaken using the People's Panel were none in 1998&#150;99; &#163;126,150 in 1999&#150;2000; and &#163;187,515 in 2000&#150;01.

This guidance was developed following extensive consultation with Departments, reflects existing best practice and reminds Departments that public expenditure must not be used for party political purposes. Departments are encouraged in the guidance to pass it to others carrying out research of this sort such as non-departmental public bodies and to publish the results of research, for example, by placing them in the House of Commons Library and making them publicly available on request and on the internet.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the recent report from the Metropolitan Police Public Order Unit about the difficulties of obtaining antisocial behaviour orders; and what response he has made.  [1247]

<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We have noted the references in the report to some of the problems faced in considering and applying for Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs). It is to be expected that a new provision will take some time to bed down. We are, nevertheless, conducting a review 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2001 : Column: 411W</I><P>
of these orders to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify best practice. The review should be completed later this year.
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para10">In the meantime we note from the report that 32 antisocial behaviour orders have been made in the Metropolitan police area between April 1999 and June this year and the very positive message about the benefits of the police working in partnership with local authorities and other agencies to tackle antisocial behaviour. Paragraph 12 of the report states:
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"One of the major achievements of the work on ASBOs has been the obligation and need to work in partnership. [. . .] We are aware of no instances of Metropolitan police service officers failing to co-operate with local authority partners in applying for an ASBO. Quite the contrary, there is considerable evidence of excellent partnership working. Tentative early partnerships are maturing into collaborations with trust and understanding."

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> antisocial behaviour orders and <i>(b)</i> antisocial behaviour contracts have been issued.  [2349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 As at 31 March 2001 there have been 215 antisocial behaviours orders (ASBOs) issued within England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para12">An acceptable behaviour contract (ABC) is a voluntary written agreement between a person, whose behaviour is causing a problem, and the police or local authority. It will normally contain a list of antisocial actions which the person undertakes not to do and may also specify certain areas which he or she undertakes not to enter. The ABC is not enforceable in itself but a breach could lead to an ASBO.
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para13">We have no plans at present to ask local partnerships to collect statistics on these.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Coffey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many antisocial behaviour orders have been successfully applied for in each of the local authorities in Greater Manchester.  [2336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We understand that at least 10 antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) were issued in Greater Manchester between 1 April 1999 and 31 May 2000. From 1 June 2000 the number of such orders applied for and issued have been collected centrally. Between 1 June 2000 and 31 March 2001, three ASBOs were applied for and granted in Greater Manchester, two were issued within the North and West Greater Manchester Magistrates Courts Committee (MCC) area and one within the Trafford MCC. Figures by local authority area for the numbers of orders applied for are not held centrally.

behaviour <i>(a)</i> contracts and <i>(b)</i> orders; and what advice he is giving to local councils and the police on the merits and demerits of each.  [2355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 As my predecessor confirmed in a written answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) on 5 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 424W, we are also researching the operation and effectiveness of the antisocial behaviour order. We will also ensure the effectiveness of the acceptable behaviour scheme in Islington.
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para14">Guidance on antisocial behaviour orders was issued to the police and local authorities in March 1999 and June 2000. The previous Home Secretary made speeches and published a number of articles on the benefits of antisocial behaviour orders. Some of these also mentioned acceptable behaviour contracts. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I will do the same as the opportunity arises.

<a name="10709w24.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how often antisocial behaviour orders have been used; and what assessment has been made of their effectiveness.  [1421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Based on figures for up to 31 March this year, 215 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued in England and Wales since 1 April 1999. The evidence so far shows that they have been used successfully in a variety of circumstances and to good effect.
<P>

<a name="10709w24.html_para15">We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of these orders to evaluate their effectiveness in dealing with antisocial behaviour and to identify best practice. We expect this review to be completed later this year and we will consider the report carefully.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many antisocial behaviour orders have been issued since the relevant provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into effect in each local authority area, broken down by <i>(a)</i> reason for the order, <i>(b)</i> average age of the subject of the order and <i>(c)</i> source of the order; and if he will make a statement.  [2115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10709w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Available information given in the table shows the number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOS) made by age group of subject and police force area. Information on local authority area, the reasons for the orders and the source of the orders is not collected centrally.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> Information on the number of offenders prosecuted in 1999 for offences of drunkenness per thousand head of population for each police force authority is given in table 1. Information showing, in descending order, the percentage change in the number of offenders prosecuted in 1999 compared with 1990 for offences of drunkenness in each police force authority is given in table 2. It is not possible to say what proportion of those prosecuted live in the area. Prosecutions of people from outside the area are likely to be much higher in some areas than others. This is most obvious for the City of London which has a low resident population and large numbers of visitors.

 Police Authorities and Chief Constables may use their rural policing fund allocations as they judge best to improve policing in sparsely populated areas. The Chief Constable of North Yorkshire plans to recruit 60 officers.

 A Home Office-led Strategic Group has been developing guidance and plans for next year's commemoration, building on the successful foundations of the first United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Day last January. The Strategic Group includes representatives from a wide range of Government Departments and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para5">A working group chaired by the Home Office is taking forward the planning and delivery of the 2002 national event, liaising with the BBC who produced and televised the first national ceremony last January.
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para6">Updated guidance for local authorities and a wide range of voluntary and community groups on ways they can mark the day is being produced by a working group chaired by the Holocaust Adviser to the Local Government Association and involving a number of representatives of NGOs with experience and expertise in Holocaust remembrance and wider diversity issues.
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para7">The Holocaust education resource pack launched last November and intended for use by schools and others is currently being reviewed by a Department for Education and Skills led working group, consisting of NGOs with experience and expertise in Holocaust education and research. Around 30,000 of these well received packs have already been issued to about 23,000 schools.
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para8">The Strategic Group is devising a communication strategy for the promotion and delivery of the 2002 commemoration. It is envisaged that there will be a single launch date in September for all Holocaust Memorial Day promotional material. Details of relevant activities and supporting guidance will be placed onto the dedicated website www.holocaustmemorialday.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para9">I would like to encourage all hon. Members to support and encourage activities in their constituencies to mark the 2nd United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Day. The day is relevant to all of us. Its focus is on learning the lessons of the Holocaust and other more recent atrocities that raise similar issues.
<P>

<a name="10709w26.html_para10">A key aim of the day is to convey the commemoration's relevance to contemporary issues of racism and victimisation and promote a democratic and tolerant society that respects and celebrates diversity and is free of the evils of prejudice. This will be reflected in all of the related guidance and plans to mark Holocaust Memorial Day next January.

We have no immediate plans for legislation but will keep the possible need for further change under review. We want to ensure that those who come and work here continue to make a major contribution to our economic and social life. We have transferred responsibility for the work permit system to the Home Office and will be looking further at the legal entry routes for people seeking to work in Britain. Officials are currently reviewing the Immigration Rules with the aim of producing a consolidated version which incorporates all changes made since HC395, the last main Statement of Changes. These revised Rules are likely to include a number of additions and amendments.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2001]:</i> Updates to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's (IND) country assessments were made by IND's Country Information and Policy Unit in April 2001. These have been placed on the Home Office website. Country assessments are revised every six months. An assessment on Zimbabwe has been included on the website for the first time, as asylum applications from Zimbabwe have increased significantly during the past year.

 In addition to the commitment of large numbers of volunteers, Neighbourhood Watch in Lancashire is actively supported by 11 police crime prevention and community safety officers.

 The details of Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators are held by police. The police may only disclose information to the extent that they have the common-law or statutory power to do so and do not thereby breach any other relevant law, such as the common law duty of confidence. Any disclosures must also then comply with the good practice laid down in the Data Protection Act 1998, except to the extent that any relevant exemption applies.

Additionally not all the funded projects provide direct face-to-face services to adults as some like the National Family and Parenting Institute and Parentline Plus have a national role, such as the provision of information or a freephone telephone helpline, while some produce support materials to be used across the voluntary sector.

<a name="10709w28.html_para2">Following the last Spending Review the current total available to voluntary organisations through the Family Support Grant is &#163;5.6 million per year for a three year period beginning 1 April 2001. The emphasis of the grant is on evaluated practice, developing new or existing models of practice in new ways and on dissemination or replication of good practice and effective work rather than routinely supporting locally delivered programmes.

In both 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 the Home Office has granted &#163;15,000 to Mediation UK as part of a joint funding exercise to provide core funding that also includes the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Department of Health and the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a broad-ranging review of the legal and regulatory framework for charities and the wider voluntary and community sector and to bring forward proposals for reform. The project is expected to finish in the winter of 2001&#150;02.

<a name="10709w29.html_para0">Since May 1997 there have been 28 letters from Members of Parliament seeking information about extending the parliamentary franchise to EU citizens. The Government's view is that extending the franchise in this way would need to be by reciprocal agreement with all other EU member states. There are no current proposals by the European Commission for action in this area.

<a name="10709w29.html_para1">Precise information for the year in question&#151; 1996&#150;97&#151;is not readily available. The initial budget of &#163;19.385 million for the grant-in-aid for royal travel by rail and air was based on the estimated costs of royal travel in 1996&#150;97. The resource budget for air travel by 32 (The Royal) Squadron was &#163;16.57 million after adjusting for depreciation and interest charges on the capital values, airframe and engineering costs, the expected number of royal flying hours in 1997&#150;98, overhead and administration charges, inflation and VAT. The budget for flying by other operators was &#163;711,000. The budget for rail travel (which included both fixed and variable costs of the Royal Train) was &#163;18.9 million. &#163;331,000 was allocated for administration costs.
