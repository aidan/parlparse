The contract for the supply of fresh fish and shellfish is scheduled to be re-tendered early in the new year and assessment of the sustainable seafood sourcing and supply policies of bidders will be included among the evaluation criteria.

 Every one of the 64 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts provides support to victims via an Independent Domestic Violence Advisor service (comprising at least on IDVA). As there is a wide range of work patterns across the 64 areas, we do not have precise employment numbers; we prefer to focus on ensuring delivery of a service that holistically supports individuals who are victims of domestic violence. By autumn of this year, there were 130 Government-funded graduates or students on the accredited training for Independent Domestic Violence Advisers, with a further 75 Government-funded places in the spring 2008.</p>

The review will examine what success looks like for Specialist Domestic Violence Courts in terms of criminal justice and safety measures. Based on the findings of the review, local areas will be advised on how they can measure performance, but we do not plan to have any national performance indicators.</p>

Early data from those areas which have been trained in Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference is promising with significant reductions in repeat victimisation, not least due to the work of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors who often carry out over 80 per cent. of the actions agreed at the conference.</p>

 Closing the pay gap between men and women is a key priority for us, as I made clear in my statement to Parliament on priorities for the Ministers for Women. We see tackling the pay gap as an essential part of enabling families to have real choices about how they live their lives because the pay gap plays such a large part in the unequal division of labour in the home, preventing fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and preventing women from fulfilling their opportunities to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="71029w0004.htm_para1"><a name="07102925000368">To galvanise this, closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new equalities public service agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as: giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working; since 1997, doubling the number of registered childcare places to 1.28 million; and guaranteeing all three and four-year-olds a free, 121/2 hours a week 38 weeks a year Government funded, early education place.</p>

 The Government have not conducted or commissioned any research on the gender gap in suicide rates.

The Government commissioned an evaluation of three mental health promotion pilots targeted at young men and published a report of that evaluation, Reaching Out: Evaluation of three mental health promotion pilots to reduce suicide among young men, in 2006.</p>

 The National Audit Office measures spending performance against plans by comparing outturns against final provision following Supplementary Estimates&#151;rather than against plans at the start of the year&#151;as plans can change during the year for a number of reasons, such as machinery of government and classification changes. The definitive figures for final provision and provisional outturn are published each year in the Public Expenditure Outturns White Paper. Changes to plans arising in-year are published in Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, as are differences between provisional and final outturns.</p>

The unspent funds were drawn down in subsequent years and the project was successfully completed in 2004-05.</p>

 Public service agreements (PSAs) apply only to Government Departments. The Department published its first set of PSAs in December 1998 and agreed a measurement methodology in March 1999. Since then we have agreed new PSAs with HM Treasury as part of each subsequent spending review (SR). We publicly report progress against these targets in our departmental annual report (DAR) and autumn performance report (APR) each year, copies of which can be found in the House Library.

 Both of these reports found no conclusive evidence of a link between playing violent games and behaving violently in real life. Both reports confirmed therefore that the current regulatory regime is satisfactory.

These measures included bigger classification symbols; advice explaining the type of content; strengthened guidance for retail staff; all games for adults to be classified by the British Board of Film Classification even if there is no statutory requirement to do so; and a website publicised by five million leaflets where parents can learn about the content of games and their classification.</p>

A commitment to carry out this review was included in CLG&#146;s recent Housing Green Paper. Terms of reference for the review are being finalised.</p>

We have recently made reforms to the planning policy framework and building regulations which has put good design at the heart of decision making and the future housing growth agenda. We will continue to monitor progress to see if any further changes are needed in the future.</p>

 Pursuant to my answer to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath of 26 March 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1321W, to date, public expenditure related to the Millennium Communities programme, excluding the Greenwich Peninsula site amounts to a total of &#163;86,561,250.</p>

The Millennium Communities programme as a whole is bringing forward seven new schools and colleges, five new health centres, 10 new public parks and play areas, and eight new community buildings. In addition, over 70,000 sq m of commercial and retail accommodation will be created. As an example, at the New Islington Millennium Community in Manchester the public investment is creating a new canal network, roads and infrastructure, a new primary school, a state of the art health centre, car club, child care facilities, an energy centre and 6,000 sq m of employment floorspace in addition to the 1,400 new homes.</p>

 In April 2006 four social landlords began piloting Social Homebuy on a voluntary basis. The pilot scheme, which will run until March 2008, allows participating local authorities and housing associations to offer tenants living in social rented accommodation the opportunity to purchase discounted shares of their home starting with an initial share of 25 per cent.</p>

Since April this year a second phase of landlords have joined the pilot scheme and are now offering Social Homebuy to their tenants. As with normal home purchases it can take several months to reach completion.</p>

 The Government set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to look into ways to improve the affordability of rural housing. Since its report in May 2006 we have taken a series of measures to help address rural problems, including changes to planning rules and a commitment to set a rural target for affordable housing over the next three years in light of the advice from regional housing boards which is done later in the year.</p>

Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) to conduct a review on how land use and planning can better support rural business and deliver more affordable housing. The review should be completed around July 2008.</p>

 It is vital that non-statutory organisations such as voluntary and community sector groups and businesses are fully involved in partnership working to agree and deliver local area agreements. Indeed in most areas they are already involved in collaborative working through the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) for the area. The 2006 LSP survey showed that over 80 per cent. of LSPs have voluntary sector umbrella organisations among their membership and nearly two thirds involve businesses. We want LSPs to develop this further because these sectors have a valuable contribution to make to discussions and can help to deliver in ways in which mainstream public sector providers can find difficult.</p>

 The consultation draft of the Planning Policy Statement (PPS): Planning and Climate Change was supported by a partial regulatory impact assessment (PRIA). The potential additional benefits of the PPS identified in the PRIA included expanded markets and demand for renewable and low-carbon technologies. While not quantifying the estimated monetary value associated with this, the PRIA states that by helping to stimulate markets for renewable, low-carbon and decentralised energy, the PPS would benefit the many small businesses active in this sector.</p>

 Regional Planning Guidance for London and the rest of the South East (RPG9) in 2000 identified the potential for significant growth in the Thames Gateway, Milton Keynes-South Midlands, Ashford and London-Stansted-Cambridge areas. Following studies into the potential for growth in these areas, the Government confirmed on 18 July 2002 that it would work with regional and local partners in each of these four growth areas to establish where, at what scale, and how quickly growth could be achieved. The Sustainable Communities Plan, &#145;Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future&#146;, published on 5 February 2003, announced confirmation of Thames Gateway and the three other growth areas together with funding support and said that working with regional planning bodies and local authorities Government would take forward growth plans for those areas through revisions of regional planning guidance, in the regional planning process.</p>

 Estimates of the type sought will vary substantially according to the assumptions made on matters such as the range of developments to which local policies arc applied, the expected number of developments to be completed, their energy demands, the extent to which the provision of installed equipment complies with the original planning permission and whether the technologies installed in practice provide the predicted savings. However the Government have set out a timetable for all new homes to be zero carbon by 2016. This will require significant increases in the use of renewables and we have assessed that overall implementation of this policy will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2050.</p>

 The London borough of Merton adopted their Unitary Development Plan in 2003 with a policy that expects new non residential developments above a threshold of l,000 sq m to incorporate renewable energy production equipment to provide at least 10 per cent. of predicted energy requirements. In doing so they were the first local authority in the UK to include a policy of this kind in a UDP. The council has been heavily involved in promoting the approach leading it to be coined the Merton Rule.</p>

BERR does not collect information on regional petrol prices. A range of factors determine retail petrol and diesel prices. Price differentials between rural and urban areas reflect different costs in distributing and supplying petrol and diesel. Price setting is a commercial matter for individual companies.

Customers should refer any complaints concerning pricing and anti-competitive behaviour to the Office of Fair Trading.

 As stated in the Government&#146;s response to the public consultation on the post office network, closures will principally affect a combination of branches in areas of over-provision and those that are least used. Post Office Ltd. will be tasked with taking a strategic overview of service provision to ensure that in areas of over-provision, people should be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used, the number of people affected will, by the nature of the offices, be low. The introduction of new access criteria will minimise the impact by ensuring that the network remains readily accessible across the UK&#151;with far greater coverage than any other retailer, financial service provider or public service provider.</p>

To improve access to basic education we are currently providing &#163;3.3 million through UNICEF and &#163;2.7 million through Save the Children, each over three years. We are providing &#163;4 million over four years through the United Nations Development Programme to improve food security and enable people in rural areas to increase their family incomes, and we are funding community development programmes through non-governmental organisations. We are also providing &#163;1.8 million over three years to help meet the needs of Burmese refugees on the Thai border. Part of the additional &#163;1 million agreed for urgent humanitarian needs in October will be used to improve access to food by poor and vulnerable people in Burma.</p>

New scheme uncleared cases over 5 years old are those which were previously under the old scheme, and have been converted to the new scheme via a new scheme calculation. When a new child support application is made, it may be established that the case has one or more links, through the parent with care or non-resident parent or their partners, to existing cases. If a link is established to one or more cases on the old computer system (CSCS), these cases will be transferred to the new computer system (CS2), along with any further cases that are linked to this chain.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the campaign his Department is running to promote the take up of council tax benefit by pensioners; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this campaign so far. [158054]</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 October 2007]:</i> The three page claim form that has been introduced means less bureaucracy and better service for pension credit customers. One phone call can give customers access to four benefits&#151;pension credit, state retirement pension, council tax benefit (CTB) and housing benefit (HB). This form is completed for the customer. All they need to do is check it, sign it and send it back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para3"><a name="07103022000363">We are taking other measures to promote the take up of CTB. There are annual awareness campaigns. We have provided local authorities with best practice guidance that contains information about barriers to claiming, ways of overcoming them, and case study examples of good practice to improve take-up. We have supported the three page form arrangements with computer scans run by The Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &#163;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para4"><a name="07103022000364">In the longer term, we want to deliver CTB as accessibly, simply and securely as possible. We want to research the feasibility of using data held &#147;across Government&#148; to build profiles of people likely to be entitled. We also want to develop the concept of a &#147;single point of contact&#148; for pensioners, coupled with alignment of application processes that will provide greater efficiency and a better public service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="71029w0033.htm_para5"><a name="07103022000365">Our assessment shows that enabling people to access CTB and HB via the Pension Service has resulted so far in over 65,000 more people being paid those benefits.</p>

The reason for the breach was a change in the accounting policy. During the 2003-04 financial year DWP reviewed its accounting policy in respect of capitalisation of expenditure on improvements to leasehold properties. As a result of this review the policy was changed so that expenditure in respect of major capital refurbishment and improvement of properties occupied but not owned was capitalised as leasehold improvements.</p>

These regulations outlaw unjustified age discrimination in employment and vocational training. Provisions relating to occupational pensions came into force on 1 December 2006. The regulations give individuals important new rights, extend existing rights and speed up removal of traditional barriers. Figures on the number of legal claims made against employers relating to ageism in the last five years, are not currently available as the regulations have only been in force since 1 October 2006. These will be provided by the ETS in its annual report. ETS does not routinely collect information on the age and sector of claimants, but BERR does carry out periodic surveys of employment tribunal findings. The last of which was carried out in 2003 (DTI/Pub 7531/0.9k/08/04/AR. URN 04/1071). The next survey is due to be carried out in 2008 and will include among other things information on the age and sector of claimants.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of how much would be needed on average in each of the next 50 years in <i> (a)</i> net present value and <i> (b)</i> cash sum terms in order for the Financial Assistance Scheme to pay 90 per cent. of the (i) core and (ii) expected pensions of all those eligible for support; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_412"><a name="07103022000688"><a name="71029w0035.htm_spnew5"><a name="07103022002089"><b>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</b>
 The &#145;core&#146; pension as defined by the financial assistance scheme standardises some pension features for ease of administration and to protect the public purse. For example, payments start from 65 rather than scheme pension age and no indexation is provided. The cash and NPV costs of paying 90 per cent. of core pension are in the following table and sum to approximately &#163;10 billion in cash terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="71029w0035.htm_para4"><a name="07103022000689">We do not have the data to estimate accurately an &#145;expected&#146; pension. Schemes that qualify for the financial assistance scheme have very different scheme rules, for example, on indexation and revaluation (particularly for pre-1997 pension accruals), and it is not possible to make precise estimates of these differences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="71029w0035.htm_para5"><a name="07103022000690">In the Government response to the report by the parliamentary ombudsman on occupational pensions (Trusting in the Pensions Promise, June 2006), we estimated the total cost of meeting expected pensions at between &#163;13 billion and &#163;17 billion in cash terms to reflect this uncertainty.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) is intended to pay compensation based on those benefits generally provided on the winding up of a pension scheme, and so does not incorporate additional benefits beyond basic retirement and survivor&#146;s benefits. The Government took a policy decision to focus the PPF compensation on these basic benefits to avoid an excessive burden on the Pension Protection Levy, which is paid by other pension schemes.

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="71029w0038.htm_para1"><a name="07103022001201">The Department has, however, estimated indicative costs for the PPF introducing early compensation on ill health grounds; these estimates are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions. If, for example, 5 per cent. of PPF deferred members qualified for ill-health compensation without actuarial reduction, they lived on average until the same age as those retiring in normal health and the average age at which they qualified was 50, the reserves of the PPF in respect of deferred members would have to rise by approximately 2 per cent. The PPF estimate that such an increase would require an increase in the Pension Protection Levy from &#163;675 million by 10 per cent.</p>

 Following the intervention of the right hon. Member for Witney the trustees of the Earlys of Witney Pension Scheme were contacted by the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) Operational Unit. Subsequently a DWP official contacted an individual member of the scheme to provide information about the FAS, and issued the standard form to return to the Financial Assistance Scheme Operational Unit. The individual subsequently decided not to pursue a claim for assistance, and I am told this was because he was awaiting an appeal judgment in court.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> Following the review of Remploy last year by PriceWaterhouse Coopers, we asked the Remploy Board to bring forward a five-year restructuring plan both to modernise the business and to support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into work, ensuring that there would be no compulsory redundancies of disabled employees, and that their full terms and conditions&#151;including rights to final salary pensions&#151;would be protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="71029w0040.htm_para12"><a name="07103022001483">The Secretary of State has now requested a final report from the Remploy board on the modernisation of the company, no later than 12 November 2007. We recognise that despite substantial progress, significant issues remain unresolved. Nonetheless, these remaining differences can and should be bridged. We continue to believe that a negotiated settlement represents the best outcome for Remploy.</p>

 At July 2007, &#163;264.3 million was outstanding in social fund loans to beneficiaries no longer in receipt of benefits from which deductions can be made. This figure is, generally speaking, obviously inversely proportional to success rates in moving customers off benefits and into work</p>

This transfer will be completed by the end of March 2008. This will ensure that Debt Management&#146;s specialist skills and technology can be used to the best effect to recover these loans.</p>

The overall aim of the Department&#146;s anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment.
