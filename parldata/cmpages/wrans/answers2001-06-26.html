<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Palmer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what decision has been taken on the future of the Defence Diversification Agency following the recent period of consultation.  [1167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We have been greatly encouraged by the response to the consultation on the future of the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) and were particularly pleased by the many words of encouragement and support for the agency and its work. We continue to support a strong UK defence industry and recognise fully the significant role it plays in our wider industrial base. It was for these reasons we set up the DDA with three key aims: to extend technology and expertise within the defence sector to civilian use; to foster partnerships and joint development programmes, recognising that the civil sector has much of potential benefit to defence; and to inform and assist the defence industry's own diversification planning.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para14">We intend that the DDA should continue to be a highly effective technology broker and achieve its aims in support of our overall defence diversification strategy. We believe that to do this successfully, the DDA must remain part of the defence community. But it cannot remain as part of the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) as now because of the planned public-private partnership. MOD's strategy of putting an increasing proportion of its research work outside of QinetiQ (as the new company will be known) and the Defence Scientific and Technology Laboratory (Dstl; the retained part of DERA) means that DDA would, in the longer term, be poorly 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2001 : Column: 58W</I><P>
placed if wholly located in either. There is also the need to ensure commercial confidentiality and fairness to all defence research suppliers.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para15">We have decided to bring the DDA into the Ministry of Defence head office. Existing DDA technology development managers will be transferred in their current locations to QinetiQ and Dstl. This recognises that QinetiQ and Dstl will remain our major suppliers of defence research for some time and, importantly, this option commanded the highest level of support from the DDA staff themselves. It will also have the benefit of allowing us to retain DDA's existing regional structure and thus ensuring that the existing close links are maintained with both the defence technology base and local business communities.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para16">Once we have experience of how the DDA will operate in practice under the new structure, we will proceed with determining the appropriate composition and terms of reference for the Defence Diversification Council.

<a name="10626w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the overseas recruitment missions that have taken place over the last six months and which are planned over the next year, indicating in each case <i>(a)</i> the country (i) visited and (ii) to be visited, <i>(b)</i> the number of overseas nationals (i) recruited and (ii) expected to be recruited and <i>(c)</i> the cost of the mission; and if he will make a statement.  [228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Recruits to the UK armed forces must be British or Commonwealth citizens or Republic of Ireland nationals. Overseas recruitment missions are limited to those locations where numbers of expected applicants justify the effort.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para17">A visit to St. Helena, which has generated some 40 applicants in each of the last two years, is currently taking place. Costs are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para18">An Army visit is being planned for later in the year to St. Lucia, from where 1,400 applications have been received. The cost of the visit is estimated at around &#163;100,000.
<P>

<a name="10626w01.html_para19">No other recruiting visits have taken place in the last six months or are currently planned in the next 12 months.

<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what requests were received by his Department regarding the use of Ministry of Defence vehicles during the bid to host the 2006 World Cup;  [130]
<P>
<UL>(2) what use was made, and at what cost to public funds, of Ministry of Defence vehicles during the bid to host the 2006 World Cup.  [129]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> In mid-1999, the Ministry of Defence received a request from the FA World Cup 2006 Campaign Manager for the use of 32 (The Royal) Squadron aircraft to transport members of the FIFA Inspection Delegation Team for World Cup 2006 to various football grounds and airfields during their inspection of facilities, scheduled for October 1999.




<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2001 : Column: 59W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_para0">Between 22 October 1999 and 25 October 1999, members of the FIFA Inspection Delegation Team for World Cup 2006 used aircraft of 32 (The Royal) Squadron for approximately 19 hours at a cost of &#163;22,957.
<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_para1">Similarly, between 24 April 2000 and 10 June 2000, members of the FIFA Executive Committee used aircraft of 32 (The Royal) Squadron for approximately 17 hours at a cost of &#163;60,879.
<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_para2">In each case, the costs were initially met by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which was subsequently reimbursed in full by the Football Association Campaign Team. There was therefore no cost incurred by public funds, save minimal invoicing and administrative costs.

 The new CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions-based system of company car tax comes into effect from April 2002. It has been the subject of extensive consultation since proposals were first announced in Budget 1999. The Inland Revenue has received few recent representations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government announced an Independent Review of the law on gambling on 8 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 534W, and the Review Body's term of reference on 16 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 537W. We expect to receive its report shortly. We will give it careful consideration before deciding what changes to make to the legislation.
<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_para5">We will also take account of this report when we consider how to progress the regulatory reform proposals for modernising the methods of payment in gaming machines which were set out in a Home Office consultation paper in March 2001, and the proposals for changes to the law on bingo clubs which were considered in the last session by the Deregulation Committees of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will publish the most up to date figures available on the number of playing fields sold by public bodies since 1 May 1997.  [229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Information on the number of playing fields sold by public bodies since 1 May 1997 is not available. Sport England does, however, monitor the number of planning applications concerning playing fields in their role as statutory consultee.
<P>

<a name="10626w02.html_para6">The amendment to Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act in October 1998, which was brought in to halt the previous Administration's policy of forcing schools to sell off playing fields, has introduced powers that require all state schools to seek consent for the sale of playing fields from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. In making her decision my right hon. Friend will take into account a number of criteria including consultation with the community and user groups, whether the proceeds will be used for education or used to enhance or improve sports provision, and whether the remaining playing fields fully meet the needs for local schools and the community. My right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State for Education and Employment gave approval for the sale of 26.4 acres of school playing fields in England in 1998; 111.2 acres in 1999; and 60.9 acres in 2000. In many cases such approval will only involve the sale of part of a playing field (which will not affect the sporting use), or even no sale at all, as it is reused for another sporting use.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research the Cabinet Office has undertaken to measure progress in recognising and improving diversity in the civil service.  [1223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I have today published two reports, one on the Civil Service Diversity Survey and the other a research report on "Equality in performance review in the Civil Service".
<P>

<a name="10626w03.html_para0">The diversity survey was conducted across the service to measure staff perception and experiences of working in the civil service in order to track progress on meeting objectives on civil service modernisation, diversity and equal opportunities. The research on equality in performance review was undertaken across six Departments, following an earlier research study on differences in performance markings between groups of staff.
<P>

<a name="10626w03.html_para1">The diversity survey identified the civil service as a good employer, with high ambitions as part of the civil service reform programme. The equality in performance review research suggests small but statistically significant differences in performance appraisal box markings between ethnic minority and white staff, disabled and able-bodied staff and men and women, and the research suggests underlying causes for this. These projects demonstrate the commitment of the civil service to continue to make progress to becoming truly diverse.
<P>

<a name="10626w03.html_para2">I have placed copies of both reports in the Libraries of both Houses.

 The Department of Health reviews all PFI projects through the Business Case approval system. To be approved, the Business Case must clearly demonstrate that, overall, the private finance option is better value for money when compared to the publicly funded alternative, the Public Sector Comparator (PSC), and that it provides improved facilities for the NHS. NHS Trusts are required to monitor performance throughout the lifetime of the PFI contract.

<a name="10626w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department has not made any recent comparative investigations across health authorities into the provision of health visitors based on the number of children under five years of age. Local health improvement programmes include an assessment of the health needs of local populations, and the funding of primary care group investment plans is aligned with priorities identified by the local health improvement plan. It is the responsibility of local health providers to plan their own staffing requirements to meet local need accordingly. Primary care groups and trusts have huge potential to improve people's health and prevent illness, which includes providing appropriate health visiting services.

 The rates and numbers of self-inflicted prisoner deaths at Winchester prison and establishments in England and Wales as a whole, are set out in the table. The Prison Service's new suicide prevention strategy targets prisoners most at risk in the types of prisons, mostly locals, where the risk of suicides is highest. There is an early focus on pilots in five establishments--including Winchester--with a range of changes that include physical improvements to reception and induction areas and more first night support centres and safe cells.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he will publish the report of the Quinquennial Review of Her Majesty's Land Registry.  [1103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10626w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has today published the Report on the Quinquennial Review of HM Land Registry. HM Land Registry is a Government Department established in 1862 for which the Lord Chancellor is the responsible Minister. In 1990 it was launched as an executive agency and granted Trading Fund status in 1993.
<P>

<a name="10626w09.html_para11">I would like to thank the reviewer, Andrew Edwards CB, for conducting such a thorough review and for his most comprehensive Report. The Review has found that public confidence in land and property ownership depends on HM Land Registry's ability to guarantee title and to deliver its services impartially. For these reasons the Review finds that HM Land Registry should remain in the public sector as a Government Department, an executive agency and a trading fund; while continuing the significant amount of work in partnership with the private sector that it currently undertakes. The Government accept the Review's conclusions on HM Land Registry's

<P><I>26 Jun 2001 : Column: 85W</I><P>
continued public sector status and the Lord Chancellor has now asked officials to take forward the review of HM Land Registry's Framework Document.
<P>

<a name="10626w09.html_para12">I note that the Review makes wide-ranging proposals for the enhancement of the Land Register and for improvement in the operation of the property market in England and Wales. It also provides a timely contribution to the debate on the future of e-conveyancing and land registration services. While some of the recommendations are consistent with programmes of reform already under way, others are more radical and wide-ranging. The Lord Chancellor has therefore asked officials from his Department and HM Land Registry to examine the recommendations carefully with officials from other interested Government Departments. Together with colleagues, we will wish to assess the more wide-ranging and radical proposals, including, in particular, their implications for, and impact on, other Government

initiatives, before reaching conclusions on the best way forward in this important area. The Lord Chancellor intends to publish in the autumn a plan for taking forward the wider recommendation contained in the Report once this more detailed consideration has been completed.
<P>

<a name="10626w09.html_para13">Copies of the Report and a summary of its recommendations have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
