<a name="00707w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to promote the use of liquid petroleum gas in cars.  [128276]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a number of measures to promote the wider use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in recognition of the fuel's environmental benefits. The Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme, which is funded by my Department, provides grants towards the additional cost of vehicles fuelled by LPG. Funding for this programme was increased to &#163;10 million following the last Budget. LPG and other road gas fuels also benefit from a relatively low rate of fuel duty compared to petrol and diesel. From 1 March 2001, Vehicle Excise Duty for new cars will be graduated on the basis of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. Under the new scheme, LPG cars will benefit both from a modest discount and from generally having lower CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions than equivalent petrol cars. The Government are currently consulting on further tax discounts under the new company car tax regime, which comes into effect from 6 April 2002, for gas and electric cars.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress he has made in recovering the regeneration grant awarded to the Walton Group in respect of Exchange Flags Liverpool; and if he will make a statement.  [128635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under section 175 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, the Secretary of State appointed the Urban Regeneration Agency ("English Partnerships") to act as his agent in respect of the agreement to pay a City Grant to the Walton Group for the refurbishment of the Exchange Flags building, Liverpool. In that capacity English Partnerships carried out a review of the project and are pressing for repayment of the grant.

<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of current arrangements for monitoring homelessness in England.  [128895]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local housing authorities in England make quarterly and annual returns to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions of data concerning their activities under the homelessness legislation. They also provide annually an estimate of the number of people sleeping rough in their area on any one night in June. The extent of the rough sleeping problem in England is monitored through single-night street counts, co-ordinated by local authorities and carried out in partnership with the local voluntary sector and volunteers. We are satisfied that these arrangements provide an effective means of monitoring homelessness in England. The Government currently have no plans to introduce common arrangements for monitoring homelessness throughout the UK.

<a name="00707w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the arrangements for reviewing homelessness decisions made by local authorities under sections 202 and 203 of the Housing Act 1996; and if he will make a statement;  [128905]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many reviews were undertaken by authorities of decisions taken under section 202 of the Housing Act 1996 in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98, <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 and <i>(c)</i> 1999-2000 in each local authority area.  [128906]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We will consider the effectiveness of the current arrangements for local housing authorities' review of homelessness decisions when we take forward the proposals for reform of the homelessness legislation set out in the Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all". Information about the number of reviews undertaken by local authorities is not held centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to seek amendments to the provisions of Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 relating to intentional homelessness; and if he will make a statement.  [128904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all", sets out the Governments proposals for introducing more choice for existing and prospective tenants of social housing and for strengthening the protection available to homeless people. The Paper suggests that it may be possible to modify the rules of intentional homelessness if these proposals were adopted. The Government will consider responses to the Green Paper before deciding whether to take this forward, and would wish to discuss any proposals with representatives of local government, Shelter and others before introducing amending legislation.

<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The present franchise for the West Coast main line is not due to be replaced until 9 March 2012. When replacing franchises, the Franchising Director will be seeking to improve services to passengers and improvements in performance. Boarding times at stations are an operational matter for Train Operating Companies and it is not envisaged that they will be the subject of specific franchise requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received about making the level of on-board service a condition of franchise renewal for the West Coast main line.  [129600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has not received any representations about making the level of on-board service a condition of franchise renewal for the West Coast Main Line. The present franchise for the West Coast Main Line is not due to be replaced until 9 March 2012. This franchise, in common with all the other passenger rail franchises, does not contain any provisions stipulating which on-board services must be provided. It is not envisaged that there will be any such provisions in any of the replacement franchises.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will ensure that, where a new franchise is awarded by the Strategic Rail Authority, the performance standards in the new franchise agreement are applied during the unexpired period of the old franchise agreement;  [129687]
<P>
<UL>(2) what powers the Strategic Rail Authority has to ensure a smooth and rapid transfer when it awards a new franchise to a company different from the one currently providing the service and the existing company decides to continue until its contract expires.  [129705]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This would be a matter for negotiation between the Franchising Director and the existing and potential franchisees. In the event of failure to agree transfer arrangements in advance of expiry of the existing franchise, the existing franchisee would be obliged to continue to honour its contractual commitments.

Copies of the study have been placed in the Vote Office and the Libraries. I asked the PIU to provide an initial assessment of the main problem areas, identify options and make recommendations to the Government on the use of adoption for children in the care of local authorities. The report contains a range of options for promoting greater use of adoption, and for making it faster and more straightforward. To ensure that there is the fullest possible debate on this issue, the report is published for consultation. In the light of views expressed in consultation we will then publish a White Paper before the end of the year setting out the Government's new approach to adoption, and including proposals for new legislation, to be introduced next year.

former Rhodesian civil servants. That constitution guarantees the continued payment of pensions to former Zimbabwe public servants, wherever they reside. Occasionally, there have been delays in pension payments being made as a result of shortages in foreign exchange, but, these apart, the Government of Zimbabwe have consistently honoured their obligations. There is no provision in the Constitution to protect the value of externally paid pensions against the effects of fluctuating exchange rates.

 I have frequent exchanges with Commissioners Nielson and Patten about EC aid to developing countries. It is in sore need of reform. We are working for full implementation of our detailed strategy (a copy of which is in the Library of the House) which requires the European Commission and other EU member states radically to improve the poverty focus and effectiveness of EC development assistance. There is a growing commitment to reform. The reduced number of Commissioners responsible for development, the improvements incorporated in the renegotiation of the Lome convention and the recently published strategy for development are significant advances, but implementation of the promised reform remains to be achieved.

 The general issue of the role of development assistance in countries in conflict has been discussed frequently, most recently at the informal meeting of European Community Development Ministers in Lisbon in January, which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State attended. Further discussion was also held during part of a seminar held in Paris, jointly hosted by the French and Portuguese Development Ministers, on 30 June. The position in a number of specific countries, notably Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia and Eritrea, was discussed at the meeting of the Development Council on 18 May.
<P>

<a name="00707w03.html_para0">All development programmes, including the European Community's, need to develop more effective methods for targeting development assistance to countries in conflict. The UK and other member states have urged the Commission to undertake work in this area. Provisions on the issue of peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution were included in the new EU-ACP Cotonou Agreement. The Commission are currently developing guidelines to help officials design programmes that address potential sources of conflict.

<P>

<a name="00707w03.html_para1">The report shows that there has been progress in broadening the diversity of Fast Stream recruits. In particular, for the first time the Civil Service has reached parity in the numbers of successful men and women applicants to open Fast Stream schemes. The standard of entry to the Fast Stream Development Programme has remained consistently high. In line with the experience of other major employers, the Civil Service did not fill all its Fast Stream vacancies in 1999, with specialist areas a particular source of concern.

<i>Note:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is taken from HA Annual Accounts which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in each year. (These are not the total amounts spent on healthcare. General Dental Services expenditure is separately accounted for and cannot be analysed by health authority over the three years). Also, since 1997-98 drugs expenditure has been mainly accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. For consistency, figures have been reduced by the amount of non-cash limited prescribing expenditure accounted for by the health authority in each year.<P>

2. However, there are a number of other reasons why the figures shown cannot be directly compared between years and between health authorities. These will include:<P>

(a) Non medical education and training expenditure (NMET); some authorities account for NMET on behalf of local consortia, and those HAs will have different levels of NMET funding over different years;<P>

(b) The levels of non-recurrent allocations (such as strategic assistance) will have varied between years and authorities;<P>

(c) The differential impact of cash limited prescribing, eg as a result of differential levels of general practitioner fundholding;<P>

(d) Services (eg HIV/AIDS) that are accounted for on a district of treatment basis will distort the expenditure per capita figures which are based on resident populations;<P>

(e) Changes in accounting policy over the years;<P>

(f) There could also be different interpretations by auditors which may affect direct comparison; and<P>

(g) Changes in the weighted population figures between years.<P>

3. The expenditure per weighted head figures in the answer do not therefore reflect real changes in the resources available for spend on healthcare locally over the period or provide robust comparisons between HAs.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> Eighty- seven major hospital developments (over &#163;25 million at current prices) have taken place and become operational since 1980. Details are set out in the table. The low figure for 1999 is a consequence of the small number of major hospital developments which started during 1996 and 1997. This was due to all major developments having to test for private funding during this time.
<P>

<a name="00707w07.html_para0">Since 1 May 1997, 38 major hospital developments worth over &#163;3.1 billion have been given the go ahead. The introduction of the private finance initiative into the National Health Service capital building programme will result in a dramatic increase in the number of major hospital developments in future years. The first of these developments, the new hospital at Carlisle, was officially opened on 16 June 2000.

 Our proposals for modernising National Health Service pay, which were published in February 1999 in "Agenda for Change", include bringing some groups of highly qualified staff within the scope of the Nursing Pay Review Body (NRPB), without changing its fundamentally professional character.

 We have no plans to appoint a children's commission for England, although as our response to the Waterhouse Report made clear, we are keeping this matter under review. In the meantime, we have already embarked on a major programme to improve children's services and strengthen the safeguards protecting children from abuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact on army training of the delay in making improvements to the Otterburn ranges; and if he will make a statement.  [129134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> In 1995 my Department submitted a Notice of Proposed Development (NOPD) to the Northumberland National Park Association for the redevelopment of infrastructure at Otterburn Training Area (OTA). This redevelopment is essential to enable training of AS90 and MLRS units at regimental level. This remains an absolute requirement that cannot occur anywhere else in the UK. Since the NOPD was submitted our proposals have been thoroughly examined by two Public Inquiries (PI) and we are still awaiting the outcome.
<P>

<a name="00707w08.html_para3">As a result of our inability to develop OTA, AS90 and MLRS units have not been able to conduct the full range of special-to-arm training that is a necessary precursor to deploying with other formations on combined arms training. As a result, individual Brigades will not be trained sufficiently in all aspects of combined arms war fighting that would enable them to react to short notice operational deployments world wide, as envisaged under the Strategic Defence Review. This has direct consequence for our ability to meet readiness liabilities for the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF).
<P>

<a name="00707w08.html_para4">The results of the Public Inquiries are currently being considered by the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions and I am hopeful that a decision will be forthcoming later this year. If our application is successful and allowing time for the necessary construction work on the training area, we expect that AS90 and MLRS units will be able to commence manoeuvre training at Otterburn in 2004.

This, if implemented, should extend the engine life and reduce support costs. The change would be practically invisible to the pilot and have no effect on tactical training. During all operational flying full thrust levels will be available.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 8 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 357W, on what occasions in the last 12 months the Government have received information on GM seed contamination incidents from EU member states; and what information was received.  [126818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w10.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> At the meeting of EU and EEA/EFTA seed certification agencies, on 2-5 May this year, Greece reported an incident involving the suspected adventitious presence of GM seed in conventional cotton seed.
<P>

<a name="00707w10.html_para11">Information on the recent discovery of GM rapeseed in conventional rapeseed has been shared between the affected member states.
<P>

<a name="00707w10.html_para12">Following reports in the French press last week that the French authorities have discovered low levels of GM presence in conventional maize seed imported into France, we contacted the French authorities, who confirmed on 30 June that they had indeed found some GM seed in conventional maize seed, which has been sown in South West France. Further information now indicates that they have found three different modifications in a number of varieties of forage maize imported into France by the company Golden Harvest. The French authorities have not yet confirmed which varieties of maize seed are involved, but have confirmed that sweetcorn varieties are not affected by their current investigations. We are seeking further information from them on the varieties concerned. However, as the varieties concerned are cultivated in Southern France, it is possible that they would be unsuitable for cultivation in UK conditions.
<P>

<a name="00707w10.html_para13">The GMs found in maize samples by the French authorities are BT 176 and BT 11, and one further, as yet unidentified, modification. BT 176 is insect resistant and has Part C consent within the EU under Directive 90/220 for import, food and feed use, and for cultivation. BT 11 is insect resistant and has Part C consent for import and use in animal feed. Pending further information from the French authorities, my Department, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Food Standards Agency are considering what the implications would be should further investigations indicate that affected seed might have been sown in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00707w11.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> In general terms, all pig producers who can show they were involved in commercial pig breeding in June 1998 are eligible to take part in the outgoers element of the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme. There may, however, be further conditions applied as a result of the recently concluded consultation exercise on this part of the scheme and by the terms of the European Commission's clearance document.

<a name="00707w11.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> As things stand, the eligibility criteria for the outgoers element of the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme is that applicant must be able to show they were involved in commercial pig breeding in June 1998, that they have pig breeding facilities to destroy or dismantle and that they are prepared to enter into binding undertakings to cease pig production for a minimum of 10 years. These criteria may, however, change as a result of the recently concluded consultation exercise on this part of the scheme or to comply with the views of the European Commission. The final terms of the scheme will be announced following European Commission clearance.

 We remain of the opinion that the "no change" policy is an essential part of our strategy. It is designed to be a disincentive to those who intend using the asylum process for economic migration.

 I understand that, at the end of May, the total number of eligible cases awaiting allocation to a case review manager was 899. The kind of breakdown requested is not readily available from the Criminal Cases Review Commission's current management information system, though it will be from a new system that is expected to be in use by the end of August.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what effect the recent increase of case review managers for the Criminal Cases Review Commission has had on the waiting time for allocation to a case review manager; and if he will make a statement.  [128607]<P>
<P>

 It is not yet possible to say. The Commission was notified at the end of March that it would be given additional funding for 2000-01, and allowed to increase its complement of case review managers from 40 to 50. I understand that the Commission has recently completed a recruitment exercise, but that the successful applicants have not yet all taken up post, and further recruitment will anyway be necessary to bring the number of case review managers up to complement. The impact of 



<P>

these additional staff on the waiting time for the allocation of cases will also depend on the nature of the cases to be allocated to them, and the rate of receipt of applications.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason the remaining cases held in Croydon of asylum applicants whose claim falls to be considered under the concession announced in the White Paper, have been transferred to the Asylum Arrears Group at the Nationality Directorate in Liverpool; and what effect this has had on the time taken to make decisions on those claims.

<P>
<a name="00707w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> The average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced at Barnet magistrates court is estimated to have been 100 days in the period April 1999 to March 2000. This estimate is based on data collated by the Lord Chancellor's Department. It is calculated from the average time from charge to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced at Barnet magistrates court between April 1999 and March 2000 and on the police force level results of a survey on the average time between arrest and charge for persistent young offenders dealt with in 1999. The figure excludes any cases that were dealt with at Barnet magistrates court but were committed to the Crown Court for trial or sentence. It is based on only 19 sentencing occasions and therefore should be interpreted cautiously.
