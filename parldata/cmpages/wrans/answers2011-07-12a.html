 âCreating Strong, Safe and Prosperous Communitiesâ was prescriptive around how local authorities should agree their priorities, engage their citizens, lead their communities and commission public services.

In this context, we recently consulted on light touch statutory guidance on the best value duty setting out some reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with voluntary and community groups and small businesses when facing difficult funding decisions. The consultation closed on 14 June and we expect to provide a government response and publish final guidance this summer.</p>

In addition to putting in place fiscal incentives for local authorities to develop housing, in the form of the New Homes Bonus and the reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, the Government are also accelerating the release of public sector land, investing Â£4.5 billion to help deliver over 150,000 new affordable homes and, together with house-builders, providing around Â£400 million for the new First Buy scheme, which will help nearly 10,500 first time buyers to buy a new build property over the next two years. While introducing incentives we are also abolishing top-down Regional Strategies through the Localism Bill. Together, this package of measures will enable people in all areas of the country, including south east Dorset, to support and shape future housing development.</p>

 The Government recognise that where problems arise over leaseholders' homesâespecially about the actions of managing agentsâthese can cause real inconvenience and, in some cases, lead to significant distress. The law therefore provides leaseholders with a wide range of rights in order to avoid these disputes or, where they arise, to enable them to be resolved. These include the right to ask for service charge information and to see supporting documentation.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr Pickles), has announced his intention to repeal the duty to involve. Repeal requires primary legislation; therefore until it is repealed via legislation, it remains a duty.</p>

In this context, we recently consulted on light touch statutory guidance on the Best Value duty setting out some reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with voluntary and community groups and small businesses when facing difficult funding decisions. The consultation closed on 14 June and we expect to provide a Government response and publish final guidance this summer.</p>

The screening showed that new best value guidance will balance out any possible equality impacts arising from the loss of the duty since it supplements the existing duty to consult under best value and underlines support for voluntary and community sector organisations. It will strengthen the role of voluntary and community sector groups in terms of engagement, funding and potentially running public services. It will also give greater freedom to councils to respond to local rather than central priorities and expand the scope of councils to collaborate with small businesses and voluntary and community sector organisations.</p>

The recently published Dairy Roadmap sets targets for waste recycling and recovery for both farmers and processers, and on amounts of recyclate used in packaging for retailers. Part two of The English Beef and Sheep Production Roadmap also looks at waste and efficiency issues through supply chains, extending the work begun on greenhouse gases in part one.

However, research undertaken in 2009 by the Transport Research Laboratory for the Department for Transport included a biomechanical assessment of over 100 police forensic reports on cyclist fatalities and estimated that 10% to 16% of the fatalities could have been prevented if the cyclist had worn an appropriate cycle helmet.

On 30 March 2011 the Department for Transport published a scoping document that frames the debate on the future direction of aviation policy and asks a series of questions, including on regional airports. The responses to the scoping document will help to inform the development of a draft framework, which we intend to publish for full public consultation in March 2012.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
3. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.
4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable.
6. Weekly incomes are presented in 2009-10 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound.

1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
 2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
3. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.
 4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable.
6. Weekly incomes are presented in 2009/10 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound.
7. Families are defined as a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children, including same sex couples (civil partnerships and cohabitees) from January 2006. A household is made up of one of more families and is defined as a single person or group of people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one meal a day together or share the living accommodation (i.e. a living room). In line with the wording of the question, analysis has been carried out at the family level.

 The headline youth unemployment figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) cover the UK. These show the number of 16 to 24-year-olds unemployed on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition in February to April 2011 was 895,000, a fall of 35,000 over the last year. Nearly a third of unemployed young people are full-time students; the number not in full-time education and unemployed is 618,000, down 30,000 on the year. The latest unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-oldsâthe number unemployed as a proportion of the active labour forceâis 19.3%.</p>

The latest data, covering January to December 2010, show a 16 to 24 ILO unemployment level of 738,000 in England and an unemployment rate of 19.2%. In the west midlands the level is 83,000, an unemployment rate of 21.2%. In Dudley there are around 6,000 unemployed people, an unemployment rate of 22.5%.</p>

The following table shows the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) in England, the west midlands and Dudley over the last 12 months. These figures are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuation so month-on-month changes should not be seen as an indication of the underlying trend. Comparing the latest May 2011 data with the same month last year suggests the number of JSA claimants aged 18 to 24 has fallen in England and the west midlands and risen in Dudley.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated assistance for capacity-building at all levels of government. All DFID-funded development programmes in South Sudan contribute to capacity-building and one, the Capacity-building Trust Fund, focuses entirely on this objective. A precise breakdown by level of government is not possible as programmes often operate at more than one level.</p>

 We are deeply concerned about the situation of civilians displaced by the recent fighting in the Abyei region. At present, lack of access to the conflict affected areas and populations hinders accurate humanitarian needs assessment by humanitarian personnel, but the current UN assessment is of about 100,000 people displaced. We are working with the United Nations to ensure that if security and access is granted, assistance will reach these displaced civilians. The UN has reserves of both shelter and food for such situations. As well as its ongoing support to the Common Humanitarian Fund, the UK has made an additional Â£10 million available for contingency planning to respond to any emergencies that are linked to southern secession.</p>

 The UK has strongly supported UN Women from the outset, lobbying hard for its creation, providing transitional funding as it established itself and agreeing to a senior staff secondment. Following adoption of UN Women's strategic plan on 30 June the UK will provide Â£10 million in core funding to UN Women for each of the next two years. This will help UN Women achieve results for girls and women that include helping 15 countries adopt legislation to tackle domestic violence, supporting efforts to allow women to participate in political decision-making in 25 countries and holding the UN system to account on gender equality.</p>

 Under the law of negligence, if a person has been injured as a result of the negligence of another person, he or she is entitled to recover compensation for the injury. If cases come to court, the claimant must provide evidence of the injury suffered in order to satisfy the court that the claim is justified. Restricting the ability to claim in relation to a particular type of injury could lead to injustice where people who have suffered a genuine injury as a direct result of another's negligence are prevented from recovering compensation.</p>

 Recent reports suggest that violence is continuing in many parts of Southern Kordofan. There are reports of aerial attacks by Sudanese armed forces; of abuses against civilians carried out by soldiers from both sides; and of innocent civilians being caught up in the violence. The British Government condemns the ongoing violence and calls all parties to cease hostilities immediately. The recent Framework Agreement on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile is a step in the right direction but must lead to a ceasefire without delay, so that humanitarian aid can reach those in need, and talks on the future of Southern Kordofan can take place without continuing violence.</p>

<i>Note:</i>
Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates, are described as follows:
<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CVâfor example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 = CV&lt;5%âStatistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 = CV &lt;10%âStatistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 = CV &lt;20%âStatistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ? 20%âStatistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation

 The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Cancellation of Contracts made in a Consumer's Home or Place of Work etc. Regulations 2008 provide consumers with a cooling-off period of seven days for consumers purchasing most goods and services at a distance or away from business premises. It is proposed that the new EU consumer rights directive will extend these cooling-off periods to 14 days. This will be implemented into UK law.</p>

 There is no country to which the UK would not return those with no right to stay in the UK. However situations may arise in relation to any country, where practical barriers temporarily prevent actual removals from taking place. Each asylum and human rights claim is considered on its individual merits in accordance with our international obligations and taking full account of conditions in the country concerned as they impact on the individual. Those found to be in need of international protection are provided with it. Failed asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national prisoners of all nationalities who have been found by the Home Office and the appeals process not to be in need of international protection and have no legal basis of stay in the UK, are expected to return to their country of origin and may have their removal enforced if they do not leave voluntarily.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 11 July 2011]:</i> Foreign identity cards are not currently accepted as evidence of identity for taking the Life in the UK test. This is largely because of the large number and variety of foreign documents that University for Industry (Ufi) staff would need to be familiar with in order to ensure effective verification. The vast majority of those taking the Life in the UK test are able to provide another valid form of identity.</p>

Extra guidance for the recording of sexual offences was formally incorporated into the Home Office Counting Rules from 1 April 2010. However, some forces were following the new guidance prior to this date, reflecting good practice that the Association of Chief Police Officers had been promoting within forces before this formal implementation.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> The number of rape offences shown in the table need to be interpreted with caution. In the 24 month period for which data are provided, it is known that police forces took additional steps to improve their recording of sexual offences, including rape. This may be reflected in the increases in rape offences seen in the data. Extra guidance for the recording of sexual offences was formally incorporated into the Home Office Counting Rules from 1 April 2010. However, some forces were following the new guidance prior to this date, reflecting good practice that the Association of Chief Police Officers had been promoting within forces before this formal implementation.

We will continue our efforts to identify opportunities to eliminate any unnecessary burden on businesses this year through full engagement with the âRed Tape Challengeâ.</p>

The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>

No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>

The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, the right hon.

It is the responsibility of admissions authorities to ensure that the admissions arrangements they set, having consulted with parents and others as specified in regulations, must comply with the code. Parents, local authorities and others as set out in regulations can refer any admissions arrangements they feel are unfair to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA). Currently for academies these objections are made to the Young Persons Learning Agency. In future, subject to clause 62 of the Education Bill, we intend to see all objections being made to the same body, the OSA. Local authorities have a duty, under the School Admissions Code, to refer any admissions arrangements they feel to be unfair or unlawful to the OSA.</p>

               <a name="1107131000952"> The Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), launched a full public consultation on proposed reforms to the codes and it is intended that a revised form of the codes, taking account of the consultation, will be made available for admission authorities to use from September 2011. Subject to the passage of the Education Bill, we anticipate bringing the final codes into force in early 2012. One of the proposals in the consultation is that we would wish to enable anyone who has concerns over the fairness of admission arrangements at any school, including academies, will be able to refer their objections to the OSA.</p>

Outstanding special schools, including those which focus on providing for children with autism, will be able to apply to become teaching schools, or members of teaching school partnerships, developing their own staff alongside staff in schools in their network and sharing their expertise. The Department will also help local networks of schools develop teachers with specialist skills, such as skills in teaching children with autism, who can be deployed across clusters of schools.</p>
