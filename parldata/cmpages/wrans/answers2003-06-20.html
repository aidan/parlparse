<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the actions his Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are taking to comply with the requirements of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002; whether he has made an estimate of the cost of compliance; and if he will make a statement.  [117709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My Department has recently commissioned independent specialist consultants to carry our asbestos surveys in all the buildings the Department occupies and manages. These surveys will provide us with up to date information on the location, type and, most importantly, the condition of asbestos. Appropriate risk assessments have also been carried out, asbestos control measures confirmed and a programme of regular reviews and updates has been scheduled.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para0">All these procedures are being incorporated into an updated Departmental Health and Safety Management Plan. This will incorporate specific job responsibilities for building safety managers to maintain asbestos registers, undertake appropriate reviews and risk assessments and address all other statutory requirements to effectively manage the risks from asbestos in departmental buildings. These measures are being progressed in cooperation with the Health and Safety Executive and will result in the Department complying fully with the new Regulations.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para1">Accurate costings for compliance with the new Regulations are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in which subjects <i>(a)</i> rural and <i>(b)</i> countryside issues feature in the National Curriculum at (i) primary and (ii) secondary level.  [119150]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Rural and countryside issues are covered within the National Curriculum through citizenship and geography.

<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para2">Through geography, a foundation subject studied by all pupils aged 5 to 14; pupils investigate different places and environments, including the countryside within the United Kingdom and abroad. Through citizenship, a statutory requirement in secondary schools from September 2002, pupils should be taught about the wider issues and challenges of global interdependence and responsibility, including sustainable development and Local Agenda 21. This gives teachers in rural schools the opportunity to incorporate issues of a rural nature in lessons.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para3">From October 2003, schools opting for Specialist School status in any one of the 10 specialisms will be able to build in a rural dimension into their chosen specialism. Target setting subjects, which schools may utilise as part of the rural dimension, include: GCSE Geography, GCSE Environmental Science, GCSE Rural and Agricultural Science, GNVQ or GCSE Leisure and Tourism and GNVQ Land and Environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 10 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 785W, on synthetic appliances, if he will list the international research over the last 30 years on which the teaching of phonics in the National Literary Strategy is based; how many schools have adopted the Jolly Phonics programme; and when he will publish the report on the seminar of 17 March 2003.  [119912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The teaching of phonics in the National Literacy Strategy (NLS) is based on a wide range of research, and can be found in Roger Beard's "Review of Research and Other Related Evidence", which is available on the Department for Education and Skills Standards website at: www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/literacy/publications
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para4">The Department does not collect information on the number of schools who have adopted the Jolly Phonics or any other commercial programme. Schools are able to choose from a range of phonics programmes, including the NLS Progression in Phonics, as well as other commercial schemes. It is up to individual schools and teachers to decide which scheme is most effective in meeting the needs of their pupils.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para5">The report on the phonics seminar of 17 March 2003 will be published shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 166W, on drink driving, what plans he has to amend police powers to allow evidential breath-testing at the roadside and to increase penalties; when he plans to introduce these changes; and if he will make a statement.  [119993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As stated in our Road Safety Strategy, the Government intend to create a power for police to carry out evidential breath-testing at the roadside. This measure requires primary legislation and will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para7">With regard to penalty changes, the Criminal Justice Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for an increase in the maximum penalty for causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs from 10 to 14 years' imprisonment. We are planning to implement further penalty changes referred to in the report on the Review of Road Traffic Penalties (July 2002), including those applying to repeat drink-drive offenders, when a suitable legislative opportunity arises.

 The Government support the movement of freight by rail and waterways as a key part of our sustainable distribution policy. The freight grants programme is a demand-led scheme, which encourages the movement of goods by these means.
<P>

<a name="30620w01.html_para8">Following the Transport Act 2000, the programme is administered by the Strategic Rail Authority (for rail freight) and by the Department for Transport (for inland waterways and sea freight). There is regular consultation between the Department and the SRA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much track access grant aid was paid to freight operators in each year since 1992 <i>(a)</i> at current prices and <i>(b)</i> at outturn prices, broken down by location of company.  [120075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Track Access Grants became available in 1994, with the first payment being made in 1996. The table below excludes grants made by the Scottish Executive, which is a matter for the Scottish parliament. Track Access Grant is awarded only to freight train operators, who operate throughout the network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]</i>: Enlargement will bring important benefits for developing countries. The new member states will take on EU partnership and co-operation agreements, and will therefore provide expanded access for developing countries under preferential and free trade arrangements, the EU's Generalised System of Preferences and the "Everything But Arms" scheme. Overall, enlargement will give access to a larger single market of up to half a billion people, with one set of rules and regulations applying throughout.
<P>

<a name="30620w02.html_para3">However, enlargement will not alter the conclusion that the CAP as it stands has a detrimental impact on developing countries. The government are committed to CAP reform as a key element towards their goal of a more sustainable agriculture. A fundamentally reformed and market-oriented CAP would benefit developing countries, as well as farmers, consumers, the environment, and taxpayers in both old and new EU member states.

Of that, about 20 per cent. by weight was sent for reuse or recycling. This report is currently being updated and revised figures will be available shortly.

<P>
<a name="30620w03.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I have asked officials to follow precisely this approach and I know they make considerable efforts to do so. It is a formal aim within Defra for all correspondence, reports and documentation to be written according to Plain English standards (allowing leeway in technical reports aimed at a specialist audience) and to avoid non-standard spelling. I have also asked officials to avoid use of initials except when they are in standard use, but this is even more difficult to achieve in practice. Publication of reports is carried out in line with Guidance on the Work of the Government Information Service.

<P>
<a name="30620w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The recommendations in this report were initially under consideration by an inter-departmental group of officials, formed in early 2002. However, this work has taken on a much broader context because of the agreement successfully reached last September at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) on the theme of sustainable consumption and production. The Government's intention now is to publish, later this summer, a strategic document on the broader WSSD theme. This will draw on the earlier work of the Performance and Innovation Unit on resource productivity, as well as on developments in the related areas of energy and waste, on which the PIU and then the Strategy Unit have also reported.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the quantified radioactive discharges, by terabecquerels, from Sellafield to <i>(a)</i> air and <i>(b)</i> water in each year from 1980 to date; and what the projected discharges are in each year to 2020.  [117422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]:</i> Liquid and aerial discharge data for the years 1980 to 2002 inclusive, is provided in the following tables. For liquid discharges, the total alpha plus total beta (excluding 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jun 2003 : Column 454W</I><P>
tritium) measurements in table 1 provide a simple indication of past and future discharges that is representative of the overall discharge. Tritium in liquid discharges, which has very low radiological toxicity, despite being high in quantitive terms, is shown separately in table 2.
<P>

<a name="30620w03.html_para0">For aerial discharges in table 3, the total alpha plus total beta measurements relate to particulate activity discharged to the atmosphere from the Sellafield site. In addition to the particulate activity there are low active radioactive gases and vapours discharged from the site which require specific sampling equipment dependent upon the gas to be measured. These measurements are separate from and in addition to the total alpha and total beta measurements and are provided in table 4 to give a more complete picture of past aerial discharges. Included in the gaseous measurements are the noble gases such as Krypton 85 and Argon 41 which are inert and consequently do not react with the environment through the normal pathways of rainwater or ground deposition. Their impact on man is through external exposure and as such their impact in terms of dose is relatively low, although in quantitive terms the discharges appear to be large.
<P>

<a name="30620w03.html_para1">The projected results of liquid discharges in tables 5 and 6 are reproduced from the UK's Strategy for Radioactive Discharges, 2001&#150;20, published in July 2002 and are shown as averaged 5-year predictions. Aerial projections are not currently available. These will be developed in the context of the first revision of the UK's Radioactive Discharges Strategy which is due to be published in 2005.

<a name="30620w04.html_para0">There are many hundreds of other incinerators for sewage sludge, hazardous waste, clinical waste, production waste from factories etc. In England and Wales, the larger plant generally is regulated by the Environment Agency and details of their locations are available on the Environment Agency's public register. Other plant, that is part of another process regulated by the Agency, may not be shown separately on the register. Smaller plant is regulated by local authorities. In Scotland all such plant are regulated by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

<P>

<a name="30620w04.html_para1">A new plant will need planning permission to start construction and a PPC permit to start operations. The table gives the number and status, as at 16 June 2003, of new Municipal Waste Incineration Plants in England and Wales. The table contains information shared with the Environment Agency by prospective applicants for pollution control permits. There may also be other planning applications or amendments which have been submitted to local authorities over which the Agency has not been consulted. The planning status may have been changed since the data were supplied.

 The Government are keen to see, where appropriate, a level playing field between industrial and provident societies and companies. We are currently examining our options for taking forward this agenda. However, in order to provide for a strategic, consistent and up-to-date approach between companies and societies, the Government believe that the general modernisation of industrial and provident society legislation in this area should be considered in the light of the planned major reform of company law, announced in the "Modernising Company Law" White Paper, published in July 2002.

 The Chancellor has received a number of representations from Members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents seeking confirmation that pensions will continue to be increased in line with the RPI. In his statement on 9 June the Chancellor confirmed that pensions and benefits and index-linked gilts would be calculated on exactly the same basis as now.

<P>
<a name="30620w04.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Treasury published a paper in October 1999, "The New Monetary Policy Framework", which assessed the performance of the new framework in its first two years. This analysis was updated in the book "Reforming Britain's Economic and Financial Policy&#151;Towards Greater Economic Stability", HM Treasury, published in 2002. In addition, the Government publishes regular commentary on, and analysis of, the performance of inflation and inflation expectations under the new monetary policy framework in Budget and Pre-Budget Reports. The analysis demonstrates that the

<a name="30620w04.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Treasury discussion paper "Fiscal stabilisation and EMU" discusses how the new fiscal rule could be set up if the UK were to join EMU. In his statement to Parliament on 9 June 2003, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, "to ensure stability inside the euro area we will consult on the case for an open letter system on fiscal policy and a new and additional fiscal rule." We intend to discuss the new fiscal rule with external experts. Given that decisions on how such consultation will be carried out have not yet been made, the draft answer quotes from the statement that "we will report on progress in the Budget next year"

<a name="30620w04.html_para4">"On past performance, UK business cycles have been much less compatible with the euro area average than has been the case in other countries such as Germany and France. There is some evidence that compatibility may have increased in recent years, reflecting greater macroeconomic stability in the UK and increased convergence between the business cycles of all the advanced economies. Over the last five years, the UK output gap cycle has been more correlated with the German cycle than that in the US..."

 Customs and Excise Law Enforcement South Region was created in April 2001, as an entity did not exist prior to April 2001. Law Enforcement changes its structure from time to time in order to meet new business challenges. Over the period in question there have been some changes to regional management structures in the South, which together with accounting constraints, mean that no exact correlation of data is possible.

<a name="30620w05.html_para0">For the fiscal year 2001&#150;02 the total spend on travel and subsistence for the Law Enforcement South Region was &#163;2.32 million, and covers the operations of all detection, intelligence and investigation officers.

<P>
<a name="30620w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2003]</i>: In recent years, the Presevo Valley in the south of Serbia and Montenegro (formerly Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) has experienced clashes between the Serbian security forces and armed extremist elements from the local ethnic Albanian community. The security situation has now improved following a peace settlement in May 2001, and a political process which has incorporated the Albanian minority more fully into local government.
<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para4">Tensions re-emerged in February this year when there were renewed attacks on Serbian security forces from ethnic Albanian extremists, largely based in eastern Kosovo. With the support of the international community, the Serbian authorities brought the situation under control. There remains an increased security forces presence in the region but the situation is currently calm and stable, with only occasional isolated incidents.
<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para5">Progress on refugee returns to southern Serbia has been good. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) estimates that 90 per cent. of ethnic Albanian internally displaced persons (IDPs) or refugees from Presevo have returned, 66 per cent. from Bujanovic district, and 70 per cent. from Medvedja district. The principal obstacle to further returns is the poor economic situation in the region. We have received no reports of destruction or illegal occupation of properties in any area of the PresevoValley.
<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para6">The Serb authorities, through the Serbian Government's Co-ordinating Body for Southern Serbia (SGCB), and the International Community continue in their efforts to consolidate the rule of law and multiethnic democracy in the region. There are no international peacekeeping forces in southern Serbia itself. KFOR maintains a presence in Kosovo and in Macedonia, which borders with the Presevo Valley.
<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para7">United Nations agencies, the OSCE and the European Union Monitoring Mission operate in southern Serbia, as well as a large number of NGOs. These include:American Refugee Committee (ARC); Development Alternatives Inc (DAI); International Rescue Committee (IRC); Medecins du Monde (MDM); Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF); Belgian Red

<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para8">The UK continues to take a close interest in the democratic development and the security situation in southern Serbia. We have contributed financial assistance to projects aimed at stabilising the region, including the OSCE's Multi-Ethnic Policing programme. The last visit by officials from the British Embassy in Belgrade took place on 19&#150;20 March 2003. We look forward to seeing progress in tackling the economic problems of the region, and in integrating ethnic Albanians more closely into the local state structures, both of which will help to stabilise the region further.

 We are concerned about recent reports of human rights abuses in Aceh. During my visit to Indonesia on 3&#150;4 June I stressed to the Indonesian Government the importance of their Armed Forces using proportionate force, respecting human rights and acting in accordance with international law. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary issued a joint press statement with the Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, on 20 May calling on the Indonesian Armed Forces to ensure full respect for human rights and to show maximum restraint while they carry out operations in Aceh.

 The UK, together with EU partners, supports Special Autonomy for Papua. We have encouraged the Indonesian Government fully to implement Special Autonomy as soon as possible.

<P>

<a name="30620w06.html_para12">President Megawati issued Presidential Instruction 01/2003 in January 2003, which says that Papua should be split into three provinces. It is not clear how this Instruction relates to the Special Autonomy package of 1 January 2002, but the Indonesian Government said in February 2003 that the Instruction and Special Autonomy do not contradict each other and that both can be implemented. We are seeking further clarification on this from the Indonesian Government.

The data do not demonstrate efficacy in depressive illness in this age group and show an increase in the risk of episodes of self-harm and potentially suicidal behaviour in the Seroxat group compared to placebo. Various analyses suggest that the risk of these events is between 1.5 and 3.2 times greater with Seroxat compared to placebo. On the basis of these data, the CSM has advised that Seroxat should not be used in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years to treat depressive illness.

<a name="30620w11.html_para15">The CSM formally reviewed the issue of suicidal behaviour with SSRIs most recently in December 2001 and concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to confirm a causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour, although an effect in a small high-risk population could not be ruled out. The CSM has advised that Seroxat is an effective treatment for adults with depressive illness and anxiety disorders and that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.
<P>

<a name="30620w11.html_para16">The expert working group of the CSM will examine urgently what implications, if any, these new findings from clinical trials in children have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs.

<a name="30620w11.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 A new expert group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has been convened to further review the safety of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and to ensure the advice in the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jun 2003 : Column 490W</I><P>
product information for both patients and prescribers is optimal for the safe use of these products. This group has been asked to examine what implications, if any, the CSM's recent advice on the use of Seroxat in children have for the use of Seroxat in adults and for other SSRIs. The timetable for the group's programme of work has been planned with a view to the availability of advice as promptly as possible, commensurate with a full and detailed consideration of the evidence including the experiences of patients. As part of its initial considerations, the group has advised on strengthened advice on side effects and withdrawal reactions for inclusion in the patient information leaflet on Seroxat. Product information for other SSRIs will also be considered.
<P>

<a name="30620w11.html_para17">The advice of the CSM, most recently in 2001, is that the benefits of Seroxat, when used in adults for licensed indications, outweigh the risks. Regulatory authorities world-wide have also taken a similar position. Depression and anxiety disorders are serious conditions that can cause severe suffering and are associated with an increased risk of suicide. The availability of effective treatments is critically important. In the absence of evidence indicating that the risks of using Seroxat in adults outweigh the benefits, it would be difficult to justify withdrawing the medicine from use.
<P>

<a name="30620w11.html_para18">The Yellow Card Scheme is recognised to be one of the best in the world in terms of the level of reporting, has a proven track record of identifying new drug safety hazards and enables the monitoring of all medicines, including Seroxat, in clinical use. The effectiveness of the Scheme is under continuous review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the CSM. From April 2003, the first phase of patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions via NHS Direct was introduced. When fully rolled out in England and Wales, this will enable the first hand experiences of patients to be utilised in the identification and assessment of drug safety issues. Other measures to further strengthen the Yellow Card Scheme include a new regional monitoring centre, established in Scotland last year and the inclusion of education on yellow card reporting in the training of nurse prescribers.

 The Home Office does not hold information on the number of Open Circuit Television (OCTV) systems acquired by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30620w12.html_para3">The cost comparison between an OCTV system and a conventional Close Circuit Television (CCTV) system is not straightforward owing to the differing natures of the two systems and reasons for their use. An OCTV system comprising of a Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) camera and computerised monitoring station will cost in the order of &#163;12,000 (+VAT and delivery etc.). A typical single camera CCTV system will cost anything between &#163;8,000 and &#163;30,000 to purchase and install. On running costs, the OCTV system will incur mobile telephone call charges plus any standing charges. The CCTV system will possibly incur leasing fees for the transmission network.

<a name="30620w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 June 2003]:</i> The Government are working to ensure that GATS offers real benefits both to the UK, as the world's second largest exporter of services, and to developing country members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We believe that the progressive, properly managed, liberalisation of services can stimulate economic growth and help reduce poverty. The World Bank estimates that a liberalising trade round could bring 300 million people out of poverty by 2015. Developing countries could increase their annual income by up to $60 billion for a relatively modest degree of services liberalisation. This is greater than total annual aid flows to developing countries ($50 billion).

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the <i>(a)</i> UK and <i>(b)</i> EU priorities for the Fifth World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September are.  [119004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w14.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2003]:</i> The mid-Round Ministerial Conference in Cancun is our main opportunity to provide increased political momentum towards a successful outcome to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by the current target of 1 January 2005.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para11">The UK and EU priority for Cancun is to seek an outcome which keeps all aspects of the DDA negotiations on track and within the single undertaking.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para12">As part of the DDA we are determined to reform agricultural trade, as agreed at Doha, by substantially improving market access, substantially reducing trade distorting domestic farm support and reducing, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, which do so much harm to developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para13">On market access for non-agricultural goods we will be seeking significantly improved access market by tackling high tariffs, tariff peaks, tariff escalation and non-tariff barriers, in order to significantly increase trading opportunities for all WTO members, including between developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para14">We are hopeful that the services negotiations will bring considerable market opportunities for business as well as benefits to consumers world-wide. However, we 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jun 2003 : Column 501W</I><P>
are not seeking general deregulation or privatisation of sectors where principles of public interest are at stake, such as healthcare, education and the provision of water.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para15">We are committed to finding solutions to justified developing countries' concerns about implementation of existing WTO agreements, to their proposals for specific actions for Special and Differential Treatment and to providing trade-related assistance to help their participation in WTO negotiations, to implement the results of the DDA, and to build up their trade capacity.
<P>

<a name="30620w14.html_para16">We believe that launching negotiations on the "Singapore Issues" (investment, competition, transparency in government procurement and trade facilitation) at Cancun will help provide predictability, transparency, secure market access gains, and level a playing field for all WTO members.

Before then, the breakdown was less detailed. Therefore the above figures for 1997&#150;78 and 1998&#150;99 are not directly comparable to the figures for the later three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many carers over 65 years of age have <i>(a)</i> claimed and <i>(b)</i> received carers allowance since 28 October 2002.  [115902]<P>

<a name="30620w15.html_spnew7"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The information is in the table and relates to the period 28 October 2002 to 31 December 2002. The majority of carers aged 65 and over who qualify for carer's allowance also receive a state pension of an equal or higher amount. In these circumstances, the overlapping benefits rules preclude the payment of carer's allowance. However, people affected in this way can, if they are on a low income, qualify for the carer premium payable with income related benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the outcome was of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 2&#150;3 June; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if he will make a statement.  [117558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w16.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 My hon. Friend, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Health (David Lammy), represented the UK for the Health element of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 2 June.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para0">The main health business of this Council related to the Safety of Tissues and Cells Directive. The Council reached political agreement on a text that did not include any of the amendments, proposed by the European Parliament at its first reading, to which the UK was strongly opposed. The UK voted in support of the Council text.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para1">The Council adopted a proposal which will enable member states to sign the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The UK voted in favour of this proposal.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para2">Member states also reached political agreement on two elements of the Pharmaceuticals Review. These address changes to the human medicines directive, and to the Regulation that established the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (the EMEA) and a Community marketing authorisation procedure for certain human and veterinary medicines. The UK voted in favour of the Council text overall. A progress report was received on the veterinary medicines directive on which discussions are not as far advanced.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para3">The Council adopted Council Conclusions on combating Stigma in relation to Mental Illness, the product of a Conference, which took place in Athens under the Greek Presidency. The UK voted in favour of adopting these Conclusions.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para4">The Commission updated the Council on activities in the area of joint activity on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), including the announcement of funding into diagnostics research. They also gave an update on the High Level process of reflection on patient mobility and health care development, indicating that the second Ministerial plenary session would take place in July.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para5">Under any other business the Commission updated the Council on the programme of co-operation on bioterrorism and health security. The Commission also presented a proposed Recommendation on Cancer Screening. Voting was not required on either of these items. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Andrew Smith) represented the UK together with my hon. Friend, then Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions (Alan Johnson), at the Employment and Social Policy part of the ESPHCA on 3 June in Luxembourg.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para6">The Council agreed a general approach to the 2003 Employment Guidelines. The EP will now be consulted as directed by the Treaty and the Guidelines will be adopted at a future Council as an A point. The UK are

content with the simplified guidelines which are more focused on the employment targets set at Lisbon in 2000 and are geared more towards outcomes. Council also agreed the Recommendations on member states employment policies, the second part of the Employment package.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para7">There was a lengthy discussion on the proposed Directive on Temporary Agency workers which was originally tabled for political agreement. The Council was unable to reach agreement on the proposal and the Presidency remitted further negotiations to the Italian Presidency, recalling that the Brussels Spring Council urged agreement on the directive by December 2003. The UK maintained its position that it could back a directive that supported agency workers without putting their jobs at risk. Any directive must reflect the realities of our labour market.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para8">Council agreed the rest of the items on the agenda with little or no discussion. Council reached political agreement on a regulation on the European Co-operative Statute and a parallel directive on employee involvement.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para9">Council also reached political agreement on a Decision setting up an Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work. The UK and Denmark made a written declaration, to be included in the minutes of the Council, regretting the use of Article 202 as the legal base for this Decision.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para10">Council adopted two Resolutions without discussion: one Resolution on building social and human capital in the knowledge society; and a second on promoting the employment and social integration of people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para11">Council also agreed a general approach on the three chapters of a Regulation to replace Regulation 1408/71, the co-ordination of member states' social security systems, that have been discussed under the Greek Presidency. The chapters concerned cover invalidity benefits, pensions and special non-contributory benefits. Work will continue under the Italian Presidency with a view to completing the simplification of this regulation by December 2003, as requested by the European Council at Barcelona in 2002.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para12">The Council approved, without debate, the Social Protection Committee's plans to carry out themed studies on pensions issues.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para13">Under the Council's new rules of procedure, both the Commission and the Presidency presented Any Other Business items as written information. There was no discussion of these points.
<P>

<a name="30620w16.html_para14">No votes were taken in this part of the Council.

 The only hat available to the Guards Regiments made from real fur is the ceremonial bearskin cap, which is made from the fur of the Black Bear. The Regiment currently holds 2,258 of these caps. It is not possible to accurately estimate the number of pelts used, as the number required for each cap varies; one bear pelt can make on average between one and two caps. A total of 1,396 caps have been procured over the last 10 years (1993 to 2002). Since 2001, a refurbishment programme has been in place designed to ensure that we reduce the requirement for new caps to a minimum. A total of 329 caps have been refurbished since this programme began.

To ensure that the fleet remains operational up to this point, it is expected that modifications will be required on most of the fleet to maintain structural integrity of the aircraft. A more substantial work package, including outer wing replacement, may be required for several C130K aircraft that have undertaken more demanding flying tasks during recent operations.

<P>
<a name="30620w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The forces participating in the operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be under the political control and strategic direction of the EU Council of Ministers. This is exercised through the Political and Security Committee which is comprised of representatives of member states. We expect that personnel and equipment participating in the operation will carry some form of identifying EU insignia, as is the case for the EU-led operation in Macedonia. This follows the example of NATO operations where participating forces are expected to wear NATO insignia.

 In response to a request from the UN Secretary General, the EU decided on 5 June to lead a multinational force to Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo under ESDP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 303W, on early leavers, what research his Department has commissioned on changes in the number of naval personnel leaving the Service by premature voluntary retirement between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02; and if he will make a statement.  [120321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The increase in the number of premature voluntary retirements in 2001&#150;02 is primarily due to a reduction in the notice period for ratings from 18 to 12 months in that year, and is not the subject of any further specific investigation. However, reducing the outflow of personnel from the Naval Service is a key strategic objective of the Navy Board which is being implemented through a Retention Campaign, including initiatives on terms and conditions of service, rebalancing lives, remuneration and career management.

<a name="30620w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Funding is allocated for in-year expenditure only. Provision for future years' expenditure is made in the annually revised Equipment Plan. In the case of Typhoon, the allocation for equipment acquisition for 2003&#150;2004 is &#163;1,158 million. We currently estimate that the total procurement cost of Typhoon will be &#163;19.7 billion. Typhoon is planned to be procured in three tranches. The first tranche is already on order and in production. We plan to place orders for the second and third tranches of aircraft in 2003 and 2007 respectively.

 The Defence Secondary Care Agency was disbanded on 31 March 2003 and its functions were subsumed by the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency and the Defence Medical Services Department. The Agency employed an average of 2,282 military and civilian people between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003 of which 11 were employed in Scotland. This compares with 2,317 in the preceding financial year of which 10 were employed in Scotland.

 As at 1 January 2003 there were 95 people in post working for the United Kingdom National Codification Bureau (UKNCB), all of which are employed in Glasgow. The total annual personnel costs of UKNCB as at 1 January 2003 were approximately &#163;2.6 million. For the comparable 12 month period as at 1 January 2002 there were 99 people in post employed by UKNCB, all in Scotland.

 The Director General Commercial is the Professional Head of the Ministry of Defence's Commercial Function.

The Director General Commercial Organisation is a term used to describe collectively the commercial staff within the MOD. It is neither an agency, nor a budgetary element within the Department.

<P>
<a name="30620w19.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tyler: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the outcome of the appeal in the case of Mr. Shaun Rusling, and its implications for other Service personnel suffering illnesses due to mobilisation for or action in the 1991 Gulf War.  [120495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The High Court judgment of 13 June 2003 against the Ministry of Defence, as appellant, rested on a number of considerations. A key consideration was that the Pensions Appeal Tribunal was entitled to find, in Mr. Rusling's case, that the Ministry of Defence had failed to show beyond reasonable doubt that disablement due to 'Gulf War Syndrome', which he claimed in 1994, was neither attributable nor aggravated by his Service in the armed forces. The High Court made it clear that it was not in a position to express any views on whether, according to current medical research, 'Gulf War Syndrome' was or was not a 'single disease entity', and the judge confirmed that the court had not expressed any such view in its judgment. The court confirmed that all other cases would have to be decided on their own facts.
<P>

<a name="30620w19.html_para0">We would not expect the level of Mr. Rusling's war pension to be affected by this judgment as the disablement that he describes as 'Gulf War Syndrome' is already being fully compensated for in his war pension award, using the World Health Organisation's International Classification of diseases, 10th edition, (ICD10) category, "Signs, Symptoms and Ill-Defined Conditions".
<P>

<a name="30620w19.html_para1">Of those veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict who have already claimed for conditions they attribute to their Service in the armed forces, many have already received a war pension. These awards have been based on consideration on whether there was evidence of disablement and whether this was attributable to Service. Where these have been satisfied, an award has been made. Similarly, therefore, the eligibility for an award and its level has not been affected by the issue of whether or not there was a single disease entity, 'Gulf War Syndrome'.

<i>[holding answer 11 June 2003]:</i> HMS Tireless suffered some external damage as a result of contact with a free-floating object.

<P>
<a name="30620w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 None. Our current planning assumption is to acquire up to 150 short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the joint strike fighter (JSF) to meet our future joint combat aircraft (FJCA) requirement.

 NATO remains the cornerstone of the United Kingdom's defence policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30620w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The increase in the strength of pilots for the Sea Harrier fleet was due to the graduation of three pilots from the Sea Harrier Operational Flying Training (SHAR OFT) course and one pilot, previously listed as very seriously injured, now being included in the trained strength.
<P>

<a name="30620w20.html_para1">The decrease in the strength of pilots for the frontline Harrier GR7 fleet was due to Officers being posted to Qualified Weapons Instructor Courses (QWIC); or to be Qualified Flying Instructors, training students for the frontline. Postings, promotions and retirement from Service are also factors. Three RAF officers will be returning from the QWIC on 20 June 2003, and a further three RAF officers will graduate from training in July 2003.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's targets for improving energy efficiency and the ways in which we intend to achieve them are set out in Chapter 3 of the Energy White Paper, published on 24 February this year. We propose action to tighten Building Regulations with the aim of bringing forward the next revision of the Building Regulations in 2005. This will raise building fabric and services standards and enable developers to take the benefits of using low carbon solutions such as solar water heating and photo-voltaics in overall building solutions. We will also encourage greater energy efficiency in homes through the decent homes target to ensure that all social housing is made decent by 2010 and through our delivery of the Sustainable Communities Action Plan.

 The National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal (2001) sets out the vision of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for narrowing the gap between the most deprived areas and the rest of the country on the key domains of crime, health, education and skills, worklessness, and housing and the physical environment.
<P>

<a name="30620w22.html_para0">An important element in delivering the strategy is the introduction of floor targets under SR2000. These are National Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets that set a floor or minimum standard so that Whitehall Departments are judged for the first time on the areas they are doing worse rather than on the national average. Under SR2002, Department for Transport (DfT) have signed up to a PSA target on road safety with a floor component:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30620w22.html_para1">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit has been working closely with the DfT on its proposals for tackling road accident casualties in deprived areas. DfT is targeting &#163;17.6 million to those deprived areas with a high number of child pedestrian casualties. Several of these are in Greater Manchester and around. Local authorities will be expected to draw up local strategies to tackle the problem and obtain results in three years. Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs) and the police will have a stake locally. In these areas, LSPs will play a key role in drawing together all the key agencies from both from the public and voluntary, community and business sectors to deliver decisions and actions that join up

NRF spending plans are therefore determined locally, and the NRF can be used to support not only local authority services, but also those of other organisations, including other members of the LSP. NRF is used primarily to facilitate the bending of mainstream resources to tackle deprivation in the most deprived areas.
