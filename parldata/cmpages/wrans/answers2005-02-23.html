<a name="50223w01.html_dpthd0"><h3 align=center>PRIME MINISTER</h3>

<a name="50223w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Helicopter Flight Cost</h3>


<p><a name="50223w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 To ask the Prime Minister from what budget the helicopter he used for his official engagements on 11 February was paid for.  [217711]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 There was no cost to public funds.
</p>




<a name="50223w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Honours</h3>


<p><a name="50223w01.html_wqn1"><b> Tony Wright: </b> 
 To ask the Prime Minister how many recipients of each category of award in the honours system there were in each local authority area in each of the last five years.  [216591]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The information requested is not held centrally and to obtain the information would incur disproportionate costs. Details of awards made by regions over the last five years were published in Sir Hayden Phillips&#039; Review of the Honours System (2004), copies of which are available in the Library.

<a name="50223w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Iran</h3>


<p><a name="50223w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Dalyell: </b> 
 To ask the Prime Minister pursuant to the oral answer of 9 February 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1496 to the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), what diplomatic means of engagement he has pursued with the Government of Iran since 9 February in respect of <i>(a)</i> the security of Iran, <i>(b)</i> the Iranian perception of the security of Iran, <i>(c)</i> Iran&#039;s relations with the United States and <i>(d)</i> the alleged development of nuclear weapons by Iran.
</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Our policy towards Iran is one of critical and conditional engagement. The UK, France and Germany (the &quot;E3&quot;), with European Union representatives, are engaged in a dialogue with Iran aimed at agreeing long-term arrangements for Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. These are intended to provide objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Working groups on political/security issues and nuclear issues met in Geneva on 9 February and 10&#150;11 February respectively. A working group on technology/co-operation met on 8 February. Relations between Iran and the United States are a matter for those two countries.

<p>7. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn3"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he expects the devolved assembly to re-convene.  [216997]</p>

<p>8. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Gregory Campbell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he plans to make announcements regarding cultural arrangements, appointments and other equality measures regarding Ulster Scots.  [216998]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spnew1"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Government fully recognises the importance of cultural identity in Northern Ireland and has in hand a significant programme of work aimed at recognising it. The wide range of issues involved means that announcements are made as and when it is appropriate to do so.
</p>




<a name="50223w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Devolved Government</h3>


<p>9. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn5"><b> Helen Jackson: </b>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the impact of the suspension of the Assembly on the democratic process in Northern Ireland.  [217000]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paul Murphy: </b> 
 The Belfast Agreement envisaged a Northern Ireland Assembly and a power-sharing Executive, both made up of locally-elected representatives. The Government continues to believe that this represents the best long-term guarantee of peace and stability in Northern Ireland and I regret that current circumstances make it impossible to restore those institutions at present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w01.html_para0">
However, this does not erode the democratic process altogether in Northern Ireland. This House&#151;including those Members with Northern Ireland constituencies&#151;continue to hold myself and my ministerial colleagues to account for our administration of Northern Ireland under Direct Rule.

<a name="50223w01.html_sbhd7"><h3 align=center>Education Boards</h3>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the financial position of the education boards in Northern Ireland; and what steps are being taken to improve that position.  [217001]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 Between 1999&#150;2000 and 2005&#150;06 total spending on education has increased by 56 per cent. Total funding per pupil has increased by 64 per cent. In the budget for 2005&#150;06 I have increased the allocation to the ELB centre budgets by &#163;19 million over the previous year; that is almost 6 per cent.&#151;from &#163;333 to &#163;352 million at a time when inflation is running at 2.5 per cent. and pupil numbers are declining.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w01.html_para1">
The priority now for all ELBs is to develop plans that reflect Government education policy and ensure that services are managed and delivered within budget.

<p>12. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Walter: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on cross-border trade in second-hand motor vehicles.  [217002]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spnew5"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The number of second hand vehicles imported into Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland has reduced considerably over the last five years, from a figure of 2,889 in 2000 to 959 in 2004.

<p>14. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn10"><b> Ann Winterton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the Northern Ireland peace process.  [217004]</p>

<p>15. <a name="50223w01.html_wqn11"><b> Kevin Brennan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the economic impact in Northern Ireland of the peace process.  [217005]</p>




<p><a name="50223w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 The Northern Ireland economy has performed remarkably well over the past decade with high levels of economic growth, a strong labour market and increasing visitor numbers. I believe this can be attributed in part to the increased stability and confidence provided by the peace process.

<p><a name="50223w03.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on agricultural markets in Africa.  [217420]</p>




<p><a name="50223w03.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in its current form, impacts on agricultural markets in Africa by increasing world supply, thus lowering world prices; by artificially raising EU prices; by heavily subsidising exports; by undermining world price stability and by limiting access to our markets through the use of high import tariffs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para0">
This imposes high costs on developing countries. Empirical research has shown that amongst rich countries, the EU is responsible for the biggest costs to developing country farmers. Reform of the CAP could increase developing countries&#039; food and farming income by $7.5 billion per year, which could significantly reduce poverty for those producers in Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para1">
DFID and the UK are committed to reform of the CAP in order to facilitate freer and fairer agricultural trade between developing countries, including in Africa, and the EU. This issue is being analysed in the Commission for Africa Report, expected in March 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para2">
DFID will continue to press for reforms on the EU side including by weakening the link between EU farm support and domestic production to discourage over production (which lowers the world market price), and providing better market access by reducing tariffs and will also continue to build supply-side capacity of agricultural producers including infrastructure and technological development to improve quality and competitiveness of African products.

(i) Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI): There are 439 SSSI in the West Midlands region and currently 65 per cent. are either in favourable or recovering management condition. Only around 5 per cent. have been classified as declining in management condition. In some cases improvements in management condition are secured by English Nature through management agreements under its Wildlife Enhancement Scheme and in others by the Rural Development Service through agri-environment schemes. On other sites improved management has been achieved with support from the Heritage Lottery fund, for example at Cannock Chase and Sutton Park under the Tomorrow&#039;s Heathland Heritage initiative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w04.html_para5">
One major outstanding issue which relates to the condition of river and other wetland SSSIs is diffuse pollution, invariably from agricultural sources. Under the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme a specific pilot scheme is now underway to tackle diffuse pollution issues on the river Teme through collaborative working among both relevant agencies including the Integrated Agency confederation and the Environment Agency together with local individuals and groups.

(ii) Biodiversity: The Government is supporting the co-ordination the of six Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) Partnerships operating in the West Midlands and the delivery of specific nature conservation actions for a selection of each area&#039;s most threatened habitats and species. This ranges from restoration of lowland heathland in Staffordshire and Worcestershire to the survival of water voles in Birmingham and Herefordshire. The region&#039;s Biodiversity Strategy (to be launched March 2005), and the associated regional biodiversity audit and regional habitats targets work, has derived from strong Government engagement with and facilitation of partnership outputs. The ODPM&#039;s Regional Planning Guidance (June 2004) incorporates policy intent to achieve effective protection and measurable gains in the conservation status of 23 priority habitats by 2010.

 The surface water problems that occur at specific areas on the M60 result from a combination of wide carriageways and the road alignment and crossfall.

 In an audience with the King on 8 February, our ambassador in Nepal raised our concerns about the suspension of civil liberties and called for the immediate release of all political and human rights detainees. In my statement of 1 February, I expressed the UK Government&#039;s grave concerns about the situation in Nepal and called for the immediate restitution of multi-party democracy. We understand that Krishna Pahadi was arrested on 9 February and have sought to find out where he is being detained.

 On the information available to us we estimate that around 125 people were arrested following the actions by the King of Nepal on 1 February 2005, of whom nine were detained under house arrest. Because of media and other restrictions, we may not be aware of all those arrested, especially outside Kathmandu. Of the 125, 19 were members of the Unified Marxist Leninist party and one was a member of the United People&#039;s Front. A number of those detainees have now been released, although some party leaders still remain in detention.

[216732]</p>




<p><a name="50223w12.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The King&#039;s takeover of power in Nepal on 1 February was accompanied by the imposition of a state of emergency which included the suspension of many fundamental rights. These included the right to association, the right to freedom of expression, the right to property, the right against preventative detention and the rights of the press.

<p>
<a name="50223w12.html_para3">
The UK is deeply concerned by the measures taken under the state of emergency and believes they undermine the institutions of democracy and increase the risk of instability in Nepal.

 The King&#039;s move to dismiss the Prime Minister and assume power outside the framework of a multi-party democratic system will unfortunately, probably put back the prospect of any negotiated settlement. In our view negotiation with the Maoists should be the responsibility of a representative civilian government, to which the Royal Nepalese Army is accountable.

Further assistance for the Government&#039;s relocation to Somalia and its immediate needs has been set aside, but the scale and timing of the disbursements will have to be decided in consultation with the TFG and in the light of developments.

A number of European Union member states as well as other members of the International Community have contributed to the reconciliation process and are considering making further contributions.

3. Income support expenditure has been provided separately for people aged under 60 and people aged 60 and over. Expenditure for those aged 60 and over includes minimum income guarantee and pension credit.<br>

4. It is not possible to accurately state expenditure on the disability premium paid within income support. Rather than make any assumptions about the level of disability premium expenditure, all expenditure on people who receive a disability premium has been included.<br>

5. Incapacity benefit is not an income-related benefit.<br>

As the pilots are still at a relatively early stage it is not possible to give a meaningful figure for the average cost per client or per incapacity benefit claimant in the relevant area. This is because there will be a disproportionate number of customers in the early stages of the pilot (compared to the steady state) and because early figures include an element of start-up costs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) whether, under the plans published in his Department&#039;s five-year strategy, a claimant suffering from a condition which is serious enough to prevent them from doing any kind of work for a period of time, but which is expected to be temporary, would receive the rehabilitation support allowance or the disability and sickness allowance;  [215547]

<p><a name="50223w16.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Rehabilitation and support allowance will be for people with less severe impairments that can be well managed with the right support and so need not be a major long- term obstacle to getting back to work. Disability and sickness allowance will focus more on those with the most severe impairments where the health problem or disability will, for some time, form a very significant obstacle to getting back to work. However, we know many people with severe impairments still do work, and want to do so. Disability and sickness allowance recipients will still be able to access any appropriate programme or financial support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w16.html_para0">
The basis of the division between the two benefits will be the severity of functional limitation as a result of a health condition or disability.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps his Department is taking to reduce the numbers of sick days taken by staff in the Department.  [216631]</p>




<p><a name="50223w17.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 We are developing new attendance management policies and systems to be introduced in the spring. These will place greater accountability on managers to deal with absence and take into account recommendations of the recently published Managing Attendance in the Public Sector report. They will introduce a more robust approach to reviewing absence on both short and long-term sickness focusing on earlier management interventions. Our overall approach revolves around building management capability, through training and support, to underpin the new policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w17.html_para3">
In the medium term we have work under way to better understand patterns of sickness absence and what actions will have the greatest leverage to bring overall absence levels down. This will enable us to develop a revised attendance management strategy.

Skeletal fluorosis in the United Kingdom appears to be non-existent&#151;with the exception of a reported case in 1966&#151;see Webb-Peploe MM, Bradley WG (1966): &quot;Endemic fluorosis with neurological complications in a Hampshire man&quot;&#151;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, Vol. 29, pp. 577&#150;584.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure accounted for by the health authority. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health.<br>

3. In many HAs, there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs.<br>

4. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board (DPB). An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) and not by HAs. Total expenditure on these items by the DPB and the PPA cannot be allocated to individual health bodies and are therefore omitted from the answer.<br>

5. For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between HAs or between different years.<br>

The national specialised services mental health definition subset provides guidance to commissioners on securing effective collective planning arrangements that take into account the needs of a planning population considerably larger than that of a single primary care trust (PCT). A group led by the national director for mental health is currently reviewing the subset with a view to publish updated guidance later this year.

Local health communities should design the provision of their services for the treatment and management of mental health problems according to the standards set in the national service frameworks for mental health (1999), older people (2001) and children, young people and maternity services (2004) and in light of the clinical guidelines and technology appraisals published by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

 The national service framework (NSF) for mental health provides a rationale and evidence base for a national standard for mental health services relating to carers of people with mental health problems. In accordance with the NSF, all individuals who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach should have an assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs repeated on at least an annual basis. People who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach are also entitled to have their own written care plan, which is given to them and implemented in discussion with them.

The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 strengthens the rights of all carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers. It involves a right to a carer&#039;s assessment. It gives local councils mandatory duties to support carers by providing services to carers directly and in the provision of breaks, as well as, directly supporting carers by providing direct payment for carers&#039; services.

In line with the NHS Plan, mental health provider trusts are recruiting 700 carer support workers to increase the breaks available for carers and to strengthen carer support networks.

The Department publishes regulatory impact assessments in relation to new statutory and regulatory duties.

 The Government are taking forward work to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme. Recent achievements include: the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns which took place over the summer and winter last year, the introduction of new fixed penalty notices for minor alcohol offences from November last year and the launch of the first tranche of the Tackling violent Crime Programme&#151;providing extra help to those areas which have the highest volumes of violent crime. We are also working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to develop guidance for local authorities to help them manage the night-time economy.

<p>
<a name="50223w23.html_para2">
To build on this work, the Government published a consultation document called &quot;Drinking Responsibly&quot; on 21 January 2005 outlining new policy proposals for tackling the problems of alcohol-related disorder. The proposals included: Alcohol Disorder Zones for town and city centres, Drinking Banning Orders, a review of the penalties associated with alcohol-related crimes and new police closure powers for premises selling to under-age children.

 It is not the practice to give specific information about a particular case. Cases in the Stage 2, at-liberty queue currently being allocated to a Case Review Manager are, on average, 30 months old. Cases in the Stage 2, in-custody queue currently being allocated to a Case Review Manager are, on average, 19 months old. The Commission would expect applications received in February 2005 to wait a comparable time, but this is subject to other factors such as the need to prioritise certain cases and the time taken to complete case reviews in progress. The majority of cases (some 77 per cent.) are, however, allocated for review with minimal delay, because they are assessed as requiring less than five caseworker-days&#039; work.

For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Thames Valley police force increased by 408 from 3695 to 4103. The Government&#039;s introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 18 CSOs on Thames Valley streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&#150;04, Thames Valley police force area has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 11 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 29 per cent.

Thames Valley police will receive &#163;220.6 million in general grants for 2005&#150;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&#163;7.9million) over last year. Thames Valley benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &#163;4.1 million less. General grants funding to Thames Valley has increased by 28.9 per cent. between 1997&#150;08 and 2005&#150;06. In addition to general grants, Thames Valley will also receive around &#163;23.8million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedure <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the Assessor follows in assessing the compensation for victims of miscarriages of justice who are entitled to compensation under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.  [216087]</p>




<p><a name="50223w26.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Although the Home Secretary decides in principle whether compensation should be paid, the assessment of the amount of compensation is undertaken by an Assessor, appointed by the Home Secretary under section 133(4) of the 1988 Act, who is experienced in the assessment of damages. The current Assessor is Lord Brennan QC. Each case is considered on the basis of the circumstances relating to that individual claimant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w26.html_para0">
The assessment is made on the basis of written submissions setting out the relevant facts. When the claimant or the claimant&#039;s representative is informed that a payment will be made, they are invited to submit to the Claims Assessment Team, in the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, any information or representations which they would like the Assessor to take into account when considering the amount of compensation to be paid. The Claims Assessment Team prepares a draft memorandum based on this material.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w26.html_para1">
The draft memorandum will be sent to the claimant, or the claimant&#039;s representative, for their comments. Factual inaccuracies in the draft memorandum will be corrected and a copy of any comments made by the claimant will be sent to the Assessor with the memorandum. The Assessor may, through the Claims Assessment Team, seek further information or clarification arising from the material placed before him. For example, he may ask them to instruct independent accountants to advise him as to the reasonableness of certain pecuniary loss claims.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w26.html_para2">
In reaching his assessment, the Assessor will apply principles analogous to those governing the assessment of damages for civil wrongs. The assessment will take account of pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss arising from the wrongful charge or conviction and loss of liberty that results from it. The Assessor will take into account any reasonable expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by the claimant in reversing the conviction or pursuing the claim for compensation.

Home Office Regional Directors and their teams in the Government Offices for the Regions have an important part to play in helping to secure local delivery of the Government&#039;s objectives in respect of crime, substance misuse and community cohesion. This inevitably requires them to meet regularly with key partners in their areas including, of course, the police.

<a name="50223w30.html_para1">
The Prison Service has a statutory obligation to assist prisoners to maintain external contacts as part of their rehabilitation. To this end, convicted prisoners are allowed to send one letter a week and unconvicted prisoners two at public expense by 2nd class post. Prisoners are required to meet the cost of any additional letters but Governors and Directors have the discretion to fund special letters in exceptional circumstances (such as when a prisoner is to be transferred, or is involved in legal proceedings).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w30.html_para2">
Prisoners pay to make an estimated 25 million telephone calls a year. For Foreign National prisoners, Governors have the discretion to provide a free 5-minute call provided that the prisoner in question has not received a domestic visit in the preceding month. Governors also have the discretion to provide prisoners with access to an official telephone or make a call on their behalf to a close relative or partner within the first 24 hours of their arrival into prison. The only other occasion where prisoners are provided with calls at official expense is in urgent domestic circumstances involving a close relative or partner.

 The average cost per place for each Prison Service and privately run establishment for the financial year 2003&#150;04 is listed in the tables. These figures are not directly comparable since prisons vary widely in a number of factors which impact on costs such as the type of prison, category of security, levels of crowding, facilities and layout, location and the age of establishment.

For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the West Mercia Police Force increased by 325 from 2,040 to 2,365.

West Mercia Police Force is receiving &#163;111.8 million in general grants for 2005&#150;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&#163;4.1 million) over this year. West Mercia benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the Force would have received &#163;2.5 million less. General grants funding to West Mercia has increased by 27 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 2005&#150;06. In addition to general grants, West Mercia will also receive around &#163;10 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&#150;06.

As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.
