To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress he has made in establishing the scheme of regulation for immigration advisers and service providers; and if he will make a statement.  [152674]<P>

<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Office of The Immigration Services Commissioner published a Code of Standards, Guidance to Advisers on Competencies, The Commissioner's Rules and a Complaints Scheme in October 2000. An office has been established at 6th floor, Fleetbank House, 2-6 Salisbury Square, London EC4Y 8JX. Application packs for registration and exemption have also been sent to advisers and organisations known to the Commissioner's office. The Commissioner is about to start a publicity campaign designed to ensure that those who are required to make an application to him know of the need to do so.
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para0">I am pleased to announce that, following discussion with the Commissioner, I propose to bring the remaining provisions of Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 into force on 30 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para1">The Commissioner has, however, made representations to me about a large number of voluntary organisations which provide immigration advice and services and are committed to applying for the Community Legal Services Quality Mark. Organisations which have gained this Quality Mark are regarded as having met some of the Immigration Services Commissioner's requirements as set out in the Code of Standards. The Government have no wish to impose unnecessary regulatory demands on voluntary organisations which are already committed to a recognised quality programme and we propose to make an order under section 84(4)(d) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. As a result of this order, voluntary bodies which commit themselves to the Community Legal Services Quality Mark before 30 April 2001 will not breach the general prohibition on providing immigration advice or services which will come into force on that date. The protection for qualifying voluntary bodies will cease to have effect on 31 January 2002. The understanding will be that, by this date, the voluntary bodies will have applied to the Office of the Immigration Services

<a name="10306w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what average sum of money is allocated per serving police officer for training within the Metropolitan police force in the current financial year.  [151614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that as training is provided on the basis of need, it is not possible to provide an average sum of money allocated per serving officer for training. The Metropolitan police service has allocated &#163;99.5 million for training both police officers and civilian staff for the current year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 All child abuse inquiries are undertaken by specially trained officers. Training in each force is a matter for the chief officer concerned but would generally entail a minimum of five days of joint training with social workers.

<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what system is in place to ensure democratic accountability of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners.  [152122]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Chief Surveillance Commissioner appointed under the Police Act 1997 has a statutory responsibility to make an annual report to the Prime Minister on the exercise of his functions under the 1997 Act, and since 25 September 2000, of his additional functions as described in section 62 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). This report must be laid before Parliament. A copy of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner's most recent report is available in the Library. (Police Act 1997 Chapter 50 Report of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner for 1999-2000--Cm 4816).
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para3">The responsibility for appointing the Chief Surveillance Commissioner rests with the Prime Minister who is also responsible for appointing such Surveillance Commissioners and Assistant Surveillance Commissioners as he thinks fit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Office of Surveillance Commissioners (OSC) was allocated &#163;405,000 for the financial year 2000-01. The regional offices of the OSC were allocated &#163;84,000 by the Northern Ireland Office and &#163;41,000 by the Scottish Executive for the year 2000-01.

<a name="10306w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persons have been employed by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners in each year since its inception.  [152123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Office of Surveillance Commissioners was set up in 1998. It currently has four support staff in the Central Office in London, a part-time member of staff in Northern Ireland, and a part-time member of staff in Scotland. The staff joined between November 1998 and February 1999.
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para4">A Chief Surveillance Commissioner was appointed in July 1998. He is supported by six part-time Surveillance Commissioners appointed in November 1998. One Commissioner resigned in April 2000 and was replaced in February 2001.

 The aims and present work programme of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners (OSC) are twofold:




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2001 : Column: 125W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para5">First, for the Chief Commissioner to keep under review the performance of functions under Part III of the Police Act 1997 and, so far as they are not required to be kept under review by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, the Intelligence Services Commissioner or the Investigatory Powers Commissioners for Northern Ireland, the exercise and performance, by persons on whom they are conferred or imposed, of the powers and duties conferred or imposed by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 (RIP(S)).
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para6">Secondly, for the Surveillance Commissioners to carry out their statutory functions of (a) scrutinising and considering whether to give their prior approval to decisions to grant or renew grants of authorisations for property interference and intrusive surveillance and (b) scrutinising decisions to cancel authorisation for property interference and intrusive surveillance.
<P>

<a name="10306w01.html_para7">The work programme is currently being reviewed to incorporate oversight of directed surveillance and the use of covert human intelligence sources by the public authorities listed in Schedule 1 to RIPA and section 8 of RIP(S). A team of Assistant Commissioners and inspectors is to be recruited to assist with this.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. 'Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000' and 'Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000' can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by Basic Command Unit and Crime and Disorder partnerships.
<P>

<a name="10306w02.html_para0">The impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally examined by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects, such as recorded crime, cannot be matched in the way requested although set out are examples relating to the Stroud constituency or the immediate locality:

 We have no plans to introduce measures which would require the police automatically to inform the public of the identities and addresses of sex offenders.

 Under the Crime Reduction Programme, the Probation Service in England and Wales has been developing three programmes for sex offenders based on evidence of what is known to be effective (the What Works Initiative). The three sex offender programmes will be developed to the standard set by the Joint Prison and Probation Accreditation Panel. Once accredited, they will be rolled out across the Probation Service nationally. The quality of delivery will be audited by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation on behalf of the Accreditation Panel. Implementation of the first programmes to be accredited will begin this summer.

<a name="10306w03.html_para1">The three sex offender programmes aim to reduce the risk of re-offending by men who have committed any type of sexual offence such as rape, child abuse, viewing and distributing child pornography including via the internet. The programmes take between nine months and two years to complete and accept men on Probation Orders and post-custodial licences, providing the licence is sufficiently long to enable the programme to be completed.

<a name="10306w03.html_para2">In addition, the Prison Service Sex Offender Treatment Programme is available to men serving a prison sentence for a sexual offence or any offence with a sexual element. Similar treatment methods are used in both the prison and community programmes.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations her Department has received from Mongolia for assistance arising from the impact of severe winter conditions; what response has been made; and if she will make a statement.  [152265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Mongolia has been hit by two consecutive winter disasters or 'dzuds' (1999-2000 and 2000-01) caused by severe and widespread drought in the summer, unusually cold temperatures in the autumn and heavy snow fall in winter. These conditions are seriously affecting both animal and human welfare. Last year's dzud affected 450,000 herders and killed approximately three million livestock. Compared with the same period last year the current situation is much more severe in terms of the impact of the disaster on people and livestock and on the national capacity to respond. Over 300,000 herders are affected in 20 out of 21 provinces and 600,000 livestock have already died.
<P>

<a name="10306w04.html_para0">The Government of Mongolia have been active in disaster preparedness and relief assistance in dzud affected areas. However the two consecutive dzud have overstretched national capacity. The Government have therefore requested international relief assistance following a needs assessment, in which my Department was involved. An appeal for $11.8 million has been launched by the Government of Mongolia through the United Nations.




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2001 : Column: 134W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10306w04.html_para1">The appeal aims to target vulnerable groups in the most severely affected provinces and seeks to fulfil unmet relief needs. It focuses on building the disaster management of the Mongolian State Emergency Commission and other relevant national partners to enhance preparedness and future response.
<P>

<a name="10306w04.html_para2">We have offered US $1 million for the provision of emergency relief under the framework of the UN appeal to be channelled through humanitarian agencies working in Mongolia.

<P>
<a name="10306w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The first meeting of the co-ordinating board of the Stop TB Partnership took place in Bellagio, Italy from 21-22 February. There was wide representation, including from high burden countries.
<P>

<a name="10306w04.html_para3">The meeting was a success and reached agreement on the mission, priorities and mechanisms for governance for STOP TB and the Global TB Drug Facility (GDF). The GDF will be formally launched on World TB Day (24 March 2001). The outcome of the meeting lays the foundation to accelerate the collective and co-ordinated response to the Amsterdam Declaration, to build on the commitment of existing partners and encourage others to join this global movement to stop TB.

<a name="10306w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The vast majority of our students are allocated via an algorithm, which takes into account research funding (through grants, staff and fellowships) provided by NERC to all university departments with an RAE (research assessment exercise) score of 3 and above. We have been using essentially the same algorithm for six years and it is therefore well known to the departments. Not only do we provide the heads of department with a

BNFL has also, since 1990, made sales of depleted uranium to a number of industrial customers and universities for a variety of research and commercial purposes. Details of individual contracts are a commercial matter between BNFL and its customers.

 The detail of the changes made and actions taken by BNFL in response to the MOX data falsification issue is a matter for the company. The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) report on the MDF data falsification incident, published on 18 February 2000, included 15 recommendations which BNFL had to address to HSE's satisfaction. A number of the HSE recommendations related to identifying and dealing with specific workforce problems and improving management arrangements. A copy of the HSE report is in the Library of the House. A copy of BNFL's response to the HSE report, which was published on 18 April 2000, is also in the Library of the House. That response set out details of the programme of work through which BNFL planned to address HSE's recommendations. On 18 December 2000, HSE closed out its 15 recommendations, since they had been satisfactorily addressed by BNFL. On 22 February 2001, HSE published a further report updating the progress made by BNFL in responding to the three HSE reports published in February 2000. A copy of this report is also in the Library of the House.

This would give many petrol retail outlets mandatory rate relief of 50 per cent. provided their rateable value was less than &#163;6,000.

<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Council housing is a major public asset which needs to be maintained and modernised. The introduction of the Major Repairs Allowance will provide local authorities with the resources they need to meet the on-going capital costs of maintaining their housing stock.

<a name="10306w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has today published a consultation paper setting out a framework of legislation and guidance within which local authorities would use the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) as the basis for action against unacceptable housing conditions.
<P>

<a name="10306w07.html_para1">We published a report on the development of the rating system in July. The system will bring a modern, risk-based approach to health and safety in the home and will underpin our commitment to improving the housing conditions of the most vulnerable people.
<P>

<a name="10306w07.html_para2">The HHSRS illustrates our recognition of the close relationship between housing and health. Considerable steps have already been taken to familiarise local authorities with the new system and we now want to hear their views, as well as those of landlords' and tenants' organisations, on the enforcement proposals. The system will also underpin our licensing scheme proposals for Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO).
<P>

<a name="10306w07.html_para3">Legislation to allow authorities to use the rating system as a basis for their enforcement decisions will be introduced as soon as the opportunity arises.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with his counterparts in European Union maritime member states to establish the scientific basis on which these states have excluded navigational channels and working port areas from designation under the European Union habitats directive.  [151998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Most member states have yet to complete the assessment and selection of possible sites to be designated. All should be using the same guidance offered by the European Commission's Interpretation Manual. Opportunity for collective consideration of the outcomes will occur at the next moderation meeting for the Atlantic biogeographic region, scheduled for September in Amsterdam.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he has taken to ensure that English Nature has acted under the terms of the European Union habitats directive regarding the protection of estuarial features under the terms of the European Union habitats directive where their action leads to the designation of an entire estuary; and if he will make a statement.  [151989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 English Nature were asked by Government to identify sites hosting habitats listed in Annex I of the habitats directive; estuaries are one of the listed habitats. In considering such sites English Nature has used the European Commission's own Interpretation Manual for guidance. The nature conservation agencies' advice is that estuaries are complex ecosystems containing many interdependent components within which other Annex I listed habitats are represented. Consequently, 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2001 : Column: 148W</I><P>
boundaries have been drawn to protect the form and function of the entire estuarine ecosystem necessary for its long-term maintenance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he last met the chairman and chief executive of English Nature to discuss its interpretation of its designation requirements under the European Union habitats directive and that of other member states; what steps he is taking to ensure that there is consistency of interpretation of the habitats directive across all member states; and if he will make a statement.  [151997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 No meeting has taken place. English Nature is following the European Commission's own guidelines pertaining to the interpretation of the habitats directive. It is for the European Commission and member states collectively to ensure that there has been a consistent scientific approach adopted by all member states in the selection and designation of Natura 2000 sites. Opportunity to do so will occur at the next moderation meeting for the Atlantic biogeographic region, scheduled for September in Amsterdam. The UK will question any instances where there appears to have been inconsistency of approach.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what criteria have been applied by English Nature in evaluating those sites which it has recommended for designation as special areas of conservation under the European Union habitats directive programme; what steps he takes to ensure that its evaluations are scientific; and if he will make a statement.  [151987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 In advising Government, the statutory nature conservation agencies, including English Nature, must apply the criteria set out in Article 4 and Annex III of the habitats directive, and that given additionally at EU moderation meetings. In this process they may only use relevant scientific information to identify sites eligible for selection as Special Areas of Conservation. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) acts with the other statutory nature conservation agencies in collating information, moderating and providing quality assurance on recommended sites before providing formal advice to Government.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make available the list of European Union member states that have complied with the requirements of the European Union habitats directive in designating navigational channels and working port areas as being outside environmental designations.  [151901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Member states are still in the process of revising and submitting new designated sites. No lists have yet to be circulated and there has not, therefore, been any opportunity to examine final designations. Site details proposed by member states in the Atlantic Biogeographical Region will be circulated by the European Commission in advance of the next moderation meeting for that region, scheduled for September in Amsterdam.

 It is for the European Commission and member states collectively to ensure that there has been a consistent scientific approach adopted by all member states in the selection and designation of Natura 2000 sites under the Habitats Directive. English Nature's role, through the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is to advise Government on the scientific merits of sites in England they consider meet the criteria in Article 4 and Annexe III of the Habitats Directive.

 My Department does not systematically collect data on the development of energy efficient building regulations in all member states.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the Warrington, North constituency, the effects on Warrington, North of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [152322]<P>

<P>
<a name="10306w10.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Warrington, North, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the General Election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 638, or 29 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 60 per cent., and long-term unemployment has fallen by 63 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10306w10.html_para2">Macro-economic stability is being complemented at the micro-economic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds had helped 836 young people in the Warrington, North constituency gain valuable skills and experience--382 (46 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle income families. In August 2000, 2,400 families in the constituency were benefiting from WFTC.




<P>

<a name="10306w10.html_para3">The Government are also committed to developing policies which enable all pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. As a result of the recent pre-Budget report, all pensioners, including 14,400 in Warrington, North, will receive an above-inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001. Single pensioners will receive an extra &#163;5 per week, and couples will receive an extra &#163;8 a week. All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000--including around 9,400 in Warrington, North.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 31 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 213W, on unemployment costs, what the cost is to the Exchequer per unemployed person per year in terms of all forgone taxes where the calculation assumes <i>(a)</i> the person to have been on average earnings and <i>(b)</i> the person to have been on average earnings for the manufacturing sector.  [152468]<P>

 As the extent to which unemployment affects Government revenues depends on a number of assumptions, in particular the extent to which unemployment reflects permanent changes in output growth, no estimates of the effects of unemployment on taxes forgone are available.

<P>

<a name="10306w11.html_para1">Between 1989 and 1997, publicly planned funding per full-time equivalent higher education student fell by over 36 per cent. from just under &#163;7,600 to just over &#163;4,800. As a result, Lord Dearing's National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education concluded in 1997 that higher education institutions could not absorb a further reduction of over 6 per cent. in funding which was planned for 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="10306w11.html_para2">The Government accepted the recommendation of the Inquiry. Higher education institutions were asked to deliver no more than a 1 per cent. reduction in unit funding in both 1998-99 and 1999-2000. This was later extended for a further year.
<P>

<a name="10306w11.html_para3">The Government announced last November cash increases in publicly planned funding of &#163;412 million, &#163;268 million and &#163;298 million over the three years to 2003-04. Coupled with planned increases in student numbers this implies estimated annual increases in publicly planned unit funding of 3.2 per cent., 2.5 per cent. and 2.9 per cent. which themselves imply estimated real-terms increases in funding per full-time equivalent student of 0.7 per cent., 0 per cent. and 0.4 per cent. over the next three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much local discretionary funding was allocated to each of the Learning and Skills Councils for 2001-02; and what proportion of total funding allocated to each Learning and Skills Council this amount represents.  [151667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 There is no single definition of local discretionary funding. After the current transition period, local LSCs will have the decisive role in the allocation to providers of the vast bulk of the LSC's mainstream budgets, including those for further education and work-based training (although prices paid per individual learner will be determined by a national formula).
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para0">For a range of other activities which total 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of LSC overall funds, and for which there will be no national formula, local LSCs will determine both the allocations and the prices paid. One element within that 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. category is the Local Initiatives Fund (LIF), offering maximum flexibility for the local LSC to support local projects which would not otherwise be funded through mainstream programme budgets. The total LIF budget for 2001-02 is

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2001]:</i> We are not currently conducting any such reviews. The student support arrangements we have introduced are working well and share the costs of higher education fairly between students, parents and the taxpayer and we are monitoring the impact of the new arrangements. From September this year, because we have raised the income contribution thresholds, around 50 per cent. of all English and Welsh higher education students liable for fees under the Education (Student Support) Regulations will not have to make any contribution to their tuition fees. In 2001-02 new additional targeted support, in particular opportunity bursaries and a child care grant based on actual costs, will help students with dependants and those from poorer backgrounds. Annual figures on student finances are not collected. However, the average level of student debt was &#163;840 in 1995-96 and &#163;2,530 in 1998-99 for full-time students in higher education in the UK after their savings had been taken into account, according to data from the Department's periodic Student Income and Expenditure Survey.

<P>
<a name="10306w12.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Liverpool city council.  [152672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of Liverpool city council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para3">The report makes recommendations to help the authority address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para4">Overall, inspectors found a number of weaknesses and poor standards of performance in benefit administration and counter fraud work that needed immediate attention. Inconsistent and ineffective work practices were found and there were substantial backlogs of work affecting over 30,000 benefit claims which had led to lengthy delays in claims processing.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para5">The BFI reports the authority's lack of effective performance standards and targets, inadequate management information, weaknesses in checks and controls, poor management and recovery of benefit overpayments and no formal assessment of the risks of benefit fraud.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para6">The report notes that although there is some good counter fraud work, it is not focused and significant effort is being wasted. Where management checking exists it is largely ineffective and provides little assurance.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para7">The report concludes that BFI has serious concerns about Liverpool's recent performance in managing and delivering a secure benefits service. More positively, however, the report notes that the authority has recognised the significant challenges it faces and is strongly committed to a significant change programme that will involve overhauling its systems, structures and processes. 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2001 : Column: 169W</I><P>
While BFI recognises the size of the task and that the necessary changes will be difficult, inspectors are encouraged by the authority's commitment to tackle these issues.
<P>

<a name="10306w12.html_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the authority for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are about 9,000 in Stroud. 2,500 pensioner families in Stroud are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.

The process by which the Child Support Agency deals with these exceptional cases includes gathering information from one or more sources. Details of the 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2001 : Column: 172W</I><P>
application are then sent to the other party, giving them the opportunity to comment. Complex cases may be referred to the Appeals Service for determination. This process can often be time consuming especially when the information required is difficult to obtain.
<P>

<a name="10306w13.html_para20">The reformed child support scheme, which we plan to introduce for new cases by April 2002, will not include any provision for departures. However, either parent will be able to apply for the child support rates to be varied in specified, exceptional cases. The decision-making process for variations will be streamlined. Applications for a variation will be accepted before the maintenance calculation has been made, thus enabling the system to operate more quickly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w13.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what changes will be made to the Child Support Agency's procedures on disclosure following the proposed changes to the Child Support Agency to be introduced after April 2002;  [152182]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on Child Support Agency procedures for the disclosure of information on one partner to another;  [152180]
<P>
(3) what advice he has taken since the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 on the Child Support Agency's approach to disclosure of information.  [152181]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Child Support Agency treats the protection of personal information very seriously. A parent's details will not normally be disclosed by the Agency to anyone unless that parent consents. However, where a court makes an order requiring child support information to be disclosed, the Agency must comply with that order. The Agency also has the power to give any information it holds to a court or tribunal when child support cases are being considered, or to the appropriate authority for the calculation of Housing or Council Tax Benefits.
<P>

<a name="10306w13.html_para21">Regulation 10 of the Maintenance Assessment (Procedure) Regulations 1992 sets out the information which the Agency is required to provide when telling parents about a new maintenance assessment, or a revision or supersession of an existing assessment. This information includes the net and assessable income of both parents, and the non-resident parent's housing and travel costs allowed in the assessment. This information will not include details of addresses unless permission is given.
<P>

<a name="10306w13.html_para22">In the event that a parent appeals against a decision, they have the opportunity to opt into a confidentiality agreement so that any information which might lead to their whereabouts is not passed to the other parent.
<P>

<a name="10306w13.html_para23">In the new scheme, less information will be required to make a maintenance calculation and consequently, less information will be communicated in explaining that calculation. Regulation 23 of the Maintenance Calculation and Procedure Regulations 2000 provides that the notification of a maintenance calculation will set out a limited range of information, including the non-resident's net weekly income.
<P>

<a name="10306w13.html_para24">Provisions for the disclosure of information are entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.

The SSC advised that BSE incidence figures, at that time, did not require modification of the BSE risk of France and Ireland. However the SSC is reviewing this position regularly in the light of BSE surveillance results.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w16.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2001]:</i> The key arrangements for dealing with BSE and scrapie suspects have not changed as a consequence of the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Carcases of animals slaughtered because of suspicion of BSE or scrapie will continue to be destroyed at incinerators. The movement of such carcases for disposal is exempt from the movement restrictions we have introduced in the response to the foot and mouth disease outbreak.
<P>

<a name="10306w16.html_para3">For non-BSE or scrapie suspects, pyres are being designed in a way to maximise good combustion, which will help to minimise air emissions and minimise incomplete burn-out and therefore potentially contaminated residues.
<P>

<a name="10306w16.html_para4">We are currently assessing the implications of the possibility that small numbers of cattle affected by the FMD outbreak may be in the pre-clinical stage of BSE and may harbour some of the BSE agent. A previous independent risk assessment undertaken for the Environment Agency in 1997 indicated that any such risk was very low and the incidence of BSE is now considerably lower than in 1997. Nevertheless, we are revisiting these conclusions in the light of the current circumstances, and hope to receive a preliminary independent assessment shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> Responsibility for the provision of advice on food safety matters rests with the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para3">The FSA commissioned Dr. Christl Donnelly to research the risks associated with French beef and her paper was published in <i>Nature</i> on 14 December 2000, as was a letter from the FSA Chairman Sir John Krebs. Dr. Donnelly estimated that the risk from imported French beef from cattle aged no more than 30 months old at slaughter is essentially zero (no cattle within 12 months of developing clinical BSE). If the Over-30-Month-Rule is not fully enforced, the risk rises in proportion to the frequency of the breach. Dr. Donnelly estimated that if compliance with the Rule is 75 per cent., which Sir John Krebs considered to be reasonable on the basis of informal indications to the FSA from local authorities, the risk from French imports would be of the same order of magnitude as the current estimate for Britain's domestic beef.
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para4">The FSA estimated that comparable if not greater risks to United Kingdom consumers could arise from imported meat products that contain French beef.
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para5">The risk that applied in the period leading up to the UK's ban on beef-on-the-bone was estimated by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) at its 2 December 1997 meeting. At that meeting, SEAC considered the experimental finding in BSE infected cattle that dorsal root ganglia (DRG) became infective in the pre-clinical phase of the disease and that in one experiment bone marrow appeared to be infective. SEAC reviewed a risk assessment which estimated that 24 per cent. of the total infected DRG were attributable to bone-in beef. The remaining DRG related to infectivity arises from the ganglia that cannot be removed from cuts of joints of meat in the normal boning out process. The Committee estimated the risk to people from DRG in food to be "very small", and commented that
<P>

<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para11">The trend for the Department is downward but part of the explanation for the decreasing trend in departmental expenditure is the adoption of a new definition of consultancy, agreed by Ministers during 1997-98 and implemented in-year. This definition removed confusion between contracted services and consultancy proper; the figures for earlier years are therefore artificially inflated by including some doubtful categories. The significant reduction in 1998-99 is explained by being the first full year in which this distinction had been made.

[151464]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Care Standards Commission will regulate a wide range of social care and independent healthcare providers. Regulations and national minimum standards are being developed to reflect the different nature of each of the services to be regulated. Depending on the nature of the service being provided, a resuscitation policy will be required for some providers but not others. For example we will require independent healthcare providers to have a resuscitation policy in which patients' rights are central, which is readily available to staff, patient's relatives and carers, and of which staff are informed. These policies will have to be kept under review to ensure their continued effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para12">We published the national minimum standards for "Care Homes for Older People" on 2 March. These require care home providers to discuss with service users their wishes concerning terminal care. The standards also require them to provide staff with first aid training or employ nurses who will have basic life support training.
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para13">There will, however, be providers for whom a resuscitation policy will not be necessary, such as fostering agencies or voluntary adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="10306w17.html_para14">It will not be necessary to extend the requirements in National Health Service Circular 2000-028 to local authority social services departments as the providers they contract with will have to be registered by the commission and therefore required to meet the relevant standards. This new regulatory framework will also require local authority owned care homes to be registered for the first time and these too will be required to meet the national minimum standards.

 Legislation on false and misleading labelling is enforced by local authorities. We have issued guidelines to help enforcement officers tackle misleading origin labelling. We have also appointed a pigmeat verification officer to investigate misuse of 'British' labels on pork and pigmeat products. He has dealt with over 20 cases considered to be misleading to the consumer; in almost all cases the retailer and processor have either removed the product from the shelves or changed their labelling policy in line with Government guidelines.

<P>

 No such estimate has been made. However, the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force says that it appeared to them that the main reason for small and medium-sized abattoirs going out of business at that time was the level of meat inspection charges.
<P>

<a name="10306w18.html_para0">The level of meat inspection charges has not been the only reason for business closures. Other factors, such as market changes, would be a more likely explanation for the long-term decline in the number of red meat abattoirs (which in England and Wales fell from 1,056 in 1979 to 410 in 1997 and 351 at the end of last year).

 Information on the incidence of heart disease is not routinely available. We recognise the importance of better information, not least to ensure that we are able to identify and treat those with heart disease. That is why one of the early priorities for the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the systematic development and maintenance of practice-based CHD registers.
<P>

<a name="10306w19.html_para1">Data for the 25 health authorities with the highest rates of mortality from all circulatory disease, which includes all forms of heart disease, for men and women, are shown in the table. Information at council ward level on rates of death from specific causes is not collected.

<a name="10306w19.html_para2">Last week my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced new national health inequalities targets to reduce the health gap between children in different social classes and to reduce the difference in life expectancy between areas with the lowest life expectancy and the national average.

 The number of deaths from coronary heart disease for the under-65s in England has decreased from 17,140 in 1995 to 14,158 in 1999 (the latest year for which figures are available). Advances in technology, new investment and an increased focus on prevention should reduce this number still further.

<P>

<a name="10306w19.html_para3">Heart disease risk is cumulative. The risk of heart disease can be significantly reduced, even for those individuals with a family history of heart disease, by stopping smoking, eating a low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercising regularly.
<P>

<a name="10306w19.html_para4">Many of the factors which influence the occurrence of heart disease are linked back to inequalities. Last week my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced new national health inequalities targets to reduce the health gap between children in different social classes and to reduce the difference in life expectancy between areas with the lowest life expectancy and the national average. This is not a short-term process--but it is only by tackling inequalities now that we can impact on familial and hereditary factors in the future.

<a name="10306w20.html_para0">Effective co-operation between the Government and the Scottish Executive is vital to tackle the scourge of illegal drugs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has regular contact with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss a wide range of matters. The climate change levy will raise an estimated &#163;1 billion in its first year, all of which will be recycled back to business by a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' National Insurance contributions and &#163;150 million of spending on energy efficiency. The Government expect the levy to be broadly neutral between services and manufacturing.
<P>

<a name="10306w20.html_para1">The effect on any specific business, sector or region will depend on a number of factors, including their future energy consumption, the level of employment, eligibility for discounts, use of renewable or combined heat and power energy, and take up of enhanced capital allowances.

<P>

<a name="10306w20.html_para2">The Chancellor announced a variety of measures in his pre-Budget report in November last year which will help mitigate the effect of fuel prices on rural areas. These include: the reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty for cars up to 1500cc; the abolition of Vehicle Excise Duty for tractors and agricultural vehicles; a transitional rebate of 50 per cent. for HGV Vehicle Excise Duty; a 2p per litre cut in cleaner ultra-low sulphur petrol and a 3p per litre cut for ultra-low sulphur diesel. He has also announced more recently that any reduction in duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol that is announced in the Budget will be matched by a reduction in duty on unleaded petrol for a temporary period until 14 June 2001.

<a name="10306w20.html_para3">The continued roll out of ultra-low sulphur fuel across the country is being monitored regularly by the Department of Trade and Industry. The Government's objectives are to ensure that everyone should be able to share the environmental benefits of ultra-low sulphur fuel, and the benefits of the duty cut associated with it. The Government intend to match any reduction in duty on ultra-low sulphur fuel that is announced in the Budget with a reduction in duty on unleaded petrol for a temporary period until 14 June 2001 while ultra-low sulphur fuels are rolled out across the country.

 To answer the parliamentary question would incur disproportionate cost. Departments do not yet have systems in place to provide the data on the proportion of certified timber purchased over the last six months. The interdepartmental working group on timber procurement is working to develop a common reporting template, which will form the basis for the future reporting on timber procurement.

 The Broadcasting Act 1996 sets a 10 per cent. target for audio description to be reached by the 10th anniversary of the start of the digital terrestrial television (DTT) service. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) has set an interim target for at least 2 per cent. of programmes on DTT to be audio described by the start of the second year of the service. The BBC's policy is to at least match these targets. I understand from the ITC that the 2 per cent. target has been met, except by those channels which have been granted special exemption.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if the powers of Ofcom as proposed in the White Paper, "A New Future for Communications", will include the provision to ensure that television advertisements are accessible to deaf and hard-of- hearing people through the provision of closed caption subtitles.  [151850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w23.html_spnew0"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 It is intended that Ofcom will have the same general powers in respect of the provision of programmes for deaf and hard-of-hearing people that the Independent Television Commission (ITC) currently possesses under section 20 of the Broadcasting Act 1996. There are at present no statutory requirements for advertisements to be subtitled on digital terrestrial television; indeed they are specifically excluded from the definition of "programme" under section 20(14). The ITC does not therefore monitor the level of subtitling in advertisements but has advised my Department that about 50 to 60 per cent. of advertisers currently subtitle advertisements voluntarily.

 My Department recently published the results of a review of the statutory requirements for the provision of subtitling, sign language and audio description services on digital terrestrial television(DTT), which included our intention to raise the level of subtitling on DTT from 50 per cent. to 80 per cent. The Independent Television Commission, which is responsible under the Broadcasting Act 1990 for setting targets on analogue services, have separately undertaken to review the feasibility of Channel 3 and Channel 4 increasing subtitling beyond 80 per cent. in respect of these services before the end of 2001.

We have also been working together with the Department for Education and Employment to develop a number of initiatives to improve opportunities for children to enjoy sport in schools including an intention to offer school children an entitlement to two hours per week of high-quality PE and sporting activity within and around the school day. We are consulting on how best to do this. In addition, DCMS is part of the Inter-Ministerial Group to Improve Children's Diet and Activity which is considering cross-departmental action to promote the health benefits of physical activity and to tackle the increasing levels of obesity.

<a name="10306w23.html_para6">The first strand of the new arrangements is an improved defined benefit scheme. Employer contributions to this will be the same as for the existing defined benefit scheme, with the entire cost of the changes met through an increase in the member contribution rate. The second strand of the new arrangements is a defined contribution plan (delivered through stakeholder pension products). Employers will make contributions to this according to the age of the scheme member. In addition to the age-related contribution, the employer will match employee contributions to a maximum of 3 per cent. of pensionable pay. The Government Actuary has not yet finalised the contribution scale for the defined contribution plan, but the scale will be commensurate with the costs to employers of the new defined benefit option for those expected to be attracted to the defined contribution plan.

We have taken steps to improve the management and effectiveness of the services we provide and to meet customer needs, including working closely with other agencies to provide a fair, swift and effective system of justice, improve the availability of affordable and good quality legal services and to improve the lives of children and help build and sustain strong families.

<a name="10306w25.html_para7">The Vale of Clwyd is covered by Denbighshire Community Legal Service Partnership (CLSP). There are currently 165 CLSPs throughout England and Wales. Fifteen of these are based in Wales.
<P>

<a name="10306w25.html_para8">Within Denbighshire 10 solicitor firms and two not-for-profit organisations have been awarded contracts whose total value amounts to over &#163;273,000. The contracts cover a range of categories, including family, debt, housing and welfare benefits.

<a name="10306w25.html_para9">Eleven of the organisations are based within the Vale of Clwyd constituency area and predominantly provide services to residents covered by the towns of Rhyl and Denbigh. Although one provider, South Denbighshire CAB, is based outside the Vale of Clwyd, its services can still be accessed by people living within the Vale of Clwyd.
<P>

<a name="10306w25.html_para10">All 12 organisations above are holders of the Community Legal Service Quality Mark. In addition, the award of a specialist level Quality Mark is imminent for the Welfare Rights Unit at Denbighshire County Council, and should be issued no later than May 2001. North Denbighshire CAB has submitted an application at the General Help level and is due to be audited at the beginning of April 2001.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the changes which would be required in the budget of the Community Legal Service for civil cases for each 5 per cent. increase in solicitors' remuneration in criminal cases; and how many people requiring support for civil cases would be affected by each 5 per cent. increase.  [152063]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10306w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Each 5 per cent. increase in remuneration for all categories of criminal legal aid would cost around &#163;42 million, and would reduce the ability of the Legal Services Commission to support about 75,000 acts of assistance in civil matters.
