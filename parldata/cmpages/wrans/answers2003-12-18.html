<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps are being taken to encourage <i>(a)</i> the use of alternative crops and <i>(b)</i> non-farming livelihoods in the Afghan provinces.  [144859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 We are providing more than &#163;20 million over three years to our livelihoods programme in Afghanistan. This includes funding a Research in Alternative Livelihoods Project, (&#163;3 million over three years) designed to help the rural poor in Afghanistan build new ways of making a living. Research grants will be given to organisations, which put forward innovative ideas for the development and promotion of new farming and non-farming opportunities in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para0">Workshops will be held to share lessons learnt and information gathered by the projects being funded with other rural development projects across Afghanistan. We are also building the capacity of key Ministries to enable the Afghan Government to support the new livelihoods opportunities and engage with the local communities through newly established development councils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of the UK target figure for the Global Fund his Department has pledged for 2004&#150;05.  [141501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 For the financial year 2004&#150;05 we will provide &#163;30 million and have extended our current commitment through to 2008 bringing our total planned contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS TB and Malaria (GFATM) to US$280 million.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para1">At the 6th Board meeting of the Global Fund held in October, members of the Board of the Global Fund voted to move to a periodic replenishment model on a voluntary basis for all public donors, complemented by additional ad hoc donations. This is now the agreed system for contributions to the Global Fund and should put the Fund on a firmer financial footing.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para2">Future UK funding will be subject to the GFATM reflecting a clear poverty focus, achieving a better financing system, integrating the Fund's activities more effectively with national programmes and meeting agreed benchmarks to monitor its effectiveness. We have been working closely with the Fund on all of these issues and made some good progress at the recent Board meeting held in October&#151;particularly on improving the financing system by moving to a more reliable system of 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2003 : Column 1004W</I><P>
replenishment based on commonly agreed performance measures. Good results will encourage increased contributions to the Global Fund&#151;both from the UK and, importantly, from the wider international community and this will help to ensure its future as an effective instrument to tackle these terrible diseases.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para3">Our contribution to the GFATM reflects only part of the UK's significant contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. At country level, DFID has committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to strengthening health systems so that better care and drugs can be delivered. Our commitment to HIV/AIDS is demonstrated by the increase in bilateral spending from &#163;38 million in 1997&#150;98 to over &#163;270 million in 2003&#150;04. We are now intensifying our efforts to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the recently published "Call for Action", we state that we will make HIV/AIDS a priority for the extra &#163;320 million the UK will be devoting to development in Africa by 2006. We will also double our core funding of UNAIDS.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para4">We also contribute to other global partnerships, which work on different aspects of these diseases. For example DFID has contributed &#163;48 million over four years (1999&#150;2003) to Roll Back Malaria, a global partnership which aims to halve the world's malaria burden by 2010. This financial year we are providing some &#163;1.2 million in support for public private partnerships to develop a new generation of affordable drugs required for malaria control. DFID plays a major role in supporting TB control and the adoption of good practice in countries such as India, Russia, Zambia, Nepal, Bolivia and South Africa. The UK is also a member of the coordinating Board of the global Stop TB partnership and in 2002&#150;03 we provided &#163;0.75 million to the partnership.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the implications of the introduction of compulsory identity cards for his Department.  [142950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 There has been no assessment made.

<a name="31218w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Iraq (Medicines)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_wqn3"><B> Tom Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on shortages of <i>(a)</i> antisera (anti-snake venom) and <i>(b)</i> anti-cancer medicines in Iraq.  [143935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Assessments by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Iraqi Ministry of Health earlier in the autumn indicated that there are no major shortages of essential medical supplies in Iraq. There are however still reported shortages of some very specialised supplies including antisera (ie anti snake venom) and some anti-cancer medicines.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para5">A great deal has already been achieved to re-establish drug systems in Iraq. The initial focus was, rightly, on securing adequate supplies of the most essential and most used medicines and vaccines. On 27 October, the Iraqi Ministry of Health estimated that 15,000 tons of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies had been delivered in 150 days. However, new supply systems are 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2003 : Column 1005W</I><P>
not yet fully operational. Until these are in place, including comprehensive accounting and reporting processes to ensure that needs are identified before shortages arise, some problems will continue to occur.
<P>

<a name="31218w01.html_para6">Work is currently underway in the Iraqi Ministry of Health to develop a national drug formulary. This will enable improved sourcing of drugs and a new purchasing structure which will facilitate the arrival of some drugs which were almost non-existent under the old regime, including top-tier cancer drugs and other advanced pharmaceuticals. Work is also being done by the Ministry of Health, CPA and WHO to develop a complete overview of missing drugs and supplies. This is scheduled to finish in three months.

<P>
6. <a name="31218w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Borrow: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent discussions he has had on financial incentives for private healthcare.  [144721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I have met BUPA and others. We estimate the cost of financial incentives for private medical insurance, including tax relief on private medical insurance and vouchers for private healthcare, at &#163;2 billion.

<a name="31218w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Council Tax</H3>


<P>
19. <a name="31218w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McWalter: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what mechanisms are available to him to ensure that the resources he makes available to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the 2004&#150;05 settlement for local authorities will generate council tax rises in that year no higher than the rate of inflation.  [144734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The extra resources for local authorities announced in November and in the pre-Budget report amount to an additional &#163;760 million for local government on top of previously planned increases in grant. Following the provision of these substantial extra resources provided, excessive increases should not be necessary, but the Government have capping powers and are prepared to use them to protect local taxpayers from excessive council tax rises imposed by local authorities.

<a name="31218w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Information Technology</H3>


<P>
20. <a name="31218w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bacon: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer until what date and for how much money his Department has given financial commitments in relation to the funding of the National Programme for information technology in the health service.  [144735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Although programmes of this scale do need Treasury approval, the Treasury does not commit funding to individual projects. It is for the Department of Health to ensure that the national programme for information technology is affordable within its budget, without pre-empting the results of future spending reviews.

<P>
<a name="31218w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on Equitable Life.  [144738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Equitable Life's most recent interim accounts, which reflected its position as at 30 June 2003, confirmed that it remained solvent. However, the interim accounts also refer to the fact that it continues to face fundamental uncertainties over its mis-selling liabilities and, like all market participants, has had to operate in difficult economic conditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have met BUPA and others to hear representations on private medical insurance. The Government believe that the best way to fund healthcare is through general taxation and that delivery of healthcare should be on the basis of clinical need not ability to pay.

<a name="31218w02.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress has been made against the EU target for biofuels to reach two per cent. of the petrol and diesel market by December 2005.  [144771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The EU Biofuels Directive (2003/30/EC) requires member states to set indicative targets for sales of biofuels for 2005 and 2010, and provides reference values of 2 per cent. and 5.75 per cent. respectively. Member states must report to the Commission by 1 July 2004, indicating the level of their national indicative targets for 2005.
<P>

<a name="31218w02.html_para2">Current sales of biofuels in the UK are around two million litres a month, which is approximately 0.05 per cent. of the transport fuels market. This represents a dramatic increase since the position prior to July 2002, when the 20 pence per litre fuel duty incentive for biodiesel came into effect.
<P>

<a name="31218w02.html_para3">The Department for Transport will be consulting in early 2004 on its plans for implementing the Directive.

<P>
<a name="31218w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The resources available to the British Transport Police (BTP) are a matter for the BTP Committee, which overseas the Force and sets its budget. The rail industry is responsible for providing the necessary funding for the Force. In addition to this funding Government has agreed to provide the BTP in 2003&#150;04 with an additional &#163;1.5 million for anti-terrorist response vehicles in London.

 An announcement will be made following full consideration. The Highways Agency is developing proposals for the section of the A21 between Kippings Cross and Lamberhurst. This area is particularly sensitive in environmental terms and it is important to achieve a balance between the impact on the environment and the impact on those living beside the existing route.

<a name="31218w03.html_para3">As regards anti-drink-driving measures, the law has been changed to make drivers who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs take an extended driving test and the maximum penalty for this offence will shortly be increased from 10 to 14 years' imprisonment. Blood samples may now be taken from unconscious, hospitalised drivers suspected of committing drink-drive offences in order to make it easier to prosecute them. The option of referring drink-drive offenders to rehabilitation courses has been extended to courts throughout Great Britain as a means of reducing re-offending. The Government's drink-driving publicity campaigns are being extended to run at different times and in a variety of media throughout the year, rather than just at Christmas and in the summer.

<a name="31218w04.html_para4">In England, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) conducted a Municipal Waste Management Survey in 2001&#150;02 which estimated that 292,900 abandoned vehicles were removed and destroyed by local authorities.

 It is not possible to estimate how many vehicles will be abandoned in the period leading up to January 2007, from which time producers will be required to take back end of life vehicles at no cost to the owner.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The national Air Quality Strategy, published in 2000, sets a one hour mean air quality objective for nitrogen dioxide of 200 micrograms per cubic metre not be exceeded more than 18 times per year and an annual mean of 40 micrograms per cubic metre, both to be achieved by 31 December 2005. These objectives, together with objectives for six other air pollutants, are prescribed in the Air Quality (England) Regulations 2000. Local authorities are required to review and assess the objectives and, where these are unlikely to be met, to work towards the achievement. European Council Directive 99/30/EC sets similar limit values for nitrogen dioxide which members states are required to achieve by 2010. The limit values have been implemented by the Air Quality Limit Values Regulations 2003.

<P>
<a name="31218w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 I regret that the error was made. Defra figures are only one of a number of sources of information available to the market and individual buyers and sellers have to use their own commercial judgment. Although there was an initial increase of approximately &#163;5 per tonne immediately following publication of corrected figures, this had reduced by about half within a few days with the price back on trend. This reflects the UK's position as a price taker rather than a price maker in an international commodity market. UK production is only about 13 per cent. of EU production, and EU production is just over 20 per cent. of world production. On average, however, wheat prices this year are now some &#163;50 per tonne higher than at the same period last year. They have risen steadily throughout the marketing season in response to serious reductions in supply elsewhere in Europe as a result of heat and drought in the summer. This has also coincided with a tighter global market which has seen world wheat prices at their highest levels in recent years. There was no

<P>
<a name="31218w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

In addition, the existing procedures for checking results will be strengthened and a risk assessment process will be instituted to ensure that potential problems are identified.

 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Estimating the size of the annual wheat harvest depends on information from a number of different sources gathered over time. A provisional estimate of planted area is normally published in September based on a combination of census and IACS data. Provisional yield information in the form of a production estimate is normally published in October. Updated figures are normally published in November and January respectively.

<a name="31218w05.html_para2">A number of checks are in place to verify the information coming in from farmers, the processes and the credibility of the aggregate results. Unfortunately, the internal error in the calculation of this year's planted area figures was only discovered by Defra statisticians after the area results had been published, and a corrected Statistical Notice was therefore published on 1 December.

<a name="31218w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In 1998, this Government announced that no proposal for legislation, which has a potential to impact on business, the voluntary sector or charities, should be considered by Ministers without a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). Departments are required to undertake RIAs for all proposed regulations and policies, including environmental regulations, that impose a burden or realise a benefit to business, charities and the voluntary sector whether initiated by the UK or EU. The RIA includes an analysis of the costs of implementation and enforcement. It is an ex-ante appraisal and it is an explicit requirement that consideration is given to monitoring and review at the appraisal stage.
<P>

<a name="31218w06.html_para7">The RIA process will be strengthened further by the National Audit Office (NAO) taking on a new role as an independent evaluator of selected RIAs. The NAO will focus on the quality of analysis in the RIAs and the thoroughness with which the RIAs have been undertaken. The findings and recommendations of best practice will be fed back to Departments.
<P>

<a name="31218w06.html_para8">All RIAs published by Government Departments since January 2001 can be accessed via the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit website (http://www. cabinet-office.gov.uk/regulation/index.htm).
<P>

<a name="31218w06.html_para9">The responsibility for assessing the cost and enforcement of EU environmental regulations in other member states rests with individual member states.

<a name="31218w06.html_para10">In June 2002 the European Commission adopted an Action Plan for Better Regulation, in which it committed itself to the introduction of a two-stage impact assessment process, covering the economic, social and environmental impacts of policy proposals, the phased implementation of which started earlier in 2003. Impact assessment is to be applied to all proposals listed in the Annual Policy Strategy or Work Programme. All proposals will be subject to preliminary assessment, with some proposals being selected for extended assessment.
<P>

<a name="31218w06.html_para11">The European Commission produces an annual survey on the implementation and enforcement of environmental Community law within existing member states.

Some farmers may also have received market support payments, though these are available to traders as well. In addition, farmers benefited from the effect of the market regimes and import tariffs, which kept the price of many commodities in the EU higher than elsewhere. Questions regarding payment of direct grants and subsidies in Wales should be directed to the devolved authorities in Wales.

 We have concluded the environmental risk assessment of deca-BDE carried out under the Existing Substances Regulation (EC) 793/93 and forwarded it to other Member States. Initial discussion has agreed that for the standard risk assessment, no further information nor risk management measures are needed. However, further data, not mandated by the Regulation, is available and this cannot be ignored. This information is of concern but it is not possible at this stage to conclude that there is a clear and unambiguous risk. It was therefore further agreed that the UK should recommend a monitoring programme, which will provide information as to the changing levels of deca-BDE in the environment. We are expecting levels to go down as industry controls its emissions more effectively. The environmental risk assessment is still being discussed within the European process and the final conclusion will ultimately be for the Community.

 One of the opportunities provided by the proposed Animal Welfare Bill would be the possibility of introducing codes of practice, including a code on the rearing of gamebirds, which would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The codes would support a statutory duty to promote the welfare of animals kept by man. The code on gamebirds would better regulate the methods, including bits and specs, used in rearing. It is not known how many companies currently use bits and what the costs and benefits of employing specs are.

 The European Commission has proposed that the rate of compulsory arable set-aside be reduced from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. for the 2004&#150;05 EU marketing year. The proposal has been made in order to try to restore a more normal balance of supply in response to serious reductions in this year's cereals harvest as a result of prolonged hot weather and drought in Central and Southern Europe in the summer.
<P>

<a name="31218w08.html_para9">The Commission estimates that the measure will increase the supply of cereals by around 7 million tonnes. It is not clear what the impact will be in the UK. There is normally around 400,000 hectares of land in compulsory set-aside each year, with a further and more variable area being set aside voluntarily. In theory, up to 200,000 hectares of additional land could be cropped in 2004 increasing UK cereal production by 1.4 million tonnes based on average yields. In practice, however, the additional output is likely to be significantly lower than this as the proposal has been made after many farmers have finalised their cropping plans for next season.
<P>

<a name="31218w08.html_para10">Reducing the rate of compulsory set-aside may also have some impact on the environmental benefits which can be derived from uncultivated land, though it is difficult to assess this without knowing what land may be put back into cropping.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> In April 2002, the Department published new "Climate Change Scenarios for the UK". The scenarios do not contain an analysis of the changes in the number of snowfall days, but show that climate change will cause the amount of snowfall to decline significantly throughout the UK in the future. By the 2080s, large areas of the UK are likely to experience quite long sequences of snowless winters. Coastal areas and the English lowlands are likely to show the largest percentage reductions (up to 90 per cent. or more by the 2080s compared to 1961&#150;1990 baseline), while the Scottish Highlands and parts of Northern Ireland may experience smaller percentage reductions (50 per cent. or less).

<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Blackhead is not a notifiable disease so it is not possible to provide an accurate figure for the number of cases. Of the cases diagnosed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in 2003 most have been in back-yard turkey flocks of under 100 birds, with a very small number of turkey flocks of under 2,000 birds also affected. We are not aware of disease in any larger turkey flocks.

<P><I>18 Dec 2003 : Column 1033W</I><P>
had discussions with the Environment Agency and attended a meeting at the Agency's Huntingdon office on 24 July 2003. During that meeting, Mr. Donovan was advised that there was a possibility that his plant would be subject to the Waste Incineration Directive and the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (the PPC Regulations). Following the meeting, this advice was confirmed in a letter to Mr. Donovan of 13 August 2003. The letter also stated that the plant may fall within the regulatory remit of the appropriate local authority in England and Wales or the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), depending on where the plant would be located.

<a name="31218w09.html_para3">Prior to transposition of the Waste Incineration Directive at the end of 2002 it was difficult for the Environment Agency to be able to provide firm advice to every operator on whether they would be subject to it However, my Department consulted on draft Regulations and Directions during the summer of 2002. The transposition of the Waste Incineration Directive and the publication by my Department of draft "Guidance on the Directive 2000/76/EC on the Incineration of Waste" was publicised through articles in the trade press and at a ministerial press conference in January 2003.

<P>
<a name="31218w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) sets out a range of measures on the management of waste&#151;including its collection and disposal. These measures include Article 8 which requires that "any holder of waste has it handled by a private or public waste collector"; and Article 15 which provides that "In accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, the cost of disposing of waste must be borne by the holder who has it handled by a waste collector."

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what high temperature incineration capacity she estimates the UK will require when provisions of the Landfill Directive relating to hazardous waste are implemented in the UK.  [143283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Current high temperature incineration capacity (HTI) in the UK is approximately 110,000 tonnes per annum. Work undertaken for the Hazardous Waste Forum suggests that the demand for HTI is likely to increase, but that the level of any increase is dependent on a number of factors, not least future arisings of hazardous waste. The Forum continues to keep these issues under review, in particular through the treatment and capacity task force.

 Waste Strategy 2000 provided five estimates of waste management options over the period 2000 to 2020. A 'base case' was modelled so that the additional cost of meeting the landfill targets for biodegradable waste and the waste strategy goals could 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2003 : Column 1035W</I><P>
be calculated. The other four models provided different mixes of recycling, composting and incineration and the additional capacity required for those facilities under each option.
<P>

<a name="31218w09.html_para8">Cases 3 and 4 (increasing levels of recycling and composting with some incineration with energy recovery) were designed to meet the waste strategy targets, as well as the requirements of the Landfill Directive.
<P>

<a name="31218w09.html_para9">The actual figures for additional capacity can be seen in annex C in Part Two of Waste Strategy 2000 (table C8 on page 194). A copy of the strategy is in the House of Common's Library and can also be accessed through the Defra website at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategy/cm4693/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="31218w09.html_para10">Future hazardous waste treatment capacity required under the Landfill Directive depends in part on future arisings of hazardous waste. Currently some 5 million tonnes of hazardous waste is consigned each year in England and Wales. Analysis in support of the Hazardous Waste Forum shows that future arisings of hazardous waste will be affected, among other matters, by future levels of waste minimisation balanced against changes to the hazardous waste list. Nevertheless, the Landfill Directive requires all hazardous waste to be treated prior to landfill or to be dealt with in an alternative treatment option altogether, such as high temperature incineration or co-incineration. It is clear that new treatment plants for hazardous waste will be required, for example to solidify waste, and to enable hazardous waste to meet the landfill waste acceptance criteria under the Directive. The Hazardous Waste Forum is considering these issues and requirements in detail through its treatment and capacity task force.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average household water bill was in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> each English region in each financial year since 1996&#150;97.  [142272]<P>

 Water bills and sewerage bills are set separately by each water and sewerage company and water company in England and Wales. The boundaries of these companies do not conform to the boundaries between England and Wales nor to the boundaries between English regions. It is therefore not possible to provide the information on exactly the basis sought.
<P>

<a name="31218w10.html_para0">The average household water and sewerage bills in England and Wales in each financial year since 1996&#150;97 are set out as follows.

procedures. The equal pay questionnaire came into effect on 6 April 2003 and enables individuals to request key information from their employers right at the start when they are deciding whether to bring a case. The frequent lack of transparency on pay has helped perpetuate the gender pay gap. The questionnaire will help individuals, often women, to establish whether they actually are being paid less than their comparators and, if so, why. Establishing the key facts quickly could encourage the issues to be settled without resort to tribunal, benefiting both employers and employees. We are looking at further ways to speed up and simplify complex equal value cases and will be consulting on proposals shortly. The Government also believes that carrying out an equal pay review should be good business practice for every employer and has developed a number of initiatives to help them, including funding the Equal Opportunities Commission to develop equal pay tool kits.

 As a Government, we are committed to working in partnership with the trade union movement and others to tackle the barriers facing women in the workplace and reduce the gender pay gap. We provided additional funding of &#163;151,867 (on top of an initial &#163;145,000) to trade unions, for training representatives in equal pay issues in the workplace. The trade unions were fully consulted on the pay reviews of Civil Service Departments and supported the comprehensive guidance issued by the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office continues to have an open dialogue with the trades unions on progress across the Civil Service. We have a target that the Government will work with businesses and trade unions, the Equal Opportunities Commission and Opportunity Now towards ensuring that 35 per cent of large organisations have done pay reviews by 2006. We have provided the EOC with funds to take a sectoral approach to promoting equal pay reviews. We are also promoting pay reviews through the

 I am advised that the following sums have been allocated by England's Regional Development Agencies from their single programme budgets to the promotion of tourism and the arts in the specified years. However, the figures should be treated as estimates because there is no generally accepted definition of the arts and because they will not include projects funded by the RDAs, such as regeneration activity, where tourism or arts are fundamental to the project but are not the main consideration. Furthermore, as the RDAs do not have a specific responsibility to promote the arts, some RDAs do not record spend against a dedicated budget heading. Proposals for RDA funding to promote tourism and the arts are considered against the priorities set out in the region's Regional Economic Strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w15.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Children's Commissioner as proposed in the Green Paper will be an independent children's champion who will be a voice for children and young people, especially the disadvantaged and vulnerable. The Commissioner will play a crucial role in raising the profile of the issues that affect children, working with a wide range of bodies, such as local and national government, service providers, business, media and the voluntary sector, to ensure that children and young people are involved in the policy making process.
<P>

<a name="31218w15.html_para1">The Green Paper proposes that the Commissioner should work at a strategic level and would not investigate individual cases&#151;except where they have wider implications for all children as directed by the Secretary of State. Nor will the Commissioner have a complaints or specific advocacy function&#151;this will remain the responsibility of others. The Commissioner would work with the relevant Ombudsmen and statutory bodies to promote good practice and ensure that complaints procedures work and are quick and easy for children to access and follow.
<P>

<a name="31218w15.html_para2">The Commissioner would have a duty to report annually to Parliament on progress against the key outcomes set out in 'Every Child Matters', reflecting what children and young people have been saying.

<a name="31218w15.html_para3">Further details on the role and powers of the Commissioner are being developed in the light of the consultation which ended on 1 December, and legislation will be introduced to Parliament at the earliest opportunity.

An information campaign, run annually, aimed at potential higher education students and their parents informing them of the financial support available and how to apply for it;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31218w15.html_para5">Following the publication of the Higher Education White Paper in January 2003, the Department ran a campaign informing potential and existing higher education students and their parents that changes were being proposed and signposting them to sources of further information.
<P>

<a name="31218w15.html_para6">In 2002&#150;03 the Department spent &#163;8 million on higher education publicity campaigns of which &#163;3.2 million was spent on advertising. In 2003&#150;04 we expect to spend &#163;13.8 million of which &#163;6.08 million would be spent on advertising.

 The Department regularly runs advertising campaigns to explain to potential students and their parents what financial support is available to those undertaking higher education courses. The current 2003 campaign, (for those applying for September 2004 and which runs to the end of February 2004) is closely linked to the Government's wider Aimhigher campaign, designed to encourage young people from non-traditional backgrounds to apply for university. The total cost of advertising is &#163;682,000 which covers radio and poster advertising, and paid editorials.

 Funding for pre-school settings is rightly a matter for local determination in the light of local needs and circumstances. From April 2003, we have increased local flexibility and autonomy by consolidating the resources to enable local authorities to meet their statutory responsibilities to provide free nursery education for three and four year olds through the under-fives sub-block of their Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS)&#151;the main source of funding for education. In the current financial year, Devon's overall

under fives sub-block is worth nearly &#163;30 million. We calculate that more than &#163;6 million of additional ring-fenced funding is available to providers in Devon-through a variety of Sure Start funding streams administered by the local authority.

<P>

<a name="31218w16.html_para3">Each provider is contracted with separately, and fees vary for each provider. Each trainee is funded separately depending on their own unique set of circumstances. Providers are paid a one-off fee for each trainee that starts a course; these start at &#163;1,000 per trainee, rising to &#163;2,000 when the provider passes a pre-set threshold. Weekly fees are also paid for each trainee.
<P>

<a name="31218w16.html_para4">Additionally, providers are paid outcome payments; these are on a sliding scale ranging from &#163;4,000 for a job outcome within 40 weeks of starting training to &#163;1,000 for a job outcome after 12 months of finishing a training programme. Additional fees are also payable for specific support such as child care, tools, equipment, interpreters, readers, travel and special support for those with mental health problems.

 Grants are allocated to local authorities to support Sure Start initiatives. The Sure Start Unit is continually simplifying funding arrangements. Six separate funding streams for early years and child care have already been brought together in one simplified grant for 2003&#150;04 and the number of ring-fenced funds has been halved. Strategic Guidance issued to local authorities in July 2003 has confirmed that they will have greater flexibility in setting local priorities and use of funding. A new performance management system with a set of streamlined targets will be introduced from April 2004.
<P>

<a name="31218w16.html_para7">Funding for Sure Start local programmes is paid to the organisation nominated by the local partnership as the 'accountable body'. Annual revenue funding is approved by the Sure Start Unit, based on the programme's delivery plan. Capital funding is approved by the Sure Start Unit from submission of capital project plans. Payments for both capital and revenue funding are made on submission of quarterly funding claims.

July 2002, contains no proposals to introduce tolling in NI. It does, however, contain a commitment to monitor the impacts of fiscal demand management measures, such as road user charging.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para2">In the meantime, the issue of road congestion is being addressed as part of the wider transportation picture set out in the RTS. The RTS proposes that congestion be tackled through selected highway improvements and measures designed to encourage greater use of public transport, walking and cycling facilities. Overall it envisages &#163;427 million in strategic highway improvements, &#163;250 million on rail services, &#163;98 million on bus services and "park and ride" in Belfast and almost &#163;40 million on making it easier to walk or cycle. The actual level of resources invested in transportation will, however, depend on the normal budgetary processes, satisfactory economic appraisals and satisfactory progress through statutory processes (where relevant).

 The Department consulted both formally and informally on the Government's proposals for a Local Housing Allowance (LHA), which is now in operation or about to go-live in 9 "Pathfinder" local authorities.
<P>

representative bodies of landlords. SSAC made a number of recommendations, to which the Government responded. The relevant Command Paper, 5955 was presented to Parliament on 24 September 2003 and is available in the Library.

 The tariff income rules, whereby money is deducted from benefit in respect of capital, are not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing that capital.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para8">The capital rules within the income related benefits exist to ensure that help is targeted on those with least resources while not completely denying help for those who have moderate amounts of capital. Where customers have substantial capital, current rules ensure that some of those funds are used for their maintenance before their needs can be met from public funds. The tariff income rules are designed to avoid a "cliff edge" effect which would occur if there was a simple capital limit beyond which benefit is completely withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para9">We have made it clear that we will keep the treatment of capital in the income related benefits under review so that they strike a reasonable balance between providing targeted support for those who need it and not penalising those who have acted responsibly by saving.

<P>
<a name="31218w22.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 One of the Government's key priorities is to tackle pensioner poverty. We want all pensioners to have a secure income in retirement and to share in the rising prosperity of the country.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para10">Our strategy is already working. Compared with the 1997 system, as a result of Government measures, from April 2004, on average pensioner households will be &#163;1,250 a year better off in real terms. Our target is, that by 2006, Pension Credit should be in payment to at least 3 million pensioner households.

 The information requested is not available.

<P>
<a name="31218w22.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government are committed to extending opportunities for older workers and to introducing age discrimination legislation in 2006. Under the legislation, compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful unless employers can show that they are objectively justified.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para12">In the meantime, our Age Positive campaign is encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practises. Through Age Positive, we are promoting the business benefits of an age diverse workforce by encouraging employers to adopt the voluntary Code of Practice, "Age Diversity at Work, A Practical Guide For Business". Over 750,000 copies of the Age Positive Code have been issued to employers and individuals and it is available on the Age Positive website, which has 75,000 visits per month.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para13">The Age Positive campaign is widely promoted to employers and individuals through advertising, the website and press features in national, local and specialist publications and at exhibitions and workshops for employers. Age Positive awards help to further publicise the achievements of businesses and individuals who conquer age prejudice.
<P>

<a name="31218w22.html_para14">Age Positive also works closely with organisations such the Federation of Small Businesses, Employers Forum on Age, Institute of Directors, TUC, CBI and Age Concern.

 The move to Direct Payment and the introduction of universal banking services has resulted in a number of benefits for individuals and the communities in which they live, particularly in terms of increasing customer choice, helping to address financial exclusion and improving access to banking for all.

<a name="31218w23.html_para4">The new arrangements ensure a more modern, efficient and reliable service that increases customer choice, provides better value for the taxpayer, cuts fraud, and boosts financial inclusion. More customers are now paid into an account than by order book or girocheque.

There are a number of advantages to having a bank or building society account and over 85 per cent. of DWP customers already have access to a suitable account with the figure rising to 90 per cent. for pensioners. But this currently leaves around 3.5 million adults in the UK without access to a bank account and not able to take advantage of, for example, the savings to utility bills that come through making payments by Direct Debit from an account. Direct Payment will help spread financial inclusion by increasing the number of people who have bank accounts and giving them opportunities to benefit&#151;this includes the new easy to operate basic bank accounts.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The existing computer system contains little validation around data entry and we have been progressively working through certain fields to ensure that apparent anomalies, inaccuracies or incomplete data are corrected. In designing and developing computer support for the new Child Support arrangements we created a series of 'business rules' designed to ensure the accuracy of data flowing from one system to the other. We have not yet finalised our data migration strategy or the timetable for that work. In doing so we will need to establish what business rules are applied at the point of migration and what data cleanse activity might sensibly be deferred until later in the process. In making this judgement our prime aim will be to ensure that clients gain the most accurate possible calculation and have a clear and responsive channel open to them to challenge and/or correct any errors.

<a name="31218w24.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Donohoe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what checks the Government have in place continually to assess a person's eligibility for the disability living allowance in order to protect the system against fraudulent claims.  [141960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The DLA Periodic Enquiry has introduced checks of Disability Living Allowance awards to ensure that those entitled to the benefit receive, and continue to receive, their correct entitlement, although it is not regarded primarily as an anti fraud measure.
<P>

<a name="31218w24.html_para6">The process involves gathering up-to-date evidence about the customer's care and mobility needs, and making adjustments to the award of the benefit where appropriate. Changes in awards may be appropriate for example where the customer's condition improves or worsens, or where they adapt to their disability and therefore have fewer needs. Since the inception of Periodic Enquiry, 70 per cent. of the cases examined have resulted in no change to entitlement. Of the 30 per cent. of cases where the level of entitlement changed, two thirds resulted in entitlement to a higher level of award and in the remaining one third of cases entitlement either reduced or was extinguished altogether.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w25.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans the Government have to re-instate the full guaranteed minimum pension for members of final salary schemes where the assets of the scheme are insufficient to buy the full amount of guaranteed minimum pension when the scheme is wound-up.  [144076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w25.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Members of contracted-out occupational pension schemes can already, in certain circumstances, have some or all of their state scheme rights restored for the period they were contracted-out.
<P>

<a name="31218w25.html_para2">Deemed buyback&#151;the mechanism for restoring members' guaranteed minimum pensions&#151;was introduced as part of the Pensions Act 1995. Deemed buyback can be applied when the date the scheme started to wind up is on or after 6 April 1997. It is dependant on the scheme meeting certain conditions.
<P>

<a name="31218w25.html_para3">Where deemed buyback applies, the Inland Revenue can accept a lower amount from underfunded schemes than it would normally cost to restore the individual's rights in the state scheme. The actual transfer value held for each scheme member for whom deemed buyback applies is paid to the Inland Revenue, with the result of either the remainder being "deemed", or the member's rights being partially instead of fully restored, thereby extinguishing the scheme's liability to provide the member with contracted-out benefits.
<P>

<a name="31218w25.html_para4">The final decision to buyback into the state scheme will be taken by the individual scheme member.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w25.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide accurate estimates of the number of people entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension or those who might not receive their full entitlement in these circumstances. In order to produce such estimates, data on individual schemes' funding positions would be required. However, detailed information on this area is not available from existing data sources. Funding position information is particularly hard to obtain, given that it is highly sensitive to investment decisions and conditions in financial markets.
<P>

<a name="31218w25.html_para5">The Pensions Schemes Registry (PSR), administered by the Occupational Pension Schemes Regulatory Authority (OPRA), holds information on the number of final salary schemes which are currently in the winding-up process and the number of schemes which have entered and completed winding-up. The registry database is, however, limited in a number of ways as described in the following footnote. Consequently, it does not provide a continuous record of the status of schemes, though it nevertheless remains the most comprehensive source of information available on the aggregate number of pension schemes in the UK.

The pilots are managed and run by Jobcentre Plus. From January 2004 one key element of the reforms, the condition management programmes, will be delivered in collaboration with NHS Primary Care Trusts (local health boards, in Wales). In some pilot areas the NHS may decide to contract with local providers from the private/voluntary sector in order to meet service demands.

<P>

<a name="31218w25.html_para12">The percentage of people leaving New Deal for Young People for sustained employment may be distorted by the trend in leavers to unknown destinations, which has been steadily increasing since 1998.

<P>
<a name="31218w26.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Pensions Bill will include proposals to protect employees' on-going pension rights when affected by business transfer.
<P>

<a name="31218w26.html_para3">TUPE Regulations do not currently provide any protection for employees' on-going occupational pension rights when businesses transfer. However, proposed legislation will require transferee employers to provide transferred employees, who were in an occupational pension scheme with the transferor employer, with either a defined benefit, defined contribution or stakeholder pension scheme. In addition, if the transferee employer sets up a defined contribution or stakeholder scheme, they must match employees' contributions up to 6 per cent. with more from either party at their discretion.
<P>

<a name="31218w26.html_para4">The proposed debt on the employer regulations, published on 11 June 2003, will improve protection of employees' accrued rights if their scheme is wound up when their company is solvent. Legislation currently provides that, when a defined-benefit occupational pension scheme winds up, a deficiency in the pension fund becomes a debt on the employer. The proposed regulations will strengthen this protection by requiring that debt be calculated on the basis that a scheme wound up when the sponsoring employer is solvent should be able to meet the full costs of the rights accrued by scheme members.

 We are committed to extending opportunities for older workers. Our Green Paper 'Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement', December 2002, outlined a number of incentives to help implement flexible retirement ages.
<P>

<a name="31218w27.html_para0">From 2005, we propose changing the tax rules to allow people to continue working for the sponsoring employer while drawing their occupational pension .

This will include making compulsory retirement ages unlawful except in those cases where employers can show they are objectively justified. We will work with employers and representative groups to develop best practice and ensure that occupational pension rules do not discourage flexible working.
<P>

<a name="31218w27.html_para2">In addition to this our Age Positive Campaign will continue to work closely with employers promoting and building on the known business benefits of recruiting and retaining older workers as part of an age diverse workforce.

[145130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w27.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our Green Paper 'Simplicity security and choice: Working and saving for retirement', in December 2002 set out our proposals for supporting flexible retirement and greater choice and opportunity for people to work up to and beyond state pension age where they wish.
<P>

<a name="31218w27.html_para4">In response there was widespread support for flexible approaches to retirement, where that is based on individual choice and enables employers to retain experience and skills. Over 90 per cent. of respondents agreed with the proposal for individuals to be able to draw their occupational pension and continue working for the sponsor employer, with support coming from employers, individuals and representative organisations.
<P>

<a name="31218w27.html_para5">Through our Age Positive campaign employers are increasingly expressing their support for removing compulsory retirement ages. However, some employers feel that retirement ages should be retained; the Department for Trade and Industry has been consulting on proposals for age legislation covering employment and are currently assessing the responses to inform a further consultation in 2004 on draft regulations.

It has not yet done so and we do not expect it to do so for another 2&#150;3 years.
<P>

<a name="31218w28.html_para2">The UK continues to press its view&#151;with the Commission and our EU partners&#151;that maximum levels should be set on a safety basis. Our overseas posts have been kept informed of the follow-up to the Directive and have been asked to echo our general line with their own contacts.

 The answer is as follows:
<P>

<a name="31218w28.html_para3">225 (3.8 per cent.) Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff contribute to a charity through the Give as You Earn scheme. The average total contribution is about &#163;6,710 a month. In addition, many staff overseas give their time and money generously to local charities. We encourage staff to support their chosen charities through this scheme and have recently taken a number of steps to give it a greater profile, including information on the FCO intranet, a mail shot to all posts and dissemination of publicity posters.

<P>
<a name="31218w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government have not directly commissioned any research into the increase in student applications. However, the British Council, which is partly funded by the FCO, has recently carried out research on the results of the Prime Minister's Initiative for international student recruitment which was launched in June 1999. Current indications are that the increases in the number of foreign student visa applications result from the success of the PMI marketing campaign aimed at attracting foreign nationals to study in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="31218w29.html_para1">In 2000 there were 125,139 student applications of which 16.1 per cent. fell for refusal.
<P>

<a name="31218w29.html_para2">In 2002&#150;03 there were 181,905 student applications of which 28.9 per cent. fell for refusal.
<P>

<a name="31218w29.html_para3">All visa applications are assessed individually on their own merits so it is not possible to draw any general conclusions for the rise in the refusal rate. Possible factors might include the abolition of pre-assessment by UK visas (under which applicants who were unlikely to be successful were given the option to withdraw before the application was formally made) and improved methods of detecting forged documents.

 We condemn instances where individuals or groups are persecuted because of their religion or belief. Where we believe a state to be in breach of its obligations in international human rights law, such as the obligation in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, we take action, either alone or with our EU partners, on a case by case basis. Through our biannual Freedom of Religion Panel we work closely with NGOs and representatives of religious groups to identify countries and cases of particular concern. Our Annual Report on Human Rights highlights states which we believe to be the worst violators of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This list is by no means exhaustive, but we do not believe that a league-table approach to human rights violations would add value to the important work already undertaken by NGOs in this field.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs pursuant to his Answer of 10 December, <i>Official Report</i>, column 457W, on the Census (1911), what powers the Lord Chancellor has under the Public Records Act 1958 to release details from the 1911 census before 2011; and what conditions concerning confidentiality were agreed to by those who participated in this census.

 Section 5(1) of the 1958 Public Records Act provided for the general release of records after 50 years, and this was reduced in 1967 to 30 years. This section of the Public Records Act gives the Lord Chancellor the power to vary the normal closure period in relation to specific classes of records with the approval, or at the request, of the relevant minister.
<P>

<a name="31218w29.html_para4">In 1966 the Lord Chancellor approved Instrument No.12, which sanctioned the closure of Decennial records for 100 years on the grounds that the information supplied by householders was given in strict confidence. The Open Government White paper (Cm 2290) of July 1993 recommended the retention of the 100 year closure period.

<a name="31218w29.html_para5">The conditions quoted on the 1911 Census Householder's Schedule give the following assurance of confidentiality: "The contents of the Schedule will be treated as confidential. Strict care will be taken that no information is disclosed with regard to individual persons.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs pursuant to his Answer of 8 December, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 350&#150;51W, on the Electoral Commission, how potential applicants for the position of Chair and/or member of the Electoral Commission were informed that an open competition would be held; and how many applicants indicated that they wished to be considered for the position of Chair.

<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The selection process for appointments for the position of Chair and/or member of the Electoral Commission began in April 2000 with publication in the press of advertisements inviting applications to fill the posts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn4"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many and what percentage of staff in his Department contribute to a charity through the Give as You Earn scheme; how much money is donated to charity per month by staff in his Department through the scheme; and what steps he is taking to encourage greater participation in the scheme by staff in his Department.  [143897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Currently, 534 members of staff in the Department for Constitutional Affairs contribute to charity via the Give as You Earn scheme. This represents a little over 4 per cent. of total staff in the Department. In November 2003 contributions to charity under the scheme totalled &#163;4,839. My Department has had discussions with "The Giving Campaign" to determine what more can be done to encourage contributing to charity through payroll, and as a first step we are planning in co-operation with them to promote the present arrangements in the Department's staff magazine early in the New Year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement on the implications for private practice in criminal work of the consolidation of the number of solicitors' firms to be supported under the legal aid franchise.  [144882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission manages contracts with solicitors' offices which provide a comprehensive national network of quality assured legal services. The Commission is obliged by statute to ensure it achieves value for money and has therefore recently announced its intention to further develop its approach to contracting CDS services. In major urban areas, where services are often supplied through a multiplicity of relatively small contracted offices, this is likely to result in a reduction in the number of contracted offices, each undertaking greater volumes of work, but no reduction in the overall availability of services to the public. Outside the major urban areas, and particularly in rural areas, the Commission will be looking to provide arrangements which support and encourage supply in ways which recognise the need for access to quality services and the particular challenges facing solicitors in these areas.

<a name="31218w30.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Mental Incapacity Bill</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what account is being taken in the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill of measures to improve support for people with learning disabilities requiring help to reach decisions affecting their future health needs.  [144958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Draft Mental Incapacity Bill will greatly improve decision making for people with learning disabilities by setting out the key principles that everyone must be assumed to have capacity and that 'all practicable steps' must be taken to help people make their own decisions. This will provide empowerment for people with learning difficulties in all decision making.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn7"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what his plans are for the draft Bill on mental incapacity; and what his policy is on the timing of that draft Bill in relation to the revised Mental Health Bill.  [142111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 A draft Mental Incapacity Bill was scrutinised by a Joint Committee during the summer and their report was published on 28 November. My Department is working together with the Department of Health and stakeholders to consider the Committee's recommendations. We will seek to introduce the Bill in the current session of Parliament. With regard to the revised Mental Health Bill, there is no relationship between the timings of the two Bills, but I am aware that the Mental Health Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny early next week. My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Health to ensure that the proposals are consistent with each other.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement on progress in expanding the role of the Public Defender Service.  [144881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission opened two further Public Defender Service offices in 2003, making a total of eight offices. There are no current plans to open further offices before the end of the four-year pilot in 2005. But the Government and the LSC have always said that the PDS provides a flexible option to deliver criminal defence services where existing provision is low, or of poor quality. We will review the future role of the PDS in the provision of criminal defence services, taking into consideration the researchers' evaluations of the PDS.

<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what steps are being taken to develop and produce accurate measures of aphasia;  [144525]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps are being taken to improve the quality of services available to people with aphasia;  [144526]

<P>
(3) what steps are being taken to support services development for people with aphasia based on accurate measures of need and performance;  [144527]
<P>
(4) what steps are being taken to improve access to speech and language therapy for aphasic people.  [144535]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts have the responsibility of improving the health of the community, securing the provision of high quality services, and integrating health and social care locally. They have the resources to commission services, and to identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. This process provides the means for addressing local health needs within the community including the provision of speech and language therapy. No steps are being taken centrally to develop or produce measures of either the severity of aphasia or treatment outcomes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B>

<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Havard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps are being taken to inform cancer patients about the alternatives to blood transfusion for chemotherapy-induced anaemia.  [144495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31218w30.html_spnew11"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 There is a national patient information leaflet produced by the National Blood Service for patients who may receive a blood transfusion. The leaflet includes a section on alternatives to blood transfusions&#151;although this is directed principally at surgical rather than cancer patients. When the leaflet is next reviewed consideration will be given to providing more information on other possible alternatives to blood transfusion. In addition, guidance on information provision for cancer patients will be included in the supportive and palliative care guidance currently being produced by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for publication next year.

 The National Health Service Counter Fraud Service, now Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS), was created in 1998 with a remit to tackle fraud and corruption within the NHS. So far, it has produced a financial benefit to the NHS of more than &#163;295 million. It works with more than 400 professionally trained and accredited local counter fraud specialists covering every health body in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="31218w31.html_para13">NHS bank and agency staff are an integral part of the NHS work force, but there is, unfortunately, a small minority of these staff who take advantage of the NHS and its resources. CFSMS have identified bank and agency timesheet fraud as a significant area of fraud and investigations, to date, have resulted in 33 criminal prosecutions. Some of the individuals involved have received terms of imprisonment ranging from nine to 21 months. Criminal prosecution is not the only action taken and CFSMS pursues a parallel sanctions policy, seeking to combine appropriate disciplinary procedures with civil action to freeze and recover assets.
<P>

<a name="31218w31.html_para14">The CFMS is engaged in a national proactive exercise aimed at highlighting system and policy weaknesses in the NHS. As a result, information will be sent to the whole of the NHS in England and Wales on how to improve systems, stop the fraudulent practices that put resources at risk and prevent bank and agency staff fraud in the future. Local counter fraud specialists in NHS organisations that use bank and agency staff have 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2003 : Column 1123W</I><P>

<a name="31218w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Existing contracts for midwifery training between strategic health authorities and higher education institutions cover the full cost of training, including the personal tuition fee. The consultation document, "Funding Learning and Development for the Healthcare Workforce", sets out our proposal for a national model contract. It is intended that this contract for national health service-funded pre-registration courses, to be introduced from 1 April 2004, will specifically prohibit the charging of top-up fees to students. If, under the proposed top-up fee arrangements, the existing tuition fee continues to be levied on students, then it will continue to be met by the NHS without means testing.

<P>
<a name="31218w34.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Public Health Laboratory Service's regional network of microbiology laboratories has been replaced by the Health Protection Agency's (HPA) local and regional services division, which has a network of eight regional laboratories. This is supported by more than 300 National Health Service microbiology pathology laboratories across the country. The HPA has regional microbiologists (a newly created post in microbiology), who, working with regional epidemiologists and local communicable disease control teams, ensure that the public health outputs of the laboratories in their regions are maintained. This is a more comprehensive coverage of the public health needs across the country than was previously possible, filling some of the surveillance gaps identified by the Chief Medical Officer in his strategy for combating infectious diseases, Getting Ahead of the Curve.

 The Government's policy is to promote self-care and give patients greater control over their treatment. On 9 December, we published "Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS". This document broadly sets out how we need to make the national health service more responsive to patients by offering more choice across the spectrum of health care. Redesigning services around the wishes and choices of different groups of service users will improve access to care and treatment and reduce health inequalities.

This aimed to increase the awareness of tuberculosis, encourage early access to diagnosis and treatment and reduce delays in diagnosis and completion of treatment and encourage early diagnosis for cases of active tuberculosis and preventative measures. As a result of the campaign and improved surveillance, both detection and diagnosis of the condition has improved.
