<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60126w01.html_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 As G8 lead nation on counter narcotics in Afghanistan, the UK and the international community are supporting the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to deliver their National Drug Control Strategy and to bring about a sustainable reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium. To that end, the UK spent &#163;24,442,350 on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan in 2004&#150;05. This included the running of seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter Narcotics Police, support for interdiction operations, resulting in major seizures of opiates, the provision of a mobile forensic laboratory and help to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.

<p>
<a name="60126w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Over the next three financial years, the UK is providing more than &#163;270 million. This is a funding increase, agreed by the Domestic and Overseas Policy Cabinet Committee on 21 July 2005, of &#163;115 million. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 Jan 2006 : Column 2236W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;130 million of the funding will be provided by the Department for International Development, with the rest coming from other Government Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. In this three year period, we will focus on the following three key priorities, which we judge will make the greatest impact: targeting the trafficker and the top end of the drugs trade; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihood opportunities; and developing strong and effective counter narcotics institutions.

<a name="60126w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">In November 2005, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed the poppy cultivation figures for 2004&#150;05 from their annual survey. UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 (production of 4,200 metric tonnes) to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05 (4,100 metric tonnes). Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for the increased yield. While there remains a risk that cultivation may increase again this year, our goal is to ensure that the downward trend in cultivation is maintained in the long term. We are working hard with the GoA and other international partners to ensure that it is able to deliver on this goal.

Individual cases of concern, including Christians, were raised at this meeting and at the Dialogues. We will continue to raise our concerns about religious freedom with the Chinese authorities.

Violent demonstrations by supporters of President Gbagbo followed the recommendation by the IWG that the mandate of the National Assembly should not be renewed.

We urge all Ivorians to unite in support of efforts to bring a lasting peace to the country.

 We have received no representations in the past 12 months on genocide survivors. Ibuka, the genocide survivors&#039; umbrella organisation, makes regular representations to the Government of Rwanda. The Rwanda National police is tasked with investigating all allegations of crimes against genocide survivors and witnesses involved in genocide related gacaca trials. We have received no representations in the past 12 months on behalf of prisoners released into the community as part of the gacaca process. Fears among the population about the punishments believed to be meted out by gacaca courts led to around 15,000 Rwandans fleeing to neighbouring countries in the past six months.

 The Rwandan authorities are pursuing the traditional justice system, gacaca, in order to tackle the enormous number of people, estimated at 750,000, accused of genocide and related crimes. A new gacaca bill, which replaces the current gacaca law, has been forwarded to the Rwandan Parliament for approval. We have not yet seen this. With European partners we are urging the Rwandan Government to ensure that the new gacaca courts do not issue the death penalty, and that international concerns over the variable punishments and the lack of defence counsel are addressed.

As the major bilateral donor to Rwanda, the UK is providing development assistance worth some &#163;46 million in 2005&#150;06, which is targeted towards delivery of Rwanda&#039;s PRSP. In recent years, we have supported specific activities to promote understanding and reconciliation, including an allocation of over &#163;0.9 million for peace education activities, linked to the 10th anniversary of the genocide in 2004.

Following an amendment to the Review of Children&#039;s Cases Regulations in 2004, review meetings must, where possible, be chaired by an independent reviewing officer, whose role it is to ensure both that the child&#039;s views are understood and taken into account and that reviews are carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations.

 The IFS report identified a number of issues relating to the employer training pilots. The report has highlighted that we need to do more to attract the harder to reach employers and the subsequent phases of the pilots have shown us better how to do so. That has been one of the many real values of the pilots and their evaluation.

<p>
<a name="60126w12.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_115">In some ETP areas around 25 per cent. of eligible employers are now taking part in the pilots&#151;a far higher penetration rate than the 8 per cent. that IFS estimated carried out similar training without the pilots. We therefore anticipate that a higher proportion will be additional. Skills brokers in the new national programme, Train to Gain, will have a target of at least half the employers they engage being hard to reach&quot;, additional employers. We are making &#163;15 million available in 2005&#150;06 and &#163;20 million in 2006&#150;07 to develop the capacity of the brokerage network and implement a performance management system that focuses services on this priority and rewards achievement accordingly.

<p>
<a name="60126w12.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_116">A number of evaluations, including the IFS report, have shown that employers identify many benefits from ETP including productivity improvement, changed attitudes to learning, improved motivation and provided employers and employees with a platform for progression. Participating employers were more likely to train their low-skilled staff to the benefit of their business and say that ETP has allowed them to train more people over a shorter period of time. So we are confident that we are already involving more hard-to-reach learners.

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="60126w13.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 January 2006]:</i> The Government want to ensure that young carers can gain maximum life chance benefits from educational opportunities. Local authority children&#039;s services and adults social services should work with families to ensure that young people are not expected to carry inappropriate levels of caring. We have also advised schools that in a genuine crisis, they can approve absence for a child to care for a relative until other arrangements are made&#151;the school should set a time limit for the absence and set some school work so that the pupil does not fall far behind while at home. This advice is reflected in the existing guidance on the codes which are used to record absence and attendance in the school register. It is also reflected in Managing Behaviour and Attendance: Groups at Particular Risk&quot;. This guidance has been available since 1999, initially included within the Department&#039;s Social Inclusion circulars, and was published again on the Department&#039;s school attendance and behaviour website in 2005 as Managing Behaviour and Attendance: Groups at Particular Risk&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w13.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_118">The Department has not made any assessment of the proportion of young carers who have school attendance difficulties and does not collect or hold data that would enable it to do so. Census data are based on self-identification by carers&#039; families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w13.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_119">When a pupil is not attending school regularly, for whatever reason, local authorities are best placed to decide on the most appropriate course of action on a case by case basis. The Government would expect, however, any assessment of school attendance difficulties to take into account the possibility of circumstances such as caring responsibilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w13.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_120">One of the options available is the Fast-track to Attendance framework which is a time-focused approach to case management. Its aim is to ensure that schools and local authorities deal with attendance cases quickly and in the most effective way to get the child back into school. The Fast-track framework promotes early intervention both by the school and, when necessary, by the local authority and other agencies. Fast-track is not just about prosecutions or sanctions, rather the approach aims to ensure that appropriate action is taken to identify and tackle attendance problems as soon as they become apparent. Guidance on the &#039;Fast-track&#039; process was issued to local authorities in 2003. As the guidance relates to a process it does not specifically refer to young carers or any other group.

Inclusion on the roll signified that a team inspector satisfied the conditions of his or her enrolment: that he or she was fit and proper, and competent and effective, to discharge the functions of a team inspector.

The RISPs have different recruitment and selection processes but all include checking whether inspectors were previously Section 10 inspectors. Where an inspector had previously been de-registered or removed from the roll, the RISP would have to look at the individual&#039;s circumstances. However, we have no reason to believe that inspectors would be disadvantaged in seeking and securing inspection work simply on the basis that they were previously removed from, and reinstated to, the Section 10 roll of team inspectors. Finally, I should inform you that, although there is no longer a roll of team inspectors, HMCI is required, under the Education Act 2005, to publish at intervals of not more than 12 months the names of those persons who are notified to him by a RISP as persons with whom the RISP proposes to make arrangements for carrying out of inspections on behalf of HMCI.

 Pollution controls for coal-fired power stations in England and Wales are a matter for the Environment Agency and are applied through authorisations issued under the integrated pollution control (IPC) system or by permits under the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive which is replacing IPC.

Provided their operators comply with their permits (and they would face enforcement action if they did not), all those power stations should therefore comply with the extant EU legislation by the due date. There are currently no EU proposals for further legislation in this area.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps he is taking to avert the possible Civil Service industrial action in Northern Ireland.  [44801]</p>








<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60126w21.html_spnew6"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Government regrets the Trade Union&#039;s decision to proceed with a statutory ballot for strike action. As part of the normal negotiating process officials had a series of meetings with trade union representatives on the 2005 pay round dating back to July of last year. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland met personally with the Trade Union on two occasions in an attempt to reach agreement with them on the 2005 pay deal. During the course of the negotiations a number of information bulletins were issued to staff, continually up-dating them on the negotiations and providing them with details of the 3.49 per cent. pay offer made by management. This offer represented the maximum available to the Northern Ireland Civil Service under the terms of the Government&#039;s pay policy. Officials made it clear that they were prepared to negotiate the content of the offer in order better to meet Trade Union concerns, subject to remaining within the 3.49 per cent. envelope approved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_176">Under the terms of the offer the majority of staff this year will see their pay increase by between 2.2 per cent. and 6.5 per cent. depending on their position on their

pay scale. It took cognisance of the fact that inflation was 2.3 per cent. at July 2005 (the settlement date was 1 August) while private sector earnings growth was less than 3 per cent. In this wider context I firmly believe that the 2005 pay deal is fair and reasonable and represents the best that could have been achieved for staff in the prevailing economic circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_177">There was no additional money available for this year&#039;s pay round and as a result there was nothing to be gained in further delaying payment of the pay offer to staff. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State therefore wrote to all staff on 20 December 2005 indicating that the deal would be paid as soon as possible. This was the fairest course of action in all the circumstances. Naturally it would have been preferable if agreement could have been reached with the Trade Union not just on this year&#039;s pay deal but on how best to address next year&#039;s pay remit. In that context My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has invited the Trade Union to work with officials in developing the strongest possible business case in support of the 2006 pay remit. I hope that that invitation will be accepted and that we can work constructively together to secure the best possible deal for staff in 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_178">I hope that the staff will form a judgment based on the facts, and that a strike can thus be avoided. In the meantime however, Departments have been asked to draw up appropriate contingency plans to be put in train in the event of an all out strike. All appropriate measures will of course be taken to minimise the impact of any strike action on our public services.

The criminal justice organisations, working together through the Criminal Justice Board, are committed to improving public awareness and understanding of the justice system, and therefore help reduce fear of crime. A number of these initiatives include: a one-stop CJSNI website, a criminal justice module in the citizenship curriculum for key stage 4, and a series of criminal justice roadshows planned for spring and summer of this year.

 The Senior Education Officer posts have been created as a result of a collaborative working proposal brought forward by the Southern and Western Education and Library Boards and are being trawled on a restricted basis between both Boards. The Boards and the Staff Commission for the Education and Library Boards have advised that under existing procedures, appointment to any reconfigured post/s within a new structure where voluntary redundancies have been approved can be made on the basis of a restricted trawl within the defined unit of redundancy. In the case of these posts, the unit of redundancy is the Western and Southern Education and Library Boards and the posts, which have a fundamentally new remit within a Collaborative Working context, are being trawled on a restricted basis within both Boards.

 The Government believe that the most effective way to develop fair and ethical trade labelling schemes is to ensure that they are voluntary and business led as they are likely to be more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. Government should provide an enabling rather than a prescriptive framework. There are already a number of successful voluntary labelling initiatives, which have been those developed by business, sometimes in partnership with civil society. For example, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label, put together in partnership with NGOs and full industry backing, fills a communication gap and delivers environmental improvements.

 The Government have reviewed with industry the performance of the telecommunications sector and provision of services on 7 July 2005. This shows that there was no failure of the mobile networks but the level of demand was significantly greater than usual and exceeded the extra margin of capacity&#151;about 20 percent. above the average daily peak&#151;that is built into the networks for unseen demand. Consequently, service was either restricted or not available for some customers at periods during the day. The congestion was managed by the operators through the application of network calming measures such as call gapping&quot;, which restricted access from the fixed networks onto the mobile networks&#151;but does not affect 999 services&#151;and by squeezing more calls within the available capacity by reducing the quality of voice calls. Restricting customers to text messages only at such times to ease congestion, as has been suggested, is not possible because voice and text services use separately allocated network channels that are not interchangeable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w32.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_252">The measures taken by the operators, together with their advice to customers to keep calls short, succeeded in ensuring there was no collapse of the networks. This enabled a swift return to normal services when the congestion eased.

 SITPRO, UK Trade and Investment and the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have distinct roles. SITPRO is the world&#039;s leading trade facilitation agency and its expertise lies in the simplification of documents and procedures, e.g. customs, for clearing goods at the border. UKTI&#039;s role is to support UK businesses undertaking international trade and in attracting inward investment to the UK. The RDAs work closely with UKTI on both inward investment and trade development activity at regional level. UKTI promotes the whole of the UK as a location for inward investment, working in partnership with the English RDAs and the Development Agencies (DAs) of the Devolved Administrations. In addition to working with UKTI to attract, retain and add value to inward investment, staff in all these agencies have actively participated in the Committee on Overseas Promotion (COP), which brings together inward investment practitioners from throughout the UK to discuss strategic and operational issues, as well as share best practice. In addition to the regular meetings of COP and its sub-groups, there is regular contact with the RDAs and DAs on a daily basis concerning individual investor inquiries.

The Home Office works closely with a wide range of organisations, including the DfES, on preventing young people who are at risk as a result of a number of factors, including family circumstances, from involvement in offending and a range of negative outcomes. For example, the Youth Justice Board and Youth Offending Teams provide a number of targeted services for children and young people at high risk of offending. In addition, the Government&#039;s Every Child Matters reforms are an essential part of this work as they shift the focus of children&#039;s services towards early intervention and prevention.

 The Department for Education and Skills, along with the Home Office and the Department of Work and Pensions, published on 15 December a Green Paper on offender learning: Reducing Re-offending through Skills and Employment&quot;. As part of the policy development for this document, officials invited a wide range of views, including those of organisations representing the rehabilitation and education of offenders.

<p>
<a name="60126w35.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_279">Officials, and the Minister for Skills, Phil Hope, visited prisons and probation areas, where they were able to speak directly to offenders and staff. Two discussion groups were also run with prisoners prior to publication, focusing in particular on changes that would improve education provision. Offenders will also be able to take part in the Green Paper consultation&#151;further discussion groups will be run to facilitate this. In addition, prisoners can on a day to day basis make their views known on education matters through other means, such as talking directly to prison or probation staff including the head of learning and skills; and they may refer matters to the prisons and probation ombudsman.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners in each prison had <i>(a)</i> a job, <i>(b)</i> training and <i>(c)</i> an education placement to attend upon release in the last year for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [44345]</p>

 The data collected identifies prisoners entering Education Training and Employment (ETE) which includes those who attended FRESHSTART appointments at Jobcentre Plus. FRESHSTART is the initiative whereby prisoners who do not have a job or training place to go to on release are linked into employment, training and benefits advice and support immediately after release. The compound elements of ETE cannot be broken down except at disproportionate cost. Figures for ETE are given as follows.

 There are no plans to change the necessary entry requirements for new prison officers. However, all newly recruited prison officers now undertake an eight-week Prison Officer Entry Level Training course. The course provides new staff with a foundation level of training, including; interpersonal skills, mental health awareness, race and diversity, violence reduction, safer custody, security awareness and practical skills. An improved quality assurance system is now in place, which adheres to the Adult Learning Inspectorate common inspection framework.

This represents a fall of up to 21 per cent. since 1999 and a fall of 15 per cent. since the introduction of a new policy framework in 2002&#150;03.

 The home detention curfew scheme was introduced in January 1999. Over 120,000 prisoners have been released on HDC since then. Before release on HDC is granted, Probation Service staff are involved in assessing the suitability of the offender and the proposed release address.

All offenders serving sentences of 12 months to four years, and young adult offenders aged under 22 years of age serving less than 12 months, are released subject to probation supervision. Changes in the way HDC has been applied have caused short term increases in the number of offenders released but they have not had any long-term impact on supervision resources.

<p><a name="qn_344"><a name="60126w37.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Bellingham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria are used, expressed as level of risk <i>(a)</i> to the public and <i>(b)</i> of re-offending, for each level of Probation Service supervision for an offender upon release from prison; and if he will make a statement.  [44382]</p>








<p><a name="st_339"><a name="60126w37.html_spnew0"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Probation Service assesses offenders using the Offender Assessment System (OASys). There are two main elements within OASys, an assessment of the risk of serious harm posed by an offender and an assessment of the likelihood of reconviction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w37.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_288">Risk of serious harm to the public or to particular groups of people is assessed as low, medium, high or very high. The assessment involves two variables: the likelihood of an event occurring and the potential impact of that event. Serious harm is defined as life threatening and/or traumatic from which recovery (psychological as well as physical) can be expected to be difficult or impossible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w37.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_289">An offender&#039;s likelihood of reconviction is expressed as a numerical score that is split into three bands: low, medium and high. This assessment is based on such factors as the offender&#039;s criminal history and whether for example he or she is a drug misuser, abuses alcohol or anti-social attitudes. The two elements of assessment come together in the allocation of offenders to a four level &#039;tiering&#039; structure through which all offenders under Probation Service supervision are managed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w37.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_290">Those offenders who require the least probation input will be in Tier One, while those requiring the most will be in Tier Four. Tier Four includes those offenders released on licence who are assessed as posing a high or very high risk of serious harm and where it is likely that more than one agency should be involved in their risk management under the Multi- Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60126w37.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_291">The MAPPA provide the framework to co-ordinate and strengthen the risk management activity of all the relevant agencies involved. High and very high risk of serious harm offenders are managed in the community at MAPPA Levels Two or Three, dependant on the nature and imminence of their risk and the level of resource, or senior management involvement, needed from the relevant agencies.

 In 2005 my Department made an assessment of the additional support that might be helpful to vulnerable victims and witnesses, including those with communication difficulties, in the criminal justice process. An interdepartmental examination of early advice provision is also examining ways in which access to independent early legal advice can be improved for vulnerable groups. In addition my Department is testing the use of television as a means of delivering education and information for potential users of the Justice System, with a particular focus on vulnerable and socially excluded witnesses.

 The FOI Act gives the Secretary of State power to set an upper limit (known as the appropriate limit) for the cost of responding to FOI requests. The public authority is not required to comply with requests whose cost exceeds that limit. The Act also enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for public authorities to charge for requests that costs less than the appropriate limit. Under the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 the appropriate limit was set at &#163;600 for requests to central Government and &#163;450 for requests to public authorities outside central Government. Public authorities could only charge for the cost of disbursements (such as photocopying and postage) if the cost of complying with the request was less than the upper limit.

<a name="stpa_309">DCA has no plans at present to revise either the appropriate limits or to change the fees that may be charged under those limits.

No timetable for any review has yet been agreed. There have also been no decisions taken on the scope of any review.

 DFID understands that life in Fallujah is slowly returning to normal. A functioning local government exists and the population has voted in both the October 2005 constitutional referendum and December 2005 general election. The US now estimates the city&#039;s population to be at 239,000, compared to 300,000 before 2004. The US Government reports that there is currently no-one officially classified as a displaced person in the vicinity of Fallujah; many of those displaced by the conflict moved to stay with relatives or relocated to surrounding cities. A UN survey showed that 17 per cent. of former Fallujan residents (approximately 50,000) did not expect to return to the city.

The Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals continues to lead on the reconstruction effort, with support from the US. Financial aid came from the Iraqi Government and the US.

We have pledged to increase our own aid for trade to &#163;100 million per annum by 2010. While this is not a substitute for significant changes to WTO trade rules, DFID believes it will assist poor countries to engage in and benefit from the international trading system.
