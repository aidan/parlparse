This reflects an estimated total gross cost of the domestic rollout of £11 billion, offset by £16 billion in gross benefits.

No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>

 In its recent market study into the off-grid energy market, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) examined the heating oil market. The OFT found most consumers have a reasonably large choice of supplier with less than 3% of UK off-grid households living in a location with fewer than four distinct suppliers. It also found that heating oil consumers are normally able to switch supplier because they usually own their storage tanks and very few are tied into supply contracts. Moreover  <br/>

In terms of back-up systems, recommendations IR-18 and IR-19 of the report seek review of the need for the provision of additional electrical or cooling supplies in the event of loss of off-site capacity under severe conditions or disruption. These actions will be taken forward by operators and may become part of the site’s Periodic Safety Review Programme and will in any case be reported to the Office for Nuclear Regulation.

 There is already a great deal of international activity looking at the issues of the future development of nuclear power and responsibilities for non-proliferation and nuclear security and safety worldwide. We recognise the value of co-operation between operators and Governments and support closer working between the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA), the World Nuclear Association (WNA) and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). Indeed, at the recent WANO biennial general meeting in China, the IAEA Director-General encouraged closer co-operation between the IAEA and WANO. However, we believe that this can be achieved without the need to set up new fora and secretariats.</p>

 On 24 July 2006, the then Government proposed a change to the rules governing the tabling of parliamentary questions to enable questions to be tabled for answer on certain days in September that year; the proposal was agreed to by the House. On 28 March 2007, the then Government proposed a new Standing Order making such arrangements permanent; this was agreed to by the House and is now Standing Order No. 22B. Although not involving formal rule changes, on 25 October 2007 the House of Commons approved proposals for topical oral questions, which arose from a recommendation of the Modernisation Committee and were supported by the then Government; topical questions were introduced from the start of Session 2007-08. The Procedure Committee made a recommendation for earlier deadlines for questions tabled electronically in its Third Report of Session 2008-09, published in July 2009, but this recommendation was not considered by the House.</p>

The treaties and subsequent amendments thereto have been agreed by the member states by consensus and not by either majority voting or unanimity in the Council of Ministers. There have been no treaties agreed since May 2010 which have transferred competences from the UK to the EU. There has been a decision under the simplified revision procedure to allow for the amendment of Article 136 TFEU. This does not apply to the UK, nor does it transfer any competence from other EU member states to the EU. It remains to be ratified by all member states and therefore is not yet in force.</p>

 The Government are working with local councils to increase the frequency and quality of waste collections and to make it easier to recycle. We strongly believe that the best way to drive up recycling performance is for local authorities to determine the most appropriate form of recycling services for their areas, to reflect local circumstances and demographics. This enables local authorities to work with their residents to deliver recycling services that people will use. The Government will continue to provide advice and support to inform the decisions made by councils, through the work of the Waste and Resources Action Programme and others.</p>

 The costs to authorities of discounts and exemptions are supported through Formula Grant. Formula Grant is an unhypothecated block grant and it is not therefore possible to say how much is provided for discounts and exemptions. The total amount of Formula Grant is set during the spending review. Formula Grant is funded from within the local government departmental expenditure limit.</p>

 As pledged in the coalition agreement, in order to help authorities increase take-up we are, through the Localism Bill, removing the legal requirement for ratepayers to submit an application form in order to claim the relief councils will therefore be free to administer the relief in a way that best serves local businesses and local needs. We are also amending secondary legislation to ensure that all eligible businesses automatically have their bills calculated using the small business multiplier.</p>

 Table 1 provides the average length of time from: (i) the date of arrest to the date of charge; (ii) the date of offence being committed to the date of charge; (iii) the date of charge to the date of first hearing; (iv) the date of first hearing to the date of completion (verdict or sentence); and (v) date of offence to the date of completion, for defendants in charged cases concluding in either the magistrates courts or Crown court from April 2010 to June 2011, the latest date for which statistics are currently available. In addition, the average time taken from the date of offence to date of completion of the case has been provided for defendants in all criminal cases, including summons cases. These statistics are sourced from the administrative data systems used in the courts, and have been produced by linking together records held on the two datasets.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> Between 1997 and 1999, the results are based on one week period of each June. 1999 is a transitional period and results are now based on two surveys. Those are conducted in February and September. Thereafter, all criminal cases are collected in March and September.
<sup>(4 )</sup>Data from arrest to charge are only available from 2008, because prior to this date, it was not a mandatory requirement to fill in the date of arrest
<sup>(5)</sup> The arrest to charge column is a subset of the offence to charge column, so the first four columns will not add up to the overall offence to completion figure for charged cases.

There were components missing within the mailbox at the point of migration meaning that some e-mails were not redirected from the legacy system to the new system. These e-mails would have been sent back to the sender and they should have received a non-delivery receipt.</p>

               <a name="11103130000245"> Ministers were satisfied that the steps taken once the fault was identified meant that extending the consultation was not necessary. A message was sent to some 7,000 stakeholders on 23 September advising them of the fault and requesting that any responses submitted via e-mail were re-sent. A similar message was placed on the consultation page on the Ministry of Justice website. E-mail was not the only available method of submitting responses to the consultation and the fault did not affect the receipt of hard copy responses or the use of the questionnaire that could be completed on the Ministry of Justice website.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Includes offences under the Road Traffic Act 1988. s.143(2).
<sup>(3)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences It is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(4)</sup> Every effort Is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Displayed figures are subject to rounding.
2. The unit cost measurement used is based on overall cost which includes prison related overheads met centrally by NOMS, for example, property costs including depreciation (and cost of capital for 2009-10), major maintenance, prisoner escort and custody service (relates to transporting prisoners) and central HQ overheads. This involves some estimation.
3. Data for Elmley, Standford Hill and Swaleside are reported under the Sheppey cluster; data for Parkhurst, Camphill and Albany are reported under the Isle of Wight cluster; similarly, data for Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange is reported together as a cluster.
4. Dover and Haslar are not included as they are Immigration Removal Centres operating under Detention Centre Rules 2001.
5. Lindholme includes Lindholme IDC as it is a split site, part Category C Training Prison and part Immigration Removal Centre.
6. The following expenditure is not included:
impairment charges, including the revaluation of land and buildings (2009-10: £525 million; 2010-11: £6.9 million);
Operation Safeguard (use of police cells);
cost of capital on assets in the course of construction (2009-10: £22.5 million);
project, operating and commissioning costs at HMPYOI Isis in 2009-10 (£2.7 million), as the establishment was not opened during the course of year;
costs associated with Probation (2010-11: £l,038 million);
electronic monitoring (2010-11: £112.5 million);
payment to Department of Health towards Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (2010-11: £22 million).
7. For certain prisons the unit cost is not typical, because they were in the process of change, e.g. Isis (2010-11) and Bure (2009-10) were building up capacity during the respective years.

The PQF has been welcomed by stakeholders and is underpinned by a comprehensive Regulatory Framework, quality assured by the Probation Qualification Assurance Board. The Justice Select Committee on the Role of the Probation Service commented favourably on the PQF model in their report published earlier this year and it is therefore considered to be fit for purpose.</p>

 The Highways Agency has moved to an outcome based specification which allows its service providers to innovate and choose how best to deal with clearing the accident. As part of the new outcome based specifications, performance measures are based around incident clearance times rather than incident response by the incident support unit service, bringing estimated cashable savings of £11 million per annum. There are specified clearance times for reopening the motorway and it is expected that the new specifications will bring improved incident clear up times and economic benefits by focusing the service providers on swift incident resolution.</p>

 The majority of rolling stock is owned by the rolling stock leasing companies. They lease trains to the train operating companies so they can operate their franchised services. With certain limited exceptions (for example relating to major rolling stock programmes linked to infrastructure investment funded by the taxpayer) this Government wish to see the industry take the lead in rolling stock decisions.

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 There are 24 free schools, in 21 local authorities, which opened since September 2011. The Department does not currently hold free school meal information for pupils in these; this is being collected as part of the autumn term school census. A table will be placed in the House Library when available; this is likely to be early in the new year.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 19 October 2011]:</i> Local authority maintained schools are funded on a financial year basis and their budgets are set locally on a formula determined by local authorities in consultation with schools forums. For 2011-12 financial year basis, the average budget share per pupil in (i) London is £5,505 and (ii) for England is £4,667. These figures are taken from local authority section 251 Budget Statements for 2011-12 and include local authority maintained schools at the time the statements were completed by local authorities.</p>

               <a name="11103131000927"> Academies are funded on an academic year basis by the Young People's Learning Agency according to the same local funding formula as maintained schools. This ensures funding equivalence with maintained schools in the local authority. Free schools are funded using a model designed to provide per pupil funding equivalent to maintained schools in the same local authority area. For the 2011/12 academic year, the average funding per pupil for academies in (i) London is £6,320 and (ii) for England is £5,483. The funding per pupil for free schools in (i) London is £6,507 and (ii) England is £5,092.</p>

Academies and free schools both receive the Local Authority Central Services Equivalent Grant (LACSEG), to reflect the additional responsibilities they undertake that were previously the responsibility of their local authority. Funding for academies and free schools also includes funding for post-16 pupils, where relevant.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 27 October 2011]:</i> The Government are committed to making government procurement quicker, cheaper and work differently for all concerned. The Lean Review conducted in late 2010 set out to uncover wasteful practices and examine how the procurement process could be accelerated. The report was published in February 2011 identifying significant potential to reduce turnaround time and costs in the way government procures. Since then, the Cabinet Office has developed a new lean sourcing process embracing 'lean' management practices. The new process is being tested on live procurement projects, with promising early results, and a pilot training course has been designed and run. Roll out across central Government is due to commence in early 2012.</p>

 Generally, the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and kidney disease increases with age. However, there are other fixed risk factors—sex, ethnicity and family history—common to these diseases. There are also important modifiable risk factors for all these diseases that are smoking, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol and obesity. If these are managed appropriately, they will reduce the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and stroke.</p>

 The Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc) Regulations 1994 make it an offence to place a medicine on the market without the appropriate authorisation or to distribute such a product by way of wholesale dealing. Breaches of the regulations are a criminal offence and can be punished by up to two years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Prior to the date of full implementation of Directive 2004/24/EC the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) wrote to 272 companies which it believed to be involved in the supply of herbal products in the United Kingdom. 132 replied saying that they marketed some 2,915 products under the section 12(2) exemption from licensing contained in the Medicines Act 1968. The Medicines Borderline Section of the MHRA is currently investigating nine companies complained about by the manufacturers of registered herbal medicines. The time taken to process a complaint will depend on the complexity of the case, the number of products involved and the response from the company concerned. Five other complaints have been investigated by the section and closed. The average time taken to process these was 19 days.</p>

In addition to this, NICE is developing a Quality Standard for ovarian cancer which will set out what good ovarian cancer treatment and support looks like and will help support clinical commissioning groups when they take responsibility for commissioning ovarian cancer services. Detection of ovarian cancer in primary care will be considered when developing this standard.</p>

Departmental officials have already met with a number of these charities, including an ovarian cancer charity, with the aim of identifying some of the barriers to early diagnosis and to discuss potential solutions.

 The improvement of the quality of health care is one of the key priorities of the Government of South Africa. As part of its support to achieving this improvement the Department of International Development is facilitating learning between the UK Care Quality Commission (CQC) and counterparts in South Africa. South African inspectors have been invited to join the CQC inspector orientation training programme at a total cost of £57,860 for all 10 South African inspectors. These costs will be met by DFID and are inclusive of flights; accommodation and all other expenses. There are no cost implications for the CQC or the Department of Health. This represents good value for money in that CQC is a global lead in this area and will not in this case be charging any fees. This is a good example of how UK expertise can benefit partner governments.</p>

The Director attended a meeting on 12 August 2011 with the Chairman and members of the Waverley Steam Navigation Co. Ltd to discuss what can be done through business planning development and fundraising to keep Waverly in service. In addition the Heritage Lottery Fund, which also has UK wide remit, has awarded two grants (£2,689,000 in 1996-97 and £3,028,000 in 2001-02) in recognition of the vessel's heritage value.</p>
