 The Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and UN monitor the numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Afghanistan. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees&#146; (UNHCR) most recent assessment, conducted in early 2007, the estimated figure for longstanding IDPs in Afghanistan is some 130,000. Around 85 per cent. of these are located in four settlements in the south of the country.</p>

 Indoor air pollution is a considerable health hazard for approximately 2.4 billion people around the world relying on poorly designed wood, dung and coal burning stoves for their cooking and heating. DFID has funded research into the problem, with a current &#163;253,000 programme due to end in July 2007.

The research did not provide clear evidence that reed beds were the most appropriate wastewater treatment option, and showed that industrial wastes resulted in erratic performance efficiency.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 March 2007]: </i>None of these groups make a contribution from their pay into the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. When setting pay levels for all personnel up to Brigadier and equivalents, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) looks at a range of factors in their consideration of overall pay comparability. Pension is just one of these factors. The AFPRB then makes an adjustment to comparator earnings to reflect the value of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) benefits compared with the pension benefits of comparator employees.</p>

They provide transparency and certainty of bids and so avoid the potential difficulties sometimes associated with informal negotiations.

qualifications is an important component of the MOD&#146;s Personnel Strategy and is detailed in the &#147;Defence Policy for the Accreditation of Education, Training and Experience&#148;, which aims to have military training, education and experience, where appropriate, accredited against nationally recognised qualifications. Furthermore, the priorities set in this policy are aligned with those in the Government&#146;s National Skills Strategy, focusing particularly on qualifications in literacy and numeracy and in wider employability skills, such as NVQs and Apprenticeships, but also seeking accreditation leading to higher education qualifications, including Foundation Degrees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="70320w0002.htm_para10"><a name="07032046000224">Although the attainment of the operational requirement remains the primary goal of military training, accreditation to civilian qualifications has an obvious benefit to recruiting, retention and resettlement. The success of this policy is such that, in the last financial year, personnel in the armed services gained:</p>
<a name="70320w0002.htm_brev0"><a name="07032046000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">in excess of 11,000 NVQs or other Level 2 qualifications;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="70320w0002.htm_para11"><a name="07032046000225">In addition, staff are constantly seeking further opportunities with Awarding Bodies to extend the linkage of military training, education and experience to appropriate civilian qualifications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="70320w0002.htm_para12"><a name="07032046000226">However, it is more difficult for Awarding Bodies to validate, in terms of quality assurance and syllabus content, military training and education that was undertaken by serving and ex-serving personnel a number of years ago and thus provide retrospective accreditation opportunities. For those who have left the services with no or very low level qualifications, there are opportunities with local colleges and training providers to gain civilian qualifications funded through schemes such as the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s &#147;Train to Gain&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="70320w0002.htm_para13"><a name="07032046000227">Financial assistance is also provided to support service personnel in gaining nationally-recognised qualifications for their own personal development through the Armed Forces Learning Credits Schemes. Firstly, under the Standard Learning Credit Scheme, service personnel are eligible to claim from public funds 80 per cent. of course fees, up to a maximum of &#163;175 per financial year. Secondly, the Enhanced Learning Credit (ELC) Scheme (introduced in 2004) provides larger scale support to pay for higher level academic and vocational learning at Level 3 or above on the National Qualifications Framework. The claim limit is also 80 per cent. of the annual fee (the claimant making a minimum 20 per cent. personal contribution to demonstrate their commitment). Individuals can draw down a maximum of &#163;1,000 per annum on three occasions after serving four years from registration, and this rises to &#163;2,000 per annum having served eight years after registration. Since the introduction of the ELC Scheme, over 225,000 personnel have registered with 16,500 claims made. While the majority of those registered have not yet made a claim, many of the claims are made in the last two years of service and are used alongside individuals&#146; resettlement provision. Moreover, claims under the ELC Scheme can be made up to 10 years after leaving the armed forces.</p>

 The Health Act 2006 introduces a ban on smoking in workplaces and enclosed or substantially enclosed public places from 1 July 2007. While the Act does not formally apply on the parliamentary estate, the Commission, on the advice of the Administration Committee, has decided that the House should comply with the principles of the legislation, as it is not desirable that those who work on or visit the parliamentary estate should be treated differently in this respect than in other workplaces and public places. The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting.

 The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Electricity and Gas (Energy Efficiency Obligations) Order 2004, estimated that the cost to energy suppliers of meeting their energy efficiency obligations for 2005-08 would be around &#163;1,200 million. If passed on in full to their domestic customers, this would be no more than about &#163;9 per fuel bill per customer per year. We do not anticipate any recurring costs for energy suppliers (other than complying with subsequent obligations). On average costs will be more than outweighed by the benefits to householders in terms of reduced fuel bills or increased comfort from the installation of energy efficiency measures. The RIA estimated that overall lifetime-discounted savings would amount to a net present value of around &#163;1,000 million by 2010, &#163;3,400 million by 2020 and &#163;5,400 million over the lifetime of the measures.

 The European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) is the EU agency that will own Galileo on behalf of the Community and be responsible for regulating and overseeing it. It has been set up in Brussels initially and is currently being staffed. Eleven member states are bidding to provide it with a permanent location: Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK&#151;with a bid for Cardiff. Germany has not made a decision on the location of the GSA a priority during its current presidency of the Union.</p>

The GSA has been negotiating with a consortium bidding for this role. The Commission target is for the contract to be signed by end 2007. Full operational capability of the Galileo system is currently expected in 2011-12.</p>

 Regulation 13 of Chapter V of the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea places a general responsibility on contracting Governments for the adequate provision of aids to navigation in and around each of their respective coastal areas. Under Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act, responsibility for the provision of marine aids to navigation has been given to the general lighthouse authorities (GLAs). These are Trinity House Lighthouse Service, the Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which provides aids to navigation around the coast of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70320w0003.htm_para8"><a name="07032046000265">Under the Merchant Shipping Act, the expenses incurred by all three GLAs are paid out of the general lighthouse fund (GLF), into which are paid light dues collected in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The GLF is administered by the Secretary of State. Under an agreement signed in 1985, the Irish Government agreed to contribute to the provision of aids to navigation in the Republic. There is no contribution from the UK Government to the GLF nor is there a separate Irish lights fund.</p>

 The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. These surveys assess that the potential volume of opium production in Afghanistan was 6,100 metric tonnes (mt) in 2006, 4,100 mt in 2005, 4,200 mt in 2004, 3,600 mt in 2003 and 3,400 mt in 2002. The cultivation picture varies between and within provinces and comparing total levels of production does not necessarily represent an accurate picture of progress to date; in areas of Afghanistan where access to governance, security and development has improved, reductions achieved in 2005 were sustained and in some cases improved upon in 2006. Although it is too early to predict the levels of production in the next three years, the UNODC&#146;s 2007 Rapid Assessment Survey suggests that Afghanistan may be facing another year of high poppy cultivation.</p>

Arbitrary detention is common for political reasons, as well as criminal, and is sometimes imposed for apparently minor offences. Imprisonment without trial is also commonplace. Expatriates working on contracts in the country have been detained, not always in prison, in purely commercial disputes. Corruption and bribery is widespread throughout the judicial system. Nepotism is also rife, so resolving consular difficulties can be problematic and time consuming. Where trials do occur, they are often considered to be unfair. Amnesty international, which observed the coup trials in 2005, stated in its 2006 report that subsequent trials were also unfair, with defendants held incommunicado before the trial and reportedly convicted on the basis of confession statements extracted under torture.</p>

 Our ambassador in Harare and officials from the embassy, together with other members of the diplomatic community, have sought access to those detained following the violent suppression of the Save Zimbabwe Campaign prayer meeting on 11 March, as well as visiting the hospitals where the injured are being treated, and reported back on the horrific torture some of those have been subject too, including opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.</p>

The Zimbabwean ambassador was called into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 13 March to hear the UK&#146;s condemnation at first hand, and we have met leaders of Zimbabwe&#146;s trade unions to express support for their civil rights. We have urged the Zimbabwe authorities to allow all those still detained access to legal advice and all necessary medical care, and to arrange for their immediate release.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary briefed the Commonwealth Secretary-General on 30 January about the situation in the country. However, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth in December 2003 and there is currently no formal engagement between the two. Before Zimbabwe can rejoin and enjoy the support of the Commonwealth, it will need to satisfy all Commonwealth members it is meeting the basic human rights and governance principles as set out in the Harare Commonwealth declaration. As the dire current situation in Zimbabwe clearly demonstrates, it is a long way from doing so.</p>

 Primary care trusts (PCT) in England do not award dental providers an annual budget but an annual contract value, which is payable in equal monthly instalments, in return for an agreed level of service. Service levels may be defined by an annual number of units of dental activity (which are a weighted measure of courses of treatment), or they may include service outputs that cannot be measured through courses of treatment. All contract payments will be honoured if the dental provider delivers their agreed service levels. The Department does not assess the performance of individual dental providers. PCTs, as the commissioning bodies, are responsible for monitoring the delivery of services by their local dental providers.

 In previous years the pooled drug treatment budget (PTB) has been allocated using a formula based on an estimate of population need, linked to social and economic factors, known as the York formula. For 2007-08, the York formula continues to determine the majority of the PTB allocation formula. In 2007-08 the PTB indicative allocations also includes a small element of redistribution from those areas who currently receive a high level of Government contribution to the cost of treatment per person treated, to areas where the contribution is significantly lower. Nationally, this will mean a distribution of funding that is flatter per person treated than has previously been the case. For Enfield, the projected number of individuals in drug treatment in 2006-07 is 604. These figures are based on April to December data from the national drug treatment monitoring system.</p>

 We take the issue of eating disorders, especially among young people, very seriously. This is why the Department asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce a clinical guideline on the core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders, and which NICE published in 2004. The guideline covers physical and psychological treatments, treatment with medicines, and information specifically for patients, carers and the general public. The guideline is due for review in January 2008.</p>

These funds will assist in meeting and maintaining the Department&#146;s public service agreement (PSA) standard of a comprehensive CAMHS, including services for young people with an eating disorder. Further funds totalling &#163;134 million have been made available to the NHS and local authorities in 2006-07 to help achieve a comprehensive CAMHS in every area by the end of 2006 and that it is maintained thereafter.</p>

 The national health service provides a contribution to the cost of continuing education and training for professions whose income derives in part from providing NHS services. Under deregulatory changes approved by Parliament in 1986, the NHS provides optical vouchers to certain eligible groups to assist in buying glasses or contact lenses, but the dispensing of glasses is carried out on a private basis. The Department considers that these arrangements work well in promoting choice and access to services and that it would be anomalous to use public funds to make continuing education and training payments to health care professionals who do not provide services under contract to the NHS.</p>

 The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) keeps the risk of Avian Influenza (AI) under constant review. The Department has a range of preventive measures in place, which are ongoing, to address the risk of AI entering Northern Ireland and to stop it spreading in poultry. Wild bird surveillance is under way this winter throughout Northern Ireland and to date no highly pathogenic H5N1 AI has been found here. A NI Bird Register is in place to gather essential information about poultry, game and other captive birds for the purposes of risk assessment, disease prevention and control. DARD has issued extensive guidance to bird keepers on biosecurity measures to protect their birds, including on how to plan for housing birds in the event of an outbreak. This is also available on the DARD website.</p>

These include the introduction of a number of trade restrictions including new general and specific licensing arrangements,, and a ban on the movement of birds from Great Britain to attend bird gatherings and pigeon races here. The Department has also reiterated to bird keepers the importance of good biosecurity measures to minimise the risk to their birds. The Department continues to liaise closely with Defra to monitor developments, and also maintains very close contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food in the Republic of Ireland. The Department will continue to keep the situation under constant review and the need for additional measures in proportion to the level of risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_631"><a name="70320w0027.htm_para6"><a name="0703212001243">H5N1 avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds. Transmission to humans in contact with poultry/other birds occurs rarely and to date has occurred almost exclusively in people with very close physical contact with infected birds. The Northern Ireland Pandemic Influenza Control Committee (NIPICC) is concerned with contingency planning for, and management of, a pandemic of human influenza. As such NIPICC does not have a role in reviewing/managing an outbreak of avian influenza and hence has not met in relation to the most recent H5N1 outbreak in Suffolk.</p>

 I am discussing the application of the recent Pay Review Body settlements with ministerial colleagues in HM Treasury. Where comparable, the settlements, including nurses and other health professionals will apply in Northern Ireland. The Pay Review Body pay awards should ensure that the public sector can recruit, retain and motivate suitable staff. The Government have achieved a great deal in recent years with significantly increased investment in public services, with the NHS being the main beneficiary. This in turn has led to greatly increased pay for front line staff, fully recognising the hard work they undertake and service they offer on a daily basis. On balance, the latest pay award ensures that key front line workers continue to be fairly rewarded while maintaining the wider need for overall awards that help maintain our current UK economic success.</p>

 Fire safety training is the responsibility of individual school Boards of Governors. In order to help them carry out that responsibility, the Education and Library Boards have set out detailed fire precautions guidance in their publication "Health and Safety Manual&#151;A Manual for Principals and Governors". That manual requires school principals to ensure staff receive training in areas such as fire prevention and evacuation and also requires that a safety inspection is completed annually. Principals and governors of schools are further assisted by each board's health and safety practitioner in the preparation of fire evacuation policies and testing of school-based procedures. While primarily aimed at governors in controlled and maintained schools, the manual is also available via the boards' websites to voluntary grammar and grant-maintained integrated schools, whose governors have similar responsibilities.</p>

 I understand that planning for Towerview Primary School is well advanced and that final design stage costs are to be submitted by the South Eastern Education and Library Board to the Department of Education for approval. Once design costs have been received and approved it would normally take a few months to complete the remaining stages before construction work could commence. I would therefore expect the scheme should be able to start by the summer and take around 12 to 15 months to finish, subject to the necessary stages being completed satisfactorily.</p>
