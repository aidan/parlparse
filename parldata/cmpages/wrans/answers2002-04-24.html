<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will list the functions of his Department that have been <i>(a)</i> market tested and <i>(b)</i> outsourced in each of the last five years, specifying the (i) money saving and (ii) percentage saving in each case.  [43000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office on Tuesday 23 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 201W.

<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_wqn1"><B> Linda Perham: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will instruct the Performance and Innovation Unit to investigate the need for legislation on corporate social responsibility.  [50081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is responsible for corporate social responsibility. She will be issuing a report in mid-May 2002 'Business in Society' which will report on developments in corporate and social responsibility in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20424w01.html_para0">The Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) have already considered the international aspects of corporate social responsibility in the "Rights of Exchange" report of September 2000. This is available on the PIU website (www.piu.gov.uk).
<P>

<a name="20424w01.html_para1">As stated in my answer to the hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Derek Twigg) on 3 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 93W, I have also asked the PIU to undertake a project to review the legal and regulatory framework for charities and the wider voluntary and community sector and bring forward proposals for reform. This includes some consideration of issues of corporate social responsibility.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the cost to public funds of the funeral of HM the Queen Mother; and which Departments contributed.  [50685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B>

<a name="20424w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Saville Inquiry</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action has been taken regarding those responsible for the release of the names of soldiers involved in the events of 30 January 1972 in Londonderry.  [52042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Bloody Sunday inquiry is independent of Government and any action it has taken is a matter for the inquiry itself. However, we understand that procedures have been reviewed and significant improvements made.
<P>

<a name="20424w01.html_para2">So far as the two inadvertent disclosures by the team of lawyers representing the majority of soldiers are concerned, an official was reprimanded and a barrister apologised to the Tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20424w01.html_para3">The breach of security that occurred at the Treasury Solicitor's Department is the subject of a formal internal investigation, which is still being actively pursued.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether additional costs have been incurred in providing security to the former soldiers whose names were improperly released into the public domain by the Saville Inquiry.  [52043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The provision of security advice and additional protective measures where appropriate would of course incur costs. I am withholding details of these costs in accordance with Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much public funding has been provided to the legal representatives of his Department, HM armed forces and other individuals appearing at the Saville Inquiry, broken down by each <i>(a)</i> barrister, <i>(b)</i> firm of solicitors and <i>(c)</i> other body involved.  [48695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The payments made to the legal representatives appearing at the Saville Inquiry on behalf of the Ministry of Defence or HM armed forces are set out in the table. The figures include fees, expenses and VAT (where that is paid). The first date shows when the first payment was made, which may have been some months after the recipient was first instructed by the Ministry of Defence. The second date shows the payments made as at the end of February 2002. There are four teams representing the soldiers (necessary due to the existence of conflicts of interest between various individuals) and one representing the MOD.

 Bids were assessed against the criteria of best value for money, having regard to price, delivery and quality. Tenderers were required to produce financial evidence of guarantees or other financing arrangements that underwrote their ability to sign a contract in a timely manner. Government Departments and regional and industrial bodies with a legitimate interest in the strategic sealift service competition were consulted at all stages. The complexity of the transaction has extended the negotiations but all major questions have been resolved and we foresee no significant obstacle to early signature.

We have, however, at the same time, been able to take advantage of policies developed in recent years as set out in "British Shipping Charting a New Course" and elsewhere.

 These questions collectively concern the circumstances surrounding the death of Private Geoff Gray at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, on 17 September 2001. Some of the information requested has already been placed in the public domain in the form of witness evidence given at the coroner's inquest into the death of Private Gray, which was held on 19 March 2002. However, jurisdiction for the investigation into this incident was retained by the Surrey Police who will be briefing the family of Private Gray shortly on the circumstances surrounding his death. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage. The evidence will also be considered by an internal Army Board of Inquiry, which will convene on 25 April 2002. The inquiry is likely to take some time. The next of kin will, as a matter of courtesy, be afforded a copy of the final report in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what savings will be made from the standing down of 5 Squadron.  [49762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The down declaration of 5 Squadron in October 2004 was assumed in the 1999 Eurofighter Force Planning Assumptions and was part of a series of measures related to the introduction of Eurofighter. The Squadron's down declaration was designed to release manpower and other resources to allow the build up of Eurofighter squadrons to begin. As such, 'savings' arising from the down declaration of 5 Squadron will be offset elsewhere in the Defence programme. The decision to down declare 5 Squadron early, by January 2003, was taken to produce a more effective and efficient Tornado F3 capability pending the arrival into RAF service of the Eurofighter. Its aircraft and most of the Squadron's personnel are being redistributed among the other Tornado F3 squadrons. However, savings of approximately &#163;2 million over two years are expected.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> The capability to attack surface targets at intermediate range (35 to 100 nautical miles from the delivery platform) from RAF strike aircraft has been given the title SPEAR (Selective Precision Effects At Range). Studies into how the SPEAR capability might be best achieved are still ongoing. However, work to date has indicated that one single system may not be the most cost-effective solution, as the required effects of SPEAR will vary according to the various scenarios and target types against which it is used. The capability may, therefore, need to be realised through improvements to weapons to enter service in the short to medium term, as well as the introduction of a new system (or systems). Time scales for the delivery of the capability will depend upon which solution is chosen.

 United Kingdom forces did not use depleted uranium (DU) munitions in Northern Iraq during the Gulf War.

 The Royal Society reports on "The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions" consider three levels of exposure to depleted uranium (DU):

<a name="20424w04.html_para3">Level I&#151;exposures to personnel in a vehicle that is struck by a DU penetrator, or to personnel entering a struck vehicle immediately, typically to assist injured comrades.

<P>

<a name="20424w04.html_para5">Level III&#151;all other exposures, for example, being downwind of an impact or fire involving DU, or brief entry into contaminated vehicle.
<P>

<a name="20424w04.html_para6">No British troops who served in the Gulf or Balkans would have featured in the Level I scenario, or the worst case estimate for the Level II scenario, that is, personnel exposed to DU for about 100 hours.
<P>

<a name="20424w04.html_para7">Some duties undertaken by British troops in the Gulf could potentially have put them in scenarios representative of the Royal Society's Level II average estimate of 10 hours exposure to DU. However, the Royal Society's prediction of excess deaths from lung cancer and leukaemia, resulting from such Level II exposures, is very low (0.25 and 0.0007 per 10,000 respectively by the age of 75). This would not be detectable above the general risk of dying from cancer over a normal lifetime.

<a name="20424w05.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible for the co-ordination of policy for rural communities, assisted by myself and by the Department. My right hon. Friend chairs the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Rural Renewal, which addresses issues relevant to rural people that cut across departmental boundaries, and I am also a member of that Committee. The Countryside Agency is the Government's statutory adviser on rural and countryside issues, and in particular was asked to report publicly on the "rural-proofing" of the full range of Government policies; their first annual report was published on 11 April and a copy is available in the Library of the House. The Government's rural policies were set out in the White Paper "Our countryside: the future", published in November 2000; an update on progress was included in "England's Rural Future", which I published in December 2001.

<P>
<P>

 The Government have welcomed the publication of the energy review by the performance and innovation unit, which draws attention to the key role of renewable energy sources, including energy crops, in moving to a low carbon economy. The Government plan a public consultation on the key recommendations of the report leading to a White Paper in the autumn. This Department has allocated support of &#163;29 million to solid biomass crops through the energy crops scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. The Renewables Obligation permits the co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels. Working with other Departments we are putting in place further schemes with funding of &#163;70 million which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. We are also working closely with the Countryside Agency which has launched the Community Renewables Initiative to help local communities develop renewable energy projects. In the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor confirmed the new duty rate for biodiesel set at 20p per litre below the rate for ultra low sulphur diesel. The Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels.

 The Department and the Environment Agency (EA) manage a joint programme of research and development on flood management. Recent studies have been carried out by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory and HR Wallingford, both leading institutions in coastal and tidal research.

 At the moment, the prospective purchaser of a cleaner fuel vehicle applies to the Energy Saving Trust for a PowerShift grant before buying the vehicle or having their existing vehicle converted. This ensures that the conversion is on the PowerShift Register of clean, safe conversions, and safeguards against fraud. When the grant is confirmed, the applicant buys or converts the vehicle. The garage or converter provides a certificate, and the applicant claims the grant.
<P>

<a name="20424w08.html_para2">The trust have also introduced a new block grant scheme, under which the vehicle manufacturers can deduct the appropriate PowerShift grant from the list price or rental cost of the vehicle. This alternative means that the purchaser is not involved in applying for PowerShift grants.

<a name="20424w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The Department informed Network Rail, during the week before Network Rail made its bid to Railtrack Group plc on 25 March, that it was potentially willing to offer a &#163;300 million grant on the basis of Network Rail's proposal.
<P>

<a name="20424w09.html_para0">The grant offer is conditional upon Network Rail securing an earlier exit from administration than would otherwise have been the case and reflects the benefits available from this earlier exit.
<P>

<a name="20424w09.html_para1">Financial support of a type similar to that negotiated by Network Rail could be available to other bidders. The Government and the SRA are willing to discuss proposals advanced by any serious bidder for Railtrack plc. The guidelines issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 31 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 669&#150;71W, make clear that any proposal should address the basis, extent and nature of support that will be required from Government. Any support would be subject to negotiation and agreement. No other detailed proposals have been received.
<P>

<a name="20424w09.html_para2">The grant offer reflects the potential savings that can be delivered through an earlier exit from administration. This includes an earlier delivery of efficiency improvements; earlier improvements in network performance; avoiding any delay to the major projects identified in the SRA's Strategic Plan and an earlier end to the Government advisory costs associated with the administration.
<P>

<a name="20424w09.html_para3">In addition, the Network Rail bid itself offers an early implementation of a company limited by guarantee structure. This structure offers a greater alignment of the operation of the network with the wider public interest, a potentially more efficient financing structure through debt finance company and a company that re-invests surpluses back into the railway network rather than distributing them as shareholder dividends.

 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does not itself set specific safety targets but it encourages the rail industry to do so. However, HSE is pursuing a number of initiatives aimed at reducing railway staff injuries, including initiatives aimed at reducing the exposure of trackside workers to the risk of being struck by a train. The Health and Safety Commission will shortly publish a strategy for improving health and safety on the railways. This identifies a number of key areas for improvement on which the HSE will focus in its contacts with employers, including trackside worker safety. HSE encourages the setting of health and safety targets in the railway industry. The Railway Group Safety Plan for 2001&#150;02 sets out a number of detailed targets, including targets for reducing risks to railway staff working on Railtrack's infrastructure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 26 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 952&#150;53W, on London Underground, who will make the decision on further revision to safety cases; and who determined the requirement for previous safety cases.  [51453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As the duty holder under the Railway (Safety Case) Regulations 2000 (as amended), London Underground is responsible for revising its railway safety case. Where a revision would make an accepted safety case "materially different", the duty holder is required to submit the proposed revision to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) for assessment and consideration for acceptance. Guidance is set out in HSE's publication "Railway (Safety Case) Regulations 2000 including 2001 Amendments&#151;Guidance on Regulations".

[51263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Under the proposals for the modernisation of London Underground three contracts for maintenance and investment work would be awarded to private sector infrastructure companies. The contracts set clear requirements for improvements to be achieved by specific dates, with significant financial penalties for any delay. In order to meet their contractual obligations the infrastructure companies would have to deliver improvements to rolling stock, signalling, track and stations on all lines, including the Metropolitan line. The infrastructure companies would also take the risk of any cost overruns that result from their own inefficient or uneconomic behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20424w10.html_para1">The contractual obligations would be set out in legally binding contracts between London Underground and the infrastructure companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In relation to <i>(a)</i> London Underground is currently a nationalised industry, in the public sector. When it transfers to the control of Transport for London it will remain in the public sector. The Secretary of State's current powers in relation to London Underground are largely set out in the London Regional Transport Act 1984. These include a power (section 32) to give directions of a general nature, but not to require particular services to be run.
<P>

<a name="20424w10.html_para3">In relation to <i>(b)</i>, the Mayor has a general duty (section 141 of the Greater London Authority Act 2000) to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within Greater London, and is required to publish a transport strategy setting out his proposals. The Secretary of State has powers (section 143) to issue directions to revise that transport strategy if it is inconsistent with national transport policy and that inconsistency is detrimental to any area outside Greater London.

<P>
<a name="20424w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 Under the Data Protection Act 1998 details of a person's religious beliefs are classed as sensitive personal data. Where a patient is incapable of providing consent, perhaps through serious or terminal illness, it is possible for hospital staff to disclose religious affiliation, as this may in the circumstances be in the best interests of the patient. Where the patient is capable of giving consent, it is open to the hospital authorities to seek their agreement to disclose their religious beliefs to the hospital chaplain. The Department of Health is currently considering the need to issue guidance on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's policy has been determined by the overriding need to ensure the long-term viability and effectiveness of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It was clear that the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had lost the confidence of a significant number of the organisation's executive council. For this reason we concluded that the interests of the OPCW and the CWC would be best served if the Director-General were to be replaced by someone who could enjoy the full confidence of all states parties to the convention. The United Kingdom delegation to the Special Conference of States Parties, which convened on 21 April, was guided by this position. The matter came to a vote at the Special Conference on 22 April. The outcome was 48 votes in support of the termination of the Director-General's appointment, with seven votes against and 43 abstentions. The Director-General's appointment was therefore terminated with immediate effect.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Anyone aged 19 or over was able to open an individual learning account. Within the universal offer ILAs were targeted toward four key groups&#151;young people aged 19&#150;30 with few or no skills or qualifications, women returning to the labour market, the self-employed and non-teaching school staff. An advertising campaign between October and December 2000 concentrated on two of these groups&#151;young people aged 19&#150;30 with few or no qualifications and women returning to the labour market. The campaign used local and commercial radio and was supported by national and regional newspapers.
<P>

<a name="20424w13.html_para3">In addition, further steps were taken to ensure the programme reached those in the target groups. The Department targeted self-employed/owner mangers through the small firm learning account (SFLA) pilot project. Over 200 small businesses actively participated in the pilot and 1,242 employees opened an ILA. From January 2001, the Department funded five ILA community projects in Liverpool, Sheffield, Kent and London and 3,279 accounts were opened. These projects placed particular emphasis on targeting hard to reach groups and the pilots were successful in engaging black and ethnic minority groups and people with no existing qualifications. The Department also worked with the TUC to engage groups of learners that were traditionally hard to reach through the Union Learning Fund and Learning Representatives. 79 per cent. of TUC ILA users were from priority groups, least likely to participate in learning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are two principal sources of support for young people taking vocational qualifications in schools or colleges, both administered by DfES. Further Education Learner Support Funds help students aged 16&#150;19 who are from low income families or who face a particular financial difficulty. Payments are made to eligible students in school 6th forms and FE colleges for course related costs, including transport, child care, residential and hardship funding. In 2002&#150;03, the Department increased overall discretionary support funding for young people in FE to &#163;54 million, an 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 2002 : Column 304W</I><P>
increase of &#163;10 million since 2000&#150;01. It is not possible to say how much of this funding was received by young people studying for vocational qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20424w14.html_para3">In addition to the Learner Support Fund, the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is also available to young people in full-time further education in 56 pilot areas in England. In 2001&#150;02, around &#163;100 million will have been spent in the 56 pilot areas, with anticipated spend for 2002&#150;03 of &#163;156 million. Again, it is not possible to say how much of this funding was received by young people taking vocational courses.
<P>

<a name="20424w14.html_para4">For young people in work-based training, which does not attract a wage, we provide support through the Minimum Training Allowance (MTA). The MTA is currently worth at least &#163;40 per week, although the local Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) who administer MTA are able to pay higher local rates. In addition to weekly payments, local LSCs are also able to assist young people on MTA in difficult financial circumstances by giving additional help towards costs such as transport and the purchase of learning equipment etc.
<P>

<a name="20424w14.html_para5">In all these cases, payment is made directly to the young person, with the exception of some of the EMA pilots where the option of payment to a parent or guardian is being trialed.
<P>

<a name="20424w14.html_para6">Support for families is administered by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue. Child benefit and any child allowances paid with other benefits and tax credits are paid to families with children under 16, or to families with children over 16 but under 19 who are continuing in full-time non-advanced further education. The new child tax credit, to be introduced in April 2003, continues that practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The proposal to remove children from the application of sections 13 and 14 of the Education Act 1996 applies only to the children of asylum seekers who will be educated in-house in accommodation centres. All other children, including refugees, will continue to be educated in schools maintained by local education authorities. This proposal has been prepared in close consultation with the Home Office.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> There will not be a statutory obligation for accommodation centres which provide education for asylum seekers to have an anti-bullying policy. Matters such as anti-bullying and the discipline of the children attending the education provision in the accommodation centres may be provided in the agreement between the Home Secretary and the contractor. However, the education that will be provided for these children will mirror what they would get in schools.

 Following a public consultation, in March this year the Secretary of State announced plans to extend the availability of Parenting Orders to cover cases of non-criminal misbehaviour by pupils resulting in exclusions from school. We understand that the Home Office will issue a Criminal Justice White Paper in the late spring 2002 which will refer to the plans to extend Parenting Orders, probably by means of a Criminal Justice Bill in due course. Parenting Orders normally require parents to attend counselling or guidance sessions to help them cope better with their child's challenging behaviour and take more responsibility for that behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20424w15.html_para0">The Department has already made clear that when necessary Headteachers can permanently exclude pupils responsible for serious disruption, violence or a threat of violence. We recently consulted on a revision to part of Circular 10&#150;99 'Social Inclusion: Pupil Support'. This stated that the Secretary of State would not normally

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the future use of dyslexia teachers in schools; and if she will review the funding of dyslexia teaching.  [50921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 It is important that teachers are properly prepared for the range of special educational needs (SEN) they will encounter in schools. As part of their initial training, all student teachers must show that they understand their responsibilities under the SEN Code of Practice, and know how to seek advice. These skills are reinforced and developed during induction, when teachers have to demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN.
<P>

<a name="20424w15.html_para1">Opportunities for continuing professional development for teachers in post are supported under the training component of the SEN category of the Department's Standards Fund, which provides grant aid to local education authorities and schools. &#163;91 million of supported expenditure is available for SEN in 2002&#150;03. Training in dyslexia is specifically mentioned in the guidance for the category and this can range from awareness raising sessions to more in-depth specialist training. Grant support has also been made available to voluntary organisations and higher education training providers to create new training opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20424w15.html_para2">Responsibility for ensuring that appropriate provision exists for children with SEN rests with the school and LEA. More than &#163;23 billion is available annually for the education of pupils, including children with SEN. Over &#163;1 billion of this is used by LEAs to provide additional support for children with SEN, including transport. When allocating budgets to schools in 2001&#150;02, LEAs also identified over &#163;1.9 billion as allocated to SEN. However, it is for individual schools to decide how they spend this funding taking account of their statutory duties towards children with SEN.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> The Department does not collect information on the number of toilet facilities in schools.
<P>

<a name="20424w15.html_para3">In 1998&#150;99, the Department had a &#163;35 million programme for the construction of internal toilet facilities so that it would be unnecessary for any children to have to use lavatories accessible only from outside. 450 projects were supported through the programme which should have addressed the issue, although it was down to individual Local Education Authorities to identify needs and apply for a grant. Also, many schools would have retained toilets adjacent to playing fields, and in some cases to serve temporary classrooms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Further to my comments during the Standing Committee's consideration of the draft Contracting Out (Local Education Authority Functions) (England) Order 2002 (official report of the Eighth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, 5 March 2002, column 23) it would be possible under the Order for a contractor to determine the dates when school terms and holidays are to begin and to end. I should clarify that the contractor could, depending on the terms of the contract with an LEA, determine to move from a three term year to a different arrangement, where such decisions lie with the LEA. In the case of foundation, foundation special and voluntary-aided schools, responsibility lies with the governing body. We believe that LEAs will want to ensure that clear arrangements about such decisions are contained in any relevant contract. We would expect there to be wide consultation and, if any change is to be made, that ample notice would be given so that parents, teachers and others can plan accordingly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what support has been given since 1997 to assist businesses in taking on apprentices.  [51483]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government has contributed substantial financial support for Modern Apprenticeships (MAs), which provide craft, technological and business skills. Between 1997 and 2002 over &#163;3.7 billion has been allocated to Government-supported work-based learning, of which it is estimated that in excess of &#163;1 billion has been used to support MAs since 1997. As a result of this investment, the number of young people on MAs has risen from 75,000 in 1997 to over 220,000 today. We are investing an additional &#163;180 million over three years 2001&#150;04 to support and further develop MAs, a clear sign of the importance we attach to their role in raising skills levels in the workplace, and in offering young people high quality vocational and work-related options for post-16 learning. The Government and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) recently agreed a target of over a quarter of young people between the age of 16 and 21 entering MAs by 2004.
<P>

<a name="20424w15.html_para4">In addition to direct funding of MAs, we assist businesses in other ways. For example, the LSC has a major role in raising skills levels and is active in improving employers' awareness of MAs. National Training Organisations (NTOs) have played an important role in developing apprenticeship frameworks to meet employer needs in their sector and promoting entry by young people; new Sector Skills Councils, supported by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) and the LSC, will provide an even stronger focus for employers to lead the development of apprenticeships linked to skills and productivity priorities and sector needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The decision about how to provide for a child who has special educational needs (SEN) must be taken locally in the light of all the circumstances. Under the Education Act 1996, each local education authority (LEA) is under a duty to identify and make suitable provision for children's SEN and where necessary to make a statement. A statutory assessment can also be requested by parents who have the right to be involved with all the relevant professionals in decisions about meeting their child's needs.
<P>

<a name="20424w16.html_para0">In 2000 (latest figures available) the overall level of children with statements in St. Helens LEA was 4.6 per cent. compared to the national rate of 3 per cent. The authority has set targets to reduce the number of statements it maintains and figures for January 2002 will be available later this year.

 Chapter 2 of Treasury's Guidance "Non-Departmental Public Bodies: Annual Reports and Accounts Guidance" requires executive NDPBs to provide, as part of their annual reports, information about the performance and efficiency targets agreed with their sponsor Departments and performance against those targets. The information is to be given for the current year and the four previous years. All of the Department for Education and Skills executive NDPBs, which are: Adult Learning Inspectorate; British Educational Communications and Technology Agency; Construction Industry Training Board; Engineering Construction Industry Training Board; Higher Education Funding Council for England; Investors in People UK; Learning

and Skills Council; National College for School Leadership; Qualifications and Curriculum Authority; Student Loans Company; and Teacher Training Agency, annual reports are available in the House Library. As the Construction Industry Training Board and Engineering Construction Industry Training Board are self funding we do not set them efficiency targets, however, the boards set themselves efficiency targets, the details and progress towards which are available in their annual reports. Our tribunal NDPBs are also self funding, so we set neither Special Educational Needs Tribunal nor Registered Inspectors Appeals Tribunal efficiency targets. The SENT annual reports are available in the House Library and RIAT has no permanent staff and has only met once since it was registered in 1992 so setting efficiency targets and producing annual reports seems inappropriate.

 The Government are particularly concerned that the young and more vulnerable members of society should be protected from potentially harmful material.
<P>

<a name="20424w19.html_para5">The general law underpins this approach. The Obscene Publications Act 1959 is the principal control on broadcast and published works, including material published via the internet, and makes it a criminal offence to publish any article which, in the view of the court, tends to "deprave and corrupt" those who are likely to read, see or hear it. In addition, under the Indecent Displays (Controls) Act 1981 it is an offence to display any indecent material in a public place or where it can be seen from a public place. In addition, where a publication does not fall under these controls, most newsagents abide by a voluntary code of practice, placing pornographic magazines on the top shelves and refusing to sell them to young people under 18.

<a name="20424w20.html_para1">Under existing sex offences legislation, rape is an offence perpetrated by a man against a man or a woman. It consists of non-consensual penetration of the vagina or anus. There has been at least one case where a court has held that penile penetration of a surgically reconstructed vagina does constitute rape, but the current law on rape is not clear on this point. Alternative charge could be indecent assault. The Government are currently considering a proposal made within the context of the Sex Offences Review, that the offence of rape should include surgically reconstructed male or female genitalia. This would make clear in statute what is currently a matter for judicial interpretation.

 There are currently no plans to increase the maximum sentence for illegal dealing in wildlife.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> Denial of guilt is not of itself a bar to the release of prisoners from custody. The assessment of the prisoner's current level of risk is the pre-eminent factor in determining whether he/she may be granted parole. Although denial makes it harder to conduct a risk assessment, it should still be possible to make one, taking into account, among other things, the prisoner's attitudes and behaviour during sentence. The Prison Service has to assume that the prisoner was rightly convicted. Prisoners who maintain their innocence are advised to contact the independent Criminal Cases Review Commission who are responsible for investigating alleged miscarriages of justice.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) has responsibility for enforcement action by means of a formal investigation where it has reason to believe that a person has committed or is committing an unlawful act under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act DDA, and any regulations made under it. It can also help individual disabled people secure their rights by, in some circumstances, providing legal assistance. The DRC also has responsibilities to provide information and advice to service providers, including pubs, about their obligations under the DDA and guidance on good practice. It prepares statutory codes of practice, runs a Helpline and undertakes general awareness raising initiatives. These activities complement the media campaigns run by the Government to raise awareness of the DDA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 People who opt to have their retirement pension paid into their bank account are normally paid four weeks in arrears. From 2003, payment directly into bank accounts will become the normal method of paying benefits and pensions. We will be enhancing our computer systems to make payments of retirement pension available in advance and on a weekly basis.

<P>

<a name="20424w25.html_para0">If payment were made for part weeks at the start of a claim only, and there was no recovery of overpaid benefit at the end of a claim, we estimate that this would incur a cost of up to &#163;20 million per annum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> Smart card technology is currently being used within the Department for Work and Pensions for security and access control as part of a project to modernise the Department's IT infrastructure. The project is currently part way through implementation, and all offices should be on stream by the end of 2002. Competitive tenders were sought for the supply of the Smart Card technology. Schlumberger, GemPlus and Giesecke and Devrient submitted proposals and the contract was awarded to GemPlus.

<P>
<P>

 Although the Fit for Work scheme was initially successful, it gradually became less effective at promoting employers' awareness of disabled people's potential in the workforce and was ended in 1991.
<P>

<a name="20424w25.html_para2">There are no plans to reintroduce the scheme as it has been replaced by the two ticks disability symbol initiative which was launched in 1990 to foster employers' commitment to good practice in employing disabled people. This scheme is administered by the Jobcentre Plus Disability Service, which maintains a database of employers using the symbol, who currently number around 5,000. The Disability Service updates the database with information from Disability Employment Advisers and compiles the National List of Disability Symbol Users, which gives details of all symbol users and the town or city in which they are located. All symbol users have signed a declaration agreeing that this information can be included on the list. Copies of the list are available to members of the public from their local Disability Employment Adviser.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the number of people who will be affected by the changes to the eligibility criteria for the payment of the lower rate mobility component of disability living allowance, as laid down in S.I., 2002, No. 648; and if he will make a statement.  [48911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w26.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The provisions of S.I. 2002 No. 648 (The Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) (Amendment) Regulations 2002) now form part of the qualifying conditions for the lower rate mobility component of disability living allowance. They potentially affect any claims for the component which are based on fear or anxiety experienced when walking out of doors without guidance or supervision from another person on unfamiliar routes. About 200 people who are known to have qualified for the component as a result of the Tribunal of Social Security Commissioners decision R(D)4/2001, which gave rise to the need for the regulations, may well be affected, but this will depend on the individual circumstances of each claim. As explained in Command Paper 5469 published at the same time as the Regulations, longer-term estimates of people affected can only be made in very general terms.

 Health professionals and mental health services managers are expected to ensure that electro- convulsive therapy (ECT) is administered to patients in accordance with the guidance issued by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.
<P>

<a name="20424w26.html_para5">In September 1998, the Chief Medical Officer and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists wrote to the chief executives of national health service trusts, consultant psychiatrists indicating the need to consider and improve standards of ECT administration in relation to ongoing developments in clinical governance.
<P>

<a name="20424w26.html_para6">The college has a special committee on ECT and in 1995 it published detailed guidance entitled, "The ECT Handbook&#151;The Second Report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT". This is an important source of practical guidance for health professionals, mental health services managers and patients and includes sections on clinical guidelines; the use and administration of ECT; anaesthesia in ECT; the staffing and layout of ECT suites; matters relating to the law and consent. The appendices include, for example, nursing guidelines in relation to ECT and check lists for good practice in the provision of ECT services. The college is aware of the need to update this guidance and hopes to publish a revised handbook by the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what precautions his Department recommends in order to protect dentists and their employees from exposure to mercury during the placement or removal of dental amalgam fillings.  [48834]<P>

<P>
<a name="20424w27.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Dentists are required to work within health and safety legislation and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) regulations regarding all aspects of their practice, including the handling of mercury and dental amalgam. The British Dental Association also issues guidance on this topic.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will require dentists to advise patients of the potential toxicity of dental amalgam.  [48833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w27.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) reviewed the safety of dental amalgam fillings in 1997 and concluded that their use was free from systemic toxicity and did not pose a risk. As a precautionary measure, COT advised dentists that it may be prudent to avoid, where clinically reasonable, the placement or removal of amalgam fillings during pregnancy. This guidance to dentists remains current.

<P>

 There is no Government target for the number of general practitioners (GPs) per thousand population. The number of GPs per thousand at 30 September 2001 is shown in the table for England and also for Wigan and Bolton health authority. Information is not available by constituency.
<P>

<a name="20424w27.html_para1">The GP work force envelope for Greater Manchester strategic health authority, which includes Bolton South East primary care group, is an increase of 180 GPs between 1999 and 2004.

The guidance on filling GP vacancy issued on 13 March 2002 stated new PCTs below the existing average of 53.2 GPs per 100,000, like Bolton South East, should look to increase GP numbers by at least 6 per cent. or to at least the projected average of 55.7 GPs per 100,000. This would mean Bolton South East should look to recruit at least three and up to 20 GPs by 2004.

Improvements in GP computer systems completed at the end of March 2002 means that all GPs are able to record as part of patient record details whether a person is a carer.

<P>
<a name="20424w29.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the cost effectiveness of naltrexone in the rehabilitation of heroin addicts. Any potential future analysis would be carried out by the National Treatment Agency (NTA). This would most likely be made in consultation with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Naltrexone (as described in the British National Formulary) is given as an 'adjunct' to prevent relapse so that cost-effectiveness would need to address the context of use. In general terms there is little evidence on how long naltrexone should be used to remain effective in rehabilitation so adequate data on cost-effectiveness for this indication is unlikely to be available at present.

 The Government have decided that details of its medical countermeasures for response to any possible biological or chemical attack, and any tendering process for these, should not be put in the public domain, as this is information that could be useful to terrorists.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what funds have been provided by his Department for <i>(a)</i> research into the extent of hospital delayed discharge resulting from elderly patients unable to be discharged because their home does not provide a warm and healthy living environment and <i>(b)</i> practical improvement programmes to ensure that elderly people discharged from hospital can return to a healthy and comfortable home.

<P>

<a name="20424w30.html_para3">The Department has awarded a total of nearly &#163;1 million over the three years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to Age Concern (England), Help the Aged, and the British Red Cross Society. This is being used to develop local intermediate care projects, which provide practical help through volunteers to ensure that older people's own homes are safe and comfortable, in order to prevent hospital admission or to facilitate discharge from hospital. The Home Office Active Community Unit has matched this funding.
<P>

<a name="20424w30.html_para4">A number of Health Action Zones have funded systems to enable health professionals to refer patients suffering from the effects of cold housing, including patients to be discharged from hospital, for help with heating and insulation. In August 2001, the Department of Health funded publication by National Energy Action of "Affordable Warmth and Health Action Zones, a Good Practice Guide", which describes these projects.
<P>

<a name="20424w30.html_para5">The Department funds the 'Keep Warm, Keep Well' campaign each winter. In the winter of 2001&#150;02, this involved distribution of over 2.3 million leaflets, information packs for healthcare professionals, and a national telephone advice line to enable eligible older people and other groups to claim grants for insulation and heating and benefits.

<P>
<a name="20424w30.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The two week outpatient waiting time standard was introduced for all urgent cases of suspected cancer during 2000. Central monitoring of performance against the standard began on the 1 January 2001. In the first quarter monitoring (January&#151;March 2001) 93.5 per cent. of people urgently referred with suspected cancer were seen within two weeks. The latest data (October&#151;December 2001) shows that 95.1 per cent. of people urgently referred with suspected cancer were seen within two weeks.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Information about the use of sun protection creams will be available from the normal routes as well as through NHS Direct. We launched on 14 March a new Department of Health website www.doh.gov.uk/sunsafe providing sun safety advice. We are also collaborating with other key stakeholders this year in ensuring that a range of sun safety advice is publicly available. For example, the Department-funded National Radiological Protection Board has recently launched the "Sunsense" posters describing the use of sunscreens.

 We made clear in the NHS Plan that consideration had been given to buying out the bulk of private practice nationally. Analysis suggested this would probably cost at least &#163;700 million and would be unlikely to work in practice. The Government therefore proposed that for an initial period, perhaps seven years, all newly appointed consultants would be restricted from undertaking similar work outside the NHS. After this 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 2002 : Column 370W</I><P>
initial period the right to undertake private practice would depend on fulfilling job plans and NHS service requirements. The concept of a maximum part-time contract would be abolished. The relationship between NHS work and private practice remains under discussion as part of the negotiations on a new consultant contract.

<a name="20424w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> The Department collects hospital activity information by several mechanisms, including Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Service and Financial Framework Return.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para0">Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) provide information on in-patient care delivered by national health service hospitals in England and are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts. The HES database includes information about the treatment of private patients in NHS hospitals. Information from HES may be downloaded free of charge from www.doh.gov.uk/hes.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para1">The Service and Financial Framework Return (SaFFR) is the mechanism for monitoring the delivery of all NHS targets in the NHS Plan and the NHS Plan Implementation Programme. Data are collected quarterly from primary care trusts and include data on all NHS-funded activity, whether or not it takes place in NHS hospitals.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para2">Some elements within the SaFFR ask for information that distinguishes activity carried out within the NHS from activity commissioned from non-NHS organisations. However, no information is collected solely in relation to activity in private hospitals (as distinct from other independent provider organisations). The Department has also carried out a survey of NHS health authorities and trusts on the acute elective activity they commissioned from the independent sector last year, and will make available key results shortly.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para3">The Department does not collect information about activity in private hospitals for private patients.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what information he collates into delays in prescription of electrically powered indoor-outdoor wheelchairs; and what service standards are set centrally in this area.  [48819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w32.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> We do not collect details centrally, of the length of time it takes to receive an EPIOC (electrically powered indoor- outdoor) wheelchair once it is assessed to be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para4">We do not set service standards centrally; these are a matter for local services.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para5">The Department is embarking on work, in partnership with the Modernisation Agency and Wheelchair Services themselves, aimed at improving services generally and spreading best practice across the country.

<P><I>24 Apr 2002 : Column 374W</I><P>
persons of working age. Getting people back to functional independence following an accident or illness however, is a priority for the national health service. This recovery process will include access to rehabilitation services.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para6">We are working with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Health and Safety Executive on job retention and rehabilitation pilots to test different health and employment strategies to help people with long term sickness or disability to remain in their jobs. They will start in late summer 2002 and run for two years. Job retention advisers will act early to assist those who have been forced to give up work through prolonged illness or disability to retain their skills and links with employers.

<a name="20424w32.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> The design and testing stages of the information systems infrastructure project completed on time. The roll out of the information systems infrastructure to each office has been under way since July 2001. A total of 69 offices have been fully rolled out with a further 11 due to complete by July. Final costs are not available, as the project has not completed but are not expected to exceed the &#163;19.6 million budget for the project.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para7">The registration and inspection system project is expected to complete in June 2002 as scheduled. However the system is now available for initial processing of applications and the start of training. The final costs are not available as the project has not completed but are not expected to exceed the &#163;4.5 million budget for the project.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para8">The finance information technology system was in place on 2 April 2002 as scheduled. Final cost for the project will be &#163;1.4 million.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what powers PCTs will have to determine service provision by acute hospital trusts.  [50807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> Primary care trusts (PCTs) have a legal duty to work in partnership to deliver the agreed objectives of a local health economy. With the shift in the balance of power to the frontline, PCTs (subject to legislation) will lead the development of a local health improvement and modernisation plan that will inform the development of local services. PCTs have a legal duty and freedom to secure the provision of locally relevant, high quality services for the populations they serve. By engaging front-line clinicians in decision making, PCTs will be in a position to ensure better informed commissioning agreements are reached with acute providers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the publicly available performance measures for <i>(a)</i> PCTs, <i>(b)</i> acute hospital trusts, <i>(c)</i> consultants and <i>(d)</i> departments within acute hospitals.  [50793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> In September 2001 for the first time, the Government published 'NHS Performance ('star') Ratings' for all acute trusts. The publication is available on the Department's website: http://www.doh.gov.uk/performanceratings. The ratings are formulated on the basis of performance over 2001&#150;01 using a set of key targets supplemented by a balanced scorecard covering the areas of staff, clinical, and patient focus.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para10">In February this year, we published a third set of 'NHS Performance Indicators', and the first to include a full range of indicators for NHS hospital trusts. The publication is available on the Department's website: http://www.doh.gov.uk/nhsperformanceindicators/2002. The set of indicators chosen for publication was developed through a process of extensive public consultation that included the NHS and the Royal colleges.




<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 2002 : Column 376W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para11">Our intention is for the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) to take over the publication of 'NHS Performance Indicators' and the 'NHS Performance Ratings', which for future will be brought together into one annual publication covering not just hospitals but all other types of NHS trust including primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="20424w32.html_para12">To date, we have not published information on the performance of individual departments within acute hospitals, or individual consultants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans there are to increase the number of national service frameworks.  [50802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20424w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> The national service framework (NSF) programme currently includes frameworks for mental health (1999), coronary heart disease (2000), the national cancer plan (2000), older people (2001) and diabetes standards (2001). The diabetes NSF delivery strategy is due to be published in 2002 and work is in hand on NSFs for renal services, childrens' services and long term conditions. These frameworks amount to a significant programme of quality improvement across the national health service. We have no plans to amend the programme at present.
