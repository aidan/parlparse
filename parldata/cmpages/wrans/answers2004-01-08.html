 The Government are keen to see, where appropriate, a level playing field between industrial and provident societies and companies. We are currently examining our options for taking forward this agenda. However, in order to provide for a strategic, consistent and up-to-date approach between companies and societies, the Government believe that the general modernisation of industrial and provident society legislation in this area should be considered in the light of the DTI's planned major reform of company law,

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the number of families in the Leeds, North-West constituency who will benefit from the child trust fund.  [146205]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 All eligible children born since 1 September 2002 in families awarded child benefit will receive a child trust fund (CTF). Based on take-up of child benefit, it is estimated that virtually all children born will receive a CTF. Projected birth figures by Parliamentary constituency are not available, although figures for actual births and numbers receiving child benefit by parliamentary constituency are available in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="40108w01.html_para3">The CTF is intended to encourage parents and children to develop the savings habit. It will ensure that every child, whatever their family background, will have access at the age of 18 when they begin their adult life, to a stock of assets which they can invest in their future.
<P>

<a name="40108w01.html_para4">It will also help children and their parents to understand the benefits of saving and investment and how to engage with financial institutions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether it is his policy that the additional sum for research and development announced in his pre-Budget report will be filtered down to local colleges which have good science study courses; whether he expects Leyton Sixth Form College to gain from the additional funds; and if he will make a statement.  [146358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w01.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The additional spending on research and development announced in the pre-Budget report 2003 arose from improvements to the R&D tax credits schemes for both small and large companies.
<P>

<a name="40108w01.html_para5">The improvements included a new draft definition of R&D and an extension of qualifying costs. These changes will give companies greater clarity and certainty, as well as broadening the scope of expenses on which the credit can be claimed.
<P>

<a name="40108w01.html_para6">The pre-Budget report also set out the main findings of the Lambert Review into the links between universities and businesses in the UK and the significant benefits to be gained from greater collaboration. Key recommendations included a new funding stream for business-relevant research and the encouragement of new forms of networks between business people and academics. The Government will make a full response to the recommendations by summer 2004.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of tax revenue lost to the UK Exchequer in each of the last five years due to tax policies of the administrations of <i>(a)</i> the Channel Islands, <i>(b)</i> the Isle of Man, <i>(c)</i> the Cayman Islands, <i>(d)</i> Bermuda and <i>(e)</i> other Caribbean islands for which the UK Government has a responsibility; and if he will make a statement.  [146360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There is no reliable measure of total tax revenue lost to the UK Exchequer as a result of the tax policies of the administrations of the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. However, in order to minimise tax lost, or at risk, the UK is committed to encouraging the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories to match international standards on exchange of information for tax purposes and on fair tax competition and welcomes progress that has been made so far.
<P>

<a name="40108w01.html_para7">The Government also remain determined to take necessary steps domestically to protect tax revenues and have, for example, introduced legislation to counter various offshore avoidance schemes, and are funding additional activity by the Inland Revenue aimed at tackling the exploitation of offshore trusts.

 HM Customs and Excise's prosecution figures for Hydrocarbon Oil fraud over the past three years, including the number of convictions and the average sentence, are set out in their Annual Report (HC 52) published in December 2003. This also contains figures for the total value of fraud detected and identified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w02.html_wqn3"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what measures have been put in place 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2004 : Column 427W</I><P>
to reduce tax evasion since 1997; and what estimates have been made of additional sums collected as a result.  [146328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Activities designed to counter tax evasion are a normal and continuing part of the Inland Revenue's business. Important measures introduced since 1997 include the implementation of the&#151;'Grabiner' recommendations; Proceeds of Crime Act; Savings Directive; Money Laundering provisions and Production Powers for use in criminal cases. Additionally, specifically funded compliance and enforcement packages have been put in place to tackle fraud and protect the Exchequer from non-payment of tax and other duties. In the 2003 Budget the Chancellor announced additional funding of &#163;66 million over three years for such a package.
<P>

<a name="40108w02.html_para0">Typically, new measures to counter tax evasion are designed to work within the wider compliance regime and in concert with other measures. Consequently, often no meaningful estimates can be made of additional sums collected as a result of particular measures in isolation. Figures of total estimated additional liability flowing from the Inland Revenue's work tackling non-compliance are shown each year in their Annual Reports, copies of which are available in the House of Commons Library.

 Many measures have been taken to prevent overheight vehicles striking bridges, including improved signing and conspicuity of low bridges, and regulations requiring that the vehicle's height be displayed in the cab. Despite these measures bridges continue to be struck. Such strikes can cause disruption to road and rail traffic, even for minor incidents, and a serious incident could cause injury and damage. The Department let a research contract last year to investigate the causes and possible prevention of bridge strikes, with the aim of identifying which available measures are likely to be worth pursuing so that drivers follow a route that is appropriate for their vehicle. My officials will be discussing the research findings and possible future steps with a wide range of stakeholders who meet with the Department in the Bridge Strike Prevention Group.

<P>
<a name="40108w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> For the detailed references to congestion in the RIA, calculations represent estimated time lost in seconds per kilometre travelled for different vehicle types compared with speeds obtained in periods of light traffic flow . In urban areas light flow speeds are usually speeds achieved at night time and would incorporate the effects of traffic signals, pedestrian crossings and other unavoidable constraints on vehicle movement.
<P>

<a name="40108w03.html_para7">In 2000, the average time lost per vehicle kilometres as a result of congestion was 24.8 seconds on roads in large urban areas and 3.2 seconds on strategic inter-urban roads.
<P>

<a name="40108w03.html_para8">The Highways Agency estimates that the introduction of Regional Control Centres and Traffic Officers will lead to a reduction in congestion on motorways of up to 5 per cent. We expect that measures outside of the scope of the Bill, such as additional capacity at key points on the strategic road network, many of which will be implemented alongside, will also lead to reductions in congestion on trunk roads.
<P>

For a wide range of known hosts of the sudden oak death fungus (<i>Phytophthora ramorum</i> is its scientific name), specific measures must be followed before the authorities in the exporting country can issue the certificate. For trade within the EU, specific disease control measures are applied at the place of production to rhododendrons and viburnums, the two types of plant which have been most often found to be infected in Europe. Plant passports are then issued that travel with consignments allowing their free movement between member states.
<P>

<a name="40108w04.html_para9">Findings of <i>P ramorum</i> in imported and UK origin plants are of concern and inspections at UK nurseries and ports of entry are to be stepped up to ensure that all consignments of plants moved into and within the UK are free from <i>P ramorum</i> and meet plant passport requirements. Any consignment found to be infected, or not to have the correct documentation, will, as now, be destroyed. The UK will support extension of specific measures against <i>P ramorum</i> to additional types of plant when these are shown to present a significant risk.

<a name="40108w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors (PHSI) are already employed for around 20 per cent. of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to Phytophthora ramorum, which is known in the USA as sudden oak death. However, in response to the increasing number of findings of this pathogen in England and Wales, the plant health service is to employ at least 20 additional staff to cover the increased rate of inspections at production nurseries, wild planting areas and ports of entry. This is part of a package of measures announced on 4 December. Wherever possible, suitably qualified field staff will be transferred from elsewhere in the Department. These will be supplemented by recruitment of a small number of staff with appropriate experience and qualifications (e.g. ex-PHSI staff). Transfer and recruitment will start in January.

 Within the recent Skills Strategy, 21st Century Skills, Realising our Potential, we have highlighted the challenge in making real improvements in raising the skills level of our workforce. We know that the majority of working women are concentrated in just five occupational groups which are often low paid and low skilled. For example 89 per cent. of hairdressers and beauticians are women and in a survey their average pay was found to be the second lowest of all occupations <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="40108w05.html_para2">Some sectors identified as having significant skill weaknesses, such as Construction and Transport and Communications, have extreme occupational segregation. Only 9 per cent. of the workforce in Construction are women and 24 per cent. in Transport and Communications.
<P>

<a name="40108w05.html_para3">While we cannot entirely influence women's career choices, both the Skills Strategy and our recent Innovation Report identifies some of the levers to improve skills levels and for the UK to have a highly educated workforce with a culture of lifelong learning. To do this we have made a commitment to provide better information, advice and guidance on skills, training and qualifications so that people know what is available to them.
<P>

<a name="40108w05.html_para4">We have identified that our young people need to be properly prepared for the world of work. That is why we have commissioned a Working Group, chaired by Mike Tomlinson to advise on the development of more coherent vocational programmes for 14&#150;19 year olds to ensure they have the necessary skills for employment and adult life. We want both girls and boys to make informed choices about their vocational routes and our Modern Apprenticeships will help support young people in their career choices and to improve their workplace skills, particularly at craft, supervisory and technician level.

The Government have led by example in committing all Civil Service departments and agencies to review their pay systems and produce action plans to close any equal pay gaps. The Government have provided funding for the EOC to develop equal pay tool kits so all organisations can carry out equal pay reviews. Measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives will contribute to a reduction of the pay gap. The Government also welcomes the EOC's investigation into modern apprenticeships and the concentration of men and women in different professions.

 During the recent review of the Employment Relations Act 1999, the Government looked closely at the operation of protections from dismissal for employees taking lawfully organised official industrial action. The conclusion of that review, as set out in the response to consultation published last month, is that the 8-week rule should be retained and that the Employment Relations Bill will introduce improvements to the existing protections. These changes are designed to ensure, firstly, that days where employees are 'locked-out' during official industrial action are disregarded in calculating the 8-week period; and secondly that the procedural steps employers and employees must take under the statute to attempt to resolve a dispute are clear.

<a name="40108w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have long known that users' trust and confidence in the internet would impact on its uptake. This was recognised in the September 1999 report from the Performance and Innovation Unit, "e-commerce@its.best.uk" which identified trust as one of the three pillars which would support the adoption of the internet in the UK. Studies into consumer behaviour in 2001 and 2002 ("Informing Consumers About e-commerce" and "Internet and Cross Border Shopping") showed that the perception of credit card

fraud was a significant concern to on-line consumers. That said, on-line shopping represented 6 per cent. of all UK retail in 2002, and was set to grow to &#163;14 billion in 2003 as part of a continuing growth in use of the internet throughout the economy. Our latest study&#151;the "International Benchmarking Study" published by DTI in November 2003&#151;showed that the impact of a lack of confidence on internet usage appears to be receding. It was also noted that security and trust were seen as less of a barrier to internet usage by UK business than was the case in previous benchmarking studies.

<a name="40108w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 In recent months, I and members of my Department, have had several meetings with representatives of the RCVS, the BVA and other professional bodies. We have listened carefully to the views of the profession particularly in relation to animal health and welfare. These discussions have been helpful and productive and identified opportunities to reduce the potential need for legislation by addressing many of Competition Commission recommendations within the industry's own professional code of practice.
<P>

<a name="40108w07.html_para1">A consultation document together with a draft impact assessment and the draft legislation we consider is necessary to implement these recommendations is currently being finalised in discussion with DEFRA. This will be issued shortly and will provide all interested parties with a further opportunity to comment on how best to carry forward the Commission's recommendations. Reflecting the Government's better regulation agenda, the DTI would look closely at proposals from the profession to take forward some or all of them within the industry's own professional rules.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The most recent information available on violent crime victimisation of people over the age of 60 is from the 2000 British Crime Survey, which measures crime in 1999 (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 08/02, Chivite-Matthews and Maggs, 2002). This showed that 0.9 per cent. of women aged 60 and over and 1.1 per cent. of men in this age group were victims of at least one incident of violence in England and Wales that year. There were approximately 132,000 incidents of violence against older people in 1999, however some people may have experienced more than one incident in the year. People aged 60 and over had a lower risk of experiencing violent crime than other age groups, and were also less likely to be repeatedly victimised.

In 2001&#150;02, 0.7 per cent of men aged 65 to 74 and 0.7 per cent. of women in this age group experienced one or more violent incidents, while 0.6 per cent. of men aged 75 and over and 0.5 per cent. of women aged 75 and over did so. In 2002&#150;03, 1.3 per cent of men and 0.7 per cent. of women aged 65 to 74 and 0.4 per cent of men and 0.6 per cent. of women aged 75 and over were victims of a violent crime (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/03, Simmons and Dodd, 2003).

 The Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published an interim analytical report on the harms associated with alcohol misuse on 19 September 2003. This report identifies the following broad areas of policy intervention: education, information and communication; supply and pricing; health and treatment services; and community safety and criminal justice.

 An extensive consultation exercise was undertaken on the key findings contained in the project on "Getting the Best Leaders to Take on the Most Demanding Challenges". A number of regional seminars were held to discuss the key findings with those who would be most affected by any new policies arising from the project report. Approximately 320 people, representing the broad spectrum of .the police service attended the seminars and over 100 written responses were also received. The results of the consultation exercise were considered by the Police Leadership Development Board (PLDB) on which all the major stakeholders, including all the police associations and the Association of Police Authorities are represented.

 The Medical Supplies Agency (MSA) is subject to several formal mechanisms of ministerial and other evaluation. The Agency Annual Report and Financial Accounts is presented to the House of Commons pursuant to Section 7 of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. The latest Report was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed on 16 July 2003 and a copy was placed in the Library of the House on 17 November 2003. In addition to the financial statements, with a certificate by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Report covers a review of activity, an assessment of performance against agreed key targets and a statement on future strategy. The financial statement is also subject to interim audit by the National Audit Office.

 There is no requirement for reservists to provide the information requested to the Ministry of Defence. There is, therefore, no comprehensive record of the numbers of reservists who may have lost their civilian jobs as a result of service in the armed forces. However, protection is provided by reinstatement under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985. Over 8,600 reservists were called-out to support Operation TELIC and we are aware of only 11 individuals who needed to bring a case under the 1985 Act. This continues to show the high level of support from both reservists and employers which the Government is pleased to acknowledge.

<a name="40108w10.html_para1">Statistical modelling has been used to estimate the future peak number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britain. Predictions of future deaths are not available for the London region. The annual total number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britain is expected to peak at around 1,950 to 2,450 deaths some time between 2011 and 2015. (The total number of mesothelioma deaths in Great Britian in 2001 was 1,848; the 175 mesothelioma deaths in London in 2001 represent 9.5 per cent. of this total). It is estimated that the ratio of one to two of the number of asbestos-related lung cancers to the number of mesotheliomas will decrease slightly over time.

 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2003]:</i> Data on waiting times for diagnostic tests are not collected centrally, however data may be collected locally. The central returns capture consultant speciality level data on waits for a first outpatient appointment and for inpatient admissions.
<P>

<a name="40108w12.html_para0">However, it is the Governments' priority to ensure that all patients are seen quickly in the first instance so that if diagnostic tests are required they are requested sooner. Where this is not the case we are determined to speed up the process. The National Health Service is committed to reducing the length of time that people wait before their treatment starts and the NHS Plan set targets for staged reductions in waiting times.

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]</i>: Health visitors, school nurses, communicable disease control nurses and occupational health nurses are employed as public health nurses within the National Health Service.

<a name="40108w12.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Government are funding a national social work recruitment campaign aimed at raising awareness about what social workers do and increasing the number of applications to social work training. The campaign has been successful so far in reversing the trend of falling numbers of applications to social work courses: in 2002 the applications rose by 6.5 per cent. A post-qualifying child care award was developed in 1999 to ensure that social workers are equipped to undertake complex child care work and provide high quality services to children and families. Child protection is one of the areas covered by the award.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The sale and use of fair trade products by Departments of the Northern Ireland Administration and the Northern Ireland Office is limited to food products used in catering. Almost all staff catering services have been contracted out since the early nineties and the sale of food products on departmental premises, and their use in receptions and meetings involving staff and visitors, has therefore become the responsibility of the private sector suppliers.
<P>

<a name="40108w12.html_para2">There is no requirement to provide fair trade products. Government Departments in Northern Ireland are free to make their own decisions on such products against a background of obtaining best value for money, the European Community Procurement Directives and individual departmental objectives.

<P>
<a name="40108w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 On 14 April 2003 I, along with my ministerial colleague Angela Smith MP, announced proposals to deliver new facilities at the Giant's Causeway which would be capable of offering a world class experience to visitors.
<P>

<a name="40108w12.html_para3">Our proposals centred on the commissioning of an international competition to design new visitor facilities which would complement the Giant's Causeway as a World Heritage Site. This international competition, which will be initiated in early spring, will seek designs from around the world and I am confident that by proceeding along this path we can deliver a world class solution that will continue to capture the imagination of visitors in 20 years time.
<P>

<a name="40108w12.html_para4">The Government are committed to seeing visitor facilities at the Giant's Causeway that are genuinely world class, conform to the highest standards in terms of economic and environmental sustainability and which will greatly enhance Northern Ireland's place on the International map as a tourist destination.
<P>

<a name="40108w12.html_para5">Over the past number of months my officials, in conjunction with colleagues in the Environment and Heritage Service, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Department of Finance and Personnel, have been exploring a number of options with regard to the most appropriate method of delivering the solution. These discussions are ongoing. The National Trust and Moyle District Council, the owners of the site, have also been kept informed of developments.

 The behaviour and attendance strand of our Key Stage 3 Strategy provides audit and training materials and expert advice. These are freely available to all secondary schools. In addition, our Behaviour Improvement Programme (BIP) funds a range of measures to support schools in disadvantaged areas facing the greatest challenges. 60 BIP local education authorities (LEAs) are each receiving about 1.4 million in the current financial year to fund these measures. Individual LEAs and Excellence in Cities partnerships 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2004 : Column 471W</I><P>
decide which measures to adopt and which schools to involve in the light of local needs. They give priority to a core group of schools, typically four secondary schools and about 20 linked primary schools in an LEA. But in many LEAs other schools also benefit from BIP measures, which include multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams and extra Learning Support Units, Learning Mentors and Education Welfare Officers as well as locally-devised initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list for each programme funded by the Department for <i>(a)</i> primary schools and 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2004 : Column 473W</I><P>
<i>(b)</i> secondary schools introduced in each year since 1997 the funding available in the year the programme started and in each subsequent year; and whether at the end of the life of each programme it was expected that the school would continue to fund that programme.  [145613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]</i>: It is not possible to answer the Question in precisely the way it has been asked. Table 3.2 of the Department's Annual Report sets out the Departmental funding for schools since 1997 and that shows an increase from less than &#163;2 billion in 1998 to almost &#163;9 billion this year. A copy of the Report has been placed in the Library. However, most programmes were not specifically for particular types of schools and local education authorities were free to distribute the grants between schools in their areas.
<P>

<a name="40108w13.html_para7">In 2003&#150;04, the Department stopped paying grant for programmes which were worth &#163;800 million in 2002&#150;03 as part of our commitment to reduce ringfenced funding for schools. However much of this funding relates to time-limited courses that had run their course. Having regard to the &#163;250 million headroom between the &#163;2.7 billion increase in general funding for schools which took account of the overall pressures on schools, including the &#163;800 million grant reduction, we intended that each school should choose for itself whether to continue the programmes previously supported through specific grant.
<P>

<a name="40108w13.html_para8">Over the next two years, we have announced that we will be making available additional non-ringfenced resources to reverse the reductions in the Standards Fund which were previously planned. For 2004&#150;05, schools will generally receive a 4 per cent. cash increase on this year's Standards Fund allocation so there should be no reason for any school to decide on financial rather than educational grounds not to continue a particular programme. In total I am making an additional &#163;820 million extra available over the years 2004/05 and 2005/06.

<sup>(9)</sup> New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998/99. New students in 1998/99 (apart from certain specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). From 1999/2000 students who entered higher education after 1998/99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans, of which approximately three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis.<P>

<sup>(13)</sup> Regional level data have been taken from available information and may include a small number of loans which have been authorised for payment but not paid.<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> The apparent fall in the average value of income-contingent loan taken out in 2000/01 can be explained mainly by the fact that this was the third year of this loan scheme; students on the third year of a three year course will receive the final year rate of loan which is at a lower rate as it does not cover the summer vacation. This effect is not present in 1999/2000 and has been levelled out in the years subsequent to 2000/01. Additionally, this is likely to be the first year in which those students on sandwich courses have their placement year and are therefore in receipt of the reduced rate of loan.<P>

<P>

 The design of effective lessons is fundamental to the pursuit of high quality teaching and learning whatever the age of the pupil, their level of ability, or the subject or skill being learned.
<P>

<a name="40108w14.html_para2">The Primary Strategy recommends that literacy and mathematics lessons begin with whole class teaching sessions followed by guided reading and writing activities, during which pupils are grouped according to their individual learning needs.
<P>

<a name="40108w14.html_para3">The Key Stage 3 National Strategy recommends a consideration of pupil grouping as part of classroom organisation which is one contributory factor towards effective lesson design. Furthermore, the Strategy has produced a range of materials for schools (such as critical teaching units, literacy progress units, Springboard 7, learning challenge and booster materials) to use in meeting the needs of pupils below expected levels. These allow schools, depending on their particular local circumstances, the flexibility of being able to provide whole class teaching; to re-group pupils according to their needs and abilities; provide within-class pupil grouping and one-to-one coaching or mentoring.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w15.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The possibility of making an adjustment for the 'cost of living' including housing costs was considered as part of the project to update the Indices of Deprivation 2000. The main source of comprehensive data on this subject is the Retail Price Index compiled by the Office for National Statistics. This Index, however, is only available at national level and would not allow adjustments to the Income domain at sub-district level. It is therefore not possible to make any adjustment for housing costs in this update.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w15.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The proposal to publish the Index at Super Output Area level (SOA) was overwhelmingly supported in the recently concluded consultation on updating the Indices of Deprivation. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's ability to publish the Index at SOA Level 1 (between 1,000&#150;3,000 population) is dependent on the provision of the SOA boundaries and testing of the data to ensure that there are no concerns over disclosure or data reliability at this level. The relevant boundaries have now been received from the Office for National Statistics and testing of the data has begun.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has to extend the Starter Home Initiative for key health workers; and if he will take steps to ensure that a wider range of health care professionals working in the NHS, including radiographers, are eligible.  [146495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w16.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Under the Starter Home Initiative, assistance is available to a wide range of health staff including radiographers. Priorities for assistance depend upon the recruitment and retention difficulties being experienced. From 1 April 2004, a new key worker programme will succeed the Starter Home Initiative. This will provide assistance to first time buyers and existing homeowners who need to move to a larger home. It will also provide homes for key workers at below market rents. Funding will be targeted in areas where the high cost of housing is undermining recruitment and retention. Full details of the new programme, including the eligible key worker groups, will be announced by the beginning of March. Employer contributions will supplement assistance under the new programme.

[146465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w16.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Improving the skills of planning, design and regeneration professionals will take time and will require the long-term commitment of a wide range of public, private and voluntary organisations.
<P>

<a name="40108w16.html_para1">As part of this process Sir John Egan is currently undertaking a review of the professional skills required, to deliver the strategic objectives of our Sustainable Communities Plan. We are currently awaiting the outcome of this review. The conclusions of Sir John's report will be used to inform our longer-term strategic approach vis-a-vis the development of professional planning, design and regeneration skills as these relate to the built environment in the Thames Gateway and elsewhere.

<a name="40108w16.html_para2">Through our Sustainable Communities Plan, we have earmarked &#163;17.0 million over the next three years, in order to improve the quality of skills associated with the Built environment. Of this the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) have received an initial allocation of &#163;1.6 million to carry out a specific programme of skills related work. The experience and best practice developed as part of this work will be used to inform our longer-term strategic approach.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how the Government will ensure that new housing developments in the Thames Gateway meet high standards of design.  [146466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w16.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to improving the quality of the built environment in the Thames Gateway and elsewhere. To ensure that this happens, Planning Policy Guidance 1 (PPG1) "General Policy and Principles" requires that "good design should be the aim of all those involved in the development process and should be encouraged everywhere". This policy is supported by our good practice guidance, "By Design". We are currently in the process of updating PPG1 and will take this opportunity to restate our commitment to good quality and sustainable design.
<P>

<a name="40108w16.html_para3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with a wide range of partners to deliver this through a number of policy initiatives. Our Sustainable Communities Plan is central to achieving this and the comprehensive agenda this sets out includes significant extra funding for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE). This will be used to drive up design standards and to improve associated skills.
<P>

<a name="40108w16.html_para4">We have increased funding for CABE from &#163;0.5 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;17.75 million over the next three years. CABE are currently working with a range of key partners to ensure that strategies comprehensively incorporate robust requirements for good design. For example, CABE, in partnership with English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation, are scheduled to launch the Growth Areas Housing Quality Forum in March 2004. The Forum will bring together representatives from all key agencies involved in commissioning and procuring new housing, including local authorities, development agencies, mortgage lenders and landowners and will encourage the active participation of private sector house builders and Registered Social Landlords.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w16.html_wqn7"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans the Government has for local planning authorities in the Thames Gateway to adopt specific quality criteria for housing and other developments; and what role the Government has in encouraging planning authorities to adopt such criteria.  [146468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40108w16.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance 1 (PPG1) "Planning Policy and Principles" requires that "good design should be the aim of all those involved in the development process and should be encouraged everywhere". This policy is supported by our good practice guidance "By Design". PPG1 also encourages Local Planning Authorities to draw up their own clear policies vis-a-vis the built environment and to prepare supplementary design guidance where appropriate. In preparing local policy and/or guidance, Local Planning Authorities are expected to take full account of any regional guidance that may impact upon their area of operation. For example, London Authorities would need to take account of guidance/criteria contained within the London Spatial Strategy.
<P>

<a name="40108w16.html_para5">To this end, we have no plans at this stage to issue any specific quality criteria for housing and other developments in the Thames Gateway.
