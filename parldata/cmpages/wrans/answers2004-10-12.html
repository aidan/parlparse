 We took the decision to phase in EMA from September 2004 to successive 16-year-old age groups rather than immediately offer the award to all young people in Further Education. There were good reasons for doing so. The main purpose of EMA is to encourage students to stay on in learning when otherwise they would have dropped out, and the older students already in education have already made that choice. The main exception is that young people who received EMA under the pilot arrangements are eligible to apply for EMA under the national scheme. We are keeping the EMA scheme arrangements under review but do not envisage any significant changes to the eligibility criteria for 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what rationale underlay the decision to permit prisoners serving life sentences to buy national lottery tickets; and if he will make a statement.  [188575]</p>




<p><a name="41012w04.html_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 No one, including those serving a life sentence is permitted to buy national lottery tickets while they are in prison. The ticket purchased recently by a life sentence prisoner who won the Lotto (the National Lottery) was purchased while that individual was released from prison on temporary licence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41012w04.html_para9">
Temporary licences are granted as part of the resettlement process for those prisoners who are reaching the end of their sentence and are preparing for release. Under the terms of a temporary licence, a prisoner is bound by certain conditions aimed at preventing further offending and any antisocial behaviour. If these conditions are broken, they are recalled to prison immediately. The purchase of lottery tickets is not prohibited by the licence conditions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41012w04.html_para10">
The Prison Service introduced Phase 1 of its review of pay and grading in July 2000. This affected 2,500 middle and senior managers, including those in administrative and operational disciplines, and replaced more than 150 existing grades with a seven-payband common.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41012w04.html_para11">
Development of Phase 2 of the review, which would have included administrative posts, was halted in April 2002, with the project work subsumed within pay modernisation.

To date, the Prison Service has carried out 507 individual job evaluations. The system evaluates the job and not the individual job-holder, so it is not possible to identify how many of these jobs were held by administrative grades without incurring disproportionate cost.

Discussions are continuing, including consideration of a possible second border crossing point. Tailbacks on the Turkish side of the Habur crossing are 40&#150;50km long. It can take two weeks for a truck to get through.

 Intensive negotiations took place in July between officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel and trade union representatives.

The trade union also met with the Secretary of State and myself on 23 July to discuss the situation. On 3 August management tabled two offers for 2004 to the trade union a 12-month offer worth 3.49 per cent. and a 16-month offer worth 4.65 per cent. Both offers were quickly rejected and further negotiations took place on 4, 11 and 13 August. As a result of these further negotiations, management restructured the 4.65 per cent. 16-month offer and this was formally put to trade union side on 16 August. The revised offer included an increase in rates of pay of 2 per cent. plus a non-consolidated payment of &#163;150 for all staff.

 It is not the Government&#039;s policy to prevent the growing of GM crops in Northern Ireland.

Similar statements were made on the same day in the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. In addition, I issued a press release on 12 March 2004 setting out the position in respect of Northern Ireland. A copy has been placed in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41012w11.html_para0">
The essence of our policy is that GM crops will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and consumers will have choice through mandatory labelling of GM products. The primary concern will continue to be to safeguard human health and the environment. The Government will ensure that GM products are safe and provide consumer choice through labelling, but ultimately it will be for farmers and consumers to decide whether they want GM crops and food.

 Health and Social Services Trusts already have measures in place to monitor the outcomes of cardiology and cardiac surgery treatments on an ongoing basis.

The vast majority of these would have been referred to the Benefit Investigation Unit of the Social Security Agency in the 2003&#150;04 financial year for investigation.

 On 23 August 2004 there were 12,967 cases awaiting determination by the Industrial Tribunals. Almost 2,000 of these were discrimination cases and the remainder were non-discrimination cases.

The consultants advised that, in order to complete a robust RIA, more data on travel demand, bus operations and school pupil casualty rates were needed.

 The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41012w15.html_para2">
<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Roy Beggs, dated 27 September 2004:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what assessment the Government has made of the operation of the School Travel Plan Pilot; and what plans there are to extend its scope. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You will be aware that, as proposed by the Regional Transportation Strategy 2002&#150;12, Roads Service has been working to address the issue of the &#039;school run&#039;, given its impact on morning traffic congestion, through the Travelwise &quot;Safer Routes to Schools&quot; initiative. The overall aim of this initiative is to encourage more children to walk, cycle and use public transport for their journey to school.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Department of Education, the Department of the Environment Road Safety Team and other agencies are working alongside Roads Service in this project.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The following six schools are currently participating in the initiative:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">St. Joseph&#039;s College, Belfast;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Oakwood Integrated Primary School, Dunmurry;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Wallace High School, Lisburn;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">St. Anthony&#039;s Primary School, Craigavon;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Parkhall College, Antrim; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">St. Brigid&#039;s College, Londonderry</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">This is the first time a schools initiative to promote sustainable modes of transport has been undertaken in Northern Ireland. Measures at the six schools are mainly exploratory and at different stages of development. The overall aim is to assist each school in developing a travel plan, which sets out a package of measures for reducing the number of car trips made to school. Where appropriate, Roads Service will subsequently introduce improvements to the roadway, such as installing pedestrian facilities and traffic calming measures, to facilitate children who may want to walk, cycle or use public transport. Additionally, other measures such as cycle shelters and lockers are provided by the Department of Education inside the schools premises.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To get the school travel initiative started, Roads Service and its partners have spent nearly &#163;85,000 over the last three years to investigate existing infrastructure and facilities at the schools, examine accident data, undertake surveys to establish baseline school travel information, and pay for the training of a Travel Plan Co-ordinator who was appointed to champion the initiative in the schools. No specific funding has been allocated as yet for the further development of travel plans, as resources are being concentrated for the time being on the pilot group of six schools. However, it is intended, as part of the next stage of the initiative, to develop a practical support package that encourages other schools to engage in the travel plan process.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The improvements to the infrastructure and facilities at each of the pilot schools will be completed early in 2005. While we will undertake a preliminary assessment of how successful these measures have been during the latter part of 2005, initial work including installation of cycle shelters at the schools has had very positive results and generated an increase in cycling among pupils. 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>12 Oct 2004 : Column 240W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>It is anticipated that the planned infrastructure work to the road network adjacent to the schools should have equal effect in facilitating and encouraging more children to use sustainable modes of transport.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within a year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Changes in the registration periods for registrations starting after 31 August 1996 means that registration numbers for June 1997 and June 1998 are not on the same basis as later figures. Before that date, the registration period for adults was 24 months whilst children&#039;s registrations lasted until the end of the following calendar year. From 1 September 1996, registrations have lasted for 15 months from the end of the month of registration. The figures for some PCT areas will also be affected by the introduction in October 1998 and subsequent growth of the personal dental service.<br>

2. Patients may access national health service dental treatment without being registered with a general dental service dentist, for example as a patient of a dental access centre.<br>

<p><a name="41012w20.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Teriparatide is being considered as part of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence&#039;s (NICE&#039;s) appraisal of the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of technologies for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. NICE has developed guidance in consultation with a number of stakeholders. Final guidance was due to be published in October 2004, covering both England and Wales, but an appeal has been received against the final appraisal determination and guidance on this technology. NICE has arranged for the appeal panel to convene on 22 October 2004 to hear oral representations from the appellant. Full details are available on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk.

<a name="41012w20.html_para0">
In August 1999, the Department issued Health Service Circular 1999/176, which asks national health service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence. The circular applies to England only.
