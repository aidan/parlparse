<p><a name="40617w01.html_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The bulk of Government support is paid as block grant, so local authorities have considerable freedom to determine their spending priorities and decide how to apportion their revenue budget between services. The provision of local authority services is for individual authorities, bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities. The Government does not have a power to intervene in local authorities&#039; day to day decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w01.html_para1">
It is for local authorities to determine the level of council tax. Local authorities should be consulting their local tax payers on issues about levels of council tax and what the money is spent on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w01.html_para2">
Part 1 of Schedule 12A to the Local Government Act 1972 describes the types of &quot;exempt information&quot; which a local authority can decide to keep confidential. Gloucestershire county council has resolved to keep confidential the types of information specified in paragraphs 5, 7 and 9. These paragraphs cover information relating to financial assistance provided by the authority, the financial or business affairs of other parties and terms proposed in the course of commercial contract negotiations. No discussions have been held between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the county council about the council&#039;s use of confidentiality provisions in local government legislation. The circumstances under which a specific consent would need to be sought by the county council are set out in sections 24 and 25 of the Local Government Act 1988.

 To reflect the intended continued use of the properties for social housing and the need for capital investment, the price paid to each local authority per council dwelling and reflected in the following table, accords with a Tenanted Market Value (TMV) rather than an open market value. Where there is a negative value a grant equal to this amount was paid by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as part of the Estates Renewal Challenge Fund (ERCF) programme. The table shows the receipts from stock transfer, broken down by local authority, showing the number of dwellings, price per dwelling and the gross transfer price in each year since 1997.

<p><a name="40617w02.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Government gave careful consideration to recommendation 1.42 on the beam of greatest intensity. We have sought to address the concerns that the Stewart Group identified in the following ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w02.html_para3">
Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 on Telecommunications recognises that when operators are siting mobile phone base stations schools must be given special consideration. It makes clear that, where it is proposed to install, alter or replace a mobile base station near a school or college, operators should discuss the proposed development with the relevant body of the school or college concerned before submitting an application for planning permission or prior approval to the local authority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w02.html_para4">
Department for Education and Skills has issued advice to local education authorities and schools about base stations in and around school premises and the use of mobile phones by children. Where parents and/or schools wish to know whether the beam of intensity falls on school grounds or buildings, the school should contact the base station&#039;s operator. The operators have agreed to provide schools with information on the level of intensity of radio frequency radiation. If there is major concern from the school or parents, they could ask the network operator to adjust the antenna.

<p>
<a name="40617w02.html_para5">
Another recommendation (1.41) of the Stewart Report was the auditing of emissions from base stations particularly near schools and other sensitive sites. In an ongoing audit, OFCOM (formerly the Radiocommunications Agency) has measured exposures around nearly 300 base stations to date (www.ofcom.org.uk). In all cases exposures have been below, and mostly thousands of times below, the guidelines.

The table overleaf gives the latest Eurostat figures for seasonally adjusted unemployment rates amongst young people, defined as 16&#150;24 year olds for the UK and 15&#150;24 year olds for other countries. UK data are taken from the latest UK Labour Force Survey results published in May 2004. Data for other countries are taken from Eurostat&#039;s Unemployment Press Release published on 2 June 2004. In some cases, these figures may appear more up-to-date than the UK figure; however, as the table illustrates, these more recent figures are often based on modelled extrapolation of the data from the most recent Labour Force Surveys in each country, rather than on direst survey measurement.

<p><a name="40617w05.html_spnew5"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 None of the 147 deregulatory measures announced in the Pre-Budget Report were the responsibility of HM Treasury. The Department did not, therefore, produce any of the Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) linked to the 147 regulations for reform or removal which were announced with the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003. Among the regulations to reform there were several measures with direct benefits for business, including the increase to the statutory audit threshold, which freed 69,000 businesses from the obligation to undergo an independent audit. Final RIAs are laid in the House Library, and all published RIAs are also available from departmental websites.

CWT will offer a wide range of services, including a continuing implant in the Palace of Westminster, access to preferential prices for both air and rail travel, foreign exchange, and an internet self-booking facility for those who wish to book online. It is expected that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply, and the jobs of existing staff in the Travel Office will thus be protected.

ONS has publicly made clear that: &quot;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) alone took the decision on the final wording of the news release on the environmental accounts (report, 27 May 2004). There was no improper pressure from the Department for Transport or anywhere else. ONS could not satisfy itself fully on technical concerns over the reconciliation of figures on road freight emissions based on alternative definitions and hence decided that it would not be appropriate to focus upon transport emissions. There was nothing unusual about the process adopted on this occasion and it is completely wrong to suggest that the figures were &quot;withdrawn&quot; or &quot;removed from the . . . report&quot;.

Notes:<br>

1. Funding includes education formula spending plus all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;15. EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level are excluded.<br>

2. The pupil numbers used are those underlying the EFS settlement calculations.<br>

3. Figures are provisional as some grants in 2003&#150;04 have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

4. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;100.<br>

5. Figures are based on eight years of funding for pupils ages three to 10 and five years of funding for pupils ages 11&#150;15.<br>

6. Calculations are based on an LEA&#039;s total funding per pupil in 2003&#150;04 multiplied by the average number of years in school.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from Sefton LEAs&#039; Section 52 outturn statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. Hence, for consistency, the combined unit cost is provided since 1996&#150;97 but due to LEA expenditure on pupils in independent nurseries the unit cost for primary education is a more robust measure.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3. Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

4. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>





5. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

7. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

8. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 Most of this funding is directed through local accountable bodies that cover a wider geographical area than Crosby. In each case, that body has the freedom to use its funding flexibly, within a broad overall framework, to meet local priorities. Each of the respective local bodies may have used some of its funding in the Crosby area but, in most cases, it is not possible to identify expenditure at that level of detail.

 Decisions on the recruitment, retention and deployment of educational psychologists (EPs) are matters for local authorities as employers to determine in light of local circumstances and available resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w09.html_para0">
We are aware that there are shortages of EPs in some areas and that, as with other professions, there is a likelihood of a good many experienced staff retiring in the near future. In view of this, the Department has facilitated discussions involving a range of partners, including representatives of the Local Government Association, on developing a new shorter entry training route for EPs. The scheme under discussion would ensure EPs qualifying in six rather than eight years. Years 1&#150;3 would be the Psychology degree course followed by a further three years of postgraduate training built around work placements. Years 4&#150;6 would be managed by higher education institutions in partnership with local authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w09.html_para1">
The new route would require significant additional funding, the case for which will need to be considered within the wider context of the 2004 Spending Review. Ministers are currently considering the final allocation of the SR settlement in the light of our overall priorities.

Reducing the number of people with no qualifications is a major priority for the Government. The Skills Strategy announced a number of measures to address this issue. In particular, we are introducing a new entitlement to free learning for all those studying for those first Level 2 qualifications as a foundation for employability. We have also said that we will introduce a new adult learning grant of up to &#163;30 a week for full-time learners studying for their first Level 2 qualification. We want to improve the quality of information, advice and guidance to help people choose the right course for them. Basic skills needs for those without qualifications are being addressed through the Government&#039;s Skills for Life strategy. We have also asked regional development agencies to work with the Learning and Skills Council, the Small Business Service, Jobcentre Plus, Skills for Business and others to ensure that the aims of Skills Strategy are delivered in a more co-ordinated way that connects with the needs of employers and individuals at the regional, local and sectoral level through the creation of strong and effective Regional Skills Partnerships.

To help achieve the current PSA target, the Department set the 56 LEAs facing some of the greatest challenges individual stretching targets to reduce unauthorised absence in 2003/04.

As many of the measures schools and LEAs implement will improve both pupils&#039; behaviour and their attendance&#151;and action in respect of one will often have an impact on the other&#151;it is not possible to identify separately the level of expenditure allocated to tackling truancy alone.

However Objective 1 public funding is available in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, which includes Crosby, and the following table shows how much has been spent from the start of the current programme in 2000 to 14 June 2004. Final figures for domestic match funding only become available as projects complete. As the majority of projects are still under way the figures given for domestic public match funding are estimated using data from the Merseyside Objective 1 programme plan. In addition to the funding shown here it should be noted that almost 50 per cent. of the Objective 1 programme delivers pan-Merseyside projects, to which residents and businesses in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton also have access.

<p><a name="40617w13.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The UK has set out to implement the EU ETS in a way that meets the twin goals of maintaining UK industry&#039;s competitiveness, while maintaining commitment to our environmental goals. As the EU ETS is a new instrument, and, before the start of the first Phase, there remain great uncertainties as to what the EU allowance price may be, detailed analysis of the potential impact on the UK of the scheme was necessary to inform our decisions on implementation. An additional and crucial uncertainty has been how other member states will implement the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w13.html_para4">
The DTI published an analytical paper on the impact of the EU ETS on UK industry, examining in particular the trading patterns of EU ETS sectors and possible regional dimensions to the impacts. This is available on the DTI website at www.dti.gsi.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml. in addition, we commissioned ILEX Energy consultants to examine the possible impact on electricity prices of differing EU allowance prices and the impact on power sector investment. This paper is available on the DTI website, as above. Further work has been commissioned to examine the cross EU impacts on power prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w13.html_para5">
This analysis informed the decision for the UK to allocate allowances equal to estimates of what sectors will require in the 2005&#150;07 period under &#039;with measures&#039; projections. This is to ensure that EU ETS will not impose a reduction in emissions beyond what is expected given current measures. The exception to this is electricity generation, which due to the very limited international competition that the industry faces, has been allocated a reduction below &#039;with measures&#039; projections in the 2005&#150;07 period.

 The UK has closely followed the publication of other member states National Allocation Plans (NAPs), and, has actively called for robust and consistent review by the Commission. The need for the Commission to ensure there is consistent adherence to the principles of the Directive&#039;s rules for allocation in each NAP, as well as an assessment of possible State Aid implications from allocation, is crucial to ensure that there is minimal distortion of competition between the EU member states.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w13.html_para7">
The Commission has yet to make final decisions on the 14 NAPs submitted to date, so no detailed assessment of the competition implications for the UK

<p><a name="40617w13.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The EU Emissions Trading Directive and related regulations on the monitoring and reporting of emissions from installations covered by the scheme comes into force in every member state from 1 January 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w13.html_para8">
It is crucial that NAPs from member states that have not been submitted to the Commission in sufficient time ahead of January 2005 are not subject to less thorough or differing assessment or approval mechanisms by the Commission. The UK has asked for clarification on this, and the Commission has stated that the three month period for assessment of the plan by the Commission will be retained, regardless of when the date of notification of the NAP is. Late submissions of National Allocation Plans will not lift the requirements to comply with the directive in any member state, rather it will deny industry the certainty and access to use of the market from the outset to help in compliance. There are no plans to call for a delay in the start of the scheme.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what level of reliance other EU member states are placing on project credits available from the Kyoto project mechanism to meet their national targets for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. [178486]</p>









<p><a name="40617w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 To date, 14 National Allocation Plans for the EU ETS, including the UK&#039;s, have been submitted to the European Commission. Of these, seven have indicated an intention to use purchase of JI and CDM to meet Kyoto targets in 2012. The level of these planned purchases as well as the state of advancement of these policies differs in each plan. In some cases, there are clear plans and substantiated programmes and funding for this, in others there is less clarity as to how firm the policy is, whether it has been budgeted for and from what sources.

<p><a name="40617w13.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that UK industry has access to the cost effective reduction potential that the JI and CDM mechanisms offer. The UK Climate Change Programme assumes some of the reductions envisaged to meet the 2010 goals and beyond may be made via use of these mechanisms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w13.html_para10">
In the context of the EU ETS, the linking amendment on the use of project credits from JI and CDM allows member states the discretion to consider whether or not such credits can be used for compliance against emissions covered by the EU ETS. The decision must be notified to the European Commission by June 2006. The Government are keen to allow the use of project credits from Phase One of the EU ETS and negotiated in favour of allowing early linking of the CDM from 2005. A final decision on how UK companies will be able to use such credits in the 2005&#150;07 period of the EU ETS has not been made.

The increase in expenditure on external consultancy in 2000&#150;01 was primarily, due to costs incurred on the Home Office modernisation programme, in particular Information Technology (IT) related consultancy.

The high spend figures for 2001&#150;02 includes the cost ofsetting up the National Probation Directorate and various consultancies on IT Business Change.

<a name="40617w14.html_para6">
However, a cohort analysis up to and including appeals at the IAA was carried out for asylum applications made in 2002. It is estimated that around four in ten (42 per cent.) of applications in 2002 resulted in the granting of asylum (10 <sup>1</sup>  per cent.) or of exceptional leave to remain (23 <sup>1</sup>  per cent.) or in appeals which were allowed by the IAA adjudicators (a further 10 per cent).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w14.html_para7">
Based on cases where data are available, it is estimated that 77 per cent. of initial refusals of applications made in 2002 resulted in an appeal (i.e. 54 per cent. of applications in 2002 resulted in appeals), and that 10 per cent. of applications made in 2002 resulted in appeals allowed at the IAA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w14.html_para8">
Asylum cases are determined according to their individual merits. The rates of refusal at initial decision and at appeal change over time reflecting a variety of factors including the changing mix of applicant nationalities, and changing situations in source countries. Over the last five years the vast majority of appeals have been dismissed, at the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) and at the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT).

The component for additional security pressures has been included as part of the police funding formula since its inception in 1995&#150;96.

<p><a name="40617w17.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Blears  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 9 June 2004]:</i> On 4 June it became a requirement for any door supervisor working in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, including any employed by a company outside those areas, to possess a licence issued by the Security Industry Authority (SIA).

<p>
<a name="40617w17.html_para1">
It was announced on 11 November 2003 that Hampshire and the Isle of Wight would be the initial pilot area for the SIA&#039;s licensing arrangements, which are to be rolled out across the whole of England and Wales by April 2005. At the same time, it was made clear that applications in the pilot area could be made from 1 March 2004 and that the legal requirement to hold a licence would come into force from 4 June. The SIA has since undertaken considerable consultation with stakeholders, local authorities and the police, and has carried out a wide-ranging publicity campaign. A small number of representations were received from pub and club owners requesting an extension of the 4 June deadline. We have kept in close touch with the SIA throughout the pilot scheme and have received regular updates on progress, and we concluded that the 4 June deadline should stand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w17.html_para2">
The responsibility to apply for an SIA licence rests with the individual. As at 4 June, 722 applications had been received from within the pilot area and 193 licences had been granted. The great majority of applications are being processed within the SIA&#039;s published target time of four to six weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w17.html_para3">
Some representations have been received about the SIA&#039;s state of preparedness, including from a small number of right hon. and hon. Members. The main concerns have related to training requirements and the availability of training providers, the cost and affordability of the SIA licence, and the possibility that inability to meet the 4 June deadline might lead to the closure of businesses and loss of jobs. We have made it clear that all of the necessary procedures and arrangements are in place and that sufficient training capacity has been available for some time.

Schedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 details a list of species, including badgers, which are protected from further methods of killing or taking. Prohibited methods are detailed in Section 11(2) of the 1981 Act, and are any trap, net or snare, electrical devices, poisons, stupefying bait, automatic or semi-automatic weapon, any illuminating or sighting device for night shooting, any dazzling device, any gas or smoke, decoys, sound recording or, in immediate pursuit, mechanically propelled vehicles.

<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn0"><b> Richard Ottaway: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the British Waterways Board acquired a shareholding in Easynet plc; for what reasons; and what the size of the shareholding is.  [178870]</p>








<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Prior to 2000, British Waterways and GEC, each invested &#163;147,000 into a joint venture (Fibreway), which laid fibre optic cables under many of British Waterways&#039; towpaths and sold capacity to telecoms operators. In May 2000, GEC decided to concentrate its future activity on telecoms business, under the Marconi name and wanted to invest &#163;200&#150;300 million in expanding Fibreway. Fibreway was therefore restructured, and British Waterways received an annual payment and a 10 per cent. equity share in the new Fibreway business ipsaris.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para0">
In June 2001 ipsaris effectively split its business into two components. The mast site business was transferred to Ultramast and the fibre optic business was listed by way of a reverse takeover of Easynet. Marconi sold 92 per cent. of its share in ipsaris to Easynet in return for 77.5 million shares in the enlarged group. The deal meant that British Waterways received a 2.6 per cent. share of Easynet and a stake in the Ultramast business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para1">
The fibre optic business has continued successfully as part of the Easynet portfolio and British Waterways Board now owns approximately 2 million shares in the business (1.8 per cent.). This is valued at around &#163;2.1 million today, compared with the initial outlay of &#163;147,500. Easynet also continues to pay an annual sum to British Waterways for the use of the wayleave.

<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn1"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs why she has set stricter carbon dioxide reduction targets for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme than other member states.  [178488]</p>








<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK has not set stricter carbon reduction targets for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme than other member states. Most of the plans submitted to the Commission from other member states require greater emissions cuts from their industries than in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para2">
The UK is a leader in tackling climate change and has already reduced emissions of greenhouse gases to below its target under the Kyoto Protocol. However, many other member states have some way to meet their Kyoto obligations. The UK is pressing the Commission to ensure that a robust analysis of plans is carried out, and that member states are encouraged to use the EU Emissions Trading Scheme to help them meet their Kyoto targets.
</p>






<a name="40617w19.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>GM Crops</h3>





<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Simon Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what statistically valid and peer-reviewed studies her Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the safety of feeding Chardon LL fodder maize to ruminants.  [178119]</p>









<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 No studies on the safety of feeding Chardon LL, a variety of maize containing the GM event known as T25, to ruminants have been commissioned by Defra, nor has the Department evaluated any such studies. T25 maize was assessed and approved for use as any other maize by member states under Part C of directive 90/220 in 1998. Both the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feeding stuffs were satisfied, on the basis of the data submitted, that the T25 maize grain and its products pose no more risk as animal feed than non-GM maize varieties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para3">
I understand that Bayer CropScience commissioned a study which examined the effect of feeding Chardon LL forage maize to dairy cattle and that the results are being considered for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will be passed to ACRE and ACAF in due course.

<a name="40617w19.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Orchards</h3>





<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the rotational period is of <i>(a)</i> traditional English apple orchards and <i>(b)</i> modern commercial apple orchards.  [177783]</p>









<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 A grower&#039;s decision on when to replace an orchard will depend on many factors. Traditional orchards are typically aged 30 years or more but most commercial orchards are replaced after about 15 years as their productivity declines.


</p>







<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about the <i>(a)</i> apple growing and <i>(b)</i> cider industry under the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy.  [177788]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jun 2004 : Column 1102W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Many of the apples supplied to the cider industry are delivered under contract from orchards which have been planted for the purpose. We understand that a number of existing contracts are due to expire in the next two or three years and are unlikely to be renewed. Some top fruit growers who do not expect to have a market for their produce may choose to grub up their orchards to qualify for the new Single Payment, rather than retain them to the end of their productive life. This is a commercial decision for the growers concerned.
</p>






<a name="40617w19.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Radioactive Waste</h3>





<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn5"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects to publish her Department&#039;s annual report on progress made in implementing the programme set out in the White Paper on managing radioactive waste safely.  [178724]</p>









<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A copy of the 2003 Managing Radioactive Waste Safety progress report to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is available under the Environment heading of the Committee&#039;s website (www. parliament.uk/parliamentary committees/environment food and rural affairs.cfm). Additionally, CoRWM is required to submit quarterly reports of its work under Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme to its sponsoring Ministers. The first report for November 2003 to February 2004 is available on CoRWM&#039;s website (www.corwm.org.uk). The second report for March 2004 to May 2004 should be available shortly.

<p><a name="40617w19.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Damian Green: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she plans to take to maintain the quality of water in the River Stour as the population of Ashford grows; and if she will make a statement.  [177996]</p>








<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government are funding a series of studies intended to facilitate the sustainable development of Ashford, to meet a stated target of providing 31,000 new homes in the town by 2031.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para4">
The Integrated Water Management Study, which is being led by the Environment Agency, is looking into issues related to the water environment in this context. The first phase of the study identified a number of water-related constraints to growth, and potential strategies to overcome them will be identified in the final phase of the study. The final report will be available by the end of 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40617w19.html_para5">
The Agency&#039;s longer-term strategy for protecting the Great Stour will be guided by the results of the Integrated Water Management Study. Such a strategy may require, for example, more advanced wastewater treatment, new treatment and disposal locations.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jun 2004 : Column 1103W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Within Defra the Soil Action Plan currently has the dedicated support of a team of six staff (up from three a year ago and expected to expand a little further), and a research budget of &#163;1.4 million, plus a further &#163;9.7 million which it is estimated is spent on soil related research. The action plan is also supported by other colleagues in the department, and by a coalition of partners across and beyond Government, among whom English Heritage, English Nature and the Environment Agency have taken responsibility for leading particular workstreams.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what plans she has to expand the Warm Front grant scheme; and if she will make a statement;  [178671]

</p>



<p>(2) what plans she has to provide resources for a wider range of energy efficiency measures under the Warm Front scheme; and if she will make a statement;  [178672]

</p>



<p>(3) if she will make a statement on the progress made by the Warm Front scheme towards meeting the targets set out in the Government&#039;s Fuel Poverty Strategy.  [178673]</p>









<p><a name="40617w19.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 June 2004]:</i> We intend to publish a Fuel Poverty Implementation Plan later this summer which will include details about the future development of the Warm Front scheme and consider different options for improving its targeting and measures offered.

 The updated Economic Appraisal on re-opening the Ulster Canal in its entirety is currently with both Governments for consideration. As re-opening is not viable in purely monetary terms, it will be difficult to secure Government funding for this significant capital project.

 We do not have central figures for the amount spent on buying private healthcare for national health service patients in 1997.

The latest figures for total expenditure on acute services in the secondary care environment (hospital and community health service figures (HCHS) was &#163;17.2 billion in 2001&#150;02. Therefore, expenditure on acute healthcare from non-NHS providers represents less than 1 per cent. of total HCHS expenditure. It is not possible to extrapolate the precise amount of money spent in the private sector for 2002&#150;03 from the overall cost of the NHS buying services from non-NHS providers including voluntary and charitable organisations and the independent sector.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of patients were admitted to hospital within nine months of referral for admission in the last year for which figures are available.  [176856]</p>








<p><a name="40617w24.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Data are collected on the number of patients who are admitted to hospital from being placed on the inpatient waiting list. For the most recent financial year for 2002&#150;03, 90 per cent. of all admissions with a valid waiting time were admitted within nine months <sup>1</sup> . During 2002&#150;03 the maximum inpatient waiting time was 15 months. The current maximum inpatient waiting time in 2004&#150;05 is nine months, reducing to six months by the end of 2005.

<p>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.
