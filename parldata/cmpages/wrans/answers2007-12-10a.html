 One of the key objectives of the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line is to provide capacity for growth in passenger and freight over the next 30 years with substantially faster and more competitive journey times. Therefore, from the December 2008 timetable change, much greater use will be made of the fast lines with up to 11 trains every hour. This means that only two of these can call at Watford Junction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="71210w0003.htm_para1"><a name="07121025000418">The more fast line trains that call at Watford Junction, the lower the frequency that can operate to and from Euston. This would then reduce the benefits to passengers overall of the scheme, because the West Coast Main Line service as a whole would not be able to accommodate the projected demand. As a result of the new timetable, two of the 11 hourly services will call at Watford Junction. Watford Junction passengers are also able to interchange with a range of services at Milton Keynes.</p>

 The UK is vulnerable to the introduction of exotic animal disease as global trade in animals and animal products increases. Despite sophisticated systems of import control, we cannot hope to reduce the risk of introduction of disease to zero. Climate change and the threat of bio-terrorism also present new means by which animal disease could be introduced to this country. We must therefore ensure we can prepare for, and react quickly to, all disease outbreaks.</p>

This was highlighted by the pressure put on existing facilities during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK.

 The gamebird shooting industry involves the shooting of the native grey partridge and red grouse in addition to non-native gamebirds such as red-legged partridge and pheasant. These populations are managed for shooting and there is no evidence to suggest that shooting has resulted in population declines. In order to enhance gamebird populations, a range of native birds and mammals are killed legally as part of pest control campaigns. These species are generalist predators, including foxes, stoats, weasels, carrion crows and magpies. There is no evidence to suggest that this has an adverse affect on populations of these species, although little information is available on which to assess the impacts of killing stoats and weasels. The illegal persecution of native birds of prey, especially for the threatened hen harrier in England, has been associated with game rearing interests and remains a serious problem.</p>

As a part of this work, we plan to commission research to assess the environmental impacts of peatland management.</p>

 An assessment carried out by the inspection team, on 20 November, concluded that live virus had not been released to the environment.

<i>  [holding answer 4 December 2007]:</i> The Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF) is made up of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, 16 Air Assault Brigade and the High Readiness Mechanised or Armoured Brigade. None of these units is currently deployed in a JRRF capacity. The elements of the JRRF that are currently held at high readiness, therefore, are the Lead Commando Group (LCG) and the Lead Airborne Task Force (ABTF). The LCG is made up of elements of 3 Commando Brigade, while the ABTF is currently provided by the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA). The remaining element of the high readiness reserve is provided by the Spearhead Land Element. The ABTF is due to be replaced by a Small Scale Focused Intervention Battlegroup, based on a Light Infantry Role Battlegroup, between February 2008 and January 2009; its readiness may vary over time depending on the unit rostered.</p>

 Figures for those participating in apprenticeships funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) can be derived from the individualised learner record (ILR). The programme-led apprenticeship (PLA) is an initiative to enable more learners to enter an employed status apprenticeship programme. When they achieve their agreed goals, learners cease to be on a PLA and then become mainstream apprentices. It is possible to calculate participation for programme-led apprenticeships from the ILR data, but not their progression onto mainstream apprenticeships and therefore the associated framework achievement.</p>

teaching is organised on a departmental basis. However, we have consistently made clear that if a physics or chemistry department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain capacity elsewhere and we announced last year that the Council should report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way. Some science subjects are starting to become more popular and the measures we are taking to increase demand and the extra &#163;75 million announced last year should help to sustain capacity as demand increases. Physics and chemistry are also taught as major subjects at some 50 and 70 UK institutions respectively. The latest figures published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that the number of students who have been accepted for entry to full-time undergraduate courses in chemistry in autumn 2007 is up by nearly 13 per cent. compared to 2005, while the figures for physics have increased by 10 per cent. over the same period.</p>

 There were an estimated 4,188,033 persons with a DNA profile retained on the national DNA database (NDNAD) on 31 October 2007. Of these, approximately 4,165,300 had provided a DNA sample following arrest and 22,700 had provided a sample voluntarily. These figures are for the whole NDNAD and cover persons sampled by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and by other UK forces such as the Channel Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="71210w0018.htm_para5"><a name="07121048001381">Approximately 3,916,500 persons with a DNA profile retained on the NDNAD had provided a sample following arrest by police forces in England and Wales; and 21,600 persons provided a sample voluntarily for forces in England and Wales. The number of persons on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. fewer than the number of subject sample profiles. It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent. of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long-term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of all such redundant replicate profiles.</p>

 64.8 per cent. of police officer time in Essex was spent on front-line policing in 2006-07. The existing definition of time spent on patrol excludes other front line activity. Time spent on patrol refers only to time when an officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Any activity (such as advice to a member of the public or responding to antisocial behaviour) carried out while on patrol is recorded separately. This figure therefore provides a more rounded picture of front line activity by police officers.</p>

 The time spent by police officers on paperwork and other administrative duties remains an inevitable, but often necessary part of the process of protecting the public. We are, however, taking measures to reduce the time spent on these activities in order to increase the time police officers are able to spend on front line duties. These measures include: improving custody management working practices and processes; streamlining and providing greater local flexibility over performance management requirements; and providing a new &#163;50 million capital fund to support wider access to time and paperwork saving innovative electronic fingerprinting and mobile data technologies.</p>

 It will be for individual local authorities, in developing proposals for business rate supplements, to consider the potential impact on local business and on business improvement districts (BIDs).

 Eighteen local authorities are members of the network of empowerment champions. Their purpose is to promote effective empowerment practices so that they are more widely adopted. The function of the network is to achieve this by identifying effective practices, publicising them, and increasing their adoption through a peer learning programme.

Information reported each quarter by local authorities about their activities under homelessness legislation includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. This data is published in our quarterly statistical release on Statutory Homelessness, available on our website and placed in the Library each quarter.

 Detailed housing targets are not directly set by government, but are set out in regional and local plans which are developed through regional and local planning processes. The Government set the overall strategy for housing supply in England. The 2003 Sustainable Communities Plan set out a target to increase housing supply from 900,000 to 1.1 million in the RPG9 area (the wider South East) over the course of the plan, and the Government's 2005 response to the Barker review of Housing Supply announced an ambition to increase housing supply in England from 150,000 to 200,000 per annum by 2016.</p>

 I am committed to maintaining the excellent language skills of Diplomatic Service staff and to modernising the ways in which those skills are acquired. Following a review of the provision of language training, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services concluded in 2006 that its language teaching services cost between 15 and 40 per cent. more than comparable providers and that it should no longer provide language teaching services to the FCO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="71210w0036.htm_para6"><a name="07121116000093">At the same time, the FCO conducted a policy review of language training which recommended a number of reforms, including more group and in-country teaching. These changes would further increase the cost of in-house teaching. The FCO therefore concluded that it would be a better use of public money to outsource the language teaching requirement. A key element in the new arrangements was a strict quality control and monitoring component to ensure that the quality of teaching was maintained.  <br>
