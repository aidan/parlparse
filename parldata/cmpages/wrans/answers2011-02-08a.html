 We are aware that signal crayfish have a profound impact on the native crayfish population, due to predation, competition, and the spread of disease. We are also greatly concerned that abundant signal crayfish populations also impact other native freshwater invertebrates, particularly soft-bodied species, thus altering the ecology of rivers. To help ensure the long-term survival of the native species, Natural England and the Environment Agency are supporting projects to establish refuge sites for white clawed crayfish. They are currently finalising a best practice/guidance document on decision-making in the placement and establishment of Ark sites, and other conservation requirements. Natural England is currently funding a project in south-west England involving a captive rearing programme at Bristol Zoo, the identification of Ark sites and reintroduction of white-clawed crayfish to a number of sites across the south-west.</p>

 Natural England (NE) does not regularly monitor habitat loss outside of protected areas. As with other Schedule 5 species similarly protected under Section 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, in areas where white-clawed crayfish are present and work needs to be carried out, all practical measures must be taken to avoid or minimise impacts on the species. NE with the Environment Agency has produced guidance to help those planning work avoid or minimise impact on crayfish and improve habitats where possible. Depending on the type of project, various mitigation measures may be required with the aim being to ensure the long term survival of the resident breeding population. White-clawed crayfish inhabiting the affected area have to be temporarily removed by licensed crayfish handlers and are generally held until works have been completed. Crayfish habitat must be reinstated at the end of the works.</p>

 DEFRA is aware that research on signal crayfish shows that the species has an impact on both the physical nature of aquatic habitats (through burrowing and consequent siltation and erosion damage), and on a range of fauna and flora in rivers. The most noted impact is on the native white-clawed crayfish, but effects on other invertebrates and a number of fish species have been recorded. Clearly the scale of any impact will be increased as the signal crayfish population sizes increases in a given environment. A preliminary assessment of ecosystem health under the water framework directive indicates that up to 43 riverine water bodies (out of 5,818 in England and Wales) are likely to fail to achieve 'good ecological status' because of signal crayfish.</p>

 We recognise that some pensioners who are also carers currently have to claim carer's allowance in order to get the additional amount for caring included in their pension credit, even if carer's allowance would not be payable. We are looking at ways to make it simpler for carers to claim the additional amount in pension credit. In designing any revised test for the award of the additional amount we need to ensure that resources are targeted at those most in need and it is therefore important that we use an appropriate test for those who have caring responsibilities.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provides some detail not yet available from the100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. These figures have been scaled up to the overall total by the application of a single rating factor therefore subtotals, based on uprated 5% data may differ from 100% data because of sampling variation in the 5% sample.<br>
2. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 100. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
3. Figures 500 and under are subject to a high degree of sampling error and should only be used as a guide.<br>
4. Main Disabling Condition<br>
Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded. "Other" includes 25 medical conditions, including "Obesity" from February 2010 (for claims to benefit from October 2008 onwards). Previously, "Obesity" was included within "Mental Health Causes".<br>
5. Working age restricts the analysis to males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to59.<br>
6. State Pension Age<br>
The age at which women reach State Pension age will gradually increase from 60 to 65 between April 2010 and April 2020. This will introduce a small increase to the number of working age benefit recipients and a small reduction to the number of pension age recipients.<br>
7. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.<br>

 The work capability assessment (WCA) is used to determine eligibility for employment and support allowance. It is based on the principle that a health condition or disability should not automatically be regarded as a barrier to work. In March 2010, a department-led review of the WCA found that generally it is accurately identifying individuals for the right support.

 We continue to support the principle that tenants in the private rented sector should be responsible for managing their rental payments rather than having the choice of having it paid to their landlord. There are safeguards in place so that housing benefit can be paid to the landlord if the tenant is unable or unlikely to pay their rent. Benefit is also paid direct to the landlord if the tenant is in arrears by eight weeks' rent.</p>

2. The estimates presented here are for the United Kingdom.<br>
3. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication "Households Below Average Income" (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) modified equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Proportions of working age people and pensioners in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage point.<br>
 7. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are.<br>
8. The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time.<br>
9. The answer excludes men aged 60-64 since they are not defined as being above state pension age nor are in the aged 50-59 group. However, table 3 (as follows) provides information for this group.<br>

When this occurs will itself depend on factors including the speed at which wind costs fall (related to the degree of technological learning, commodity prices and supply chain development), future wholesale electricity prices and the relative costs of alternatives to wind.</p>

I therefore wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy, and asked the OFT if the study could explore the longer term consumer issues such as lifetime payback, consumer standards and labelling for alternative energy sources or supplies. Such a study would provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>

Middle office services include a variety of functions which provide direct support to the frontline, such as police training and criminal justice administration. Back office services are those which keep police forces running smoothly such as finance and HR. Forces should focus on maintaining and improving frontline services, while reducing costs as much as possible in middle and back office support functions, consistent with supporting frontline services.

Operational: any member of staff, including covert staff, whose primary role (ie over 50% of their time) is directly to deliver the overarching aims of the police service. To 'directly deliver' the role must involve routine and immediate interface (either face to face or by telephone) with the public, including covert operational staff in such roles can be considered as frontline service providers.<br>

Organisational support: any member of staff whose primary role is to service the internal needs of the organisation.<br>

<i> [holding answer 10 January 2011]:</i> The Home Office does not assess specific provision of support services for male victims of sexual violence at either a national or local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="110208w0003.htm_para17"><a name="11020866001286">In 2010-11, the Home Office has, in partnership with the Department of Health, allocated over £2.2 million to support the creation and operation of new and existing Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) around the country. These centres provide crisis support and medical care for victims in the immediate aftermath of rape and are open to men and women above 14 or 16 years of age with some centres also providing services for children. They enable victims to access services anonymously, including a forensic examination if they wish, and to consider making a report to the police in a supportive and caring environment. SARCs also provide follow-up care, and often refer victims on to other forms of specialist local provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_511"><a name="110208w0003.htm_para18"><a name="11020866001287">In addition, the Home Office has made available £860,000 in 2010-11 to support Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs). ISVAs work with victims of recent and historic serious sexual crimes to enable them to access the services they need in the aftermath of the abuse they have experienced. They provide impartial advice to the victim on all options open to them, such as reporting to the police, accessing Sexual Assault Referral Centres, seeking support from specialist sexual violence organisations and other services like housing or benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="110208w0003.htm_para19"><a name="11020866001288">In launching the cross-Government vision for tackling violence against women and girls on 25 November 2010, the Secretary of State for the Home Department confirmed Home Office funding of more than £28 million for specialist services until 2015. Of this, £1.72 million will be available each year to support ISVAs in both the specialist voluntary sector and in SARCs.</p>
