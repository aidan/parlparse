To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the North of London Breast Screening Unit based at Edgware Community Hospital; and what proposals he has arising out of that assessment.  [126161]<P>

 As part of its regular visiting programme, the London Region Breast Screening Quality Assurance Reference Centre visited the North of London Breast Screening Service on 25 November 1999. Following that visit, a number of recommendations were made to strengthen the service and improve quality. An action plan taking account of them is due to be submitted shortly to the region's quality assurance director.

<a name="00629w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) on what date and at what location a mobile breast screening unit last operated in Brent;  [126082]
<P>
<UL>(2) what bids he has received from Brent and Harrow Health Authority for funding from the New Opportunities Fund to provide additional mobile breast screening units;  [126160]
<P>
(3) on what date and at what location a mobile breast screening unit last made a visit in the Brent and Harrow Health Authority Area;  [126081]
<P>
(4) how many mobile breast screening units serve the Brent and Harrow Health Authority area; how many of these are fully functioning; and how many of the fully-functioning mobile breast screening units serving that area have been mobile in the year 2000 to date.  [126164]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w01.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There is currently one mobile breast screening unit that serves the Brent and Harrow Health Authority area. This unit is fully functional and forms a part of the North of London Breast Screening Service based at Edgware Community Hospital, which is managed by the Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals National Health Service Trust. The service provides breast screening for the population of Brent and Harrow, Barnet and part of West Hertfordshire Health Authorities. Following a successful bid from the Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals Trust, the New Opportunities Fund notified the trust in December 1999 that it would provide the capital necessary for the replacement of this and one other unit and for the purchase of one additional trailer. The London Regional Office of the NHS Executive has agreed to meet capital costs for associated equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Under the Children Act 1989, children can be looked after until they reach the age of 18. Foster care therefore comes to an end at 18. However, it would be possible, if desired, for the young person to continue to live with his former foster parents, for example under a supported lodgings arrangement. In addition, under section 20(5) of the Children Act a council can provide accommodation in a community home for a person aged between 16 and 21 should his welfare require it.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para0">The Children (Leaving Care) Bill does not affect either of these provisions. However, the Bill does create significant new aftercare duties which will require councils to continue to assist care leavers, should their welfare require it, until they are 21, or beyond if they are still in an agreed programme of education or training.

 In the previous winter (1999-2000), 18,928 people in the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency received a winter fuel payment automatically, by virtue of their entitlement to a Social Security benefit. Actual numbers of beneficiaries for winter 2000 will not be known until later in the year (the qualifying week is 18 September 2000). In addition 10,087 claims forms/ mailshots have also been issued to people in the constituency, who based on Departmental records, may be eligible for winter fuel payments for both previous winters and this coming winter as a result of the European Court judgment.

 The move to Automated Credit Transfer as the normal method of payment will bring significant savings from reduced levels of fraud. The move will begin in 2003, but full savings will not be realised until 2005, when the transition from current paper based methods of payment is complete.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para2">A large number of fraud prevention measures are in place to manage the fraud risk relating to order books and girocheques but latest figures indicate that despite these measures around &#163;100 million was lost in 1998-99.

<P>
<a name="00629w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Benefit Fraud Inspectorate reports have been published today in respect of Southwark and Windsor and Maidenhead Councils. From these reports, and others, it is clear that many local authorities are failing to reach adequate standards of performance to secure Housing and Council Tax Benefit administration and counter the threat of fraud.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para4">We have already introduced a number of initiatives aimed at helping councils and I am pleased to announce another measure that will provide practical support.

<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para5">This is an important step forward in the intelligence available to authorities and one I expect will be used.

 Copies of the Report have today been placed in the Library of the House. My noble Friend the Minister for Education and Employment is sending copies of the Executive Summary to every higher education and further education institution which administers Access Funds or Hardship Loans in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para7">The Review looked at ways in which these two schemes can be used more effectively to widen access and prevent hardship, with a particular emphasis on mature students. My right hon. Friend attaches great importance to widening access and &#163;87 million will be available next year through the Access Bursary and Hardship Funds. Hardship Loans were introduced by this Government to provide extra targeted help for students in financial difficulty.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para8">The Review concluded that changes in the arrangements for offering help to students through these schemes were needed. The Report contains a total of 20 recommendations on administration of the Funds, as well as further support for mature students. Many of the recommendations addressed to the Department have already been implemented or are being put in place for 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="00629w02.html_para9">A package of measures to provide additional help for mature and disadvantaged students was announced on 25 January. This package includes &#163;17 million for non-repayable Bursaries in 2000-01 for mature students; a new Childcare Grant from 2001-02 and &#163;10 million for Opportunity Bursaries to improve access to higher education for bright pupils from lower socio-economic groups. In addition, we have provided &#163;2 million to help higher education institutions with the cost of administering the Bursaries for mature students in 2000-01.

 The average cost of each issue of "Teachers" magazine is 32p per head. The magazine is subsidised by advertising which keeps this cost down.

<a name="00629w03.html_para2">Under health and safety legislation employers are required to ensure that suitable and sufficient toilet facilities are provided for all employees. Therefore, any worker with a disability must have access to toilet and other welfare facilities that are suitable for his or her use. In addition, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 also places a duty on an employer who has 15 or more employees to provide reasonable adjustments for disabled employees to ensure that they are not substantially disadvantaged. This could include providing access to toilet facilities. The newly formed Disability Rights Commission will be working to help employees enforce their rights and employers to understand their duties under the Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many serious offences were alleged to have been committed in 1999 by persons entitled to immunity by virtue of their employment by a diplomatic mission or an international organisation.  [128625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 From a community of over 17,500 persons entitled to immunity, 36 serious offences, allegedly committed by such persons, were drawn to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1999. "Serious offences" are defined in accordance with the 1985 White Paper on Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges; i.e. as offences that would in certain circumstances carry a penalty of 12 months or more imprisonment.

<P>
<a name="00629w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Since 1998 we have written to tour operator associations and to travel companies drawing attention to the views of Burmese democratic leaders that tourism to Burma is inappropriate. We cannot stop British citizens choosing Burma as a holiday destination, but we hope that any who go there are aware of the political and human rights situation. They should also be aware that they have to exchange $300 on arrival. Every one of these dollars will directly support the regime.

 The European Union Heads of State and Government meeting at the special European Council at Tampere in October 1999 called for action with regard to the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering, with particular reference to the tracing, freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime. It has been proposed that a new ad hoc working group, which has still to be set up, will carry this work forward.
<P>

<a name="00629w06.html_para0">Separate discussions are taking place with regard to the application of the principle of mutual recognition to asset freezing and restraint. This will involve consideration of the minimum standards which should be applied to permit recognition of orders between member states.
<P>

<a name="00629w06.html_para1">The incoming French Presidency of the European Union has made action against financial crime and money laundering one of its priorities and it is clear that this will involve some action in the area of the tracing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime.

<a name="00629w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his policy in relation to the future of the existing police radio frequencies; what is the estimated commercial value of expected surplus frequencies; what is his current estimated timescale for the changes to the use of radio frequencies; and if he will make a statement.  [128166]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The majority of the radio frequencies currently used by the police service, in England and Wales, will be returned to the central Government pool once the Public Safety Radio Communications service (PSRCS) is fully operational and the frequencies are no longer required. This is expected to occur in 2005.
<P>

<a name="00629w06.html_para7">The spectrum returned will be used to assist in re-organising the civil spectrum to improve its quality by aligning it with usage in Europe. This re-alignment will take many years and we do not expect that any parts of the spectrum currently used by the Home Office will be available for sale or for further allocation until this programme has been completed.

<UL>(2) what plans he has to introduce a sparsity factor into the process of allocating funds to rural police forces;  [126426]
<P>
(3) if it is his policy to accept the findings of the ORH study into police funding in respect of the additional costs of policing sparsely populated rural areas;  [126423]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government set considerable store by stability in the grant system to help police authorities plan ahead. In July 1998, the Government announced a three-year freeze on changes to Standard Spending Assessment funding formulae pending the wide ranging review of the revenue support grant system across local government. In view of the moratorium, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary decided that it would not be appropriate to make substantive changes to the method of police grant distribution for 2000-01. That position remains unchanged.
<P>

<a name="00629w07.html_para0">The fundings of the Operational Research in Health (ORH) report on policing areas of rural sparsity were considered by a Home Office chaired Working Group, which includes representatives of the police service, police authorities and local authorities. That report was placed in the Library. Implementing the findings of the report would have meant the redistribution of around &#163;30 million of funding almost entirely from the metropolitan forces to shire forces where call response times are longer. There was no agreement in the working group about the best way to proceed.
<P>

<a name="00629w07.html_para1">However, the opportunity has now arisen as a result of additional funds being made available through the budget, for the Government to recognise the special needs of rural policing. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has therefore agreed to make &#163;15 million available for the remainder of this year to enhance the policing service in rural areas at no cost to the metropolitan forces. Funding for future years will be considered as part of the spending review 2000 process.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what account under resource accounting rules is to be taken of the right of third generation mobile spectrum licensees to amortise the cost of their licences from the amount of their future taxable profits and of the consequential future reduction in tax revenue.  [128071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 June 2000]:</i> Tax relief for the amortisation of third generation spectrum licence costs will reduce corporation tax yields over the lives of the licences. Currently, the resource accounting rules apply only to departmental resource accounts and not to corporation tax. However, subject to the passing of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, the same accounting principles will apply in due course to the Whole of Government Accounts, which will include corporation tax revenue.

 The RAF is very conscious that the year 2000 marks the 60thAnniversary year of the Battle of Britain and the RAF is participating in many events nationwide throughout the year to commemorate the Battle.
<P>

<a name="00629w08.html_para13">A Battle of Britain Service and Reception at Westminster Abbey on 17 September is the main official commemoration of the campaign. The Westminster Abbey service is held annually in September each year, but is enhanced on this occasion in recognition both that it is the 60th Anniversary and that it is likely to be the last major commemorative event of the Battle that many of the participants will be able to attend. Members of the Government, High Commissioners, the Air Force Board and representatives of the aviation industry attend each year and, in view of the importance of this particular anniversary, members of the Royal Family have also been invited.
<P>

<a name="00629w08.html_para14">A Battle of Britain Dinner at RAF Bentley Prior is being hosted on 15 September by the Air Force Board for members of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association, ground crew and plotters. It is planned that Service personnel, aviation industry representatives and others with a connection to the Battle will attend. Members of the Royal Family and Defence Ministers will also be invited.
<P>

<a name="00629w08.html_para15">The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust Day will be held on 9 July. The Battle of Britain Memorial Trust is arranging a ceremony at Capel le Ferne on the cliffs of Dover at the site of the Trust memorial to commemorate the Battle. The Lord Lieutenant of Kent will preside over the event, which will be fully supported by the RAF, with aircrew from the 13 extant Battle of Britain Squadrons, a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, Bands of the RAF Regiment and Air Training Corps cadets. Members of the RauxAF will also be supporting the event. A short memorial service will be conducted by the Chaplain in Chief (RAF).
<P>

<a name="00629w08.html_para16">Finally, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is in high demand this year and will be representing the RAF at events throughout the UK and displaying for some of our WWII allies in Europe. The Battle of Britain Memorial

Following a request for ammunition to meet urgent operational needs, therefore, Ministers have agreed that the Government will supply five million rounds of 7.62mm rifle ammunition and four thousand rounds of 81mm mortar ammunition, which are available as surplus from MOD stocks. This will be transported to Sierra Leone subject to the Government of Sierra Leone securing formal agreement from the ECOWAS Secretariat that this ammunition can be imported as an exception to their Small Arms Moratorium. In accordance with UNSCR 1171 (1998), this shipment will be notified to the UN Sanctions Committee. The Government have received confirmation from President Kabbah that the ammunition will be used only by regular Sierra Leone Army soldiers, in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights standards, and not by child soldiers. The Government remain prepared to consider further requests for assistance from the Government of Sierra Leone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Following the publication last year of the consultation paper on "Operator Pollution Risk Appraisal (OPRA) for waste," I am issuing revised guidance to the Environment Agency to enable the introduction of a risk-based system for the inspection of sites licensed under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para0">We must ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. The site inspections which the Agency carries out are a vital part of this process. The new system will further improve standards by targeting inspections on those sites where they are most needed and making more effective use of the Agency's waste inspection resources.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para1">It will also provide site licence holders with a risk management system which enables them to identify the environmental risks associated with their site and the operations they carry out; and to assess and improve the quality of their performance in managing those operations and their environmental risks. A copy of the revised guidance, which I am issuing to the Agency under section 35(8) of the 1990 Act, is being placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reports he has received from the Greater London returning officer on the election of the Mayor and Assembly for London; and if he will make a statement.  [128464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I have now had advice from the Greater London Returning Officer (GLRO) about the first election of the Mayor and Assembly for London. There were a number of innovations at the election designed to make voting more convenient and to speed up the counting process. These included electronic counting, early voting, opening polling stations an hour earlier than usual and sending a leaflet to every elector containing an election address from each candidate contesting the Mayoral election.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para2">Two issues have emerged in relation to the count: the speed of the count and the number of votes classified as "rejected".
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para3">Although the count took a few hours longer than originally expected, the GLRO has stressed that Ministers can be satisfied that the first use of electronic counting in an election of this size and complexity went well. There were some technical problems with some scanning machines on the night, but a manual count would have taken many more days to complete. In all other respects the electronic counting system worked very well and fully in line with expectations.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jun 2000 : Column: 599W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para4">A number of other factors also contributed to the slower than expected count. For example, there were a larger than expected number of ballot papers out-sorted by the scanning machines for manual checking, before they were entered into the system. It is also the case that as this was the first time that staff had used an electronic counting system in an election, they quite rightly took time to make sure that the new procedures were followed properly. These factors inevitably slow things up.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para5">The other issue was the larger than expected number of electors who chose not to cast a vote in one or more of the elections. Each elector had four opportunities to vote--first choice for Mayor, second choice for Mayor, constituency assembly member and London Assembly Member--and each is recorded separately. If an elector chooses not to vote in any of the four ballots--as they have every right to do--this is recorded as a "rejected" vote even though the ballot paper was left blank. For example, if a voter selects a first choice for Mayor but not a second choice, and does not vote at all in the two Assembly elections, the system would record one valid vote and three "rejected" votes.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para6">Over 6.5 million votes were cast by about 1.75 million electors. Around 0.5 million votes were recorded as "rejected". These were made up of multiple votes (where the voter had voted more than once in a column), papers where marks identified the voter, blanks where no vote had been cast and uncertain votes, where even after manual checking the voter's intention was still not clear.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para7">The majority of votes classified as "rejected" simply record the fact that many electors chose not to use all the four votes at their disposal. Almost 300,000 people did not use their second preference vote for the Mayor, although they did give a first preference. About 130,000 did not cast vote for a constituency assembly member and about 70,000 did not cast a vote for a London assembly member. About 1 per cent. of ballot papers were "rejected" because they were either marked with multiple votes or had marks that identified the voter. This proportion is in line with other elections.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para8">Over 3 per cent. of voters took advantage of early voting. Almost all of them welcomed the opportunity to vote early and said they would use it again if it is available. Just under half of those who used the facility said that they would not have voted on polling day.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para9">About 3 per cent. of voters also took advantage of the extended polling hours on polling day and voted between 7am and 8am on polling day. In some polling stations 11 per cent. of voters voted in the first hour. Most were on their way to work and 20 per cent. said that they would not have been able to vote at another time on the day. More people preferred the polls to open an extra hour in the morning rather than later in the evening.
<P>

<a name="00629w09.html_para10">A leaflet containing election addresses for all 11 mayoral candidates was produced and delivered to every elector in London, as required by law.

There will be no immediate amendment to those statutory functions.

 HSE inspectors work from 20 main offices of HSE and a number of outstationed offices throughout Great Britain. They are not solely concerned with fairground work.

<a name="00629w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Work by National Energy Action and others indicate that fuel poverty is not widely recognised in other member states of the European Union, with the exception of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="00629w10.html_para5">Fuel poverty is caused mainly by a combination of low income and poor energy efficiency in homes. The links between temperature and winter mortality is strong and typically 30,000 more people die in winter in the UK than would be expected given the average death rate for the year. Although this excess mortality is caused by both exposure to outdoor conditions as well as cold homes, it is much higher in the UK than in other areas, such as Scandinavia, where winter outdoor conditions are more severe but homes are more energy efficient.
<P>

<a name="00629w10.html_para6">The Government believe it is unacceptable for households, particularly those most vulnerable to cold-related ill health--the old, disabled and children--not to be able to afford the heat they need to keep warm. The Inter-ministerial Group on fuel poverty is currently developing a fuel poverty strategy for publication in the autumn, that sets out objectives and the policies and targets to achieve them. It is likely that the strategy will cover both measures to tackle low incomes as well as improvements in energy efficiency of homes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We are consulting on proposals to amend the energy efficiency requirements of the Building Regulations. The proposed changes would introduce energy performance requirements for air conditioning equipment and include guidance to encourage the use of energy efficient components in well-designed systems. The consultation period ends on 29 September.
<P>

<a name="00629w10.html_para7">We are also concerned that HFC emissions from refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment are forecast to grow strongly in the near future. This trend is unsustainable and action needs to be taken to limit the projected growth. That is why we have given a clear signal to industry and users to look closely at alternative refrigerants and to select those that are more environmentally acceptable where they do exist. Safety, technical feasibility and cost effectiveness should be taken into account before investment decisions are taken. Where HFCs are used we intend to discuss with industry and users what measures could be taken to minimise emissions.

The work will take approximately six months as there is a need for major reconstruction work, drainage repairs, safety fencing work and minor works to structures. I can confirm that the concrete surface will be replaced with a quieter thin surfacing which will reduce the road noise at nearby properties. In addition, Junctions 4 - 5 were resurfaced at the beginning of this year and also received a low noise surfacing treatment.</FONT></UL>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00629w12.html_para0">The land below high tide level is already vulnerable to flooding and depends on flood and coastal defences. These low lying areas form around 5 per cent. of the land area of England, including a similar proportion of the developed urban land, and over 50 per cent. of the highest grade agricultural land.
<P>

<a name="00629w12.html_para1">This land could be at increased risk through climate change. We need to respond to the challenge primarily by ensuring that, where necessary and appropriate, existing defences are replaced and upgraded. Since 1989, MAFF has issued flood and coastal defence operating authorities with allowances for sea level rise for them to take into account when designing new or upgraded schemes; these allowances reflect both climate change and long term geological land movement.

<a name="00629w12.html_para2">However, the response to climate change cannot be automatically to surround Britain in concrete by building ever higher sea defences. Sustainability is a key criterion and we cannot commit future generations to unsustainable defence options. In assessing defence options the operating authorities need to consider alternative approaches including "managed realignment" of defences to reduce such pressure on the inter-tidal area, compensate for habitat losses and provide more sustainable long term lines of coastal defence. Decisions on such matters will need to be made by the operating authorities over the coming years.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry yesterday announced the publication of the Performance and Innovation Unit's report commissioned by the Prime Minister, "Counter Revolution: Modernising the Post Office Network", and the Government's response to this (Vol. 352, columns 907-11). The Government fully accept the PIU's 24 recommendations and will work in partnership with the Post Office and the devolved Administrations to build a bright future for a modernised network, including more than 1,500 post offices in Wales.
<P>

<a name="00629w12.html_para4">My right hon. Friend outlined today how the Government will act to protect a nationwide network of post offices:

However, Government funding will be available to support our proposals as necessary and we have identified funding in the current spending review. Precise figures will be announced in July as part of the Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="00629w12.html_para12">Most of these proposals are for the UK Government to take forward with the Post Office, although some will be for the Assembly to decide on. In areas which fall within the Assembly's policy remit, Wales will receive a share of any new funding and it will be for the Assembly to decide how it uses that money. I am in close contact with the First Secretary on this matter and the Assembly will no doubt wish to make its own announcement in due course.

 The under-10-metre fleet is an important part of the UK fishing industry and I am concerned to promote and ensure a stable future for our inshore fishermen.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jun 2000 : Column: 612W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00629w13.html_para5">Last year the Ministry and the other Fisheries Departments invited comments on measures to improve the management of the under-10-metre fleet. More than 250 replies have been received from fishermen's organisations and individual fishermen. The majority of those commenting were opposed to further constraints being placed on this part of the industry such as a prohibition on weekend fishing, regional licensing or species specific licences.
<P>

<a name="00629w13.html_para6">Although we have been successful in limiting the closure of fisheries, we do need to safeguard against the consequences of further increases in fishing effort. In recent years there has been a sharp increase in the construction of vessels between 9 and 10 metres. This trend prompted the Fisheries Departments to introduce monthly catch limits for North Sea nephrops last Autumn and to extend these arrangements to Area VII and West of Scotland nephrops for the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="00629w13.html_para7">In our view it would be prudent to adopt further measures to constrain future growth in fishing effort within the under-10-metre fleet. Consequently, from 1 January 2001 it will not be possible to aggregate licences from vessels under eight metres onto vessels between eight and 10 metres and a limit of 70 vessel capacity units (VCUs) will apply to the aggregation of licences onto vessels below eight metres. Additionally, the Licensing Review Working Group, comprising representatives from industry and Fisheries Departments, has been asked to consider whether any changes should be made in the capacity penalties applying to the transfer or aggregation of licences within the under 10 metre fleet.
<P>

<a name="00629w13.html_para8">The Fisheries Departments will continue to manage quota allocations for the under-10-metre fleet with the objective of providing fishing opportunities throughout the year. Steps have already been taken to underpin the main stocks of interest to under-10-metre vessels and special arrangements have been made for low impact fisheries such as handlining for mackerel. In future any surplus that arises on underpinned allocations will be utilised to acquire additional quota for this part of the fleet. Greater use will also be made of EU provisions on end year flexibility enabling quota to be borrowed from the following year and for certain stocks for any surplus to be banked. Consideration will also be given to whether suitable arrangements might be possible that would enable Producer Organisations to manage quota in respect of under-10-metre vessels within their membership.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on planned changes in the size of the UK fishing fleet; what corresponding changes are planned for other EU fleets, indicating <i>(a)</i> how many vessels will be affected and <i>(b)</i> what proportion of that country's fleet this represents; and what measures he is taking to use these changes to reduce the number of flagged vessels.

<a name="00629w13.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In document 7426/00, the European Commission recently published its mid-term review of the fourth Multi-annual Guidance Programme (MAGP IV). At the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 16 June, the UK and a number of other member states expressed reservations about the Commission's recommendations for future policy on fleet restructuring. The Commission will be consulting extensively on the report's findings before making formal proposals for new legislation and the Government will be playing an active part in those discussions.
<P>

<a name="00629w13.html_para10">Member states continue to be bound by the obligations for fleet reductions set out in MAGP IV and in the coming weeks the Commission will be publishing its report on Member states' progress (at 31 December 1999) in meeting those objectives. In implementing MAGP IV we are obliged to consider all vessels on the UK register.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not legally open to the Government to end the trade in live farm animals to other member states if the arrangements for transporting them comply with the relevant EU animal welfare rules. We do devote considerable effort to ensuring these rules are met while the animals are on our territory, as well as to urging other member states, bilaterally and through discussions in Brussels, to follow our example. We shall also press strongly for improvements to the rules in the forthcoming review. Our preference is for a carcase trade.

<a name="00629w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture Council meeting in Luxembourg on 19 June 2000, accompanied by Brid Rodgers MLA, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the Northern Ireland Executive.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para0">The main topic for discussion was a proposal for EU-wide rules governing the use of Specified Risk Materials to prevent the spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. There was no qualified majority for the proposal in the Council (Austria, Finland, Spain and Greece opposing, Germany abstaining) but the absence of a simple majority of member states opposing means the Commission are free to adopt it under the relevant procedures. I welcomed this important consumer safety measure which will apply appropriate controls on SRMs in all EU countries, and for which the UK has long been pressing.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para1">The Council deferred a decision on the 2000-01 CAP price proposals until its July meeting. In order to avoid a legal vacuum when the sugar and pigmeat marketing years begin on 1 July however, the Council agreed to extend current price supports as from that date. I, Sweden and the Netherlands voted against the decision on sugar for which we consider a support price cut is required. The decision on pigmeat was agreed unanimously.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para2">A first Council discussion of the Commission's proposal to establish income stabilisation funds in the pigmeat sector revealed a divergence of views. Many member states, including the UK, expressed fears that the proposal would exacerbate market price volatility and distort competition. Others felt provision of Community finance and greater compulsion on producers to participate in stabilisation funds was the key. The Council will return to this issue in due course.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para3">Under Other Business I urged the Commission to review its approach to the allocation of export refunds for processed agricultural products in the context of budget and WTO constraints. I expressed particular concern at the Commission's decision to suspend the issue of refund certificates, which has caught out many companies through no fault of their own. I also requested Commissioner Fischler to ensure that cutbacks in refunds for future years avoid placing a disproportionate burden on particular sectors, notably cereals-based spirit drinks.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para4">Also under Other Business I strongly supported the Swedish Minister's call for better enforcement by all member states of the EU rules on the welfare of animals in transit, as well as further, more rigorous legislation. I particularly welcomed the new Commission's Working Group, which Commissioner Byrne has established, at the United Kingdom's suggestion, to address these issues.

However, by long standing convention, adhered to by successive Governments, neither the fact that the Law Officers have been consulted on an issue, nor the substance of the advice they have been given, is disclosed outside Government and other than in exceptional circumstances.

 In my answer to the hon. Member's question on 25 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1107, I outlined the initiatives in place to improve efficiency in the Crown Prosecution Service. These include a major programme of IT modernisation, the development of joint/police/CPS Criminal Justice Units and Trial Units and the implementation of the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1988. Good progress continues to be made on all these initiatives.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para5">I am pleased to say that the first Criminal Justice Unit and the first Trials Unit were opened in Bristol on Monday 26 June 2000. police administrators and CPS lawyers and caseworkers are working together in the Criminal Justice Unit at New Bridewell Police Station, serving all the magistrates courts in Avon. Similar joint working is proceeding in the CPS premises, Froomsgate House, which is preparing cases for hearing at Bristol Crown Court.

 The estimated legal costs incurred by the CPS are &#163;155,630.91 The legal costs covered six separate cases brought against the CPS by Mrs. Bamieh which contained a large number of allegations. Two separate Tribunal Hearings were involved and a remedies hearing. All outstanding cases between the CPS and Mrs. Bamieh were resolved when a settlement, the terms of which are confidential to the parties, was reached on 8 February 2000. Mrs. Bamieh continues to work for the CPS.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00629w14.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 As the report of the Intelligence and Security Committee indicates, procedures for reviewing cases for possible prosecution have been strengthened. While criteria exist for prosecutions, the Security Service has agreed to send all material relevant to prosecutions to the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers on a trial basis for 12 months. This will allow the Law Officers to assess when a prosecution is possible for all cases and validate these criteria for future use.

<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para8">The figures (announced today) for the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders in England and Wales in the first quarter of this year showed a fall from 108 days in 1999 to 96 in 2000. This compares with 125 days in 1998 and 141 days in 1997. This downward trend in the figures has been a continuing feature since the Government's Pledge.
<P>

<a name="00629w14.html_para9">At a national level, the Crown Prosecution Service has been, and continues to work closely with other Criminal Justice System partners; the Narey reforms and the new local good practice already introduced into the Youth Court will help to make further progress.

 Approximately 10,000 people peacefully celebrated the summer solstice at Stonehenge on 20 June this year. English Heritage, in close a positive liaison with Druid and pagan groups and the Wiltshire Constabulary, successfully implemented a policy of managed open access. The site was stewarded by over 70 English Heritage personnel, ably assisted by volunteer stewards from Druid and pagan groups, who were encouraged to self-steward. I am grateful to the police for their skilful and imaginative support, and I am pleased to report that there were no arrests or significant incidents. There was no camping at the site and the visitors willingly left by the agreed time of 07.30 the next morning, most taking their litter with them. Stonehenge reopened to the public at 09.00 on Wednesday 21 June.
