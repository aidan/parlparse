To ask the President of the Council what is her Department's policy regarding the recycling of information technology equipment within her Department and relevant agencies and to other government departments or agencies; and what arrangements have been made in this respect. [23247]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 My Department's policy for the recycling and disposal of information technology equipment is to determine the most cost effective option. Consideration is given to retention for spares, or sale to staff or to commercial or charitable organisations. I am not responsible for any agencies.

<a name="80121w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The policy regarding the recycling of information technology equipment in the Departments for which I am responsible is to redeploy the equipment within the relevant Department or, if it is past its useful life, to destroy it. Surplus equipment which is of value may be sold. All data are erased for security purposes.

<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson </B>

<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> Interest rates are set by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England to meet the Government's inflation target of 2&#189; per cent. The MPC bases its interest rate decisions on a range of evidence, and its response to higher than expected earnings growth would depend on how it affected the outlook for inflation.

<P>
<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> Officials from my Department and the Scottish Office are discussing the need for a non-statutory agreement between the Treasury and the Scottish Executive covering the exchange of information, advance notification and joint working in line with the principles set out the White Paper, "Scotland's Parliament".

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the mandate of the Financial Services Authority will include those who have neither a current bank account nor one with a building society. [23354]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Financial Services Authority will be responsible for all aspects of financial regulation. It will acquire the regulatory responsibilities currently exercised by the Bank of England, the three Self-Regulating Organisations (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the Personal Investment Authority and the Securities and Futures Authority), the Insurance Directorate of Her Majesty's Treasury, the Building Societies Commission, the Friendly Societies Commission and the Registry of Friendly Societies. The Financial Services Authority will also be given responsibility for the authorisation of those currently authorised to do investment business by virtue of their membership of a Recognised Professional Body.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Treasury has received a number of representations on reform of the Trustee Investments Act.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para0">The Government understand and accept in principle the case for reform. But any reform must provide a complete and lasting solution. It is unlikely that this could be achieved without primary legislation.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para1">The Government are committed to reform in a number of areas and already have a full programme of legislation implementing its key policy priorities. Primary legislation to reform the TIA would need to compete for a space in this programme. The Government will keep the position under review and seek to make progress at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will carry out an assessment of the impact of his Department's current policies on the <i>(a)</i> income, <i>(b)</i> employment opportunities and <i>(c)</i> living standards, of the poorest 30 per cent. of the population. [23345]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Our society is more divided than it has been in generations: over the last 20 years the proportion of households without work has more than doubled from 9 per cent. Our policies are aimed at mending these divisions. Our objective is to raise the living standards of the many, not just of the few, and to offer education and employment opportunities for all.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para2">The Government believe that the best way of improving the living standards of those with the poorest living standards is to help them into work. We are implementing a range of policies under the New Deal to help move those people from welfare into work in order that their living standards may rise.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para3">The Government have also established a Social Exclusion Unit to help co-ordinate action across Government to find new and more integrated ways of tackling the worst problems. We continually evaluate our policies using a variety of methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer which registered United Kingdom insurance and reinsurance companies have ceased underwriting since January 1992; and which are paying less than 100 per cent. of claims. [23985]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Information on the status of UK authorised insurance companies as at 31 December 1996 is given in the Insurance Annual Report 1996 published by The Stationery Office, copies of which are in the Library. Appendix 3A indicates whether a company's authorisation to effect contracts of insurance has been withdrawn under section 11 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, and if a company is in liquidation, provisional liquidation, or scheme or arrangements under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985. Companies in the last three 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1998 : Column: 526</I><P>
categories will generally not be meeting claims in full. Other companies which remain authorised may in practice have ceased underwriting, but it is not possible to give a definitive list as the circumstances of each company differ.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_wqn10"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bank of England Bill. [24941]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bank of England Bill will be altered to reflect new guidance on the treatment of cash ratio deposits in the National Accounts. On the basis of advice from Eurostat, the Bank of England's income on cash ratio deposits will not score as General Government Expenditure. This does not affect the position for the Financial Services Authority, whose costs will be General Government Expenditure.

<a name="80121w01.html_sbhd11"><H4><center>Lloyd's</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_wqn11"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the future regulation of Lloyd's. [24942]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In her statement of 23 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>676</i>, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade announced that the supervision of insurance business, including that carried on at Lloyd's, would ultimately become a responsibility of the proposed Financial Services Authority (FSA). Since then, I have been considering the options for the future regulatory arrangements for Lloyd's in the context of the comprehensive reforms which we will implement in the forthcoming financial services reform Bill. As we have already made clear, we intend to publish a draft Bill for consultation in the Summer.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para4">Holders of insurance policies underwritten at Lloyd's should enjoy the benefits of the same kind of supervisory regime as those with policies issued by other insurers. I intend as part of the modernisation of the prudential supervision powers currently available to the Treasury under the Insurance Companies Act 1982, that the FSA will have much more extensive supervisory powers in relation to Lloyd's. I intend that these should include enhanced powers of intervention and a requirement for authorisation by the FSA of managing agents, who are responsible in practice for running underwriting syndicates. I also intend that the FSA should have reserve power to undertake direct authorisation and supervision of Members of Lloyd's, should that prove to be appropriate in due course.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para5">Certain activities at Lloyd's are similar to business which is currently regulated by the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services Act 1986. Members' agents advise Members of Lloyd's about which syndicates they should participate in and I intend that their activities should be subject to authorisation by the FSA. In addition, the emerging secondary market in syndicate capacity resembles markets subject to control under 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1998 : Column: 527</I><P>
the 1986 Act. I intend that the FSA should oversee the operation of the market under a regime similar to that currently in place for recognised investment exchanges.
<P>

<a name="80121w01.html_para6">These arrangements will continue to allow scope for a major role by the Council of Lloyd's in ensuring that Lloyd's continues to be a well-regulated, successful and important part of the UK financial services industry. They will however provide, for the first time in many areas, a major element of external regulatory accountability.

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>1. The data come from the Department of Social Security's Households Below Average Income (HBAI) Series, based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the 1995-96 financial year and covering Great Britain. Data from the FRS were used to answer this question because it has a considerably larger sample size than the alternative data source, the Family Expenditure Survey (FES), enabling statistically more precise results to be obtained. The FRS covers only Great Britain, so no estimates are available for Northern Ireland.<P>

2. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income. The definition of income used follows that in the HBAI series for FRS based results; figures are given both before and after housing costs in line with usual HBAI practice.<P>

3. It should be noted that the HBAI series does not take regional price differences into account.<P>

4. Each quartile of the income distribution contains exactly 25 per cent. of all individuals in Great Britain. Due to different household sizes, each quartile group does not necessarily contain 25 per cent. of all households.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In this part of the answer, each quartile group contains 25 per cent. of the households. The figures show the proportion of all taxpayers in the households in each of the quartile groups.<P>

2. The data come from the Office for National Statistics' Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household Income series, based on the Family Expenditure Survey for the 1995-96 financial year and covering the United Kingdom.<P>

3. Data from the FES were used to answer this part of the question as the information about taxpayers was not available on the FRS database. Accurate estimates of the distribution of taxpayers by quartile for the regions and countries of the United Kingdom could not be obtained from the FES because of its small sample size.<P>

4. The income measure used to rank the households is equivalised disposable household income. For a complete definition, see Economic Trends, Number 520, March 1997.<P>

In Wales, the following sites are included in the launch plan: Wenvoe, Blaen Plwyf, Llanddona, Moel y Parc, Aberdate, Kilvey Hill, and Pontypool. It is not possible to provide a precise number of television viewers in Wales who will not be able to receive an adequate digital service from these transmitters until the transmissions begin. However, the ITC estimates that approximately 766,000 people in Wales (26 per cent. of the total population of Wales) may be unserved from the 81 site plan.
<P>

<a name="80121w04.html_para4">Following the completion of the launch phase of digital terrestrial television, the BBC and ITC, in consultation with my Department, will determine how best to extend digital television services to those remaining unserved, whether by additional terrestrial transmitters or by other means.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if the Government will subsidise the provision of set-top boxes to allow <i>(a)</i> the elderly and <i>(b)</i> the disabled to continue receiving television signals after the cessation of analogue broadcasts. [23686]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Digital terrestrial broadcasting has yet to begin and the Government have no plans to subsidise the provision of set top boxes. However, multiplex licences granted to British Digital Broadcasting plc by the Independent Television Commission contain conditions relating to the promotion of the acquisition of digital receivers and this may include direct subsidy. Analogue terrestrial transmissions will not be discontinued until the spread of digital receivers throughout the population is as universal as that of analogue terrestrial services now.

<a name="80121w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Government have no authority to determine which services are carried by satellite broadcasters. It is for the broadcasters, including those currently broadcasting their signals terrestrially, to discuss carriage of their services direct with satellite operators. I understand, however, that the BBC and Channel 5 intend that their terrestrial services should be available on digital satellite once transmissions begin.

<P>
<a name="80121w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The issues raised in Sir John Smith's report do not fall within the Taskforce's remit. Rather, they are matters for the Football Association to consider in the first instance. I have written to the FA's Chairman, Mr. Keith Wiseman, welcoming Sir John's report, and encouraging the FA to respond as early as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 DCMS and its agencies all operate a policy of reusing IT equipment where this is practicable. Equipment which cannot be reused internally is sold for reuse or recycling or passed to organisations which can dispose of unusable products such as old toner cartridges.
<P>

<a name="80121w05.html_para0">DCMS has an arrangement with its IT contractors to undertake the disposal of IT equipment. Its two agencies, the Historic Royal Palaces Agency and the Royal Parks Agency both have, at present, informal arrangements for disposal of their equipment through various organisations. It is expected that these will be formalised in the coming year.

 The new, harmonised accommodation rating schemes, which are being introduced in 1998 for full implementation by 2000 by the English Tourist Board, the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club, represent a big step forward.
<P>

<a name="80121w05.html_para1">We intend to assess the impact of these voluntary measures before deciding whether statutory registration is also needed. We shall do so on the basis of consultation with the Tourism Forum. The strategy for tourism, which I am currently developing in consultation with the Forum, will specifically consider how to raise and maintain quality in all aspects of tourism, including accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were <i>(a)</i> the total annual emissions in kilotonnes and <i>(b)</i> the emissions per unit of electricity generated, in g/kWh, of (i) carbon dioxide, (ii) sulphur dioxide, (iii) oxides of nitrogen, (iv) hydrogen chloride, (v) dust and (vi) other substances, for the last 10 years from each of the coal or gas-fired power stations in the United Kingdom. [22860]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w05.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I have placed the tables which provide the data requested insofar as they are available in the Library of the House. The data have been obtained primarily from records held by the Environment Agency in England and Wales, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. Where there are gaps in the data from Agency sources, they have been filled in a number of ways.
<P>

<a name="80121w05.html_para2">Data have also been obtained from reports published by the power generators, and from correspondence between those companies and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. In some cases emissions have been estimated by combining reported or derived fuel use estimates and aggregate emission factors. Where carbon dioxide emissions were not recorded they have been estimated using the relationship with the emissions of oxides of nitrogen.
<P>

<a name="80121w05.html_para3">There are still many gaps in the tables. For the most part, this is because many power stations have closed down during the last ten years while others have opened only relatively recently. In other cases, such as for many of the pollutants in 1988, no data were recorded and no estimates can be made. Finally, emissions for some pollutants from stations fuelled by certain fuels are not considered significant and are not included in the tables, e.g. data are recorded for hydrogen chloride from coal fired stations only.
<P>

<a name="80121w05.html_para4">Particulate matter emissions have been reported in place of those requested for "dust", as the former is what is actually measured. Gas fired power stations do not emit significant quantities of particulate matter and therefore do not figure in the tables for this pollutant.

<a name="80121w05.html_para5">No other pollutant data are regularly collected for each power station, and therefore no tables have been provided for "other substances".

On 2 September a software problem caused a partial system failure lasting 68 minutes--24 flights were held up for over an hour, and 107 flights for between 30 and 59 minutes. Statistics for flights delayed by less than 30 minutes are not kept for performance review purposes because such delays could be attributable to a range of factors, not just air traffic control problems.

 National Air Traffic Services Ltd., who are responsible for Air Traffic Control operations at Heathrow and Gatwick, have provided the following statistics relating to the total number of flights, and the number and percentage experiencing delays on take-off and landing at the two airports for each of the past twelve months. It should be noted that these statistics relate to flight delays on departure and arrival for whatever reason (e.g. weather, runway capacity, late passengers, as well as Air Traffic Control). A breakdown to show delays exclusively attributable to Air Traffic Control could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the percentage of failures in car driving tests in <i>(a)</i> 1996 and <i>(b)</i> 1997; and in what proportion a reason for failure was that driving was too slow. [23508]

<a name="80121w06.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The percentage of failures in car driving tests in 1996 was 56 per cent. Figures for 1997 are available only from the period January to June because of problems with the computer system collating test data at the Driving Standards Agency. During that period the failure rate was 53 per cent. The Agency hopes to have rectified the problems relating to the IT systems in the near future.
<P>

<a name="80121w06.html_para0">Statistics showing what proportion of failures was caused by driving too slow are not currently available. The Agency is developing management information systems that will allow comprehensive analyses to be undertaken of faults committed by candidates. It is hoped that this facility will be operational from early next month.

 The value of variable speed limits in the M25 controlled motorway pilot schemes is being monitored by the Transport Research Laboratory. The results from their first year assessment, the report for which was released in February 1997, indicate that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) during the first 12 months of operation of the pilot, the scheme had accommodated traffic increases in weekdays of 1.3 per cent. during the morning peak period on the clockwise carriageway, and of 3.7 per cent. during the afternoon peak period in the anticlockwise carriageway, without measurable increase in journey times. However, the natural variability of traffic behaviour had masked any overall reduction in journey times; and
<P>
<BR>
(b) police records up to August 1996 showed a 30 per cent. reduction in injury incidents and a 25 per cent. reduction in damage only accidents compared to the previous year.

Indications are that the pilot is continuing to provide worthwhile benefits to motorists in terms of both traffic operation and safety, while contributing to pollution reductions through smoothing traffic flow.

 We have awarded Essex County Council &#163;1.2 million towards the Colchester local transport package in each of the last two years, with a further allocation of &#163;600,000 in the 1998-99 local transport settlement announced in December last year. Resources allocated to packages for minor works are not targeted on specific projects. It is therefore for the County Council to determine the most appropriate use for their allocations within the package area. I understand from the County Council that in 1996-97 some &#163;302,000 of the package allocation was spent on the High Street scheme. In addition, the County and Borough Councils provided &#163;390,000 while English Heritage contributed &#163;100,000. In 1997-98, &#163;150,000 of the allocation is being spent on High Street works, with the Councils contributing &#163;418,000. The total costs of the High Street works are estimated at &#163;2.4 million.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's policy is to appoint to judicial office on merit those who appear to him to be best qualified regardless of ethnic origin, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, political affiliation, religion or (subject to the physical requirements of the office) disability.
<P>

<a name="80121w08.html_para0">The Lord Chancellor recognises the value of consultations with judges and the profession but has taken steps to modernise and improve procedures. He has arranged that allegations of misconduct must be made known to the individual concerned and has made clear that sexual orientation is not a relevant consideration. He has announced his intention to invite applications for appointment to the High Court Bench, and to provide for appropriate flexibility in part-time sittings arrangements where, for example, women or men have taken career breaks for family reasons. He will increase the upper age limit for appointment as an Assistant Recorder from 50 to 53. He is looking too at longer term improvements, for example an ombudsman to examine complaints from anyone who feels unfairly treated by the appointments process. In the meantime, he will himself investigate any claim of discrimination. He will be working with the judiciary to develop more effective forms of appraisal and assessment for part-time office-holders.
<P>

<a name="80121w08.html_para1">Officials are to develop a scheme whereby an individual can 'work shadow' a judge to find out what it would be like to sit judicially, and a mentoring scheme in which more senior members of the judiciary will advise and guide their more junior colleagues. The Lord Chancellor regards discrimination as wholly unacceptable and supports the joint working group on equal opportunities (on which there are officials from LCD, Bar and Law Society and groups representing women and ethnic minority lawyers) and awaits their proposals with interest.

No other information on this subject has been collated. The Lord Chancellor has no grounds for believing that Freemasonry has had any influence on the appointment of new judges. Judicial appointments are made strictly on merit and are in no way affected by membership or non-membership of the Freemasons.

 The Lord Chancellor's functions in relation to the Coroners Service are set out in sections 3, 11 and 32 of the Coroners Act 1988. Section 3(4) provides that the Lord Chancellor may, if he thinks fit, remove any coroner from office for inability or misbehaviour in the discharge of his duty. Section 11(5)(c) provides that an inquisition leading to the removal of a coroner shall be in such a form as the Lord Chancellor may by rules made by statutory instrument from time to time prescribe. Section 32(1) provides that the Lord Chancellor may, with the concurrence of the Home Secretary, make rules for regulating the practice and procedure at or in connection with inquests and post-mortem examinations. The Lord Chancellor has no function regarding the appointment of Coroners, which is a matter solely for the Home Secretary.

 Following a request for international assistance from the Government of China, we have contributed &#163;200,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) for the procurement and distribution of relief items, such as food, shelter, medicines and quilts to 110,000 needy earthquake victims in Hebei Province. The IFRC are working with the Chinese Red Cross to manage this relief programme.

the likely loss of income to small farmers arising from recent negotiations conducted by the Commission with the World Trade Organisation. [24050]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w10.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have discussed this issue with Commissioner Pinheiro during his recent visit to London at the start of the UK Presidency and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has also had discussions with the Commission.
<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_para0">Although it was disappointing that some parts of the regime have been found incompatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, the ruling did not exclude all preferences for the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana producers. Work undertaken by the Government shows that the impact of the WTO ruling on the ACP banana producing countries will vary according to the details of the new arrangements which are put in place to comply with the WTO ruling.
<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_para1">The Commission has recently put forward some proposals to modify the EU banana regime; these are now being considered by member states. It is therefore not yet possible to make an estimate of the impact of the WTO ruling. None the less it seems likely that the Caribbean banana industry will face rather increased competition. There are plans to improve the competitiveness of the banana industry in the Windward islands and to provide EU funding to assist this adjustment.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w10.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In 1996-97, bilateral aid comprised 50 per cent. of external assistance programmes (excluding administration). The proportion in future years will be determined by decisions taken in our current Resource Allocation Round.

<a name="80121w10.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Efforts to build sound and accountable government which gives the poor a voice are at the heart of my Department's implementation of the White Paper in the Great Lakes. We are working bilaterally and will also use our Presidency of the EU to encourage greater cohesion in the area of governance. We will take forward the EU joint action in support of democratisation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Head of the EU Electoral Unit, Professor Vasconcelos, will visit Kinshasa later this month to see how we might best help the democratisation process. The EU Special Envoy, Ajello, has produced some useful and constructive ideas on governance issues in the Great Lakes. We will pursue these during the Presidency.

 We have recently replaced virtually all our printers and desk-top computers throughout the Department for International Development following our change to the Windows 95 operating environment, and as a result of the introduction of resource accounting. We negotiated buy-back clauses for our old equipment with the suppliers of the new equipment. The suppliers are then responsible for selling the equipment on or recycling it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The receipt of regular maintenance is a central part of the Government's strategy for helping lone parents move off income support into work. The Child Maintenance Bonus provides extra cash help towards the costs associated with starting work.
<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_para3">The Child Maintenance Bonus was introduced on 7 April 1997. At the end of December 1997, some 3,000 awards of the bonus has been made.
<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_para4">Everyone who joins the scheme receives a letter of welcome which explains how they can make a claim. Every six months the person with care of the child also receives a statement giving her an estimate of the amount the bonus would be if she returned to work at that time. Publicity for potential clients is provided through a general work incentives leaflet, the work incentives helpline and through leaflets and posters in Benefits Agency offices. All Benefits Agency offices received a supply of Child Maintenance Bonus leaflets before the scheme commenced in April 1997. Each office is responsible for ensuring that it maintains stocks of the leaflet.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1998 : Column: 559</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_para5">The bonus has been publicised to Benefit Agency Staff using a variety of methods, including bulletins, articles in internal publications and the inclusion of the bonus in various Benefits Agency general information guides. In addition, there have been seminars to raise staff awareness. A Question and Answer briefing will also be issued shortly to remind staff of the scheme.

<P>

<a name="80121w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Family Resources Survey (FRS) does not provide direct information on the number of mothers and fathers who are higher rate taxpayers. An estimate for 1997-98 from the 1995-96 FRS-based Policy Simulation Model suggests there are around 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1998 : Column: 560</I><P>
120,000 mothers and 850,000 fathers who are higher rate taxpayers. The estimates should be treated with some caution as they are based on survey data which use current weekly income which may not accurately represent current annual tax liabilities. Estimates may also be influenced by sampling error and response rates.

<a name="80121w11.html_para3">A direct comparison of costs is not sensible, as the roles that my Special Advisers undertake are different from those of the previous Administration. For example I do not employ an Efficiency Adviser in No. 10, nor is there a Head of the Policy Unit, and some Special Advisers in the Policy Unit deal with areas which in the past have been covered by civil servants. Similarly the figures include a Special Adviser in the Strategic Communications Unit which has been funded by savings across Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="80121w11.html_para4">The projected cost of the No. 10 Special Adviser paybill for 1997-98 is &#163;849,894. The figure includes Special Advisers in the Strategic Communications Unit who like all members of the Unit are funded by contributions from all Departments. The cost of the 7-8 Special Advisers in 1996-97 was &#163;434,249.

 Since the beginning of July 1997, the Government have received approximately 11,500 items of correspondence, many in standard form, concerning its proposed controls on food supplements containing vitamin B6. Of those, approximately 1,300 have been received from right hon. and hon. Members. No separate record has been kept of the number of representations received from consumers, retailers, manufacturers and experts on nutrition. Nor has any record been kept of the number of representations received which oppose the proposed controls.

 The compliance cost assessment relating to the Government's proposals on food supplements containing vitamin B6 is still being prepared. The assessment will form part of the regulatory appraisal which, together with the draft regulations, will be circulated for consultation.
<P>

<a name="80121w12.html_para2">It is impossible to estimate the number of people who regularly take any dose of vitamin B6. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the resource implication for the NHS if the number of people seeking higher doses of vitamin B6 were to consult their general medical practitioner.

 The White Paper "The Food Standards Agency: A Force for Change" proposes that local authorities retain their current responsibility for the enforcement of general food law under the Food Safety Act 1990. The Government are discussing with local authorities measures to improve consistency and, where necessary, remedy any deficiencies in enforcement

<P>
<a name="80121w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Wherever possible, information technology equipment is redeployed within the Department and our Agencies, with equipment being upgraded or used (through recycled parts) to upgrade others as the need arises. These activities can take place through ad hoc programmes or during specific information technology upgrade projects. When redundant information technology equipment can be put to no other use, it is disposed of through a Third Party supplier, conforming with environmental protection requirements. Information technology recycling programmes are carried out separately from those of other Government departments or agencies.

<a name="80121w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Of the &#163;118 million originally made available under the Rendering Industry Support Scheme 1996, around &#163;97 million of support has been paid.
<P>

<a name="80121w13.html_para0">The purpose of the scheme was broadly to replace loss of income for the rendering industry in 1996-97 compared with 1995-96 and thereby to ensure that the animal waste chain continued to operate following the loss of the markets for the rendering industry's products in March 1996. This was achieved.
<P>

<a name="80121w13.html_para1">Support under the Rendering Industry Support Scheme 1997 is based on output of mammalian meat and bone meal and tallow. Of the &#163;59 million made available for this scheme, it is not expected that there will be a significant underspend.

 The outturn figure for spend on prison education in 1995-96 was &#163;36,956,000. That is very close to the outturn figure for 1996-97, which was &#163;34,481,000. The Prison Service estimates that in 1997-98, it will have spent just over &#163;36 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ensure that on-line service and access providers, including telecommunications companies, take legal and administrative responsibility for ensuring that material which is transmitted or delivered by them does not include obscene material. [23578]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Generally, the position in law is that what is illegal off-line is illegal on-line. The Obscene Publications Act 1959 therefore applies to material published via the Internet as does specific legislation relating to child pornography (the Protection of Children Act 1978, as amended). Everyone, including service and access providers and telecommunications companies, bears responsibility for their own conscious acts and omissions and are responsible for the material published to the extent that they are aware of it.
<P>

<a name="80121w14.html_para4">It follows that there is a strong incentive for service providers to act to uphold the law. The Internet Watch Foundation--a self-regulatory body funded by the United Kingdom Internet industry--was established in September 1996. It provides a "hotline" to which anyone can report material on the Internet which they consider may be potentially illegal. If the material is likely to be illegal under United Kingdom law, and it originates outside the United Kingdom, a report is passed through the National Criminal Intelligence Service to the enforcement authority in the country of origin. If it originates in the United Kingdom, a report is passed to the relevant service provider as well as the relevant United Kingdom police force. Service providers may then ask the user to remove the material or cease the activity on United Kingdom servers; or ultimately may do this directly themselves.
<P>

<a name="80121w14.html_para5">I understand that service providers are diligent when they are made aware of illegal material and regularly co-operate with the police in the course of any investigation, for example, in identifying the originator of the potentially illegal material or activity.

 The Commissioner tells me that the cost of the Metropolitan police's share of supporting the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Secretariat in the financial year 1997-98 is &#163;139,033. The cost of time spent by senior officers in the Metropolitan Police on ACPO business is not captured separately. The total cost to the Metropolitan Police of supporting the work of other organisations is not collected centrally.

 There are no discussions taking place about the creation of a combined fire and ambulance service for London. From time to time, the services discuss whether there are opportunities for co-operation, for example, in the use of accommodation or in the provision of emergency assistance to casualties, where a fire appliance is first in attendance at an incident. As part of the Home Office Comprehensive Spending Review, fire service interests in England and Wales have also been asked to consider whether there is greater scope for collaboration with other emergency services.

 The information is not available to make a full assessment of the impact of the introduction of CS gas on the number of assaults and injuries to police officers in London. Following trials in six operational common units, the Commissioner approved the issue of CS spray across the Metropolitan Police in October 1997. Fifty of the 97 Operational Command Units are now using CS sprays. The remainder are expected to do so by the end of March 1998. The Commissioner informs me that between July 1997 and January 1998, Metropolitan Police officers discharged CS spray on 128 separate incidents. In 102 of those incidents, officers were uninjured.

<P>
<a name="80121w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Figures on the number of drug-related crimes are not available either nationally or for Northumberland because of the difficulty of identifying and separating drug-related offences from other sorts of offending in order to produce dependable statistics. Recorded crime is generally collected and published according to the type of offence as defined by statute.

<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="80121w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The costs of implementing the youth justice measures contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill, including the child safety order and the parenting order, will depend on the use which the courts make of the new powers and the effect of the measures on offending behaviour. The Government have indicated in their White Paper "No more excuses: A new approach to tackling youth crime in England and Wales" (Cmd 3809) that it will pilot many of the youth justice measures, including the child safety order and the parenting order.
<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para0">Pilot trials will enable an accurate estimate to be made of the costs and savings that will result when these measures are fully implemented. The financial memorandum of the Crime and Disorder Bill estimated that, depending on how the parenting order and the child safety order are used, additional costs will not exceed &#163;4 million. This is broken down as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Parenting orders: &#163;3.75 million
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Child safety orders: &#163;0.25 million</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para1">We expect the parenting order to be used more widely than the child safety order because the former will be available in a wider range of circumstances. The parenting order will be available for parents of convicted young offenders, for parents of children who have been made the subject of an anti-social behaviour order, sex offender order or child safety order and for parents who have been convicted of failing to send their children to school.
<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para2">The Financial Memorandum of the Crime and Disorder Bill sets out the effects of the Bill on public service manpower. These proposals are not anticipated to have a significant impact on public service manpower. The way that youth justice services are provided within the youth offending teams, established under the Crime and Disorder Bill, will be a matter for local decision by local authorities, the police, the probation service and health authorities. The youth justice plan which the Bill requires local authorities to draw up in consultation with the other agencies will have to set out how youth justice services in their area are to be provided and funded and how youth offending teams are to be composed and funded.
<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para3">It is too early to say how many care orders will be made for breach of the requirements for a child safety order. This will be one of the issues about which the pilots will provide information.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what research has been carried out or commissioned by his Department into <i>(a)</i> the need for, and <i>(b)</i> the effects of the imposition of custodial sentences on children aged <i>(a)</i> 10 and <i>(b)</i> 11 years; [23967]

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government's proposals to reform custodial arrangements for 10 to 17-year-olds are set out in the White Paper, "No More Excuses--A new approach to tackling youth crime in England and Wales" (Cmnd 3809). These proposals will provide for a more coherent and effective custodial framework for the sentencing and remand of young offenders, where this is necessary and appropriate.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 1998 : Column: 582</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para136">The proposals include a new constructive and more flexible custodial sentence for 10 to 17-year-olds, the Detention and Training Order, which will replace the Sentences of Detention in a Young Offender Institution (for 15 to 17-year-olds) and the Secure Training Order. The Government do not propose to change the existing provisions under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to impose custodial sentences on 10 to 17-year-olds convicted of "grave crimes". The new Order will be introduced only for 12 to 17-year-olds in the first place. The Government will introduce the Detention and Training Order for 10 and 11-year-olds only should it prove necessary or desirable to do so; this will be subject to Parliamentary approval. The new Detention and Training Order will provide a clear focus on preventing offending in line with proposed new statutory aim for the youth justice system. It will allow young offenders to be placed in secure accommodation appropriate to their age and maturity.
<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para137">In developing their proposals on the Detention and Training Order, the Government have taken advice from my right hon. Friend's Task Force on Youth Justice, which is composed of experts with experience of youth justice. A summary of the Task Force's advice was placed in the Library on 2 December.
<P>

<a name="80121w15.html_para138">There is no Home Office research on the effect of custodial sentences on children of 10 and 11 years old, partly because of the very small number of children in this age group who are sentenced to custody under the existing provisions.

 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Production carried out a thematic inspection of the operation of the court welfare service last year, concluding that overall the work was being carried out to a good standard. A copy of the report, which was published in November, is in the Library. I have no present plans to ask the Inspectorate to carry out a further inspection of this aspect of the probation service's work, although we are currently considering it, along with the service's other responsibilities, as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> It is our standard practice to place in the Library copies of reports by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation of thematic inspections and inspections of the quality and effectiveness of area probation services. We also place in the Library reports prepared as part of the Home Office Research Programme, an important part of which involves evaluating both the effectiveness of work carried out by probation services, with a view to developing good policy and practice, and the implementation of new policy initiatives involving the probation service, with a view to establishing the extent to which the intended aims are being achieved.

 Table A shows the total number of random tests and the numbers of prisoners who tested positive for cannabis, the opiates and other drugs in each quarter since the first in which all prisons undertook mandatory drug testing. Laboratory screening does not differentiate between heroin and other opiates, so it is not possible to provide figures for heroin alone. Table B shows the percentage of random tests positive for cannabis, the opiates and other drugs in each quarter. It indicates the changes there have been in positive random test results over time. Figures for October to December 1997 are not yet finalised.

 We are fully committed to increasing the area of woodland in Wales and we will continue to offer grant aid and advice to landowners to encourage them to plant trees. For example, the Forestry Commission has recently introduced Challenge Funds for creating forests on bracken land in Wales and for establishing native woodlands in National Parks. We shall also be taking steps to encourage the creation of new woodlands on derelict land throughout Wales. Of course, the key to really significant increases in our woodland area is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. This is one of our principal objectives in Europe, and we are discussing the options with our European partners.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced proposals for a one-off &#163;85 million package on 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>677-98</i>. It included &#163;60 million under the terms of the agrimoney compensation rules and &#163;25 million for Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances. This aid is contingent upon approval by the European Commission and will be in addition to the &#163;1.4 billion already budgeted to support the beef sector during the current financial year. This is in addition to significant funding in 1997-98 for the beef sector. Every effort is being made to have the export ban lifted. Nevertheless the beef sector remains in long term structural surplus and reform of the CAP beef regime is essential.

<a name="80121w19.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 I announced last September a five point action plan for the National Health Service setting out our human resources strategy for the future of the NHS, based on the underlying values of fairness, efficiency and flexibility. This encompasses family friendly employment policies--flexible working arrangements which allow for greater integration of all members of the workforce both in the primary and secondary care environments. These policies are essential if the NHS is to make the best use of staff and sustain the NHS as an attractive employer to people.
<P>

<a name="80121w19.html_para5">We accept that the number of opportunities for flexible working needs to be maximised in order to minimise potential wastage among those doctors who find traditional working patterns too restricting.
<P>

<a name="80121w19.html_para6">A number of key initiatives are contributing towards the need to develop family-friendly employment policies. These are summarised in the Health Department's written evidence of September 1997 to the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration, copies of which have been placed in the Library.

<a name="80121w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government recognise that back pain is a serious health problem and its treatment involves a wide range of services within the National Health Service. Health Authorities are given general allocations for hospital and community health services to commission health care services for their resident population. General practitioners provide general medical services. It is currently for individual health authorities to decide the level and type of services commissioned in partnership with GPs locally and through consultation with other agencies and local people, taking account of local circumstances and national policies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the impact on the number of deaths caused by air pollution of the introduction and use of unleaded fuel. [24039]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80121w20.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) has recently published a major report quantifying the health effects of air pollution. The Committee concluded that current levels of air pollution probably play an important role in precipitating the deaths of at least 12,000-24,000 people each year, though stressed that air pollution is likely to be one of a number of factors affecting the clinical condition of seriously ill people.
<P>

<a name="80121w20.html_para5">COMEAP was able to estimate the health effects for sulphur dioxide, particles and ozone only where a reliable assessment using available scientific evidence could be made and this did not include lead.
<P>

<a name="80121w20.html_para6">There is no evidence to suggest that exposure to airborne lead is a source of death in the United Kingdom. Lead has more subtle toxicological effects, for example on the development of intellectual function in children. The reduction in blood lead concentrations that has occurred during the period when sales of leaded petrol have declined has been encouraging and would suggest that the toxic effects may have also been reduced, though this is difficult to demonstrate. It is also likely that the level of lead in dust and particulate matter will have declined as a result.
<P>

<a name="80121w20.html_para7">One of the measures that the Government are supporting is a ban on the general marketing of leaded petrol in Europe which was agreed at the Environment Council meeting in June 1997 and which will take effect from 1 January 2001.

Decisions on whether equipment within the Department can be re-allocated or sold are made by the Department's central information technology user support branch. Where there is no further requirement for equipment, it will be sold to the highest bidder. The Department's agencies have similar policies.
