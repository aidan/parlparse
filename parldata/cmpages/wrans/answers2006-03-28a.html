 Desalination not been previously used as an option for water supply in the UK. Costs and emissions will be determined by the particulars of the operation concerned, for example, each will depend on whether brackish or sea water is involved; the source of energy used; and whether or not the plant is used continuously or to meet peak demands.

<a name="stpa_0">Projections from South East Water, who are constructing a small desalination plant on the South coast, point to an energy consumption around 4.5&#150;4.7 kWh per cubic metre of water produced, using energy from a combined heat and power plant. The company has also estimated, in its business plan for the Periodic Review of water prices in 2004, that the cost will be around 47 pence per cubic metre.

Felixstowe Ferry Sea Defences and Bawdsey Sea Defences are being promoted with levy funding from local authorities rather than DEFRA grant in aid and are not therefore subject to DEFRA&#039;s priority scoring requirement.

 My Department has conducted no such research. The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. As part of the Agency&#039;s management role it has national and regional water resource strategies, published in 2001, which set out the pressures over the next 25 years. The strategies indicated that a national water grid would suffer a number of drawbacks. These include that pipelines for long distance transfers are large and their construction may be disruptive, and that pumping can consume much energy and add to carbon emissions. The Agency is currently undertaking some further work to update its earlier conclusions.

<i>[holding answer 23 March 2006]:</i> The Department does not collect information on the charges levied by water and sewerage undertakers in England. The Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the economic regulator of the water industry, collects information on the household and non-household charges made by the water and sewerage undertakers. This information is based on the areas that the companies serve rather than administrative counties.

Most non-household customers pay a charge calculated via a volumetric rate. Most water and sewerage undertakers also levy a fixed charge on their non-household customers according to the size of the meter that the customer has. This fixed charge varies from company to company.

 We have monitored the distribution of DFID aid to those affected by the December 2004 tsunami. We did learn of some problems in India, where there was some reluctance by the authorities to allow aid to reach certain castes. This was overcome through representations made to the authorities. More recently, however, we have seen the January 2006 report of a five-country study by a group of international charities reporting internal discrimination. Although we manage and monitor DFID humanitarian aid very closely and have found no evidence of discrimination in the distribution of DFID aid in tsunami-affected countries, we take such reporting seriously and are prepared both to discuss this with the international charities and to intervene again, if necessary, with the national authorities.

A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), jointly funded by DFID and International NGOs, initiated a Social Equity Audit process in response to claims that some Dalits in India and other groups were being excluded from some post tsunami humanitarian efforts. A group of independent auditors have been trained by experts identified by the International NGOs. The International NGOs will submit their programmes to these auditors to assess how inclusive their post tsunami activities have been in order to improve their programmes and identify ways to make their humanitarian efforts more inclusive in the future. The United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund have signed up to the initiative and a Social Equity auditing manual is likely to be produced which DFID will disseminate to NGOs and agencies.

<a name="stpa_86">The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with Head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w12.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_87">The online ordering system enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require. This system is linked directly to the fulfilment service and an existing telephone ordering line. A fortnightly email service to schools informs them of new and important publications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w12.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_88">This has resulted in schools being able to order a wider variety of publications from the Department, putting schools in direct control of what they receive, when they receive it.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many employers in <i>(a)</i> the Wakefield District and <i>(b)</i> Normanton constituency are providing post-16 education; what the national average is for the number of such employers in a (i) district and (ii) constituency area; and what steps are being taken to encourage more employers to offer such education in each area.

 To encourage employers to participate in training, we have established an employer-led training infrastructure that puts their needs centre stage.

In Further Education we will be looking at the recommendations of the Foster Report on FE Colleges&#039; responsiveness to local and regional employer needs and will be announcing our plans for the next stage of reform in the spring.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103">At the end of 2005 we published the LSC&#039;s Statement of Priorities for 2006/07, a copy of which I enclose.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105">First, we are building on the success of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and from April 2006 we shall roll-out Train to Gain nationally to deliver a range of high quality training for employers with an emphasis on level 2 qualifications and skills for life. A key element of Train to Gain will be a network of skills brokers giving advice to companies on their training needs.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106">As you will know West Yorkshire is a pilot area for ETP and of the total number of employers engaged in ETP in West Yorkshire, 12.2% (180) are in Wakefield.

Unfortunately we do not have figures for Normanton.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many 16 to 19 year olds were unfunded as a consequence of further education colleges exceeding their recruitment targets agreed with the relevant local Learning and Skills Council in <i>(a)</i> 2004&#150;05 and <i>(b)</i> 2005&#150;06 in (i) each local learning and skills council area and (ii) each college.

<p><a name="st_123"><a name="60328w14.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2006]:</i> The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) agrees plans with most further education (FE) colleges which they guarantee to fund. The guarantee that college plans will be fully funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and providing confidence for colleges to make commitments for the year based on assured levels of funding. The guarantee means that colleges recruiting above agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding above the level agreed with the LSC. However, there is an expectation that where colleges have delivered higher volumes in priority areas then this should be reflected in their planning for the following year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w14.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_96">It is only possible to determine the amount of learning delivered above agreed planned levels following detailed analysis of the actual level of delivery in the academic year compared to the agreed planned levels. It is not possible to complete this analysis for 2005/06 until we have full academic year data on delivery, which will not be available until later this year. For 2004/05 the LSC estimate that colleges delivered 9,624 16 to19 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) learner numbers above the planned levels agreed with the LSC.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is her intention that parents be permitted to represent their children in the appeal process regarding moves to secondary schools under the provisions of the Education and Inspection Bill; whether she expects changes to be made to the appeals process by provisions in the Bill; and if she will make a statement.

 Admissions legislation already gives parents the right of appeal to an independent appeal panel, against an admission authority&#039;s decision refusing their child admission to a school. The appeal process already allows parents the opportunity to appear in person and make oral representations themselves, or be accompanied, or represented, by a friend. Legal representation will not usually be necessary, but parents are free to have such representation if they wish.

The Bill will strengthen this role by giving Forums the power to object to the Schools Adjudicators about the admission arrangements of any maintained school in their area. It will also give them the power to publish an annual report for the Schools Commissioner about how well admission arrangements are working in their area.

<i>[holding answer 6 December 2005]:</i> It will not be open to any organisation to set up a school trust. It will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to form partnerships with trusts, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders. All such trusts will be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. In deciding whether to acquire a particular trust, governing bodies will need to take account of the impact of the trust on driving up standards and promoting the well-being of pupils and the wider community. The school would be inspected against the contribution it makes to the five outcomes, including &quot;being healthy&quot;. As part of this, inspectors would assess the school&#039;s success in promoting healthy eating. Where there are concerns about the nature of a proposed trust, the local authority will be able to refer the case to the schools adjudicator for determination.

<sup>(30)</sup> Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>

<sup>(31)</sup> The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against &quot;notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN. In 2005&#150;06, Lancashire also budgeted &#163;13.2 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the budgeted net expenditure on SEN as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

<sup>(32)</sup> Total Education Revenue Expenditure is the combination of the total schools budget and the total local authority budget. For the first time in 2005&#150;06 Threshold and Performance Pay costs were recorded gross in the Section 52 Budget Statement which has had the effect of increasing Lancashire&#039;s 2005&#150;06 total education revenue expenditure by over &#163;24 million. Consequently, for comparison with earlier years, the adjusted budgeted net expenditure on the provision of education for children with SEN as a percentage of total education revenue expenditure in 2005&#150;06 is 16.1 per cent. and this figure is included in brackets.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> The data are drawn from Lancashire local authority&#039;s Section 52 Budget Statements (Tables 1 and 2) submitted to the DfES.<br>

Figures are as reported by the LEA in cash terms and rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

 There are two student loans schemes. Mortgage-style loans were introduced in 1990. Income-contingent loans were introduced for new students from 1998, while continuing students remained eligible for mortgage-style loans.

However, borrowers only make repayments when they are earning over &#163;15,000 and those earning less are not required to make any repayments. Most income-contingent loan repayments are collected by employers through the tax system and current policy ensures that deductions keep pace with earnings so borrowers do not become overdue on their accounts.

 The Ministry of Defence has never operated an UFO Project. UFO sightings reported to the MOD are examined solely within the context of controlling the integrity of the UK&#039;s airspace. The MOD does not attempt to identify the precise nature of each sighting, unless there is evidence of a risk to this integrity. Examination of UFO sighting reports is a task performed by desk officers within the directorate of air staff.
