 The ONS has not yet published economic growth figures for local authorities for 2004&#150;05. However, the latest figures show the West Midlands was the second fastest growing region in the UK between 2003&#150;04 after the North East, and that between 1997 and 2003 the Shropshire economy has grown by 37 per cent. Unemployment levels are also close to record lows, and the employment rate well above the national average of 74.3 per cent.

 Since 1998, the new deal has helped over 1.6 million people into work, including 630,000 young people, 250,000 unemployed adults, and 500,000 lone parents. New deal for disabled people and pathways to work have now helped over 120,000 incapacity benefit claimants into work. Independent research has shown the effectiveness of welfare to work policies, with the new deal for young people alone having estimated benefits to the economy of up to &#163;500 million a year, and each additional job achieved through new deal for lone parents resulting in an economic gain to society of &#163;4,400.

 The Government&#039;s measure to achieve full employment in the three northern regions are built on a platform of macro-economic stability, continued investment in the new deal, investment in skills and training, and policies to make work pay.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&#095;population/LAStudy&#095;FullReport.pdf</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">These studies confirmed that the 2001 Census had worked well in most areas, including West Lancashire, but there were a few cases where the adjustment for under-enumeration was not able to adjust sufficiently for exceptional circumstances. This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>

<a name="stpa_10">The Home Office introduced a National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) that all police forces across England and Wales were required to adopt from 1 April 2002. The NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of recorded crimes by an average of 22 per cent. in all forces in England and Wales. BTP adopted this standard on 1 April 2002. The principle of NCRS is that if, on the balance of probability, a crime has been committed it is recorded as a crime. The standard has made crime recording more victim-focused.

 Water companies are under a duty to develop and maintain an efficient and economical system of water supply.

This approach has resulted in a reduction in leakage of around 29 per cent. since its peak in 1994&#150;95. Most water companies are now at their economic level of leakage which is the level of leakage at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from another source.

 Clause 12 of the Childcare Bill, currently before Parliament, would place an extended duty on English local authorities to provide information on services, facilities or publications which may be of benefit to parents, prospective parents, children and young persons in their area. Children and young persons include all persons up to their 20th birthday. The Bill builds on the current duty in section 118A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by section 149 of the 2002 Education Act, to provide information on the provision of child care and related services. Authorities fulfil the duty by running children&#039;s information services (CISs). Many CISs are already making good progress in extending their services. We will encourage local authorities to move towards ensuring their information services provide the facilities envisaged in the Bill, so that, subject to parliamentary approval, the full service is ready when the duty comes into force, which is planned for April 2008.

Their proposals, including those for simplifying funding and streamlining data collection and monitoring, have been well received by colleges and other providers in the sector. We have made significant progress by reducing the audit burden on colleges through abolishing the detailed end-year funding claim and reconciliation for most institutions.

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including those in the children, young people and families sector. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note at www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/docs/DfES%20Efficiency%20Technical%20Note.doc. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department&#039;s Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.

 48 borrowers with publicly owned student loans, whose awarding local authority is in London, have so far informed the Student Loans Company that they became bankrupt in calendar year 2005. There may be delays between borrowers becoming bankrupt and notifying the Student Loans Company, therefore this figure could increase in future.

<a name="stpa_15">Overall national summary data for FSP was first published in 2003 as &#039;Experimental Statistics&#039; and in 2004 as &#039;National Statistics&#039;. However, a background of ongoing improvements to teacher assessment and moderation make it very difficult to draw meaningful statistical judgements about the progress made in Sure Start areas in the last three years. The dataset for 2005 is not strictly comparable with the results in earlier years. My Department considers that the 2005 figures represent the most robust baseline against which progress in Sure Start areas can be effectively monitored. The figures for 2005 are shown in the tables.

 The Afghan Government has expressed its opposition to licit cultivation of opium. The Afghan Minister for Counter Narcotics, Habibullah Qaderi has said recently:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">The poor security situation in the country means there can simply be no guarantee that opium will not be smuggled out of the country for the illicit narcotics trade abroad.

<a name="60302w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_28">The UK agrees that licensing opium cultivation in Afghanistan for medical use is not a realistic solution to its drug problem, not least because it risks a high level of diversion of licit opium into illegal channels.

<p>
<a name="60302w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_29">It is also unlikely that licit Afghan opium would be economically viable as Afghanistan could not compete with countries currently producing licit opium such as Australia, France and Spain. Legalisation is against the approach set out in the Afghan Government&#039;s internationally endorsed national drug control strategy. Some progress in reducing illegal cultivation is being made but it will take time and will take even longer if farmers and traffickers believe that the ban on cultivation is open to challenge.

In financial year 2006&#150;07 spending is expected to continue at similar levels. A proportion of this funding will continue to be specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers.

 Monitoring of the use of UK aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo is conducted in accordance with standard DFID procedures that apply across all of the Department&#039;s programmes. For our bilateral aid, organisations implementing projects on behalf of DFID are required to submit regular, usually quarterly, financial and narrative reports on their activities. In addition, projects over &#163;1 million require a full review to be undertaken at least annually with recommendations for actions to maximise impact and a final completion report, including the lessons learned to inform future work. Regular monitoring by DFID staff, who remain closely in touch with partner organisations throughout the duration of a project, is also an important part of the monitoring process.

 DFID supports the Government of South Africa in three priority areas: growth, jobs and equity; HIV/AIDS and vulnerability; and governance, democracy and service delivery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_56">DFID&#039;s work on growth, jobs and equity helps to access poor people to South Africa&#039;s formal economy so that they can benefit from the resources which are already available (in areas such as land, and finance) but from which they are currently excluded. It also helps South Africa translate the growth in its economy into jobs. Secondly, work on HIV/AIDS and vulnerability helps South Africa to tackle its growing HIV/AIDS pandemic, through supporting a range of partners (National and Provincial Governments, civil society groups and the private sector) across a range of activities from prevention, through care, support and treatment to mitigating the impacts of HIV on communities and society. Following the crop failures and resulting hunger which hit Southern Africa in late 2002, and DFID&#039;s response of providing more than &#163;150 million in food aid, DFID SA took on a new role of developing a longer term regional response to food insecurity in Southern Africa. Work on this, along with work on social protection issues, has been incorporated into our work on HIV/AIDS, under a broader vulnerability theme. Thirdly, DFID&#039;s work on governance, democracy and service delivery helps South Africa deliver quality public services in an equitable way to all citizens. A particular focus has been reform and capacity building of provincial and local government to strengthen their delivery of basic services, including education and health. Our bilateral budget for South Africa in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;23 million.

Notes:<br>

1. An old scheme application is defined as cleared if the case is closed or a maintenance assessment has been carried out. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming good cause or the PWC is subject to a reduced benefit decision. This differs slightly to the definition of a new scheme clearance (see below) and figures from the two schemes will therefore only be broadly, and not directly, comparable.<br>

2. A new scheme application is defined as cleared if the case is closed or a maintenance assessment has been carried out and a maintenance collection schedule set up. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming good cause, or the PWC is subject to a reduced benefit decision, or is identified as being a change of circumstance to an existing application, as opposed to a new one.<br>

3. The figure for other&quot; clearances on the old scheme (July 2001 to March 2003) includes those cases cleared because the PWC has been identified as claiming good cause, or the case has been closed, or the case has been cleared for any other reason. It is not possible to identify figures for good cause separately.<br>

4. The figure for other&quot; clearances on the new scheme (April to December 2005) includes those cases cleared because the case has been closed, or the application has been identified as a change of circumstance to an existing application.<br>

5. Figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to the nearest 1 per cent. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Cabinet Office mandate methodology excludes staff on nil pay, maternity leave and staff on reduced pay due to sickness.<br>

2. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has introduced standard definitions for use in the calculation of all public sector employment statistics. In line with other public sector organisations DWP has now implemented the ONS definitions. The ONS definition includes staff previously excluded, e.g. staff on maternity leave.<br>

3. Historical data using this definition is now available backdated to February 2004, the baseline for the Department&#039;s efficiency challenge.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to her opinion piece in <i>The Independent</i> on 19 January, what the evidential basis is for her statement that 681 defibrillators have saved 68 lives so far; when the defibrillators began to be installed in railway stations and airports; at what cost the defibrillators were installed; and if she will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_137"><a name="60302w16.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In July 1999, the White Paper, Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&quot; announced the Government&#039;s intention to invest &#163;1 million in installing automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in busy public places such as railway stations, airports, coach stations and ferry ports. A further &#163;1 million was then committed to training people employed at the site in their use and in basic life support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_101">In April 2000, the Metro Centre shopping complex was the first public place in which AEDs were installed. Nine further public places (sites) received AEDs, completing the pilot phase of the programme and in November 2002, phase one of the programme was completed. This resulted in 110 sites receiving 681 AEDs and over 6,050 people receiving training in basic life support skills and the use of an AED. These AEDs were mainstreamed to the national health service as of 1 February 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_102">Evidence suggests that 71 lives have been saved as a result of the programme. This information is derived from stakeholders; sites report incident activity to the manager of the national defibrillator programme within 48 hours. On notification from a site or the Department, the manufacturers download data from the AED and forward to the Department within 72 hours. The manager then liaises with ambulance trusts and receiving hospitals, as the download data can be used for diagnosis and follow up treatment if the resuscitation has been successful. Patient confidentiality precludes the Department from insisting on identification and outcomes of the patients so the actual survival rates could be much higher.

 There has been a major improvement in the oral health of adults. The 1998 National Adult Dental Health survey showed that the proportion of adults with no natural teeth had fallen from 37 per cent. in 1968 to 12 per cent. in 1998. However, as was recognised in the &#039;Report of the Primary Care Dental Workforce Review&#039; published in 2004, people who keep their teeth have a greater need for oral hygiene advice and restorative dental treatment. This additional demand was one of the reasons why, in response to the report, we took measures to expand the dental work force by recruiting the equivalent of over 1,400 whole-time national health service dentists (comparing October 2005 with April 2004) and providing for an extra 170 dental training places each year from 2005.

<sup>(22)</sup> Unknown dentists include dentists whose status is shown as awaiting entry or statutory exams. Awaiting entry means the dentist did not identify his or her country of qualification when requesting the opening of a new contract. Generally, these are replaced with the genuine country of qualification within weeks. Statutory exam indicates the exam taken by dentists whose home qualification is not recognised by the UK. By its nature, it does not specify a country of qualification but confirms that it is different from all country-specific qualifications.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Complete new entrant means the dentist had an open GDS or PDS contract in September of the specified year but no GDS or PDS contract in September of the previous year.<br>

2. Data includes all notifications, received by the Dental Practice Board, up to 3 November 2005. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending upon the notification period, for example, data with a later notification period will include more recent notifications of dentists leaving the GDS or PDS.<br>

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) have until 31 March to finalise new general dental services contracts or personal dental services agreements with dentists, although both PCTs and dentists have been encouraged to sign contracts by the end of February wherever possible to ensure that the first monthly payments under the new arrangements can be made in time.

<p><a name="st_150"><a name="60302w16.html_spnew16"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority reports that a time-limited arrangement, agreed between Warrington Primary Care Trust (PCT) and the Culcheth Village Dental Practice, has seen a second dentist at the practice since August 2005. The dentist has been salaried through short-term funding, allocated by the Department in October 2005 which ends on 31 March 2006. From April 2006, the national health service will be implementing major reforms to dentistry. New contracts for dentists will abolish the traditional fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care. Evidence from personal dental services pilot schemes is that these new ways of working free up significant capacity that dentists can then use in part to see a greater range of patients.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether, in the proposed NHS reforms outlined in Health Reform in England; update and next steps&quot; she intends that treatment for a terminally ill patient will be supported by the tariff to be used to enable the system of payment by results regardless of how quickly or slowly the patient&#039;s health deteriorates.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="60302w18.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Payment by results is a prospective payment system whereby providers are funded according to the number and complexity of cases treated and on the basis of a national tariff. However, in 2006, payment by results only applies to acute hospital services provided by national health service trusts and foundation trusts. Local commissioning arrangements continue to apply to services outside the scope of payment by results, including palliative care.

Notes:<br>

All diagnoses count of episodes&#151;these figures represent a count of all finished consultant episode&#039;s (FCE) where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) record.<br>

Finished consultant episodes&#151;an FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultation with one health care provider. Please note that these figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Deaths&#151;HES data cannot be used to determine the cause of death of a patient while in hospital. Deaths recorded on the HES database may be analysed by the main diagnosis for which the patient was being treated during their stay in hospital, which may not necessarily be the underlying cause of death. For example, consider a patient admitted for a hernia operation (with a primary diagnosis of hernia), but who died from a heart attack. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collect information on the cause of death, wherever it occurs, based on the death certificate and should be the source of data for analyses on cause of death.<br>





Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnosis&#151;as well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnosis relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Selected diagnosis&#151;T383: Insulin and oral hypoglycaemic (anti-diabetic) drug and Y423: Insulin and oral hypoglycaemic (anti-diabetic) drug<br>

In the light of that, we have facilitated debate about involuntary automaticity, including a discussion at the European Union patient safety summit in November 2005.

products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are for 2004&#150;05. These show an average approval time, from receipt of the application to grant of the licence, of 288 calendar days. This period, however, includes the time taken by applicants to supply any necessary new or correcting information following the initial assessment of their application. When this is taken into account the actual number of net working days taken by the MHRA reduces to an average of 122 days. These figures apply to all types of new product licensing including products for over-the-counter (OTC) supply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w19.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_127">For the relatively small number of completely new medicines, for example, those containing new drugs and with the potential for meeting unmet medical needs in major diseases, the MHRA, during the same period, has maintained its record of assessing these in under 40 days.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w19.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_128">For variations to OTC product licences, whether straightforward or complex, and again in the most recent full year for which figures are available, 2004&#150;05, the average time taken to approve, from receipt of the application to grant of the variation, was 58 calendar days. This includes the time taken waiting for the company to provide any further information needed.

The Department does not hold data on the number of people prescribed particular drugs but does hold data on the number of national health service prescriptions dispensed. There is no record of the drug having been issued in hospitals up to June 2005, though our information is not comprehensive and might not capture the use of the drug in clinical trials where it has not been dispensed at the NHS&#039;s expense. More recent data is not available due to the contractual restrictions on how data on drugs issued in hospitals can be used. The drug has not been prescribed in primary care up to September 2005.

2. Data for criminal cases is collected for calendar years and the figures in the table relate to the period 1995&#150;2004.<br>

3. To provide the information by constituency would involve a manual review of records. Given the large number of cases involved this would incur a disproportionate cost. <br>

As part of that process, Jan Egeland, the UN&#039;s Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, plans to visit Uganda in March.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether radio frequency technology will be used in identity cards.  [54928]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2006 : Column 956W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_261"><a name="60302w29.html_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 It is currently planned that the ID card will be valid for travel within the EEA. As a result, they must comply with standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a branch of the UN. These standards stipulate that a travel document such as an identity card will need to have a proximity&quot; chip, which will use radio frequencies to allow the card to be read at very short distances, approximately 0 cm-2 cm from a reader. Thus, one specific kind of radio frequency technology will be used in the proximity&quot; chip in the identity card in line with their introduction into passports in many countries in the coming years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w29.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_212">However, the use of radio frequencies in the identity card should not be confused with other uses of radio frequencies in many different technologies, such as RFID tags. While both use radio frequencies, they use different operating systems, access controls and security requirements. For example, proximity chips include a far higher level of security protection than an RFID tag and can only be read at a very short distance. These differences are reflected in the fact that they operate to different standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_213">Furthermore, proximity chips in the identity card will utilise Basic Access Control as a data access protocol in accordance with international standards as well as other cryptographic measures in order to prevent the information on the chip from being modified. In addition, it is planned that further advanced encryption will be utilised to secure biometric information on the chip of the card. This will comply with Extended Access Control standards that are currently under development at an international level.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 14 February 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1982&#150;83W, on the National Youth and Community Service, what the rationale was for setting up a new charitable company to implement the National Youth and Community Service Scheme.

 The Russell Commission report on youth action and engagement, published in March 2005, recommended the creation of a new national youth volunteering body, independent of Government. The report provided the Government with four options for the legal form of this body: a non-departmental public body, a company limited by guarantee, a community interest company, or an existing organisation, suitably adapted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w29.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_214">The Government decided to create a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. This was for three reasons:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_207">1. The vast majority of the 6,000 young people responding to the Russell Commission consultation commented that a programme run by an organisation independent from Government would be more attractive to them.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_208">2. Implementation of the scheme is more likely to be successful in an organisation with an exclusive focus.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_209">3. Full implementation of the reports recommendations is dependent on securing support from the private sector. Private sector supporters proved more likely to fund an independent charity than a Government scheme.</p>

 Operation Trident, established London-wide in 1999, has had a significant effect on gun-enabled crime in London.

population data, and combined this with Department for Transport and other Government transport and travel data. By analysing trends in public and private travel patterns, MVA were able to advise the UK Passport Service on the average journey time for the anticipated catchment populations of each of the 69 proposed passport office locations. The catchment areas of the proposed 69 office locations are derived by determining the nearest convenient office. Therefore catchment areas cross parliamentary constituency and national boundaries so it is not possible, without incurring disproportionate costs, to calculate the average travel times for a specific population group (for example within a constituency) within the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w29.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_217">The choice of the proposed 69 locations was informed by this analysis; the locations chosen balanced the need for ensuring convenience for the customer with the operational efficiency of potential locations given the predicted number of adult first time passport applications within the catchment area. Applicants will be free to choose to be interviewed in any fixed office, enabling them to be interviewed near, for example, their places of employment or study, or to attend an interview in conjunction with travel for social or leisure reasons.
