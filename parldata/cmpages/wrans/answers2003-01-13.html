 Poverty is a complex multi-dimensional problem. The fourth XOpportunity for all" report (Cm 5598) sets out our strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against our strategy. Specifically on child poverty, last April we launched XMeasuring child poverty: a consultation document". We will be in a position to publish preliminary conclusions from the consultation by this spring.

 We published the Green Paper XSimplicity, security and choice: working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677) on 17 December 2002. It provides a framework to help individuals save more in partnership with employers by providing a regulatory framework that supports employers in providing and contributing to good quality pension schemes. The Government's strategy is based on three linked proposals: major simplification of private pensions regulation and tax rules to ease burdens on employers and promote private provision; greater protection for scheme members to increase confidence and help to ensure that people get the pensions they expect; helping employers to provide better information for employees to help employees to understand the value of their pension scheme and to facilitate informed choice. The 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 362W</I><P>
Green Paper makes clear that different types of scheme suit employees with different characteristics and that overall no particular scheme type is invariably better than the others. Defined contribution schemes tend to be better for employees who move jobs more frequently. The focus, therefore, should be on building on employer commitment and emphasising the advantages to both employer and employee of workplace pension provision. The Green Paper proposals to radically simplify the regulatory regime for pensions could, in total, save employers #150-#200 million a year in administration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 About four million people of working age are not working or claiming unemployment related benefit but are claiming another out of work benefit.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para1">In addition other working age people, for example those who are financially independent, students and people looking after the family home, are not active in the labour market and are not claiming an out of work benefit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We believe that if people have the right information and clear choices they will plan for their retirement sensibly. Currently, informed choice is frustrated by complexity.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para2">The Green Paper offers a simple framework to help people understand their options and to give individuals clear information tailored to their own circumstances so they can see how the choices they face relate back to their own retirement prospects. A new pensions advice line and an improved web-based retirement planner will be set up. This builds on the improvements already in train with the new Pension Service which is now rolling out nationally. York pension centre opened on 28 October 2002 and is establishing itself along contact centre lines. Proposals in the Green Paper include significantly extended coverage of combined state and occupational pension forecasts which early research shows have the potential to encourage many people to save more.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Green Paper, XSimplicity, security and choice, working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677), set out our proposals to simplify 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 363W</I><P>
occupational and private pensions saving and make flexible retirement easier, following our earlier reforms to state provision and to financial services. Our proposals will enable people to make informed choices about their retirement provision, building on the foundation of state pension support. As the Green Paper explained, we have already taken action to reform the system of state support for pensioners, focussing in particular on tackling pensioner poverty. Specifically, we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) which is currently worth #98.15 a week for single pensioners and #149.80 for couples. Around 2.1 million people in the UK are benefiting from the MIG now.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para3">From October this year the MIG is being subsumed by the more generous Pension Credit which will reward pensioners with savings, second pensions or earnings, yielding incomes up to #139 a week for single pensioners and nearly #204 a week for couples. In addition we brought in the State Second Pension from April 2002 to boost the pension rights of low and moderate earners and bring in groups of non-workers for the first time. Around 4.5 million low earners will build up an additional State Pension worth at least twice what SERPS would have provided. Two million carers and two million disabled people also build up pension rights for the first time. Also, from this April the basic State Pension will be worth #77.45 a week for single pensioners which is a 7 per cent. real terms increase since 1997. And in future years we are committed to increasing the basic State Pension by at least 2.5 per cent., even if the Retail Price Index (RPI) is below this.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para4">Other measures we introduced include free TV licences for those aged over 75, which benefits four million households and Winter Fuel payments now worth #200 each year for eligible households. Around 11 million people benefited from Winter Fuel payments for winter 2001&#150;02. We considered that this state support for pensioners we have put in place provides the right foundation for retirement. We were not persuaded by calls to increase State Pension age for a number of reasons, including that such a change would have a disproportionate effect on the poorest pensioners. We are currently consulting on the proposals in the Green Paper.

<P>
<a name="30113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We have no targets for getting people who claim incapacity benefit into work. Our Green Paper, XPathways to Work", sets out our strategy for enabling people on incapacity benefit to move into work, and so become and remain independent.

<a name="30113w01.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government's commitment to tackling poverty and social exclusion throughout the United Kingdom is well known. In particular, we have made a clear pledge to abolish child poverty in a generation and to halve it by 2010. We will end the scourge of child poverty in London and in the rest of the UK.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para5">In the fourth XOpportunity for All" report (CM 5598), we describe the action we have taken to tackle poverty and social exclusion. Progress is monitored against a wide range of indicators.

 The Benefit Enquiry Line is a confidential telephone advice and information service for people with disabilities, their carers and representatives. It offers general advice and information about all social security benefits and how to claim them. It can offer advice and assistance with completing many disability-related claim forms and provides a leaflet and claim form distribution service. It will also sign-post people to other services where appropriate. The Benefit Enquiry Line answers approximately 23,000 calls per week.
<P>

<a name="30113w01.html_para7">The Benefit Enquiry Line aims to meet the National DWP Call Centre Target of answering 90 per cent. of calls within 30 seconds. Currently the Enquiry Line answers approximately 55 per cent. of calls within this target.

<a name="30113w01.html_para8">The Disability and Carers Service is reviewing the role of the Benefit Enquiry Line in the context of the changes being made by Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service to provide a more complete service to their customers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of delays in her Department in payments to beef farmers in the South West who have prime organic cattle condemned as a result of the unavailability of abattoirs to slaughter under the Beef Assurance Scheme; and if she will make a statement.  [89683]<P>

<P>
<a name="30113w02.html_spnew9"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I assume that the hon. Member is referring to payments for cattle that are slaughtered voluntarily under the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS). The Scheme is open to cattle that are prevented from entering the food chain because of the Over Thirty Month rule, but which are otherwise fit for human consumption.
<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para7">During the life of the scheme up to the 2002&#150;03 year the published timeliness target in respect of OTMS has been to make 98 per cent. of compensation payments to collection centres within 21 days of receipt of all correctly completed documentation establishing the claim.
<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para8">The target has been changed to making 85 per cent. of compensation payments within 28 days and is consistent with the new targets for all non Integrated Administration and Control Schemes (IACS) payments. The RPA's 2002&#150;03 Business Plan includes its new performance targets. There is no change to the requirement for collection centres to pass on compensation payments to producers within 14 days of receipt.
<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para9">The new timeliness target reflects the RPA's budget allocation for 2002&#150;03. RPA has been given more headroom in its targets to allow it to respond flexibly to the situation and to deploy its resources by means of a risk based approach which seeks to maintain vital scheme controls.

<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 368W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para10">To help offset the impact of the tighter budget allocation RPA has introduced an initiative to import data electronically from collection centres. Most abattoirs are already submitting kill data electronically and work has started on introducing mechanisms by which data can be submitted electronically from both liveweight markets and casualty centres. This initiative will greatly reduce the manual inputting of data currently undertaken when claim paperwork reaches Reading and will, depending upon take-up, realise staff savings which will to some extent reduce the full impact of the budget cuts.
<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para11">RPA will continue to make payments as quickly as possible within its resource allocation. In the 2002&#150;03 year to date 98 per cent. of payments have been made within 28 days.
<P>

<a name="30113w02.html_para12">Regarding the unavailability of abattoirs to slaughter under the Beef Assurance Scheme, all licensed abattoirs are permitted to slaughter Beef Assurance Scheme over thirty month cattle, provided they are willing to facilitate their testing for BSE. On receipt of a negative test result, the carcase must be sent to a licensed cutting plant that is separately licensed to remove the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglia before the meat is released for human consumption. All licensed cutting plants are free to apply to the Food Standards Agency for an additional licence to remove vertebral column. It is a simple process, no fee is charged, and all have been encouraged to apply. None have done so in the south west peninsular.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations her Department has made to the European Union regarding reducing agricultural protectionism; and what research she has commissioned into the effects this may have on the United Kingdom economy.  [86206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are committed to phasing out agricultural protectionism in the European Union. We seize every opportunity to make this clear to other member states, especially in the context of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations and the continuing discussions in the Agriculture Council on the mid-term review of the CAP. A recent estimate prepared for the Commission suggests that a 50 per cent. global cut in protectionism in agriculture could generate a welfare gain of up to $27 billion. The benefit for the EU as a whole was estimated at $17 billion.

<P>

<a name="30113w03.html_para0">I expect further reform to be influenced by a wide range of factors including the need to improve the sustainability of European Agriculture and to take account of its impact on international trade and development particularly with a view to a successful conclusion to the WTO round negotiations. I also expect the negotiations to take account of the setting of a ceiling for Category 1A expenditure for the period from 2007 to 2013 at the Brussels Summit.

 DEFRA's commitment to use integrated policy appraisal (IPA) was set out in the Department's Sustainable Development Strategy, XFoundations for our Future", published in June 2002. It is currently being piloted within DEFRA in a number of selected policy areas, and will be applied more widely in the coming year. The IPA provides a framework or template within which the economic, social and environmental impacts of policy options and their distributional effects in relation to different groups of people can be assessed. It allows decision-makers to:

 The proposal in the Hunting Bill is to establish a system for making case-by-case decisions on whether hunting activities may take place, to ensure that unnecessary suffering is prevented. An applicant would have to show that both the tests of utility and cruelty are met in the case of the particular hunting proposal. It will be for the registrar to be satisfied, on the basis of an objective assessment of the evidence&#151;which would cover any local factors&#151;provided by both the applicant and the animal welfare body, that the proposed hunting satisfied the two tests, namely, that it would be for one of the purposes set out in clause 8(1) and that the purpose cannot reasonably be achieved by a method that would cause less suffering.

 The Government are committed to minimising the adverse environmental impact of pesticide use, consistent with adequate crop protection. A voluntary agreement on measures to reduce the environmental damage caused by pesticides was entered into by the industry and other stakeholders in April 2001. Provided the voluntary initiative is fully implemented, it should reduce the environmental impacts of pesticides and the Government remain committed to this approach. However, the Government are carrying out further work and analysis on a possible tax or other economic instrument, should the voluntary initiative fail to deliver its objectives within a reasonable timescale.

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> We have received no specific threat to British or other foreign interests in Goa in recent months. The FCO travel advice for India, including Goa, was last changed on 13 December to indicate that India is one of a number of countries where there is an increased risk from global terrorism. The British Government are in close touch with other governments, including the Israeli Government, about terrorist threats. Our travel advice for those planning to visit India, including Goa, highlights the global risk of terrorism, including in areas visited by tourists.

<a name="30113w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The area cost adjustment is based on evidence about average wages in each area of the country, adjusted so that like for like comparisons are made. Areas with a relative wage above a particular threshold are those that receive the area cost adjustment. Wages in the Herefordshire and Worcestershire area are below this threshold. A full methodology guide to the area cost adjustment is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website, and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

In 2003&#150;04 SSAs were abolished and replaced with Formula Spending Shares (FSSs). The control totals for FSSs are much larger than those for SSAs as they have been increased to around the level of spending by all authorities in England for these services.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your question concerning the latest estimate of <i>(a)</i> the population and <i>(b)</i> the electorate for each shire and metropolitan county of the GLA area in England. I am also including responses to your two related questions requesting the population and the electorate for each metropolitan district in England and each London borough, and for each region in England. I am replying in the National Statisticians' absence. (90010, 90012, 90011).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Attached are three tables which relate specifically to your three requests. These show the total population and the 18+ population estimated for mid-2001, and the 18+ population registered to vote as at 1 December 2001.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Even though figures are shown in the tables for comparable age-ranges, it is still not easy to make direct comparisons between the population and the electorate data. For one thing, there is a difference in timing: the mid-year estimates relate to 30 June 2001 whereas electorate data are as at 1 December 2001. In addition, there are differences in population coverage. The mid-year estimates include foreign citizens resident here who are not eligible to vote and people who choose not to register. On the other hand, there are a number of reasons why the electorate data may be higher than the mid-year estimates. Students are entitled to register both at their home and their term-time addresses, and second homeowners may also register in two places. Citizens who are not resident due to working abroad may be registered as overseas voters. In addition, electoral registers may be inflated if it is some years before non-respondents to the annual electoral canvass are deleted from electoral registers.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when the regulations prescribing the manner in which the floor area of a room is to be ascertained under section 326 (4) of the Housing Act 1985 were laid before Parliament; and if he will make a statement.  [89526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Regulations governing the measurement of rooms were made in 1937 under that provision of the Housing Act 1935 which preceded section 326(4) of the Housing Act 1985. These regulations were revoked in 1990, and no alternative methods of measurement were specified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 As regards Part X of the Housing Act 1985, which specifies the overcrowding standards, the term Xliving room" is used without definition to describe a room, other than a bedroom, that may be regarded as sleeping accommodation, subject to normal practice in the locality, for the purposes of determining whether a dwelling is overcrowded. The other terms mentioned by my hon. Friend are not used in Part X.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under Part X of the Housing Act 1985, a room with a floor space of 50 square feet or more is considered to be available as sleeping accommodation if it is of a type normally used in the locality as a bedroom or as a living room.

<a name="30113w09.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Smoke Alarms</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment the Government has made of the costs and benefits of making the fitting of smoke alarms a statutory requirement for <i>(a)</i> domestic and <i>(b)</i> other property owners.  [89132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The possibility of introducing a mandatory requirement on all households to install smoke alarms was considered by the Community Fire Safety Task Force whose 1997 report, XSafe as Houses", outlined a strategy on reducing fire deaths. The Government accepted their finding that, although such a proposal does have attractions, the enforcement difficulties were likely to be excessive. Instead, it advocated a far greater level of publicity and education to build upon the significant improvement on ownership levels which have already been achieved.
<P>

<a name="30113w09.html_para0">The fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations in Approved Document B were amended in 1992, to include provision for mains wired, interconnected smoke alarms to be provided in all new dwellings, resulting in new homes being provided with smoke alarms since 1992. This provision was extended in 2000 when, following a regulatory impact assessment, it was considered to be good regulation for smoke alarms to also be provided where a loft conversion is undertaken in an existing dwelling. This move, together with our wider publicity and educational efforts, has helped to raise smoke alarm ownership levels in all households to 82 per cent.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30113w09.html_para1">Premises that require a fire certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and premises that are subject to the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 can be required to have fire detection equipment where this is reasonable and necessary in relation to the risks to persons who use the premises. This was reflected when the Building Regulations and Approved Document B were further amended in 2000 to require new and materially altered premises to be fitted with appropriate provisions for the early warning of fire.
<P>

<a name="30113w09.html_para2">The Government have also recently consulted on proposals to reform general fire safety law by means of a Regulatory Reform Order. These proposals would extend the risk based requirements of the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations to most places, other than private dwellings, and would include provision of fire detection equipment where this is reasonable and necessary. The proposals will be subject to a full Regulatory Impact Assessment and this is currently being prepared.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate the Government made of the number of homes <i>(a)</i> equipped and <i>(b)</i> not equipped with a working smoke alarm.  [89135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Findings from the X2000 British Crime Survey" suggest that 77 per cent. of households in England and Wales were equipped with at least one smoke alarm. 23 per cent. of households were not equipped with a smoke alarm.
<P>

<a name="30113w09.html_para3">Due to the nature of the question asked in the British Crime Survey, it is not possible to ascertain what proportion of households were equipped with a working alarm. However, evidence from the National Community Fire Safety Centre's annual Fire Safety Attitude and Behaviour Monitor suggests that in approximately 9 per cent. of households containing fitted smoke alarms at least one alarm has either been disconnected or has had the battery removed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the formula for funding social services expenditure of local authorities reflects a 20 per cent. higher cost of elderly residential provision in those areas to be subject to the higher differential rate of payments under the Delayed Discharge (Compensation) Bill.  [89607]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The grant distribution formulae for social services have to be generally applicable across England. As such they are based primarily on broad indicators of population, deprivation and the area cost adjustment. Possible payments under the Delayed Discharge Bill would be calculated on a different basis. My right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) has announced that there will be an additional #100 million provided to local government for each full year of the reimbursement scheme.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) does not commission feasibility studies into the re-opening of dismantled railway lines. Parties who intend to make bids for Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) funding however, often carry out feasibility studies and three such bids have been received during 2002. Therefore, no specific studies into dismantled railway lines have been commissioned by the SRA in 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State explained when giving evidence to the Transport Select Committee on 18 December 2002, the estimated cost to London Transport and to the Department of preparing for the PPP, including the costs being repaid to all bidders, is likely to total around #500 million.
<P>

<a name="30113w10.html_para3">The PPP amounts to an unprecedented modernisation of the entire underground network over the next 30-years. The level of bid development costs reflects this and also the lengthy duration of the bidding process, which commenced in October 1999. Nonetheless, the level of bid costs represents only an extremely small proportion of the value of investment that will be delivered over the life of the contracts.
<P>

<a name="30113w10.html_para4">It is normal practice for eligible bid costs to be recoverable under PFI contracts. In this instance, the amounts to be recovered have been verified through an independent review to ensure that the costs have been reasonably and properly occurred and were appropriate for a transaction of this nature.
<P>

<a name="30113w10.html_para5">The Department has sought to keep its costs to a minimum by making joint use of London Transport's advisers, expenditure on which is regularly reported to Parliament, mostly recently on 25 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 63W. As this made clear, London Transport's expenditure on external consultants, including legal advice, from 20 March 1998 (the date of the Government's announcement) to 30 September 2002, for work on the PPP and restructuring of London Underground, was #96.3 million. As a result of the delayed implementation of the PPP, London Transport currently estimate that the final amount should be between #103-#105 million, an increase of between #5&#150;#7 million over its December 2001 forecast. Around #1.6 million of this increase arises from the Mayor's second unsuccessful legal challenge in July 2002.

<a name="30113w11.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Post-retirement widow and widower pensions (PRWP) were introduced as a requirement of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. Provision was made in the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) for the payment of pensions to widow(er)s of service pensioners who married (or remarried) after retirement, but this change benefited only the widows of those giving service on or after 6 April 1978, and the widowers of those giving service on or after 6 April 1989. Only service on or after those dates was taken into account when calculating the level of pension. Against this background, it would cost in the order of #50 million to extend PRWP's to all current and deferred AFPS pensioners. This would be a one-off cost.
<P>

<a name="30113w11.html_para0">It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits from public service pensions schemes should be implemented from a current date for future service only. There is no distinction between servicemen and public sector employees with regard to the fact that the PRWP only applies to those with service on or after 6 April 1978, or 6 April 1989. To extend the post-retirement marriage concession to survivors of members of all public service occupational schemes would cost between #300 million and #500 million.

The assumptions used in making this assessment were derived from general UK population mortality statistics, supplemented by mortality experience analysis within the AFPS and other pension schemes. Detailed calculations have not been carried out due to the lack of readily available data. Full calculations could be carried out only at disproportionate cost.

 The cost of transporting HMS Nottingham from Australia to the United Kingdom on a Heavy Lift Ship is expected to be about #3 million.
<P>

<a name="30113w12.html_para1">There are no plans to publish the Board of Inquiry (BOI) report into the incident in which HMS Nottingham was damaged. A BOI is an internal fact-finding investigation into the circumstances surrounding a particular incident, undertaken by the Services for internal use. Boards are convened to discover whether there were any procedural or other Service-related irregularities, or difficulties which could be identified and overcome. The main purpose is to establish the facts concerning an incident as quickly as possible and to make recommendations aimed at preventing a recurrence. The principle of confidentiality applied to BOI proceedings is designed to encourage witnesses to provide forthright evidence.

 A total of eight letters were received during April and May 2002 from MPs relaying concerns raised by their constituents relating to the conduct of the Board of Inquiry into the loss of HMS Sheffield during the Falklands Campaign. As I stated at that time, I am satisfied that the Board of Inquiry was conducted in a professional and proper manner and that no useful purpose would be served by reopening the inquiry.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> In line with normal business practice, QinetiQ and its predecessor the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) frequently reviewed its estate in order to ensure that it was making efficient use of its property portfolio. Because a number of sites have already been scheduled for disposal, the value of the individual sites is commercially sensitive, and therefore specific details of the information requested are being withheld in accordance with Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information which relates to commercial confidences.
<P>

<a name="30113w12.html_para4">The majority of properties were transferred to QinetiQ on the basis of their value as part of the on-going business and in most cases the value of the property as part of the business was higher than would be achieved through a sale of the land on the open market. These values were assessed by external valuers immediately before the properties were transferred to QinetiQ at vesting. The total value of the land and buildings transferred from the Ministry of Defence to QinetiQ in use in the continuing business was #342 million. Due to the specialist nature of QinetiQ's business the valuation is based on depreciated replacement cost, and this amount was #114 million greater than the open market value. This amount does not include surplus properties held for disposal which on transfer to QinetiQ in July 2001 had an open market

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w13.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Steen </B> 
: To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will establish a decoding card for those serving in the Armed Forces overseas with a digital box so that they can receive BFBS radio and television; and what evaluation has been made as to the merits of providing these services.  [89606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w13.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Use of a decoding card in conjunction with a suitable set-top box would not in itself enable reception of British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) television and radio services as it is necessary to have an appropriately sized and correctly aligned satellite receiver dish in addition. The size and alignment of these dishes would not be the same as for those used by other broadcasters in the United Kingdom, e.g. BSkyB.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 405W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para0">Until recently all BFBS transmissions utilised low power satellites requiring large receiver dishes (of up to 4 metres diameter) not suitable for Direct-to-Home (DTK) down linking. This has meant that local transmission and reception has been via conventional terrestrial broadcasts requiring approval by the host nation and allocation of suitable frequencies.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para1">However, since December 2001 BFBS has used satellite capacity on Eutelsat W3 which enables radio and television broadcasts to be received on dishes no larger than 1.2 metres. As a result, it will become possible to dispense with local terrestrial transmission systems and move to DTH. Plans to do this in Germany are being finalised as part of the requirement to switch to digital broadcasting in that country and it is probable that other locations will follow in due course, dependent upon affordability.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para2">To protect programme rights holders, BFBS is introducing fully encrypted television services throughout the area covered by the Eutelsat W3. To date the Balkans and the Middle East are fully encrypted and proposals are being prepared to extend this to all other locations. The encryption service is delivered either via set top boxes (to single televisions) or via secure cable installations (again via decoders). Access at each set or cable head-end is controlled by digital cards.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para3">The BFBS radio channels can also be received via the set top boxes but in order to provide a Ml service e.g. in workshops, cars etc., radio is normally delivered via local terrestrial transmitters in the overseas Commands and operational theatres.

 All Service personnel receive basic information about the benefits offered by the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) when they join the armed forces and further information, notably a statement of benefits accrued, when they leave. We also provide advice on the AFPS and the financial aspects of resettlement through briefings by specially mandated independent financial advisers. These presentations are not restricted to Service leavers; they are available to any member of the armed forces at any stage in his or her career. They are normally delivered at Regional Resettlement Centres, nine of which are in the United Kingdom, while the other is in Germany. Pensioners also receive an annual newsletter from Paymaster, the contractor responsible for paying their pensions, updating them on any changes that might affect them.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para9">The basic information material on the scheme had become out-dated and was not simply written. We have therefore been revising it and, in late autumn 2002, we issued to all serving members of the armed forces a pack containing a straightforward, easy-to-read new guide to the current AFPS and a short, pocket-sized summary which also gives the current pension code rates, details of additional booklets in the series and useful contacts. The general guide was tested with key ex-Service organisations and with representative Service personnel, and is now available on the MOD web and the internet. It will be issued to all new recruits when they commence their initial training. The pocket-sized brief will be updated and reissued annually, again on an individual basis, to incorporate each year's new pension code rates.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para10">Five supplementary booklets covering specialised pension topics were published at the same time; these are available to serving military personnel on request and can also be found on the internet and MOD intranet. Copies of the pack and the five booklets will shortly be placed in the Library of the House. A further three booklets are currently being written to complete the series; these are due to be published in late spring this year and will also be available electronically. This series of booklets has been publicised to ex-Service organisations, notably the Forces Pensions Society. However, they may not be relevant to all veterans, given the changes to pension benefits over time, and do not replace the information that will have been communicated to ex-Service personnel during their time in service and at the point when they left the armed forces.
<P>

<a name="30113w13.html_para11">In addition to this general information on the Services' occupational pension schemes and the benefits they offer, specific information exercises are undertaken where changes take place affecting the entitlement of Service or ex-Service personnel. Examples of this include information on changes with respect to transfer rights between pension schemes, and on the introduction of Stakeholder pensions and pension-sharing on divorce.

We inform serving armed forces personnel of the provisions of the War Pension Scheme through their leaving-packs and, since the transfer of the Veterans Agency (VA) to the Ministry of Defence, the War Pensioners Welfare Service (WPWS) have attended resettlement events to give advice. In order to raise veterans' awareness of the War Pensions Scheme, we issue a range of information leaflets and posters to a variety of outlets such as post offices, regimental museums and GP surgeries. The VA works closely with ex-Service organisations and the War Pension Committees. In addition, the VA website contains comprehensive information and the WPWS holds advice days and surgeries using a mobile advice unit to reach more remote areas.

Current initiatives include: the London Ethnic Minorities Recruiting Strategy, which commenced in June 2002&#151;a dedicated campaign based on ethnic minority recruiting success in previous years; a campaign to improve submarine recruiting by offering acquaint visits to submarine facilities, and the production of a dedicated submarine recruiting video; and a proposal to use an external response handling agency to deal with the handling of potential recruiting inquiries to improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, visits to ships and establishments by potential recruits are encouraged and exhibition trailers participate regularly in local and regional events.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 31 October 2002, the ONS published experimental sub-national estimates of Government accounts for the calendar year 1998. The estimates show by region (NUTS1) where General Government output is produced, which regions and sub-regions have contributed to Government revenue and which regions and sub-regions have received Government expenditure. The ONS work, however, is not intended to give a complete picture of Government finances and certain aspects of revenue and expenditure are excluded from the analyses and hence the estimates are not directly comparable with GERS.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned a project to identify the flow of Public expenditure (UK and European) into the English regions (NUTS1) and the allocative mechanisms that underpin those flows. The project has close links with the PESA estimates and with the ONS Government accounts work, but is not looking at Government revenue. The project is expected to be completed by the middle of 2003.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="30113w16.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Based on the predicted quantity of taxable waste going to landfill, the total tax liability of landfill operators in 2002&#150;03 is estimated to be #675 million. Landfill operators can divert up to a maximum of 20 per cent. of this amount to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme. Therefore, if all available tax credits are claimed in 2002&#150;03, then approximately #135 million of potential landfill tax revenue will be foregone.

 Customs and Excise's New Export System (NES) went live at all Maritime and Inland locations (including Inland Clearance Depots) throughout the UK on 27 October 2002. NES is an electronic- based system, which enables exporters and agents to send their export declarations to Customs electronically. It replaces the current paper-based system, facilitates legitimate trade and helps combat VAT and Excise fraud.
<P>

<a name="30113w16.html_para1">NES provides a number of tailored models and procedures to meet the needs of different trade sectors. It allows Customs to target their controls more effectively, minimise disruption to legitimate trade and reduce the time it takes to process an export declaration.
<P>

<a name="30113w16.html_para2">In order to utilise NES simplified procedures exporters must apply to Customs for specific authorisation. This involves completion of a form, possibly a visit from a Customs Officer and, depending on the electronic transmission route chosen, registering to use the Government Gateway. Each application is considered on its merits; there is no specific time frame for completion of individual applications. Customs make every effort to complete their part of the procedure as swiftly as possible. Exporters who need to obtain a digital certificate from the Office of the e-Envoy (to enable Government Gateway access) may wait approximately 7 days for delivery of access data.

The figure for 2002 is estimated to be #37million. All projects are run by environmental bodies registered with ENTRUST, the scheme's regulator. All such bodies are not-for-profit, but not all are charities. They may not be controlled by landfill operators or local authorities, but very often work in partnership with them.

These proposals will tackle the shortage of coaches, both professional and voluntary, and recognise coaching as a profession, with accredited qualifications and a career development structure.

<a name="30113w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland have been possible from 30 September 2002 following changes in the rules of the date based export scheme, as a result of intensive lobbying of the EU Commission by the UK Government heavily supported by the devolved administrations. The changes mean that animals destined for the domestic market may be slaughtered in the same plant, provided they are time dedicated.
<P>

<a name="30113w18.html_para2">Efforts are being made by Government to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of eligible animals for this scheme by encouraging farmers to fully comply with EU Regulations on cattle identification and movements.
<P>

<a name="30113w18.html_para3">Officials are also in discussion with Northern Ireland meat processors to facilitate exports through the DBES. Four NI plants have declared an interest. However none have as yet provided sufficient detail of their ability to meet the scheme conditions to justify approval. Until the registration process is completed, exports cannot commence. New markets have to be found, but at present market conditions do not favour exports and, moreover, the GB market provides the best return. There is optimism however that limited exports to premium outlets will commence later in the year.

 Government policy on this issue is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="30113w18.html_para4">Current legislation extends to Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom was one of the first countries in the EU to implement late payment legislation to help promote a culture of prompt payment. There has been a statutory right for interest for late payment for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) owed money by large firms or the public sector since 1 November 1998, when the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 came into force. Since 1 November 2000 SMEs have been able to charge each other statutory interest, as well as large businesses and the public sector, for the late payment of commercial debt.
<P>

<a name="30113w18.html_para5">Amended late payment legislation came into force on 7 August 2002. The legislation fulfils the UK's obligations under European Directive 2000/35/EC on combating late payment in commercial transactions.

 The Department for the Environment for Northern Ireland, consistent with its policy of pursuing research-based solutions to identified problems, is monitoring ongoing research into drugs and driving in GB, and based on the findings of that research will consider if and when action in Northern Ireland is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30113w18.html_para8">In the meantime, the DOE, to create a more effective regime to control drugs and driving, intends to seek NIO agreement to the introduction of legislative powers to enable the police to undertake tests of co-ordination and, when suitable equipment is available, to require suspected drivers to provide samples for screening.

<P>
<a name="30113w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 A wide range of measures is being taken to tackle hospital waiting lists. These include the expansion of existing bed capacity, the development of protected elective facilities, the provision of additional in-patient procedures, the development of community provision as an alternative to hospital treatment and the validation and improved management of waiting lists. To support this action, #5.5 million has been allocated in the current year and the additional #17.4 million provided for acute services in next year's budget will also help to improve access to hospital services.

<a name="30113w19.html_para6">On 4 December 2002, I announced the requirement for massive investment in Northern Ireland's water and sewerage services and the need to find a long-term and reliable funding source to meet this investment need. In December 2002, I undertook a study visit of the water industry in Scotland and in Wales, to learn more about how water and sewerage services are financed and delivered elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Water and sewerage services are delivered by a public corporation in Scotland, whereas these services are the responsibility of a not for profit trust in Wales. These services are funded by water charges in both regions.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2003]:</i> Because trade is a matter of Community competence, the UK has been working with other EU member states to progress this issue for a number of years. Animal welfare issues have been included in the EU's WTO negotiating priorities for some years. At Doha, the EU successfully negotiated the Doha mandate so that the issue of farm animal welfare would be taken into account as part of the current Agreement on Agriculture negotiations, which are due to be concluded by the end of 2004.
<P>

<a name="30113w21.html_para12">It remains extremely difficult to reach agreement on changes to WTO rules to allow countries explicitly to limit imports of goods based only on the way in which a product was made (under which would fall consideration of whether a production method took account of animal welfare standards). Many WTO member states are highly suspicious of the EU's motives and fear that animal welfare production standards will be used as a disguised form of protectionism. This is a concern for developing country governments in particular. This issue is not on the agenda for the current Doha trade round, but the EU continues to discuss this issue in all relevant WTO fora and is working hard to try to build trust and understanding for the EU's

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is part of the Home Office and all its procurement exercises are undertaken in accordance with standard Government procurement rules.

 There are no plans to re-introduce an employment concession for asylum seekers. The concession was established when widespread delays were occurring in the asylum system. By the time the concession was abolished in July last year it had become largely irrelevant and only applicable to a minority of applicants. The vast majority&#151;around 80 per cent.&#151; of asylum seekers currently receive an initial decision within six months of their application being submitted and could not therefore benefit from the terms of the concession.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what Government initiatives have been put in place in the <i>(a)</i> Twickenham constituency, <i>(b)</i> London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and <i>(c)</i> London, designed to bring down crime; and if he will make a statement.  [88823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There has been much work on crime reduction during 2002&#150;03 within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames which has been funded through Government initiatives: Communities Against Drugs (#169,000), Safer Communities Initiative (#54,000), and the Partnership Development Fund (#20,000). This has helped Richmond Crime Reduction Partnership, which covers Twickenham, to implement local schemes such as the development of a youth project targeting those at risk of committing street crime, pro-active policing of suppliers of class 'A' drugs, and supporting a closed circuit television (CCTV) control room.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para0">Across London, Government funding has been provided for several crime reduction initiatives including over #16 million through Communities Against Drugs; #21 million for CCTV equipment since 1999; #1.5 million on Reducing Burglary Initiative; #7.3 million for the neighbourhood wardens and street wardens initiative; #7.2 million for Targeted Policing Initiative, and #9.1 million for the Robbery Reduction Initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he has issued to 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 450W</I><P>
police forces on linking the investigation of child physical abuse and the potential for domestic violence against women in the same household.  [89124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The core inter-agency child protection guidance is XWorking Together to Safeguard Children". It was published jointly by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills in 1991, and revised and updated in 1999. The guidance is addressed to all those whose work brings them into contact with children and families, including the police. Chapter 6 of the document provides guidance on 'Child Protection in Specific Circumstances', and includes a section on domestic violence. It highlights the need for professionals to be alert to the frequent inter-relationship between domestic violence and the abuse and neglect of children. It specifically states that when there is evidence of domestic violence, the implication for any children in the household should be considered, including the possibility that the children themselves may be subject to violence or other harm. Conversely, where it is believed that a child is being abused, those involved with the child and family should be alert to the possibility of domestic violence within the family.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para1">In addition to this, 'Policing Domestic Violence&#151;a Modular Training Programme', was developed by Centrex in 2002. It is a national training product, intended to provide a structured, but flexible approach to the delivery of domestic violence training within the Police Service. Module 4 is dedicated to 'Domestic Violence and Children', and aims to explain the relationship between domestic violence and child abuse and give detailed information to operational staff on this subject. The material has been developed with the assistance of the Women's Aid Federation of England and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and has been widely circulated both within and outside the Police Service for comment and enhancement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Additional funding from the spending review 2002 for tackling drug misuse will mean that from April 2003 all drug action team areas will see an increase of at least 10 per cent. in pooled treatment budget allocations.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para2">Over the next three years, new money will be invested in the introduction or extension of a range of interventions within the criminal justice system and will initially be focussed on those areas with the very worst drug problems. However all areas will benefit from the major investment in improvements we are delivering across the country.

<P>
<a name="30113w25.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Length of residence in the United Kingdom is one of the factors taken into account when deciding whether or not to remove an illegal entrant. Other factors include: age; strength of connections with the United Kingdom; personal history; domestic circumstances; previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of which the person has been convicted (where applicable); any compassionate circumstances; and any representations received on the person's behalf.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para3">Under the Long Residence Concession, persons who have continuously been in the United Kingdom for 14 years unlawfully, or a mixture of lawfully and unlawfully, before the commencement of enforcement action are normally given indefinite leave to remain unless there are strong countervailing factors.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para4">In addition, it is our policy not to proceed with enforcement action against those families where there are children who have lived continuously in the United Kingdom for seven years or more.

 There is currently no official estimate of the number of immigrants unlawfully present in the United Kingdom who are not in contact with the authorities. The Home Office has commissioned a review of methods of estimating the size of the illegally resident population used in other countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his Answer of 18 December, ref 87475, how much funding has been allocated and over what time period for the full time and part time suicide prevention co-ordinators; what definition he uses of the term prisoner listeners; what the purpose of the initiative is; and if he will list the establishments piloting the new health care screening procedures.  [89346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w25.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
For the most high-risk prisons #780,000 a year has been allocated for 30 full-time suicide prevention co-ordinators (SPCs). This money is allocated directly from the central funds. The costs of the other 99 full and part-time SPCs are funded from local budgets, and not aggregated centrally. These SPCs combine suicide prevention duties with other prison work at the discretion of individual Governors.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para5">XListeners" are prisoner volunteers who are selected, trained and supported by the Samaritans to offer confidential support to their fellow prisoners who may be at risk of suicide, otherwise in crisis, or simply in need of someone to talk to. The scheme's objectives are to assist in preventing suicide, reducing self-harm and to help alleviate the feelings of those in distress.
<P>

<a name="30113w25.html_para6">Between August 2001 and June 2002 the new health care screening procedure was piloted in ten local prisons. Of the ten establishments, six were adult male remand prisons (Leeds, Wandsworth, Holme House, Liverpool, Manchester and Durham), two were for female remand prisoners (Eastwood Park and New Hall) and two were young offender institutions (Feltham and Glen Parva). The two female prisons include both adults and women aged 16&#150;21 years. An evaluation of the pilot project supported implementation of the new reception screening arrangements across the estate, and a rolling programme is planned to start in April 2003.

 Regulation of motor vehicle clamping by private security firms on private land will be introduced by the Security Industry Authority, a non-departmental public body (NDPB) being set up by the Home Office under the Private Security Industry Act 2001. The authority is currently preparing for regulation, which will take the form of licensing all individuals carrying out activities covered by the Act. The suitability of individuals applying for a licence will be assessed in accordance with published criteria relating to criminality and competency. The Security Industry Authority will be established as an NDPB on 1 April 2003 and it is expected that it will start licensing clamping operatives by the end of this year/early 2004. It will be a criminal offence to engage in licensable conduct without a licence.

[88699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w26.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are no specific guidelines. A straightforward application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom is one where it is clear from the information and evidence submitted that the requirements of the immigration rules are satisfied. An application which is not straightforward may require further inquiries, additional checks or discretionary consideration before it can be decided. Whether individual applications are straightforward depends on the individual circumstances of the case.

 We aim normally to screen all postal applications within three weeks and decide those that are straightforward at that point. However, because of the high number of applications in the latter part of 2002, this is currently taking around 10 weeks on average. Some that are not straightforward because they need further inquiries or more detailed consideration can take around 12 months to decide, subject to how easy it is to obtain the information and how quickly applicants respond to such requests. We are taking measures to improve this situation and expect to make significant progress towards our three-week target for initial screening over the next two to three months, and to reduce the turnaround time for deciding more complex cases.

<a name="30113w26.html_para9">Postal applications received at the very end of December 2002 are currently being opened and details entered on to the General Casework Information Database. Those received in early January 2003 will be opened and entered very shortly and it is anticipated that the time-lag will be reduced to a week or less by the end of January.

 No credible nutritional assessment took place during 2002. Such data as was collected suggests that in August 2002, 24 per cent. of six month to five year olds were underweight. This compares to 13 per cent. in 1999. This indicates a significant level of chronic or 'background' malnutrition. Under current circumstances it is reasonable to predict that levels of severe malnutrition will be increasing. DFID is funding a rapid nutrition assessment, to include other health indicators, which will take place in the first two weeks of February.

 Three academies have been established so far in Bexley, Haringey and Middlesbrough. A further 21 academies have been proposed and are in various stages of development. The tables show the budgets and expenditure incurred for the current projects across the whole cycle of their development. For the three academies already open, the first table also shows their operating budget and expenditure incurred to date.
<P>

<a name="30113w28.html_para3">Academy projects receive modest funding to develop proposals to a point where the Secretary of State is satisfied that an academy is viable and a formal funding agreement can be signed. From this point, projects receive additional funding to implement their proposals and prepare for the opening of the academy. Once open, academies receive an annual operational budget to cover their day-to-day running costs, which is comparable to similar maintained schools within their local authority. Similarly, the level of capital funding is intended to ensure that academies are built and equipped to a standard comparable with the best in the maintained sector.

<a name="30113w29.html_para1">However, Annex A of the Code explains the law. Schools have always been required to have an admission number for each relevant age group, including sixth form admissions if they recruit from outside the school. The wording of A.45 differs from the previous code only insofar as it takes account of the abolition of standard numbers. The Code of Practice does not apply to further education colleges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w29.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The rules in connection with child maintenance are applicable only to the pilot Education Maintenance Allowance scheme. When the national EMA scheme is introduced in September 2004 the income assessment will be revised. We will introduce a household income assessment, in line with that applied by the Inland Revenue for the new Tax Credits. This will not include any income earned by a natural parent who no longer resides with the student, but will count the income of any step-parent in the household.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much it would cost to award maintenance allowance to those students in the pilot areas who have been ruled ineligible because maintenance from the absent parent is paid via a court order rather than through the Child Support Agency and is added to the resident parent's household income.  [89119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w29.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Evidence from the Local education authorities piloting the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) suggests that less than 1 per cent. of applications have been turned down on these grounds. The total cost of paying and administering EMA in all 56 pilot areas in the 2001&#150;02 financial year was #97.25 million. Therefore, it is estimated that to pay EMA to families in these circumstances, where the joint parental income is over the maximum threshold applicable in the pilot area would incur an additional cost of approximately #1 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the level of education funding in Leicestershire; and if he will estimate the <i>(a)</i> percentage and <i>(b)</i> cost difference between Leicestershire and the top funded education authority outside London.  [88632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The new system of funding for LEAs consists of a basic entitlement which is the same for all pupils, plus a top up for all deprived pupils, which is the same for all deprived pupils, and a further top up for those LEAs in areas with additional costs for recruitment and retention of staff. Where the average formula spending share per pupil is higher, that reflects a higher number of deprived pupils, and higher area costs. The average Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS) per three to 15 pupil for Leicestershire is #2,939 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 467W</I><P>
and for Slough (the authority with the highest average EFSS per pupil outside London) it is #3,828. The difference is just over 30 per cent. or #890 per pupil. The estimated proportion of deprived pupils in Slough is: 36 per cent. in primary schools and 33 per cent. in secondary schools. The proportions for Leicestershire are: 13 per cent. in primary and secondary schools. In addition Slough attracts an Area Cost Adjustment of 13.5 per cent. whereas Leicestershire does not.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many further education colleges are subject to special measures by the Learning Skills Council as a result of unfavourable inspection reports; and in how many cases in the past 12 months they have intended to replace college management.  [87264]<P>

<P>
<a name="30113w29.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The LSC published guidance in March 2002. This sets out the powers and arrangements for intervening where further education colleges have unfavourable inspection grades. Neither the Secretary of State nor the LSC has the power to replace the management team of a college. However, the Secretary of State can issue directions to a college corporation or replace members of the corporation, if he feels that a college is being mismanaged. In the past 12 months, 96 out of a total of 400 FE colleges were inspected. Of these, 17 colleges were judged to be inadequate and will require a full re-inspection. A further 35 colleges will require a partial re-inspection, where some areas were found to be less than satisfactory. In all of these cases, it was possible to agree an action plan for improvement without needing to use the statutory powers.

 We are committed to extending opportunity in both further and higher education. As part of our Success for All reform strategy for further education and training&#151;worth an extra #1.2 billion by 2005&#150;06 or over this spending review period, a programme of Strategic Area Reviews led by local Learning and Skills Councils will help build a network of local providers working to increase choice and widen access to further education for young people. The Excellence Challenge&#151;worth #190 million over three years&#151;is already encouraging wider participation in higher education, and is focused on areas of deprivation, many of which have particularly low participation rates in further and higher education. The joint initiative by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Learning and Skills Council, which will be launched in April 2003, also aims to encourage progression in each region.
<P>

<a name="30113w29.html_para2">We will be publishing our review of higher education shortly, which will reflect our commitment to widening participation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w29.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Work is already taking place to consider the impact should we decide to make any offers of further commitments in education services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). No such decisions have been taken. The Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), which has the UK lead on the GATS, has recently concluded a public consultation on all aspects of the current round of negotiations. The consultation document was produced with input from the Department for Education and Skills and the Devolved Administrations. Close liaison over the education services sector within the GATS will continue throughout the negotiations. The consultation document noted that many of the principal suppliers of publicly funded higher education in the UK also engage in some commercial activity, and that the Government are reflecting carefully on any GATS implications that the current structure may give rise to.
<P>

<a name="30113w29.html_para3">Officials in my Department have also consulted directly with Universities UK, the Association of University Teachers and the National Union of Students to take their views and encourage them, and other higher education sector organisations across the UK, to respond to the public consultation.

 The National Curriculum currently states that secondary schools must offer, in key stages 3 and 4, one or more of the official working languages of the European Union. Only when they have met this condition may they offer non-EU languages. Within this requirement, it is for schools to decide which and how many languages they choose to offer.

<a name="30113w30.html_para0">However, as we announced in our Languages Strategy, published on 18 December 2002, we intend to amend the statutory requirement at key stage 4 so that schools will no longer be required to teach modern foreign languages to all pupils. All schools will be required to ensure that they are available to any pupil wishing to study them.

<i>[holding answer 9 January 2003]:</i> Admission to university is the responsibility of individual institutions, and each institution determines the requisite standards of entry to the courses it offers.

 The Government allocates funding for higher education to the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Institutions receive funding from the Council as a block grant, calculated on the basis of the number of students who attended in previous years plus any extra student places awarded through the Additional Student Numbers exercise. It is for each institution to determine which courses it offers. They will clearly have regard to the demand as they will only receive funding for students they teach, not courses they run.

[88716]<P>

<P>
<a name="30113w33.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology, is the main agency through which the Government supports research on the causes and treatments of disease, including all types of cancer. The Department of Health contributes to the strategies and priorities of the MRC by meeting the national health service costs of the MRC's research (and of charity funded research). The Department also directly funds research to support policy development in health and social care, and to support effective practice in the NHS.

<P><I>13 Jan 2003 : Column 483W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30113w33.html_para2">In terms of directly funded research, the Department's main focus is on interventions to promote healthy living, including diet and physical exercise, and on research on breast cancer screening. For example, the Department is funding research projects with the following titles:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A health impact assessment of agricultural policy, using the impact on fruit and vegetable consumption as a case study;
<P>
<BR>
Reducing inequalities in health and diet: the impact of a food retail development&#151;a pilot study;
<P>
<BR>
Field co-ordination in health promotion linked to the Cochrane Collaboration.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30113w33.html_para3">The Department also funds a programme of work at the cancer screening evaluation unit, which evaluates the effectiveness of screening. Part of this programme includes work on breast cancer screening. There are plans for an observational individual-based study of the efficacy of the breast screening programme. The Department provides joint funding for the age trial, on the effect on breast cancer mortality of annual screening from age 40.
<P>

<a name="30113w33.html_para4">Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on all health research, including on cancer, is devolved to NHS organisations and details are not routinely collected centrally. Summary information about this research is available on the national research register, which is on the web at www.doh.gov.uk/research.
<P>

<a name="30113w33.html_para5">The Department is a member of the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI). The recent NCRI report XStrategic Analysis 2002" analysed most of the directly funded research of Government and charity funders. The analyses revealed relatively low sums spent on cancer prevention, which has prompted the NCRI to set up a strategic planning group to look at this area to see what further research may be possible and what extra resources might be needed to bring this about. The Department will be working in partnership with its Government and charity cancer research funding partners to take this work forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w33.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Many cases of visual defect are detected by parents or family members, others by health professionals in the course of a physical examination. We value and support both approaches. The personal child health record and the XBirth to Five" manual of child health, given to parents around the time of birth, promote the former approach. Programmes of health and development screening checks undertaken by local primary health care teams promote the latter. The purpose of the screening programme is to maximise every child's opportunity to realise their full potential for health, well being and development, and to ensure that remediable disorders are identified and acted upon as early as possible. Local programmes are a matter for primary care trusts to determine and monitor, in accordance with professional advice. This will include the content of and optimal timing for vision screening checks undertaken in childhood and the relative benefits of eye checks between infancy and primary school. I have not received recent representations on this subject but expect there to be active debate during preparation of the national service framework for children, which will set standards aimed at raising the quality of the health and social care services that children receive.

Equivalent figures for heart surgery are not collected in this way but 2001&#150;02 Hospital Episode Statistics suggest a mean waiting time of 124 days for all cardiothoracic surgery.

<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service foundation trusts will have the freedom to develop new ways of working that reflect local needs and priorities, within a framework of NHS standards and inspection to guard against two tier health care and protect NHS patients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The position is set out in paragraphs 3.10&#150;3.12 of XA Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts". Details will be set out in forthcoming legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service foundation trusts will be bound by legislation to have a primary purpose of providing health related services for the benefit of NHS patients and the community (paragraph 1.20 of XA Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts"). Activities undertaken by a NHS foundation trust will be limited to those that are conducive to and not detrimental to achievement of the primary purpose (paragraph 3.5 of XA Guide to NHS Foundation Trusts").

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The introduction of legally binding agreements for National Health Service foundation trusts takes place alongside a move to payment by results based on a national tariff across the NHS, which is designed to reduce transaction costs. The number of NHS foundation trusts will also affect the costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health will provide support for primary care trusts and other commissioners and national health service foundation trust applicants to develop competency in negotiating and framing legally binding contracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w34.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National Health Service foundation trusts will have freedom to borrow from the public or private sectors primarily on the strength of their cash flows. These will depend on the levels of activity that they agree to provide under longer term binding agreements with primary care trusts. The cost of NHS services provided in facilities funded by private borrowing will be governed by the national tariff for NHS services, not by the cost of associated debt.

 In general there is no competition between the private and public sector in the provision of public health.

It will also be highlighted through the New Opportunities Funding for children's palliative care projects&#151;and I understand this funding will be available shortly. Purchasing decisions for health care services, including palliative care services, will however remain a matter for local primary care trusts.

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> The total number of looked-after children who went missing from their usual place of residence at any time during the year ending 31 March 2001 was 920. There are currently no statistics available to distinguish the 10 local authorities with the highest and lowest numbers of looked-after children listed as missing.
<P>

<a name="30113w35.html_para3">Data on children who have gone missing from care is obtained from the Department of Health form SSDA903, a statistical return completed by local authorities for one third of all looked-after children. As these data are based on a one-third sample and the figures reported by authorities on children missing from care are small, it is not possible to produce a reliable comparison across authorities. In addition, analysis on the sample numbers has shown that there is a wide variation in the figures between local authorities-suggesting inconsistency in recording practices which may in turn suggest under-reporting. The figures may therefore be under-stating the actual numbers of children who go missing from care during the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much statutory funding has been paid to Rainbows Children's Hospice in 2001&#150;02.  [88628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30113w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 For the year 2001&#150;02 Leicestershire Health Authority allocated #26,000 to the Rainbows Children's Hospice. This funding was provided under Section 64, of Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, providing a grant to a voluntary group for respite, palliative and terminal care for children.
<P>

<a name="30113w37.html_para0">The Department's view on funding in support of children's hospices is that this should be through negotiation between the hospices, primary care trusts and social services departments, which are responsible for delivering services locally and are best placed to work in partnership with organisations like hospices and to agree an appropriate level of funding.
<P>

<a name="30113w37.html_para1">There is, however, a case for pump priming these negotiations. We expect this to be facilitated through the New Opportunities Fund, which has a budget of

<P>
<a name="30113w37.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> Currently, beds in secure psychiatric accommodation are not always designated by gender so it is not possible to be specific about the number of places that are available for women. Returns indicate that at the end of March 2001, the latest date for which information is currently available, there were 4,847 secure beds, compared to 3,845 secure beds at the end of March 1998. These figures include high, medium and other secure bed numbers and cover all genders.

<a name="30113w37.html_para2">The consultation document XWomen's Mental Health: Into the Mainstream", published in September last year, envisages the development of dedicated, integrated, secure services for women.

The HFEA concluded that sex selection should only be permitted for medical reasons where there is a risk of a child of a particular sex inheriting a serious life-threatening disorder.
