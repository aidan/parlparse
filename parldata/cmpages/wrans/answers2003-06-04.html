<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Between 1999 and April 2003, Regional Government Offices were responsible for negotiating contracts between the Department for Education and Skills and over 2,800 UK online centres funded by Capital Modernisation funding. All regional Offices were informed about the Get Started campaign and invited to get involved. During the campaign, people will be encouraged to visit UK online centres offering free internet starter sessions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to prevent sleep-related driving accidents.  [116024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We are concerned about sleep-related road accidents and have an extensive programme of publicity and research aimed at reducing these.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para0">Campaigns to warn drivers of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel have run since August 2000 and have included leaflets, posters, TV and radio advertising. Most recently, radio adverts were run over Easter and the May bank holidays advising drivers to take a break. These were reinforced by some 190 truck backs, delivering to Moto, Sainsburys, Asda and others, carrying the 'Don't Drive Tired' message over the April to June period this year. We have also recently produced a new public information film, for use by TV stations, to remind drivers to take proper breaks during long journeys.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para1">Advice on how to avoid and combat driver tiredness is in The Highway Code and on the DfT's road safety website at: www.think.dft.gov.uk
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para2">The Department has also undertaken considerable research to study driver sleepiness. The University of Loughborough Sleep Research Laboratory has carried out a series of road audits into sleep-related vehicle accidents on sections of selected trunk roads and motorways in the UK. The results were published in February 2001 in Road Safety Research Reports No. 21 and 22, available on-line at: www.roads.dft.gov.uk/roadsafety/index.htm A report on six more audits is due to be published in the summer. A project to study the effectiveness of motorway service areas in reducing fatigue-related accidents is also under way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_wqn8"><B> Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will introduce a payment scheme to reward local authorities who enable the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to recover unpaid licence fees from vehicle owners; and if he will make a statement.  [116315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is working closely with local authorities to tackle the problem of vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion. Enforcing VED helps to improve the accuracy of DVLA's database of vehicle keepers, which in turn, enables local authorities and the police to identify those who offend on parking charges, speeding, and other offences.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para3">DVLA does not charge local authorities for information on the name and address of vehicle keepers, and there are no plans to introduce a payment scheme for local authorities who provide information on unlicensed vehicles to DVLA. However, those local authorities that have taken on devolved powers to wheel clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles are able to retain the penalties charged to offenders to release their vehicles. Furthermore, the Government are in discussion with these authorities to see what else can be done to help with the costs associated with this initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list for each animal species to which they apply the nature of the legal requirements upon the driver of a vehicle which kills one of the species; and if she will make a statement.  [115712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds. It is an offence to kill, injure or take any wild bird (Section 1). Under Section 5(1 )(e) it is an offence to use any mechanically propelled vehicle in immediate pursuit of a wild bird for the propose of killing or taking that bird.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para4">Certain species of animals, listed on Schedule 5, are also protected by the 1981 Act. It is an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild animal included on Schedule 5, unless it can shown that it had not been killed or taken in contravention of the provision of the 1981 Act.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para5">Sections 4(2)(c) for birds and 10(3)(c) for animals provides a possible defence for the driver who may kill or injure a bird or Schedule 5 animal; because a person "shall not be guilty of an offence by reason of any act made unlawful if he shows that the act was the incidental result of a lawful operation and could not reasonably have been avoided".
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para6">Certain other animals listed on Schedule 6 of the 1981 Act may only be killed or taken by certain methods. It is an offence under Section 9(2)(e) of the 1981 Act to use any mechanically propelled vehicle in immediate pursuit of a Schedule 6 animal.




<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 402W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para7">Under Section 1(2) of the 1981 Act it is an offence to possess any wild bird unless it can be shown that it was killed or taken not in contravention of the Act. A similar defence exists for Schedule 5 animals.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para8">Penalties for offences committed under Part I of the 1981 Act are a maximum fine of &#163;5,000 and/or six months custodial sentence.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para9">In addition the Deer Act 1991 makes it an offence in Section 4(4) for any person to <i>(a)</i> discharge any firearm, or project any missile, from any mechanically propelled vehicle at any deer, or <i>(b)</i> use any mechanically propelled vehicle for the purpose of driving deer.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para10">It is also an offence under section 170(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 not to report an accident which occurs owing to the presence of a motor vehicle on the road by which damage is caused to an animal other than an animal in or on that motor vehicle or a trailer drawn by that motor vehicle.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what targets she has set for the use of industrial crops for alternative fuel use.  [115306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Energy White Paper, published earlier this year, sets out the Government's aspiration to achieve the production of 20 per cent. of the UKfs electricity through renewable sources by 2020. Specific targets have not been set for different renewable technologies and the market will decide which are developed. Biomass, including purpose-grown industrial crops, could become one of the largest contributors to the renewables mix by 2020. Funding under the Energy Crops Scheme is aimed at establishing around 20,000 ha of purpose-grown energy crops by 2006. The Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme is aimed at developing projects fuelled by purpose-grown energy crops and other biomass to produce around 100MW of electricity and the production of heat and combined heat and power.
<P>

<a name="30604w01.html_para13">The recently agreed Directive on the Promotion of Biofuels and other Renewable Fuels for Road Transport requires the UK and other Member States to set their own indicative targets for the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels in their areas. The Government will consult key stakeholders in due course on targets. The Government is promoting the production of biofuels through the existing 20 pence per litre duty incentive for biodiesel and the intention announced in Budget 2003 to introduce a similar duty incentive for bioethanol with effect from January 2005.

 It is not possible to provide separate costings for <i>(a)</i> a cow, <i>(b)</i> a sheep and <i>(c)</i> a pig, as the proposed national fallen stock scheme is based on a cost per holding rather than a cost per animal basis.
<P>

<a name="30604w02.html_para4">The proposed fee was &#163;100 per year for the average holding. There would be a discounted rate of &#163;50 for small holdings and a higher rate of &#163;200 for large holdings.

On 1 November 2002 the Department wrote to all slaughterhouse operators to obtain information on existing blood disposal routes. Analysis of the responses indicated that a number of red meat slaughterhouses disposed of their blood direct to sewer and did not have collection tanks. As many as one third of slaughterhouses expected to have to install suitable storage facilities.
<P>

<a name="30604w02.html_para6">The Department has worked closely with the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) and other industry experts to develop guidance on simple, low cost ways in which slaughterhouses could comply with the new requirements. This suggests that the cost of providing the necessary facilities could be as low as &#163;200 but if more substantial work is needed it could be several thousand pounds.
<P>

<a name="30604w02.html_para7">It has been estimated that the ban on applying raw blood to land or direct to sewer may increase the cost of disposing of blood from around &#163;16/tonne, for landspreading, to &#163;60-&#163;80/tonne for rendering, incineration or treatment in an approved biogas or composting plant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The World Summit on Sustainable Development set a target to significantly reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity at the global, regional, sub regional and national levels by the year 2010. A challenge of this magnitude requires international co-operation. We are working within existing international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to this end.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para0">The CBD reviewed the outcomes from WSSD at its intersessional meeting in March 2003. The UK was among those Parties which pressed successfully for a recommendation that each Conference of Parties should assess progress towards the target. To faciliate this, the CBD together with the United Nations Environmental Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre organised an international conference in London from 21&#150;23 May 2003 with financial support from my Department. The meeting made a number of recommendations on how we might better co-ordinate efforts to achieve the goal and monitor progress towards it.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para1">The Darwin Initiative is one means by which the Department provides direct support to other countries to help safeguard their biodiversity. This grant programme launched at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 assists countries that are rich in biodiversity but poor

in resources to conserve and sustainably use their biological diversity. Phase II of the Initiative launched in November 2002 by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, focuses on enhanced legacy to produce greater biodiversity gains, increasing partnership with local organisations and communities and stronger links to the aims of the Convention on Biological Diversity. So far it has committed over 30 million to over 300 projects with links to some 100 developing countries and countries with economies on transition. On 2 August, the Prime Minister announced an increase in funding from &#163;3 million per annum rising to &#163;7 million a year by 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para2">Last year also saw the largest ever replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which now stands at three billion dollars over four years. In addition to its assessed contribution to this replenishment, the UK contributed a voluntary additional amount of &#163;15 million, making a total contribution of around &#163;118 million. A substantial proportion of the GEF goes to biodiversity projects and within that a substantial proportion to protectedareas.

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk heards being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many beef carcases from Brazil were tested for disease in each of the last 10 years, broken down by type of disease; and what proportion were found to pose a health risk.  [116856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are no provisions for beef imported from Brazil or any other approved countries to be routinely tested for disease. Other controls are designed to prevent serious exotic diseases entering the country via imported meat.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para4">All meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by official veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of diseases. Meat from Brazil must have been

<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 409W</I><P>
matured and tested to confirm that it has reached a sufficiently low pH (acidity) and then de-boned so as to remove any risk of the FMD virus being present. Whole carcase meat and bone-in cuts are not permitted.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para5">European Community law requires that all meat imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks, which may include taking a sample for testing. It is the responsibility of the Official Veterinary Surgeon to decide what type of test might be carried out. These checks ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 To achieve moderate risk status, the UK must provide evidence that it complies with World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and EU rules. Essentially, there are three key areas where steps have been taken.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para6">First, the UK's normal veterinary surveillance and active monitoring programmes are in line with EU rules concerning effective surveillance systems for BSE.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para7">Secondly, the UK has implemented all EU legislation on TSEs in order to deal effectively with BSE risks.
<P>

<a name="30604w03.html_para8">Thirdly, the UK's BSE incidence must be below the upper threshold for moderate status. This target was altered at the recent annual general meeting of the OIE for countries that have implemented active monitoring programmes, to 200 confirmed cases per million adult cattle. The consistent decline of the epidemic is steadily bringing the UK closer to this threshold.

 The carcases, or parts of carcases, of wild animals, including wild deer, are exempt from the scope of the Regulation unless they are thought to be diseased or are used to produce game trophies.

<P>
<a name="30604w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The State Veterinary Service has not required all deer carcases found at Baronsdown Deer Sanctuary to be subject to a post mortem. The deer at Baronsdown are wild animals and it would not be usual for the State Veterinary Service to arrange post mortems on wild deer (these would not normally be examined unless they were intended for sale for human consumption). A veterinary inquiry pursuant to the provisions of article 6 of the Tuberculosis (Deer) Order 1989 would be undertaken only if the information received indicated that this was appropriate.

<a name="30604w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Many industrial activities in Great Britain are currently regulated under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This introduced the systems of Integrated Pollution Control, which controlled releases to all environmental media, and Local Air Pollution Control, which controlled releases to air only.
<P>

<a name="30604w04.html_para0">The Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 were made under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and will eventually replace Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The Regulations implement the European Community (EC) Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) in so far as it relates to installations in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30604w04.html_para1">The IPPC regime applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of certain industrial activities. This means that emissions to air, water (including discharges to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects, must be considered together. It also means that regulators must set permit conditions so as to achieve a high level of protection for the environment as a whole. These conditions are based on the use of the 'Best Available Techniques' (BAT), which balances the costs to the operator against the benefits to the environment. IPPC aims to prevent emissions and waste production and where that is not practicable, reduce them to acceptable levels. IPPC also takes the integrated approach beyond the initial task of permitting, through to the restoration of sites when industrial activities cease.
<P>

<a name="30604w04.html_para2">Separate systems have been introduced to apply the IPPC Directive to Scotland, Northern Ireland and the offshore oil and gas industries. Regulation of industrial pollution in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a matter for the appropriate Ministers in these devolved administrations.

 The government recognises that flood risk management is crucial to the successful development of the Thames Gateway. In order to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 414W</I><P>
improve understanding of the likely effect of the Thames Gateway construction on existing and future flood management arrangements, my department has consulted with the Environment Agency. As a result, the Agency has accelerated plans for a strategic flood risk assessment of the Thames Gateway Zones of Change.
<P>

<a name="30604w04.html_para11">This study is scheduled for completion at the end of May 2003, but early indications are that cost effective and sustainable flood risk management within the Thames Gateway, can be achieved by creative and intelligent planning and design. This will require close partnership working between the government and all agencies and developers involved. This strategic approach also opens up opportunities for significant enhancement of the environment that would not be possible if development is undertaken in an uncoordinated way. There are financial and environmental benefits to be gained from developing the Thames Gateway in a careful and sustainable way, including building flood defences at the time of development rather than later, or by allowing sufficient space for future defence construction in the development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The use of pesticides on crops is governed by two legislative systems running in parallel. Established agricultural pesticides are regulated by the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended), made under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985. New pesticides for use on crops are regulated by the Plant Protection Product Regulations 1995 (as amended), which implement EC Directive 91/414/EEC.
<P>

<a name="30604w05.html_para5">All established agricultural pesticides are subject to an on-going EU review programme to ensure that the data supporting their approvals meet modern safety standards.

<a name="30604w05.html_para6">The following Government Departments have joint responsibility for allowing the use of new pesticides: the Department of Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Department of Health, the Health and Safety Executive (for the Department for Work and Pensions), the Food Standards Agency, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Executive.

 The Government's Organic Farming Scheme encourages the expansion of organic production which uses only a limited range of pesticides. Under the Scheme, farmers moving from conventional to organic farming methods receive financial help during the conversion process. From 30 May 2003, 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 417W</I><P>
assistance will also be available under the Scheme for existing organic farmers who comply with certain environmental measures.
<P>

<a name="30604w05.html_para9">It is established Government policy to encourage farmers and growers to reduce the use of conventional pesticides. This policy is supported in a number of ways including the work of the Pesticides Forum, which promotes responsible pesticide use. The Government also support the industry-led Voluntary Initiative, which aims to encourage farmers to adopt practices that reduce impacts on the environment.
<P>

<a name="30604w05.html_para10">It is also Government policy to encourage farmers to minimise their use of other chemical inputs.

<a name="30604w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU co-funds the Countryside Stewardship, Environmentally Sensitive Area and Organic Farming Schemes under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP). These agri-environment schemes offer a range of management options primarily designed to achieve a range of objectives including protecting and enhancing bio-diversity, wildlife, landscape, historic environment and access. Some of these Schemes do place restrictions on the use of pesticides where it is necessary to achieve these objectives. Agreements are however, not offered solely for the non-use of pesticides.

 Defra provides grant aid on capital flood and coastal defence projects that meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the cost to farmers of non-availability of strychnine hydrochloride; what representations she has received from the farming industry on its availability; what research she has commissioned on alternative poisons for farming pest control; and if she will make a statement on future supplies of strychnine hydrochloride.

<a name="30604w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra first became aware of difficulties obtaining strychnine hydrochloride in early February when a number of regular users contacted Defra's Rural Development Service who are responsible for authorising use of this compound to control mole infestations. Enquiries by my officials revealed that the difficulties had arisen due to a shortage of raw material experienced by the supplier used by many pharmacies. An alternative supplier, who gave assurances that they were able to meet demands, was identified and contact details were posted on the Defra website in early March (www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates/strychnine-shortage.htm).
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para8">Furthermore, to ease difficulties obtaining strychnine, Defra temporarily suspended the practice of specifying a named pharmacist on the permit to purchase strychnine (Form LP10). This change, which remains in force, enables authorised permit holders to purchase strychnine from any pharmacist with stocks of the compound.
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para9">In view of the temporary nature of the shortages, an assessment of the cost to farmers was considered unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para10">Representations were received from regular users, including pest controllers and farmers.
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para11">Aluminium phosphide is also approved for use as an alternative for mole control. In the past the Department has commissioned work on a further alternative preparation, micro-encapsulated bromoform. This preparation has not been through the approvals process and it is not considered appropriate for the Department to pay for such registration costs.
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para12">Defra has recently asked the Central Science Laboratory to undertake a review of the range of mole control methods which exist across the EU. The aim of this review is to produce guidance to UK interests on the most humane and effective methods of mole control which are currently available.
<P>

<a name="30604w06.html_para13">As far as I am aware, strychnine hydrochloride is currently available from pharmacies, and there have been no recent enquiries reporting shortages. I am unable to comment on the long-term availability of this compound, as this is a matter for the importers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w07.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]:</i> The Competition Commission's reasoning for not allowing veterinary surgeons to charge for prescriptions over the next three years is set out in paragraphs 2.169 to 2.173 of volume I of the report. The Commission stated in the report that if it was concerned simply to establish the correct market price for prescriptions then it might be reasonable to leave vets to set their own prices and then rely on the market. The Commission reasoned that prescription charges have a major impact on competition with pharmacies, as vets are able to set the charges so as to deter clients from asking for prescriptions. In that way, they can influence the terms of competition with pharmacies to their own advantage. The Commission's view is that the three-year period of writing prescriptions at no additional charge is necessary in order to ensure that charges will not deter animal owners from obtaining written prescriptions and making use of pharmacies.

<a name="30604w07.html_para6">The Commission, in its report, fully accepted that the supply of prescription-only veterinary medicines raises issues that go wider than competition and that the public interest includes protection of public safety and animal welfare.

 Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on 1 October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools now need the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose of a playing field or any part of a playing field. Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that they meet the published criteria and, in particular, that any proceeds will be used to improve school sports provision or education facilities.

 The UK government has been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. In particular, the UK is seeking agreement that additional bilateral voluntary debt relief 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 430W</I><P>
should be excluded from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point in the HIPC initiative, and this rule change could provide a further US $1 billion in debt relief to HIPCs. The UK is also seeking to explore further options to address the issues of creditor litigation within the enhanced HIPC initiative. While the initiative does not alter the legal rights and obligations between HIPCs and their external creditors the UK believes that an adequate HIPC legal defence is still essential in reaching fair and equitable settlements with some creditors. More detail on the steps taken by the IMF and World Bank to encourage creditor participation and the status of commitments on HIPC from the G7 Kananaskis Summit, can be found in the September 2002 HIPC Status of Implementation Report and the March 2003 HIPC Initiative&#151;Statistical Update. Both are available from the World Bank Website www.worldbank.orq/hipc.
<P>

<a name="30604w09.html_para1">On March 12, 2003, the Executive Board of the IMF paper discussed creditor participation issues in the HIPC initiative. The Public Information Notice issued by the IMF on April 3, 2003, for this meeting reported the discussion between Directors on the issue of HIPC-to-HIPC debt:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"On HIPC-to-HIPC debt relief, Directors took note of the fact that these claims are concentrated in a few HIPC creditors, and that some creditors have already made commitments to deliver their share of debt relief under the Initiative. Directors agreed that, where resolution of such outstanding claims is hindered by technical issues, the staff should be ready to provide technical assistance when requested by both parties, to help HIPC creditors and debtors themselves resolve these outstanding technical disputes.
<P>
<BR>
Many Directors welcomed the proposal of the World Bank staff to establish and administer a trust fund to channel donor assistance to finance HIPC-to-HIPC debt relief. They agreed that such a trust fund should be used in cases where HIPC creditors are unable to deliver their share of HIPC relief owing to financial constraints, in accordance with the principles and conditions set out by individual donors. Others, however, questioned the need for such a fund given the small size of HIPC-to-HIPC debt and the existence of moral hazard issues."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30604w09.html_para2">The full text of this Public Information Notice is available from the IMF website www. imf.org/external/news.htm. With respect to tax incentives for creditors taking part in the HIPC initiative, corporate loan creditors can already claim relief under the loan relationships regime for losses on the release of debt owed by HIPC countries. The Inland Revenue is not aware of any non-corporate loan creditors.
<P>

<a name="30604w09.html_para3">While the UK continues to work hard to promote the HIPC initiative the Government acknowledges that debt relief is not a panacea for broader economic development problems; even the provision of 100 per cent. debt relief to all low-income countries would still fall short of the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals. That is why the Chancellor has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that would seek to double the amount of development aid from just over US$50 billion a year today to $100 billion per year in the years to 2015.

<P>

<a name="30604w10.html_para0">DFID supports an integrated approach to sanitation, water supply, and hygiene to improve health and combat poverty. Expenditure on specific water sector or related projects and programmes has remained roughly constant over the past three years; estimated at &#163;82 million in 1999&#150;2000, &#163;91 million in 2000&#150;01 and &#163;87 million in 2001&#150;02. However, DFID's budget allocation is managed on a country rather than sector basis; our recent departmental report 2003 provides this information.
<P>

<a name="30604w10.html_para1">The work DFID does has regard to what other donors are doing, and to our comparative advantage. In the water sector we have developed a role focused on improving policy. The provision of direct budget support (&#163;296 million in 2001&#150;02) rather than funding projects has given us this leverage, particularly in Africa. A small proportion of the budget allocated through direct budget support may go directly to the water sector, but the main contribution of budget support to meeting the water/sanitation MDGs is through improvements in public sector capacity and governance. We continue to push for the inclusion of sanitation, water supply and hygiene in individual country Poverty Reduction Strategies Papers (PRSPs).
<P>

<a name="30604w10.html_para2">DFID also provides funds, which may include spending on water, through a number of multilateral channels.

The UN, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, is examining how to take this forward, including whether to deploy UN human rights monitors. We aim to work closely with the Special Representative.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2003]:</i> At present, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) staff are spread over 15 sites across the United Kingdom. Continuing with this level of dispersion will ultimately degrade DSTL's effectiveness and long-term viability. The split of the former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency has resulted in DSTL being left with many capabilities that are supported by small teams or individuals. If we are to preserve and develop these capabilities effectively then we need a degree of consolidation to exploit their synergies, achieve critical mass and sustain their technical excellence. We also know that, despite everything that information technology can do, there are enormous gains in communication and knowledge-sharing when people actually work together in the same or adjoining buildings. In addition, career development is much easier when people do not have to uproot themselves simply in order to work in a different technical area. Additionally, there are financial considerations. As a Government agency, DSTL is publicly accountable for how it uses taxpayers' assets and money. In anything but the short term the additional costs imposed by the current level of dispersion are considerable. These costs will inevitably divert funds from more productive uses in maintaining and developing facilities and delivering better quality science for the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="30604w12.html_para3">To address these issues, DSTL intends to move its staff onto three core sites at Fort Halstead, Porton Down and Portsdown Main. This was announced in July 2002 and hon. Members whose constituencies were affected were written to at the time explaining this decision. The site rationalisation plan commenced in August 2002 and it is intended to be completed by late 2006. It will involve the relocation of approximately 1,600 staff during this timeframe. The moves will ultimately reduce the fragmentation of the science and technology base of DSTL, bringing together like capabilities and reducing overheads and duplication of support functions in the organisation. This will ensure that DSTL can sustain long-term capability whilst 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 443W</I><P>
providing an improved career structure for staff. While there is a possible risk that relocation will have a short-term impact that could affect capability in some areas, any effects will be more than outweighed by the significant long-term advantages these changes will produce. The relocation of the four staff currently employed at DSTL Dunfermline is part of the DSTL site rationalisation plan.
<P>

<a name="30604w12.html_para4">The investment appraisal conducted by DSTL to support the site rationalisation plan was independently reviewed and agreed by the MOD Senior Economic Adviser. This work considered both the costs of re-provision of facilities and staff transfer. Staff will be eligible for support under the DSTL relocation procedures and the specific application of the procedures will be discussed on an individual basis taking into account personal commitments. The costs associated with the housing of staff who intend to relocate to the core DSTL sites will depend on the personal circumstances of the individuals but the organisation estimates an average cost of &#163;27,000.
<P>

<a name="30604w12.html_para5">DSTL uses the planned goals and objectives of the laboratory to identify the career and personal development requirements for its staff. The career aspirations and personal development needs are obviously specific to individuals and determined by their own personal development plans and all staff in the organisation, regardless of their location, are given equal opportunity to undertake appropriate training and development to deliver the organisation's objectives. Costs for career and personal development are not determined on a per capita basis and depend on the individual's training and development needs. DSTL always looks to develop the talents and capabilities of its current staff and would look to existing staff to fill any vacancies created by the loss of DSTL Dunfermline staff from within the organisation. DSTL does not therefore envisage a significant increase in such costs attributable to their relocation plans. It currently has a relatively low annual turnover of staff and has an effective recruitment and training strategy, recruiting over 100 science graduates each year. Two of the four members of staff based at DSTL Dunfermline are within five years of normal retirement and succession plans and the associated costs to train staff to replace them are required regardless of any individual's intention to relocate.
<P>

<a name="30604w12.html_para6">Finally, it has to be recognised that as a result of the split of DERA some moves are unavoidable. On those sites owned by QinetiQ, DSTL only has assured tenancy for a fixed period. Rather than embarking on a number of relocations as each lease expires that would place the organisation into a long-running series of moves, which would cause continuing disruption to staff and delay the benefits arising from rationalisation, it has been decided that a single plan that covers all sites should be adopted. The current lease at DSTL Dunfermline is for a period of five years, ending 12 August 2006. However the other members of their technical group, which is currently based in Farnborough, will be relocating to Porton Down in the final quarter of 2003 and the intention is to consolidate the technical team at Porton Down as soon as is practicable.

 The Ministry of Defence's advertising and publicity expenditure in 2001&#150;02 was published in the annual Departmental Performance Report, broken down into categories of RN, Army, RAF and civilian recruitment, PR, marketing and business support services, Chief of PR, sales promotion, scholarships and National Employers' Liaison Committee.

 <i>[holding answer 28 April 2003]:</i> As at 20 May 2003, Coalition forces had initiated investigations into 99 sites within Iraq which may be connected to programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction. Investigations have been initiated into a further 53 sites identified since the conflict began.

<a name="30604w13.html_para4">Such sites are only one potential form of evidence. Others forms of evidence could include samples of chemical or biological agents, delivery systems, documentation or interviews with relevant Iraqi personnel. Coalition forces have identified materials which may be related to Iraqi programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction, including vehicles which appear to match descriptions of mobile biological agent production facilities in the document "Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction" published on 24 September 2002, and as presented to the United Nations Security Council by the United States Secretary of State.

 As part of routine demobilization procedures, members of the reserve forces returning from any operation undergo a routine medical assessment prior to their release from full-time service. The assessment, which is carried out by medical staff, includes the completion of a health declaration by the individual, the listing of any exposures to environmental or industrial hazards, and a medical check including blood pressure measurement, urinalysis and audiometry. All personnel should be offered a consultation with a medical officer at the time of the assessment. Where medical concerns are identified that require further evaluation, medical staff will ensure that suitable arrangements are made. This may include passing information to the individual's civilian GP, having first obtained consent from the individual.

 RAF Woodvale is the home to Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron (MASUAS), Liverpool University Air Squadron (LUAS) and No. 10 Air Experience Flight (AEF). Both University Air Squadrons at RAF Woodvale train undergraduate student pilots according to the Elementary Flying Training syllabus, which, during a student's time at university, provides them with general handling, instrument flying, formation and navigation. Ex-UAS student pilots are then able to enter the RAF at a stage where they can be streamed and selected for fast jet, helicopter or multi-engine aircraft. The AEF provides air experience for air cadet members of the Air Training Corps and RAF sections of the College Cadet Force.

There was also an internal publicity drive to encourage staff to register both private and family members' phones. This marketing drive also explored links with external community partners and consequently a substantial number of mobile phones owned by East Sussex County Council, Brighton and Hove Council and West Sussex County Council have been registered.

<a name="30604w16.html_para13">I further understand that, on the basis that some 700,000 people in the county have mobile phones, the force estimated that approximately 300,000 people would register for the Phase two text message service. It conducted its largest ever leaflet distribution campaign, in conjunction with Neighbourhood Watch, which resulted in some 15,000 people registering initially. This number may since have increased.

<a name="30604w17.html_para2">Following the Stewart Report on mobile phones and health, we asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to look at the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology used by Airwave. Their report, prepared by the NRPB's independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation, was published in July 2001. It concluded that, "Although areas of uncertainty remain about the biological effects of low level Radio Frequency radiation in general, including modulated signals, current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features of the signals from TETRA mobile terminals and repeaters pose a hazard to health".
<P>

<a name="30604w17.html_para3">The report recommended further research to address remaining areas of uncertainty. We are taking this forward with a comprehensive programme of work, which has found no adverse health effects so far. As part of this programme, the Home Office has commissioned a national health monitoring study of Airwave police users. Regular updates are available on the Home Office website http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html.
<P>

<a name="30604w17.html_para4">Advice to planning authorities about radio masts is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and is supported by the ODPM Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development. No minimal distance from TETRA masts residential properties is recommended. The rule is that international guidelines on energy levels received from the mast should be met in areas accessible to the public. Independent checks of Airwave base stations have shown that these energy levels are hundreds of times less than the guidelines. As the service rolls out the location of TETRA masts within the Airwave service will be available on the "Sitefinder" database managed by the Radiocommunications Agency.

 Quality is the foundation of a successful and competitive tourism industry and must include a variety of good quality accommodation that meets visitor expectations, both in terms of facilities and service. We want to ensure that the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) schemes: meet the needs of and are easily understood by visitors; attract a very high proportion of accommodation providers; and encourage continuous improvement in standards. There has been no change of tourism policy in this respect from what was published in Tomorrow's Tourism (1999).
<P>

<a name="30604w18.html_para6">We have not conducted a formal assessment of the accommodation schemes but are determined to increase both industry take up and consumer recognition of the schemes. However, recent research by the (former) ETC has shown that membership of a quality grading scheme brings benefits to participants in terms of higher occupancy levels: 13 per cent. difference in higher occupancy levels between those who are members of the national, harmonised grading scheme and those who do not participate.

The group will examine the differences that exist between the schemes for hotels and guest accommodation in each country, with its main aim being to reach a view on whether common schemes are feasible and would be more readily understood by consumers.
<P>

<a name="30604w18.html_para9">Good progress on common Great Britain schemes has already been made in respect of quality assurance schemes for non-serviced accommodation, for instance self-catering, Hostels and Campus accommodation. The national Boards have agreed that research and consultation in relation to the self-catering scheme should commence during the summer of 2003. This part of the review will also include consideration of the effectiveness of the symbols used to indicate scheme membership and how we could reduce the proliferation of signs and logos that are currently displayed. The review will consider consumer and industry views of the value of the quality assurance schemes, the scheme's effectiveness and value for money of scheme membership.

 We are confident that any changes made to the current accommodation schemes, which will take three years to implement from the consumer perspective, will be cost-effective as well as increasing clarity and benefiting business. Any costs relating to inspections to any new standards will be minimal, as they will fit in with the established annual timetable.
<P>

<a name="30604w18.html_para11">Replacement signage, if required, is in any case optional and should benefit business in view of the greater clarity we are aiming to achieve.

 Preliminary assessments of the impact of Olympic Lottery games have been provided by Camelot, and reviewed by the National Lottery Commission. These estimates suggest that any negative impact on income to the existing good causes would be small&#151;four per cent. for the remainder of the Camelot licence period, until 2009. It is possible that should additional funding be required the impact may rise to 11 per cent. between 2009&#150;12. However, Olympic Lottery games have the potential to invigorate interest in the Lottery in general and in that way may benefit all the existing good causes.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many <i>(a)</i> early retirements and <i>(b)</i> ill-health retirements there were as a percentage of the total workforce in (i) the Audit Commission and (ii) the average local authority in England in the last year for which figures are available.  [115496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 During the year to 31 October 2002 (the end of the Audit Commission's last complete financial year), the percentage of Commission staff who retired early was 0.1 per cent. of staff employed. There were no retirements on the grounds of ill-health. Between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2002 the average percentages of staff of English local authorities retiring early and because of ill-health were 0.7 per cent. and 0.5 per cent. respectively.

<P>
<a name="30604w21.html_wqn6"><B> John Cryer: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether term-time workers in education are deemed unemployed and able to claim jobseeker's allowance during unpaid holidays, for the purposes of calculation of their hourly rate.  [116693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w21.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Jobseeker's Allowance is paid to support people who are available for and actively seeking employment and who are not engaged in remunerative work of 16 hours or more a week. For people who have regular breaks in their employment, like term-time workers, whether or not they are engaged in remunerative work depends on the average number of paid hours that they work each week. The average is calculated over the whole cycle of their work&#151;which for term-time workers is the full year, including both terms and holidays. If this average is under 16 hours a week, term-time workers may be entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance, provided they meet the other conditions for entitlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w21.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our view is that the most appropriate form of help for low-paid term-time workers is through in-work support. The introduction of the Working Tax Credit in April has improved and extended the provision of in-work support, and there are specific provisions to ensure that term-time workers1 pattern of work is taken into account for the Working Tax Credit.

<P>
<a name="30604w22.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) if he will make a statement on the factors underlying the Government's decision not to make a statement on widowers' pensions to the European Court of Human Rights on 15 May;  [116294]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans the Government has to settle widowers' claims to benefits predating 9 April 2001.  [116808]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w22.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Before April 2001, there was no statutory basis to make payments of widow's benefits to men. The Government, in introducing its reform of support in bereavement from April 2001, said, following earlier findings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) that similar cases were admissible, that its obligation was to future widowers. The reforms of 2001 met that obligation and went further by making the new Widowed Parent's Allowance available to existing widowers from its introduction.




<P>
<P><I>4 Jun 2003 : Column 485W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30604w22.html_para2">In June 2002, the European Court of Human Rights found that the UK Government had violated the Convention in respect of Mr Kevin Willis by not paying him the Widowed Mother's Allowance and Widow's Payment that he would have been entitled to h.ad he been a woman in the same circumstances. The Court ordered a payment equivalent to the benefit that he would have received had he been a woman and an amount in respect of interest. The Government is not contesting that judgement.
<P>

<a name="30604w22.html_para3">The Court did not consider the question of widow's pension and litigation remains before the domestic and Strasbourg Courts. The Court of Appeal heard arguments in the domestic cases during week commencing 7 October 2002 and judgment was reserved. The European Court of Human Rights decided to adjourn further hearings of two applications by widowers concerning widow's pension until the completion of the domestic litigation.
<P>

<a name="30604w22.html_para4">There are important matters to be settled in both jurisdictions that will affect the Government's decisions in dealing with all the widowers affected.

 Under the Human Tissue Act 1961, organs and tissue may be taken and used for medical purposes after a post-mortem examination by a national health service pathologist if the person who has died authorised this prior to death. Where the deceased has not expressed a view, relatives may authorise such taking and use of organs and tissue.
<P>

<a name="30604w23.html_para0">Under the Coroners Act 1988 and Coroners Rules 1984, a coroner undertaking a coroner's post mortem examination may remove and retain any organs or tissue that he/she deems relevant to the cause of death on his/her own authority alone. However, any organ or tissue removed in such cases may not be used for any other purpose unless separate authorisation is obtained.
<P>

<a name="30604w23.html_para1">Under the Anatomy Act 1984 and Anatomy Regulations 1988, organs and tissue, including brains and brain tissue, may be removed for anatomical examination when a person has bequeathed his or her body for this purpose.

 NHS Estates, an executive agency of the Department of Health, provides advice and guidance to the National Health Service, principally through a series of technical manuals and design publications.

<a name="30604w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2003]:</i> The Agenda for Change proposals include a 10 per cent. uplift to basic pay for all staff groups over the three years from April 2003 to March 2006 and a further estimated increase of 2.5 per cent. in basic pay on average. The changes in pay (over and above 10 per cent.) for specific groups, such as speech and language therapists, will depend on decisions made locally about which national job profile matches a particular post or, where there is no match with a national profile, on a local job evaluation. 97.3 per cent. of the qualified speech and language therapist workforce is female.

[114782]<P>

<P>
<a name="30604w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Agenda for Change has been negotiated by staff and management sides working in partnership. Staff side organisations are consulting their members about Agenda for Change and the majority of these organisations have now announced their results. We expect that a decision about implementation will be made jointly by the United Kingdom health departments, unions and employer representatives once consultation is complete. If this decision is positive, then we will move to the early implementation phase. Where there is evidence from the early implementer sites that the success criteria in the proposed agreement are not being sufficiently met, the appropriate action would be discussed before national roll-out in the new NHS Staff Council. All the nationally recognised staff organisations will be represented on the proposed NHS Staff Council.

 Comprehensive guidance, to ensure that the National Health Service is prepared to respond to major incidents or terrorist attacks, was first issued in November 1998, and was entitled Planning for major incidents: the NHS guidance.
<P>

<a name="30604w23.html_para8">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) (formerly the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)) has for many years undertaken surveillance of biological agents on the Department's behalf. The approach taken has been to build on the public health need to have in place clinical and laboratory based surveillance for the most likely agents that could be used in a biological attack. This work resulted in the document published by the Department in March 2000, Deliberate release of biological and chemical agents.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much investment has gone into laboratory diagnostic testing since 1997; what assessment has been made of whether clinical diagnostics can cut down the costs of treatment on the NHS; and if he will make a statement on the benefits to be gained from early diagnosis of illnesses.  [114701]<P>

<P>
<a name="30604w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 During the period 1999&#150;2000 and 2001&#150;02, the Department of Health invested 28 million capital through its pathology modernisation programme in National Health Service pathology services. Extra resources for the NHS were announced in the 2002 Budget, with an annual average increase of 7.4 per cent, above inflation&#151;the largest ever sustained increase in NHS funding&#151;over the five years from 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08. As part of this, we are investing &#163;54 million capital and &#163;9.1 million revenue specifically in pathology services over the three year period from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30604w24.html_para5">It is clear that early diagnosis can benefit patients. For example, screening for early detection of diabetic retinopathy and laser therapy is effective in preventing visual impairment. Similarly, cancer screening is an important way to detect abnormalities at an early stage, allowing treatment when the cancer is most likely to be curable. We also recognise the benefits of early diagnosis for coronary heart disease in primary care and this approach is supported in the national service framework.

 We have no evidence of audiology departments discriminating against any age group in the fitting of digital hearing aids. Such discrimination would not be acceptable.
<P>

<a name="30604w24.html_para6">Most first wave sites fitted new patients when they were first modernised and then extended this to include review patients. However, this is a matter for local discretion and some current sites are fitting both new and review patients concurrently from the start. The Royal National Institute for the Deaf has issued guidelines to audiologists in sites taking part in the modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) project. These guidelines advise that patients who have received National Health Services analogue hearing aids in the last three years should not be renewed for a digital aid unless there are clinical reasons why it is particularly appropriate to fit such an aid. The guidelines suggest that patients should be assessed for digital aids if there has been significant deterioration in their hearing since the last assessment, or if the patient has been persistently dissatisfied with the performance of the analogue aid. 83,397 hearing aids had been fitted as part of the modernisation project by the end of March 2003. The cost of finding out how many of those were fitted to patients who already had analogue aids would be disproportionate, and the information is not collected centrally.

 The Department is currently gathering reports from the 15 areas that received one-off funding in 2001&#150;02 to establish pharmacy schemes. Once these reports have been considered the Department plans to disseminate the main findings to the field. We are also planning to develop best practice guidance on training pharmacists in the supply of emergency contraception under a patient group direction.
<P>

<a name="30604w25.html_para0">Funding for pharmacy schemes is a matter for primary care trusts. Central funding to support the implementation of local teenage pregnancy strategies has increased by 50 per cent. this year, 2003&#150;04, to &#163;24 million. If a local need to improve early access to emergency contraception is indicated, some areas may choose to use some of this funding to develop pharmacy schemes. In addition the document <i>Effective Commissioning of Sexual Health and HIV Services</i>

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2003]:</i> The new contract for general medical services negotiated between the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association and the NHS Confederation provides for an unprecedented level of additional investment in primary care services. If the contract is accepted, overall investment in England would rise by 33 per cent, over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="30604w25.html_para2">The minimum practice income guarantee is designed to ensure that no practice loses out from the new allocation formula, providing they achieve a minimum level of quality. Practices that gain from the allocation formula will not receive a minimum practice income guarantee and will have their global sum allocation determined by the formula. Most practices will see a substantial rise in gross income. The average increase will depend on what services general practitioner practices provide and the level of quality they achieve.

 We greatly appreciate the excellent work done by all hospices in supporting people who are suffering from terminal or life threatening illnesses. Indeed, the voluntary hospice movement in the United Kingdom is considered a world leader in palliative care.
<P>

<a name="30604w25.html_para4">In the NHS Cancer Plan published in September 2000, we pledged that the National Health Service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care, including hospices, would increase by &#163;50 million by 2004 to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and to enable the NHS to make a realistic contribution to the costs hospices incur in providing agreed levels of services.

 Primary care trusts have a pivotal role in assessing the extent of health care needs within their catchment area and funding service provision, including adult hospice and children's hospice services. The level of funding agreed is a matter for local discussion.

<a name="30604w25.html_para6">A central budget of an additional &#163;50 million per annum for specialist palliative care, including hospices, has been set up for the three years beginning 2003&#150;04. This funding is specifically to meet the commitments and aims set out in the NHS Cancer Plan. The extra &#163;50 million represents an increase of about 38 per cent. in the amount of National Health Service funding being put into adult specialist palliative care over 2000 levels and means that the pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan will be more than met. Allocation from this &#163;50 million to local cancer networks will be made once network investment plans have been approved by the joint NHS/voluntary sector group&#151;National Partnership Group.

 Since the pilot, 247 patients have been referred abroad as part of the overseas treatment programme.

Air charter is only used where the numbers to be transported make the option cost effective. Air charter has been used on five occasions to transport 122 patients from Plymouth National Health Service Trust and the Royal United Hospital in Bath to hospitals in St. Etienne, France. Spare capacity was made available to the patient's relatives, at no cost to the NHS. The precise costs of the air charter are subject to commercial confidentiality; the cost per patient for the air charter compared well with the cost of the equivalent commercial flights.

<a name="30604w28.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his Answer of 6 May, <i>Official Report</i>, column 665W, on security incidents, what definition of security incident is used in the figures provided; what the changes to the reporting procedures were; and where the acknowledgement was made that the level of recorded incidents was likely to rise in the short term.  [114883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Up until March 2003 security incidents were reported to NHS Estates and the definition of a security incident used in the figures referred to was as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the total number of security and deliberate violent incidents recorded by the organisation site for the reporting period. These include assaults on staff and client to client, and any incident requiring intervention by security personnel or police attendance".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30604w28.html_para0">No changes to the reporting procedure have been made since this system was introduced in 1999. Acknowledgement that the level of recorded incidents was likely to rise in the short-term was included in Health Service Circular 1999/229 (October 1999).
<P>

<a name="30604w28.html_para1">On 1 April 2003, the National Health Service Counter Fraud and Security Management Service was launched with the responsibility of, in respect of security management, protecting the NHS&#151;by delivering an environment for those who use or work in the NHS which is properly secure so that the highest possible standard of clinical care can be made available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We are taking a number of steps to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Department has:

Launched a &#163;4 million public information campaign, the "sex lottery", in December 2002. This promotes messages around safer sex and the use of condoms in a relevant and realistic way.
<P>
<BR>
Invested &#163;5 million last year and &#163;10 million this year to improve access to genito-urinary medicine services and reduce waiting times.
<P>
<BR>
Selected 10 areas to take forward the first phase of a national chlamydia screening programme. We will be calling for bids for inclusion in the second phase of the programme shortly.
<P>
<BR>
Established an independent advisory group on sexual health, which met for the first time in May. The group will provide advice to the Government and monitor progress on the implementation of the Sexual Health and HIV Strategy including any further action necessary to achieve the strategy's aims. These include reducing the transmission of HIV and STIs and reducing the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV and STIs.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30604w28.html_para2">These measures, together with others in our national strategy, should start to reduce new transmissions and subsequent complications and improve access to services.

<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cameron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what funding is available within his Department for <i>(a)</i> routine testing for (i) anthrax, (ii) botulism, (iii) staphylococcus enterotoxin B, (iv) ricin, (v) plague and (vi) smallpox and <i>(b)</i> research into biodefence.  [109288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Funding for all routine testing for anthrax, botulism, staphylococcus enterotoxin B and plague is covered within the overall funding of diagnostic testing services across the National Health Service and is not separately identified. Routine testing for smallpox is not undertaken as this disease has been eradicated. Testing for Ricin is not undertaken within the NHS and is only undertaken at DSTL Porton Down.
<P>

<a name="30604w28.html_para3">Research into biodefence is co-ordinated across Government by the Home Office as part of its overall chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear programme. The Department of Health has funded a number of research projects from within its existing overall research programme to help plan the responses required in the event of a bioterrorist incident. The Department also provided funding of &#163;2.4 million revenue and &#163;8 million capital in 2002&#150;03 for a strategic response capability at the Health Protection Agency Porton Down, formerly the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research. This response capability includes biodefence research.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The data on the species identified are not available. The abundance of pigeons, rats and urban foxes has not been brought to the attention of the UK Zoonoses Group or the previous Zoonoses Group for England as a national public health issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which United Kingdom commitments arising from the World Summit on Sustainable Development <i>(a)</i> have been incorporated into the Department's existing delivery plan for Service Delivery Agreements and <i>(b)</i> will be incorporated in its delivery plan for Service Delivery Agreements in advance of the 2004 Spending Review.  [113942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30604w28.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2003]:</i> The Government has made clear its commitment to implementing what was agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. Details of those Departments with lead responsibility for taking this forward is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30604w28.html_para6">The Department of Health does not have a lead responsibility in relation to WSSD. Although there is no major direct health interest, poor water quality and sanitation, for example, are recognised causes of ill health and disease. Therefore, we are continuing to work with other Government Departments to ensure that, where appropriate, health and health care issues are included in the effective delivery of the UK commitments made in Johannesburg.
<P>

<a name="30604w28.html_para7">The Department is represented on the Government's new Sustainable Development Task Force announced by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in February 2003. The task force will play an important part in the review of the Government's Sustainable Development Strategy, which will take into account World Summit outcomes.
