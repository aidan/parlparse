 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 and 22 December 2004; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [209495]</p>









<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50124w01.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the UK at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 21&#150;22 December 2004. Fisheries Ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The main items for decision were on fisheries. The Council agreed on Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2005 and on related measures. Much of the discussion at Council centred on the need for further measures to protect depleted cod stocks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Commission had proposed a series of closed areas in the North Sea. Ministers, however, were not convinced of the case for the Commission&#039;s proposal which would have significant impact on the fishing industry but without clear benefit for the North Sea cod stock. The UK believes that closed areas have a part to play in fisheries management and we indicated at the Council that we would be willing to consider more radical measures, including closed areas, if the scientific advice on the state of stocks justified such an approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Council agreed a general reduction in fishing days within the North Sea, west of Scotland, and Eastern Channel to protect cod stocks. However, in recognition of the role that large mesh gear plays in reducing catches of juvenile fish, the Council agreed that fishermen using mesh of 120 mm mesh should receive an extra day, subject to administrative sanctions for infringements. The UK&#039;s mixed cod/haddock/whiting fleet already uses 120 mm and will, therefore continue to be able to fish for 15 days per month as soon as the new arrangements are in place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Council also agreed to implement UK proposals for improved controls to ensure that illegal landings do not undermine cod recovery and for scientific monitoring of discarding. The European Commission will present detailed proposals to improve control and enforcement in early 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The Council agreed to apply days at sea limits to the western Channel to protect the sole stock. Fishermen fishing with beam trawls or fixed nets will be restricted to 20 days fishing in the area per month.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 2W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Ministers agreed that the closure to demersal fishing of an area to the West of Scotland (the &#039;windsock&#039; closure) should continue in the same form as in 2004. For the sixth successive year, there will be a closure on the western Irish Sea in the spring to protect the spawning stock. The UK reached a bilateral agreement with Ireland to take forward a review of the Irish Sea closure with industry participation. Fishermen who spend most of their time in the Irish Sea will receive one additional fishing day (instead of two in 2004) in recognition of the reduction in effort as a result of the closure. The Council also agreed to implement a proposal from the UK, French and Irish industries for a cod spawning closure in the area between south west England and Ireland from January to March. However at the request of Belgium, there will be a derogation for beam trawlers in January.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The UK secured at the Council a number of increases in Total Allowable Catches in commercially important stocks where there was scientific evidence that previous TACs were out of line with the real abundance of the stocks. This meant that fishermen were having to unnecessarily discard catches with no conservation benefit. The stocks concerned were:

<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The Council also reached agreement on cuts in fishing effort and quotas on deep sea stocks. A closed area will be introduced to protect orange roughy which is thought to be particularly at risk. There will be a review of management arrangements for deep sea stocks in 2005.
</p>


<p>

<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_9">On agriculture, the Presidency reported on two conferences that had considered the handling of animal disease outbreaks, including zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), from both the financial and disease control angles. The Commission indicated that it would be taking forward work in this area with a view to developing a more strategic approach to animal health. I strongly supported this initiative.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50124w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Department has not received any representations on this subject in the recent past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_15">However, we are aware that a report has recently been published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health suggesting such a relationship. The report evaluated childhood cancer by linking residence and migration of children who had fatal tumours (who died 1966&#150;80) with emission data from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) data for 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_16">The Department of Health has advised as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;The Committee on Carcinogenicity (COG) set up a review of cancer in children at its November 2004 meeting. The Committee has recommended a number of follow-up pieces of work which includes a review of published papers on environmental exposures and childhood leukaemia. The new paper from Professor Knox on childhood leukaemia and air pollutants will be considered as part of this review.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_17">One of the issues the COC will need to consider is the validity of the assessment of exposure for children who died in 1966&#150;80 based on emission maps for the year 2001. The magnitude and location of pollution sources is likely to have changed dramatically between these two periods. For instance, emissions of the two pollutants suggested as posing the greatest risk, 1,3-butadiene and carbon monoxide, declined by 64 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively between 1990 and 2001.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="50124w05.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Recording accurate expenditure on HIV and AIDS is difficult because of the cross-cutting nature of many HIV and AIDS initiatives and of the range of methods used to channel development assistance, including direct budget support to governments and via multilateral organisations. DFID is currently working on ways to better account for expenditure in this area and revised figures may be issued later in the year. The following are estimated figures for bilateral and multilateral independently.

<a name="stpa_57">In 2003&#150;04, DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure on projects that targeted HIV and AIDS, was &#163;297 million. This figure reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on HIV and AIDS or reproductive health. It should be noted that some of these projects will also have had a primary or significant focus on other sectoral areas such as education or health systems development.

<p>

<a name="stpa_58">In addition, expenditure which focused on AIDS through multilateral organisations was estimated at &#163;48 million. This is based on the share of spending which multilateral organisations, supported by DFID, said they directed towards AIDS.

<p>
<a name="50124w05.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_59">The overall spend is likely to be in excess of &#163;345 million, as further money has been spent on AIDS directly by partner governments receiving &#039;Poverty Reduction Budget Support&#039; (PRBS) from the UK. DFID is currently in the process of developing a methodology for estimating the proportion likely to be spent on HIV and AIDS activities, though this exercise is not yet complete.

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="50124w07.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Iraqi health care faces enormous and longstanding challenges which pre-date the 2003 conflict. However, the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) has already taken a number of positive steps to strengthen public health services. For example, funding to the health service has increased significantly since April 2003. In addition, through the multi-donor trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank, about $1 billion is available for Iraqi priorities in health and other sectors. Salaries have improved and charges largely abolished, providing free access to health care for all. The Iraqi Ministry of Health, with support from the United Nations, has also developed a set of Planning Guidelines for 2005 which set out national priorities and the objectives and standards that the Ministry expect to achieve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">DFID support is focussed on primary health care, through the provision of professional advice to the Ministry of Health in Baghdad and Basra, and a &#163;5 million grant through the World Health Organisation (WHO). Additional DFID support for health services in Iraq is channelled through the multi-donor trust funds managed by the United Nations and the World Bank. DFID has made an initial contribution of &#163;70 million to these trust funds.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent reports he has received on levels of acute malnutrition amongst Iraqi children up to the age of five years; and what action his Department is taking to reduce levels of child malnutrition in Iraq.  [208729]</p>








<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50124w07.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The most recent national survey of nutritional status conducted in Iraq took place in the second quarter of 2004 by the Iraqi Central Office of Statistics and Information Technology, with technical support from the Fafo Institute for Applied International Studies, Norway. This survey found that 7.5 per cent. of children under five years old were acutely malnourished, defined as low weight for a given height. A UNICEF survey conducted in 2000 found that 6.4 per cent. of children of the same age group were acutely malnourished. Another survey was subsequently conducted in 2002 but it was not nationally representative, and therefore direct comparisons are not valid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">All surveys are subject to a certain amount of imprecision and it is not possible to state whether the apparent increase from 6.4 per cent. to 7.5 per cent. reflects a real trend. General child malnutrition&#151;defined as weight for age&#151;showed a marked improvement over the same period, falling from 17.3 per cent. to 11.7 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_75">Reducing levels of acute malnutrition means ensuring that adequate supplies of food reach the poorest families whilst also working to tackle poverty and ensure equitable distribution of wealth in the long term. DFID helped to ensure that Iraq&#039;s Public Distribution System (PDS) for food was re-established quickly after the conflict in 2003. DFID is now supporting the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) in the development of economic policies which will protect the poorest in Iraq who are dependent on the PDS, whilst reducing the economic distortions created by distributing food, virtually free, to the entire population. The PDS currently accounts for 12.5 per cent. of Iraqi Government expenditure. DFID is also developing a programme aimed at strengthening Iraqi Government capacity to implement pro-poor employment and social protection policies. In addition, DFID programmes in employment generation and political participation are aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable in Iraq are addressed in Government policies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_76">The Medact report, published in November 2004, was critical of the Iraqi health system, but recognised that the institutional weaknesses were longstanding and pre-date the 2003 conflict and that the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) was addressing these. Medact also acknowledged that health data on Iraq are patchy, often unreliable and that their consultants were unable to visit Iraq to collect field data due to the security situation. The Iraqi MoH has issued a swift and strong rebuttal of the Medact report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_77">Improving health services presents major challenges and will take time. Despite security constraints, steady progress is being made, and many more hospitals are now functioning and have better access to medicines. Since the Medact survey was conducted the MoH have produced Planning Guidelines for 2005, with support from donors, to meet these challenges. The UN and World Bank managed multi-donor trust funds provide support to the health sector, focusing on the improvement of emergency and primary health care services, which affect the poorest and most vulnerable. DFID has contributed &#163;70 million to the multi-donor trust funds and has also provided technical assistance to the MoH.

Officials in the DFID Sri Lanka office are holding regular discussions with government officials concerning the needs, priorities and strategies in relation to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. DFID&#039;s humanitarian response has been channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement, and non-governmental organisations and in direct in kind interventions aimed at addressing immediate needs. DFID has supported the United Nations in undertaking impact and needs assessments, co-ordination, technical advice and air movements logistics support. The assistance that we have provided, and are supporting, is geographically spread throughout the country. This includes substantial support to Tamil communities in proportion to needs across the country.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="50124w09.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Powering Future Vehicles (PFV) Strategy, published in 2002, sets a challenging target that by 2012 at least 10 per cent. of new cars sold in the UK will have a fuel efficiency of 100g per kilometre of carbon dioxide (l00g/km CO <sub>2</sub> ) or better. We reported progress towards this target in the second annual report on the delivery of the PFV Strategy, published in October 2004. The percentage of new vehicles sold in 2003 emitting less than 100 g/km CO <sub>2</sub>  was less than 0.1 per cent., although 3 per cent. of new cars sold emitted less than 120 g/km CO <sub>2</sub> &#151;a significant increase on the previous year.

<p>
<a name="50124w09.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_94">The rate of progress in future years will depend, among other things, on how quickly new technologies are developed and introduced, and on the nature of any further EU-wide targets on new car fuel efficiency. We will monitor the situation closely and keep the existing package of measures under review to ensure that it is delivering the progress required, working closely with stakeholders including the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership. The scope for new measures will be considered carefully as part of the Review of the Climate Change Programme which is currently under way.

 Access by children to films in video/DVD format and computer games is controlled by the Video Recordings Act 1984, under which supplying videos, DVDs or games classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to those who do not meet the age requirements is punishable by a fine of up to &#163;5,000, a prison sentence of up to six months, or both. The Cinemas Act 1985, provides for the licensing of cinemas by local authorities, and under these arrangements controls on access by children to cinemas can be stipulated. In 2003, only 32 (or 2 per cent.) of the 1,484 computer games published depicted &#039;gross violence&#039; and therefore required legal classification by the BBFC.

<i>[holding answer 20 January 2005]:</i> Flights to deliver aid to the areas affected by the tsunami have not been held up. The Ministry of Defence is carrying out operations as tasked by DFID. DFID has agreed to transport appropriate relief items procured by Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) agencies in response to specific and stated needs on the ground. The MOD originally made available one C17 and five C130 (Hercules) aircraft to assist the relief operation. In fact, C17s and KC1 (Tristar) aircraft have been used more extensively due to the distances and types of cargo involved.

 On 14 December, we published the report &quot;A Stepping Stone to Employment&quot; with the findings of the independent research commissioned by my Department into the first two years of operation of the permitted work rules. Copies of the report are available in the Library.

<a name="stpa_145">The permitted work rules allow people with health conditions and disabilities to try out paid work while remaining on benefits, as a stepping stone to full-time work. The research showed that people on incapacity benefits participating in permitted work have been helped to return to full-time jobs and many of those surveyed found that their health conditions were not the barriers to work that they originally thought.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w17.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_146">The Chancellor announced changes to the rules in the pre-Budget report based on the key findings of the research. Our overall intention is to bring more people into permitted work with the eventual aim of progressing into full-time employment. Therefore, we will be introducing measures to improve permitted work by raising greater awareness of the provision and encouraging more people to take advantage of the scheme; there will be more regular face-to-face contact with personal advisers and staff will get new guidance and training materials. The rules will be simplified by allowing all participants an initial period of 52 weeks.

I have been asked to reply as the issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">Water Service&#039;s second Asset Management Plan (NIAMP2), which was completed in 2003, identified that &#163;2.9 billion needs to be invested over the next 20 years to modernise the existing water and sewerage infrastructure. NIAMP2 assessed the condition of the Water Service&#039;s above ground assets including treatment works, pumping stations, etc. and less than 5 per cent. were considered to be in poor condition or functionally unsound. While the condition of the above ground assets is generally good, many of the current treatment works were not designed to meet the more stringent standards associated with current EU Directives. The upgrading of water and wastewater treatment works accounts for &#163;1 billion of the total investment required. It is much more difficult to define the condition of below ground assets, but use of an industry recognised statistical model identified an investment need for this asset group of almost double that required for above ground assets. Over two-thirds of this below ground investment is attributable to keeping the networks in a serviceable condition over the 20 year period.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">The failure of the water and sewerage infrastructure to meet current EU Directives relates mainly to the fact that many of the current treatment works need to be upgraded. New treatment processes associated with new technology are often needed to meet the quality standards associated with current EU Directives. Priority is at present being given to upgrading water and wastewater treatment works and it is planned to accelerate spending on network refurbishment within the next few years as the treatment works upgrading programme nears completion.</p>

 The Government are committed to supporting the provision of child care in schools as part of the wider extended schools initiative in England. Decisions about the provision of child care in Northern Ireland are made by the Northern Ireland Assembly. In the financial year 2005&#150;06 my Department will be making available just over &#163;107 million to support the development of extended schools, including school based child care. In later years we will provide further funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course.

 The 10-year strategy for child care &quot;Choice for parents, the best possible start for children&quot; published on 2 December included the commitment to legislate to place a new duty on local authorities so that over time they will secure sufficient supply of child care places to meet the needs of local families. Local authorities are already key agents for co-ordinating, supporting and delivering child care services and there is a need to confirm the important role they play and clarify their responsibilities in this area. Consultation on the 10 year strategy is due to conclude on 24 February and discussions will be held with local authorities and other stakeholders on the new duty during 2005, with a view to introducing legislation in a future parliamentary session.

 The Government&#039;s 10-year strategy Choice for Parents, the Best Start for Children, published on 2 December, sets out our commitment to give every child the best start in life and to ensure that parents have real choice about how to balance work and family life. Our long term investment includes a guarantee of child care being available from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round, for all parents of children aged five to 11. The guarantee will help the very varied needs of children and families. Obviously we do not expect most children to spend all their time in school when schools are open for longer, but parents will be able to choose hours which meet their needs and the needs of their children. We expect at least half of parents to benefit from this offer by 2008, and all by 2010. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools will be open from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round offering a range of activities for 11 to14 year olds. By 2010, all secondary schools will be part of a network offering this provision. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local childminders.

<a name="stpa_193">A new Childcare Approval Scheme was announced on 8 December. This will allow for the approval of child care provided in the child&#039;s home or, for children over the age of seven, on other domestic premises. Carers will be able to apply for approval from 4 January 2005. By using an approved carer parents have been able to access financial support through the child care element of the working tax credit or through employer supported child care. Parents who are eligible will be able to claim financial support from 6 April 2005. The new scheme will provide parents with more flexible, affordable, opportunities for home based care.

 The Government&#039;s aim is that all vulnerable children should be able to access good quality education. The Standards Fund Vulnerable Children Grant was introduced in the 2003&#150;04 financial year to help local education authorities (LEAs) to achieve this aim.

young offenders. This list is not prescriptive or exclusive. Many of these children will face multiple challenges, sometimes including homelessness. The grant may be used by LEAs to meet the needs of any vulnerable children identified by them as needing support, including those who are homeless. This discretionary approach allows local needs to be addressed more flexibly and responsively than would be possible using central direction.

<a name="stpa_195">In November last year the Department published an evaluation of the Vulnerable Children Grant undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). One of the key findings of the report was that the grant had enabled LEAs to provide support for a variety of vulnerable groups. The NFER reported that in some LEAs surveyed the grant had been used to support children who are socially vulnerable, for example children living in vulnerable accommodation such as women&#039;s refuges, or children who were the subject of family breakdown or changes in home circumstances.

<p><a name="st_220"><a name="50124w26.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 There are no plans to adopt a single system of general support based on intensity of study. However, changes we are introducing for the 2005/06 academic year will pro-rate the amount of fee support that a part-time student receives to the intensity of their part-time study. This Government are the only one to have provided support for part-time students. Prior to academic year 1998/99 no financial support of any kind was available to them. Since then we have introduced schemes which have enabled some part-time students to have their tuition fees met, to qualify for disabled students&#039; allowances and to take out loans to cover course costs. In 2004/05 a new package of grants was introduced and this is being improved on further in 2005/06.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="50124w26.html_spnew4"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Department for Education and Skills commissioned the Open University to carry out a survey into the incomes of and costs incurred by part-time higher education students while studying.

This is slightly less than the maximum course grant of &#163;250 which is available to part-time students.

<p><a name="st_243"><a name="50124w28.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Antisocial behaviour is defined in the Part 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for the purposes of seeking Anti-social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) as behaviour that is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress. For the purposes of seeking a Housing Injunction under Section 153A of the Housing Act 1996 antisocial behaviour is defined as conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance. It is important to note that both definitions relate specifically to these legislative measures and are not to be taken as general definitions of what constitutes anti-social behaviour.

 While there are no fixed guidelines the key to categorising behaviour as antisocial must be in consideration of its impact on others. The term &#039;antisocial behaviour&#039; includes a variety of behaviour covering a whole complex of selfish and unacceptable activity that can blight the quality of community life. Other terms such as &#039;nuisance&#039;, &#039;neighbour disputes&#039; and &#039;disorder&#039; are also used to describe some of this behaviour. A legal definition of behaving in an antisocial manner is found in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, this

 As part of the initial screening process asylum seekers are required to provide proof of residence at a particular address.

Verification of the place of residence occurs during reporting. In addition, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) make regular checks, including personal visits, to ensure that individuals still reside at the recorded address.

It is important that there is a range of services for all victims of domestic violence locally, including advocacy provision, which is the responsibility of local partnerships.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_229">Each partnership is required to produce a strategy every three years for reducing crime and disorder in their area, following an audit to establish need. These audits were undertaken earlier this year, and partnerships should now be identifying what the needs of their local communities are, including for services addressing domestic violence. They will then set out how these needs will be met in their three year strategies, bearing in mind their budgets, which come from a range of sources. There is no ring fenced funding for domestic violence advocacy services from the Home Office, though the Department allocated those local partnerships with responsibility for crime and disorder &#163;74 million in 2004&#150;05 through the Building Safer Communities Fund. Among a variety of interventions, this could be spent on domestic violence services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_230">How local services are then commissioned is a matter for local areas, though we would recommend that they consider working in partnership with voluntary and community organisations where appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_231">The precise remit of individual advocacy services will be based on identified local need, and may include a range of emotional, legal and practical support.

 Chip and PIN is a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming).

using intelligence largely provided by the card industry. The Home Office funded 25 per cent. of the unit&#039;s costs (&#163;1.4 million over two years) during the pilot with the remainder being met by the card industry. An independent evaluation of the unit showed that it had been successful in detecting or preventing a significant amount of cheque and credit card fraud.

<a name="stpa_244">We have been encouraging financial and retail sectors to work towards early implementation of more secure systems to combat fraud. This includes Chip and PIN, a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming).

<i>[holding answer 17 January 2005]:</i> I announced on 21 December 2004 that from late 2006 adults applying for their first passport would need to attend an interview as part of the process of confirming their identity. Applications will continue to be sent in by post and other existing channels and will be processed initially in the present regional passport offices. First time adult applicants will then be invited to make an appointment for an interview. The UK Passport Service (UKPS) is seeking additional premises where interviews may be held. These will generally be small offices dedicated only to carrying out interviews and will not be passport offices offering the full range of UKPS services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w34.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_258">While UKPS proposals are not finalised, the aim, using 70 to 80 offices, is that nearly 97 per cent. of applicants would have an interview office within 20 miles of their home, 2.4 per cent. would be in a 20&#150;40 mile radius with only 0.7 per cent. having to travel further than 40 miles. In order to take account of public transport links, the UKPS will be consulting transport planning authorities, including the relevant officials in the Scottish Executive, on possible locations for offices. Initial planning on the 70 to 80 office model has indicated a need, subject to consultation, for 11 new offices in Scotland: three in the borders, two in the central area (in addition to the regional passport office in Glasgow) and six distributed on the east and west coasts. For those in more remote areas, we are considering the practicality of mobile facilities or peripatetic staff.

 On 31 March 2004, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy that would be developed over the coming year. It can be summarised as, &quot;Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons&quot;. This follows extensive consultations including those with the Howard League, Prison Reform Trust, Inquest, the Youth Justice Board, Prisons and Probations Ombudsman, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Samaritans and the Department of Health.

<p>
<a name="50124w35.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_264">This strategy builds on the three-year safer custody strategy that ran from April 2001 and has a close relationship with issues of resettlement, detoxification, health, purposeful activity, as well as staff attitudes, leadership and training. Key achievements were the setting up of suicide prevention co-ordinators or equivalents in all prisons across the estate, an investment of over &#163;21 million at six &#039;safer local&#039; pilot sites and the development of a safer prison design, including &quot;safer cells&quot;.

<a name="50124w35.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_265">Clearly, all self-inflicted deaths in prison are deeply regrettable. To accompany the three-year safer custody strategy, a target was set for reducing the rate of self- inflicted deaths per 100,000 prisoners from the 1999&#150;2000 figure of 141 to 112.8 by 2004&#150;05. A rate of about 130 deaths per 100,000 is projected for 2004&#150;05. The prisoner targets are being reconsidered in the light of experience.

 The issue of appropriate accommodation is addressed prior to an offender&#039;s release as part of his licence conditions; this could include consideration for approved premises. For offenders who potentially pose a risk of harm to the public, this is managed under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), which include local housing authorities and registered social landlords as part of the duty to co-operate.

<p>
<a name="50124w36.html_para6">
Jobcentres are also subject to the duty to co-operate provisions under MAPPA and securing employment is a factor contained within an offender&#039;s individual Supervision Plan. Finding employment is managed by local arrangement and suitability of any such employment is evaluated. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for disqualification orders, which make it a criminal offence for convicted sex offenders to seek employment that would provide unsupervised access to children.

 The main risk created by overcrowding is that prisoners do not complete offending behaviour programmes to which they have been assigned because they are transferred to another establishment before the programme is completed. It is well understood in the Prison Service that prisoners who have started an offending behaviour programme should not be moved before the programme is completed.

<a name="stpa_276">The Prison Service monitors the delivery of all offending behaviour programmes for the proportion of prisoners who do not complete.

We believe that the number who do not complete because of overcrowding is negligible.

<p><a name="st_326"><a name="50124w37.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Ratifying the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families would require a number of changes to UK legislation. The Convention would give migrants the same access to public funds and services as British citizens, regardless of their length of stay in the UK. Changes would be required to enable these migrant workers to access benefits, housing, education and social services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w37.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_278">Overseas nationals who are granted settlement in the UK are entitled to claim income-related benefits and non-contributory benefits and to access social housing in the same way as a British citizen. Individuals coming to the UK for employment have to support themselves and any dependants without recourse to public funds. However, state school education and treatment under the NHS do not qualify as public funds under the Immigration Rules. So migrant workers without settlement do have access to state education services and, as long as they remain in employment, NHS services. We believe that to extend this access to all benefits before these workers are settled in the UK would act as an unnecessary &quot;pull factor&quot; and undermine immigration controls.

<p><a name="st_344"><a name="50124w40.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b>

 To ask the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the purposes will be of the Government amendments to the Mental Capacity Bill which he has indicated will be tabled in the other House.  [209802]</p>








<p><a name="st_345"><a name="50124w40.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 At Report Stage of the Mental Capacity Bill the Government undertook to amend the Bill in two key areas. The amendments fulfilling these commitments have now been tabled for debate at Committee in the House of Lords. They provide additional reassurance sought by the House in two key areas. The first amendment relates to decisions about life-sustaining treatment in the context of best interests determinations for people who lack capacity. It provides that when someone is making a decision about whether the provision of life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of a person lacking capacity, he cannot be motivated by any desire that the person lacking capacity 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 144W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
should die&#151;for whatever reason. The amendment tabled in the House of Lords on 18 January will replace the existing clause 4(5). It states:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_226">&quot;Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment he must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w40.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_298">This emphasises that the person assessing best interests must look only at the treatment which might be given, for example its possible benefits and burdens. He must not bring into the process any wish or desire to end the person&#039;s life. This should lay to rest any lingering doubt that the Bill will permit euthanasia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w40.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_299">The second area of amendments concerns advance decisions to refuse treatment. The amendments tabled on 18 January mean that an advance decision will have no application to any treatment which a doctor considers necessary to sustain life unless strict formalities have been complied with. These are that the decision must be in writing, signed and witnessed. In addition, there must be an express statement that the decision stands &quot;even if life is at risk&quot;. These amendments build on the already significant safeguards in the Bill surrounding advance decisions, and respond in particular to points raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.

The criteria include our commitment not to issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.

The European Council also recalled the importance of the criteria of the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports, including criteria regarding stability and security in the region.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has sought to promote the development of free trade unions in many parts of the world. For example, the FCO has supported the development of better labour market practices through programmes within the Global Opportunities Fund. These countries have included China, Serbia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The delivery of the programmes has often involved close working between the FCO and the UK trade unions. The FCO has also provided logistical support and briefing to UK trade unions in their own work in seeking to promote the development of free trade unions in various countries. These have included Iraq, China, Zimbabwe, the Occupied Territories and Israel. The FCO has established a strong partnership with the Trades Union Congress in Britain in support of many of these activities and initiatives. For example, the FCO set up a conference for regional trades unionists in Antigua in 2004 in close consultation with the TUC.

 Competency frameworks and national occupational standards are already being used in the national health service to design services that are more flexible and relate directly to patient choices and needs. The aim is to enable individuals to develop career pathways in accordance with local needs and their own abilities, enabling them to progress or gain access to other areas of work based on the competences that they have achieved.

 In certain circumstances, people who are believed to be suffering from mental disorder may be removed to a place of safety under Part 10 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The Act defines a place of safety for these purposes as including a police station. The identification of a preferred place of safety is a matter for local agreement, but the Mental Health Act Code of Practice states that, as a general rule, it is preferable for a person thought to be suffering from mental disorder to be detained in a hospital rather than a police station.

 On 1 April 2003, funding responsibility for health services in the publicly run prisons in England was transferred from the Home Office to the Department. From 1 April 2004, at the beginning of a staged process, 18 national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed commissioning responsibility for health services in 34 prisons. By April 2006, that commissioning responsibility will be fully devolved to PCTs and, in some cases, the PCT will also be the health care provider. Prisons and their NHS partners are now expected to work together to determine how best to meet prisoners&#039; health needs. The Government are committing significant additional resources to facilitate the transfer of commissioning responsibility to the NHS. Revenue investment will have risen by over &#163;40 million a year by 2005&#150;06, an increase of more than a third over the 2002&#150;03 baseline. The Prison Service is investing around &#163;20 million a year over the same period to rebuild and refurbish prison health care facilities.

 The proposals for legislation set out in the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&#151;Making Healthy choices easier&quot; to shift the balance in favour of smoke-free enclosed public places and workplaces were based on the scientific evidence of harm from second hand smoke and the views from the public. In preparation of the proposals, we took full account of the latest scientific and medical evidence of the risk to health from exposure to second hand smoke, as set out in the report from the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, which was published alongside the White Paper. Many of the studies covered look at the effects on non-smokers of living with smokers.

While protecting the right of the majority to go out for a meal or a drink without damage, inconvenience or pollution from second hand smoke, the proposals also provide a degree of choice for the minority. We believe that this is a sensible solution that balances the protection of the majority with the personal freedom of the minority in England.
