 There are no definitive numbers, and the situation changes daily with releases and arrests as well as some tragic recent deaths in jail. We believe that the current estimate of 1,131 made by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) is broadly accurate.

 We remain deeply concerned about the situation in Burma. Serious abuses of human rights continue, particularly in areas of armed conflict. We regularly raise our concerns with the Burmese authorities. We believe if Burma is to attain the State Peace and Development Council&#039;s (SPDC) stated goal of becoming a &#039;modern, developed and democratic nation&#039;, and promote successful national reconciliation, this will require a more open and inclusive political process than is currently being pursued by the SPDC.

<a name="stpa_3">We are particularly concerned that there is an increasing risk of a breakdown of relations between the SPDC and a number of ethnic ceasefire groups, including the Shan, Kachin, and Mon. We believe that the SPDC should take steps to restore confidence with these groups, inter alia through the immediate release of the Shan leaders who received heavy sentences in 2005, and an independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the killing by SPDC troops of five Kachin Independence Organisation members and a civilian on 2 January.

 As G8 lead nation on counter narcotics in Afghanistan, the UK and the international community are supporting the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to deliver their National Drug Control Strategy and to bring about a sustainable reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium. To that end, the UK spent &#163;24,442,350 on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan in 2004&#150;05. This included the running of seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter Narcotics Police, support for interdiction operations, resulting in major seizures of opiates, the provision of a mobile forensic laboratory and help to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.

<a name="stpa_20">In November 2005, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed the poppy cultivation figures for 2004&#150;05 from their annual survey. UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 (production of 4,200 metric tonnes) to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05 (4,100 metric tonnes). Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for the increased yield. While there remains a risk that cultivation may increase again this year, our goal is to ensure that the downward trend in cultivation is maintained in the long term. We are working hard with the GoA and other international partners to ensure that it is able to deliver on this goal.
