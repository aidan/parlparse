<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> Three of the 280 prisoners who successfully applied for accelerated release to the independent Sentences Review Commission, and who have now been released from prison, have since reoffended. The nature of the charges against two of the three includes assault against police officers and breach of the peace; Grievous Bodily Harm with intent; Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm; and Affray. The third person was convicted of receiving stolen goods and of deception. None of the three has broken the terms of their licence conditions.

<P>
<a name="90716w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> A total of 518 prisoners have to date applied to the Sentences Review Commission for an accelerated release date. The Commissioners have issued determinations in 440 cases. Of those applications that have been unsuccessful, the reasons given are that the Commissioners are not satisfied that the offences were committed in connection with terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> A total of 280 prisoners have to date been released in accordance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, of which 190 were serving fixed term sentences. No fixed term prisoners who successfully applied to the Sentences Review Commission were released early having served less than a quarter of their sentence.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> Following implementation of the Northern Ireland (Location of Victims' Remains) Act 1999, the cost to the UK for the operation of the independent Commission amounts to &#163;694.50 to date. Of this, &#163;610.50 has been spent on transport and associated expenses for the UK Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield. The other &#163;84 has been spent on setting up a Post Office Box. There have been no policing costs to the United Kingdom arising from the operation of the Act.
<P>

<a name="90716w01.htm_para3">The remains of one individual, believed to be Eamon Molloy, were recovered in Dundalk on the first day of the Commission's operation, Friday 28 May. On June 29, human remains were found by Gardai at Colgagh in County Monaghan. This was the site which had been indicated as the location of the remains of Brian McKinney and John McClory. The State Pathologist was called to the scene and the Commission later confirmed that the remains of two individuals had been located. Work is ongoing to confirm the identities of the two individuals.
<P>

<a name="90716w01.htm_para4">In light of this encouraging development, I understand that the Commission has asked the Garda Siochana to reassess the plans for the continuation of excavations at any site where available information indicates a prospect of making further discoveries and to report the conclusions to the Commission. The Commission has undertaken to communicate further information as events evolve.

 The Government are determined to apply further, necessary restrictions to the importation, marketing and use of white asbestos. I am hopeful that the European Commission will ratify, without undue delay, the vote of their technical committee to adapt to technical progress Council Directive 76/769/EEC. The UK continues to encourage the Commission to act swiftly on this vitally important measure. I have received advice from the Health and Safety Commission about domestic implementation of the Directive (when ratified) in the form of draft regulations. I will act on that advice as soon as the European Commission has ratified the vote of its technical committee.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Glenda Jackson, has asked me to reply to your recent question about the link road to the Scratchwood Services on the M1 Motorway.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The link road was built to provide vehicular access to Scratchwood. Those authorised to use the road under a legal agreement between the Secretary of State and Welcome Break, who operate the services, are service area employees, delivery vans, maintenance depot employees and the emergency services. Guests at the Welcome Break Lodge are also allowed to use the access. Rat running to gain access to the M1 motorway is not an authorised use and Welcome Break are legally required to police the road by providing and maintaining a suitable barrier or gate across the link road to prevent such use. This means Welcome Break must keep the barrier shut except to admit authorised users.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It would not be possible to close the link road permanently as Welcome Break are required to maintain access at all times to authorised users.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Efford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) by what percentage he estimates road traffic will increase in the London area over the next 30 years; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this on the speed of traffic; [90648]
<P>
<UL>(2) by what percentage his Department estimates that road traffic levels will increase over the next 30 years; what assessment it has made of the impact that will have on current rates of traffic movement; and if he will make a statement;  [90649]
<P>
(3) if he will estimate <i>(a)</i> the cost of building roads to accommodate the projected increase in road vehicles over the next 30 years to maintain current rates of traffic movement and <i>(b)</i> the number of miles of road this would require.  [90650]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 1999]:</i> The National Road Traffic Forecasts published in 1997 predicted that on the basis of the capacity of the road network as it then stood, and in the absence of the new policies set out in the Integrated Transport White Paper, road traffic in Great Britain could increase by nearly 50 per cent. over the next 30 years. This growth was forecast to result in a reduction in average speeds of 10 per cent., although the reduction during the peak on the busiest roads would be substantially greater. The Department is currently working on a new set of traffic forecasts which will reflect the potential of the New Deal for Transport to tackle congestion and pollution.
<P>

<a name="90716w02.htm_para0">The 1997 National Road Traffic Forecasts were not designed to provide forecasts at a local level. However, it is possible to use the 1997 forecasts to produce crude estimates of what they imply for traffic growth and speeds in different area types and regions. These estimates suggest 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 1999 : Column: 341</I><P>
that the national figures quoted would imply traffic growth in London of about 30 per cent. over the next 30 years and a decline in average speeds of 14 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90716w02.htm_para1">No estimate has been made of the additional road capacity that would be required to accommodate the rates of traffic growth in the 1997 forecasts at unchanged speeds, nor has the Department attempted to quantify the enormous environmental, economic, and social costs that would be involved. Adding road capacity in congested conditions generates additional traffic, thereby adding to the road traffic growth to be accommodated. This link highlights one of the fundamental flaws in the predict and provide philosophy and is a key reason why simply building more roads is not the answer to traffic growth.

<a name="90716w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 1999]:</i> This information is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Bus priority measures are important for helping to make bus services quicker and more reliable. Their implementation is the responsibility of the local highway authority which should liaise with the local police on their enforcement.
<P>

<a name="90716w02.htm_para3">Trials of enforcement cameras for bus lanes have been carried out successfully in London. This involves prosecuting offenders using camera evidence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Rules of Court provide sufficient powers to ensure that lawyers are paid for the weight and complexity of the work they have undertaken and not simply because of their status. The new Civil Procedure Rules specifically require the Court awarding costs to have regard to what is proportionate to the issues at stake and the complexity of the particular case. This is in addition to the existing tests that it must have been reasonable to incur the expense at all and that the sum being claimed is itself reasonable in amount. If these tests are applied robustly, they ought to be sufficient. However, if there is any evidence that these tests are insufficient, I am happy to consider what more may be needed.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Civil Procedure Rules do not govern the levels of fees charged by leading counsel, other than in the specific case of fast track trial costs. However, the 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 1999 : Column: 344</I><P>
new Rules do require the court, when deciding the amount of costs, to have regard to what is proportionate for the particular case. This is in addition to the existing tests that it must have been reasonable to incur the expense at all and that the sum being claimed is itself reasonable in amount. Where the court believes costs incurred are not proportionate, it has the discretion to amend the costs allowed accordingly.
<P>

<a name="90716w02.htm_para9">In criminal matters, graduated fees apply in the vast majority of cases of up to 10 days' duration. In the remaining cases, the level of fees allowed is currently at the discretion of the Crown Court Determining Officer, based on the weight and complexity of the case. For the future we are considering what steps we shall take by way of contracting, or other means, to achieve better control over the costs of all criminal cases.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to ensure that the instruction of two counsel in the same case by litigants is permitted only in cases of sufficient complexity to merit two counsel.  [91585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 All litigants have the right to choose their own counsel in civil cases, including the number of counsel. The Civil Procedure Rules, while retaining this principle, set out an overriding objective of proportionality. If a party uses counsel in a way which is disproportionate to the nature, complexity or value of the claim, or to the financial position of the other party, the court could, for example, refuse to award the payment of the excessive costs.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary question asking how may pensioners in receipt of Income Support (IS) in the Coventry South constituency will benefit from <i>(a)</i> a winter fuel payment and <i>(b)</i> the guaranteed minimum pensioner income.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at February 1999, the latest date for which administration data is available, it is estimated that there were approximately 2,800 pensioners in receipt of IS in Coventry South parliamentary constituency. "Pensioner" in this context means either a single person aged over 60 or a couple where one or both partners are over 60. We would expect a similar number to be receiving the minimum income guarantee for pensioners from April, and these pensioners will also benefit from the &#163;100 winter fuel payment this winter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The minimum income guarantee for pensioners, delivered through IS, was introduced in April to provide a single pensioner with a weekly income of a least &#163;75 a week, and a couple &#163;116.60 a week. The threefold increase in the normal price uprating of the IS rates for pensioners will mean that this year, a single pensioners could be &#163;160 a year better off in real terms. In addition to those pensioners already in receipt of IS in April, nationally it is estimated that a further 65,000 will become entitled due to the increase in benefit rates.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is also estimated that within your constituency there are a further 13,790 pensioners who will also receive a Winter Fuel Payment next winter on the grounds that they are in receipt of a different qualifying benefit, for example Retirement Pension. Some of these pensioners may have a possible entitlement to minimum pensioner income.</FONT></UL>

 My Department does not have any significant uses of neon light tubing, but the MOD Disposal Sales Agency (DSA) has set up a recycling scheme across government Departments for fluorescent light tubing in conjunction with the waste companies Biffa Ltd. and Mercury Recycling Ltd. DSA take every opportunity to encourage tube recycling and are planning to widen the scheme to include different designs of tubing. Within MOD, existing disposal contracts are considered for the recycling scheme as and when they come up for renewal.

 The size of the new aircraft carriers is currently estimated to be up to 40,000 tonnes. On this basis the UK shipyards with sufficient capacity to construct the vessels are: Harland and Wolff; Kvaerner Govan: Marconi Marine (VSEL) Ltd, Cammell Laird and Swan Hunter. Depending on the design selected there may be a need for these facilities to be enhanced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will announce his decision on Baglan Cogeneration Ltd.'s application to build a new combined cycle gas turbine power station at Baglan Bay, South Wales.  [92027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today granted consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Baglan Cogeneration for the construction of a 500 MW combined cycle gas turbine power station at the BP Chemicals site at Baglan Bay, Port Talbot in South Wales. I have also deemed planning permission to be granted subject to 44 planning conditions agreed with the Neath Port Talbot County Borough

Council. The reasons why there were no energy policy objections to the proposal were given in the decision letter of 7 April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today granted consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Eastern Generation Ltd. for the conversion of Drakelow C coal-fired power station to allow it to be dual fired by gas.
<P>

<a name="90716w05.htm_para2">I have taken into account the arguments for and against the conversion. I concluded that as long as strict conditions were attached to the consent, then the benefits of the conversion, such as extending the life of the power station and thereby protecting jobs, outweighed the disadvantages. I also consider planning permission to be granted, subject to five planning conditions agreed with South Derbyshire District Council.
<P>

<a name="90716w05.htm_para3">This decision has been taken in line with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government Response to Fourth and Fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071).
<P>

<a name="90716w05.htm_para4">Copies of the Press Notice and decision letter are being placed in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w05.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry following his announcement of a stricter power station consents policy for a limited period while other reforms of the electricity market are put in place, what criteria must be met before he will relax the policy; and when he will carry this out.  [91573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 It is the expectation that the stricter power station consents policy will be relaxed as soon as the Government conclude that their programme of reform of the electricity market is substantially complete and the distortions identified in the White Paper (cm 4071) have been removed.

<P>
<a name="90716w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 1999]:</i> The Government have made clear in the House and elsewhere that we are firmly opposed to the use of abusive labour practices around the world, particularly those which exploit child labour. We have strongly supported initiatives in the International Labour Organisation aimed at improving countries' compliance with internationally recognised labour standards. We have also supported initiatives such as the Ethical Trading Initiative to encourage importers to develop effective and verifiable codes of conduct with their overseas suppliers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> On 1 July the Commission announced financial allocations of European Structural Funds for all member states.
<P>

<a name="90716w06.htm_para0">The Commission used a methodology to calculate each member state's financial allocation for Objective 1 which was based on eligible population, regional and national prosperity, and the relative severity of the structural problems, especially the level of unemployment. The allocations for each UK Objective 1 area have been calculated on the same basis.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w06.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what allocation the United Kingdom has received of European Structural Funds; and what percentage take-up he estimates there will be for each year in the programme.  [91454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w06.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> From 2000 to 2006, the total allocation for the UK from EU Structural Funds will be over &#163;10 billion (over fifteen and a half billion euros).
<P>

<a name="90716w06.htm_para1">I see no reason why there should not be 100 per cent. take-up.

<a name="90716w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Skin cancers are largely preventable and we continue to work closely with a wide range of public bodies in raising public awareness of the sun's harmful effects and the ways in which the risks from those effects can be reduced. The Health Education Authority's annual "Sun Know How" campaign financed through the Department provides a range of information, fact sheets, posters and guidance for health professionals, for local health promotion initiatives and direct to the general public. This includes both general and targeted advice on the measures a person can take to lessen risks of sunburn. The new Ultra Violet Solar Index developed with the Meteorological Office and now provided through weather broadcasts is a further example of the work the Department is supporting to provide people with information to assess their own risk, giving forecasts on the day to day strength of the sun's rays and its capacity to burn.
<P>

<a name="90716w07.htm_para0">For those who do develop skin cancer, even the most dangerous type, malignant melanoma, prompt recognition and diagnosis provide the best chance of successful treatment. Information for the public on how and what to recognise as the early signs of skin cancer and on when to consult their general practitioner, together with more detailed advice for health professionals plays an important role through the health promotion messages on skin cancer.
<P>

<a name="90716w07.htm_para1">This work will continue and build on people's increasing level of awareness of the risks of skin cancer from excessive sun exposure further promoting the simple preventative measures that can be taken--cover up, seek shade particularly around mid-day, protect children and when in the sun use sunscreen.

 Embryos may only be stored in accordance with a licence issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Clinics are required to notify the HFEA of the number of embryos placed in storage. There are some embryos which were stored before the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 came into force. Clinics were not required to notify the HFEA of these.
<P>

<a name="90716w07.htm_para2">According to the most recent verified information held by the HFEA, between 1 August 1991 and 31 March 1997 the number of embryos put into storage during the course of IVF treatment cycles was 144,297.

 As the White Paper indicates, we have commissioned a review of fluoride and health. If it is confirmed that there are benefits to health from fluoridation and no significant risks we would consult the water industry about indemnities and any constraints imposed by the water distribution network. We would then submit to Parliament proposals for amendment to Sections 87 to 91 of the Water Industries Act 1991, which would show how we consider public opinion should be measured and the extent of the public support necessary before a water company would be required to fluoridate.

 Based on the current size and structure of the meat production and processing industry in Great Britain, it is estimated by the Meat Hygiene Service that it will be necessary to secure the services of an additional 300 Official Veterinary Surgeons in order to bring veterinary supervision levels in licensed fresh red meat and poultry meat plants (ie slaughterhouses, cutting plants and cold stores) up to the levels required by the EU meat hygiene Directives. In accordance with EU rules, the costs of this additional veterinary supervision, estimated at &#163;21 million in a full year, will have to be recovered from plant operators in the normal way. However, given the shortage of veterinarians willing to undertake meat

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what percentage of agricultural land in Leicestershire is currently subject to set-aside; and what was the annual cost to public funds in the last year for which figures are available.  [91175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The area of set-aside in Leicestershire on claims made in 1998 under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) was 6,501 ha, or just over 6 per cent. of the total area claimed for. But because not all agricultural land is either eligible or claimed for under AAPS, the proportion of set-aside in relation to agricultural land in the country as a whole is estimated at around 3 per cent. Comparable figures for 1999 are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="90716w09.htm_para0">At the 1998 payment rate, the payment from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund for this area of set-aside would have been &#163;1,962,000.

 In his statement of 6 July, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry stated that Milk Marque, while it remains a monopoly supplier of raw milk to the processing sector, should not be allowed to extend its milk processing activities in the way planned. He therefore asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from Milk Marque that it would not take any further steps towards making or carrying out any agreement to acquire or build processing plant without prior agreement by the Director General.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90716w09.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The first stage of the survey is now complete. Between January and March a total of 4,163 heads were collected from cattle slaughtered in the Over Thirty Month Scheme. In accordance with SEACs wishes, the sample was not random but cattle that were five years of age or older were targeted. This was to ensure that we were sampling cattle that were most likely to be close to clinical onset and would therefore be positive by examination of brain tissue, if infected.
<P>

<a name="90716w09.htm_para1">Of the brains removed, a total of 3,951 were in a suitable condition for examination. So far we only have results of histopathological examinations. These examinations have identified a total of 18 positive and 3,933 negative brains. We are not yet in a position to interpret the data fully because we await the results of two other diagnostic tests and a statistical analysis of the age structure of animals slaughtered under the OTM Scheme.

<a name="90716w09.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The age of a cloned animal is determined from the date of its birth. There have been suggestions backed up by recently published results, albeit based on a very small sample, that animals cloned from adult cells may be genetically older than their birth age. Further research, and the passage of time, will be needed to determine whether cloned animals do have a shorter life span.

<a name="90716w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1999]:</i> The Animal By-Products Order 1999 requires animal by-products, such as mink carcases, to be disposed of by one of a number of routes including incineration. Burial, including landfill, is permitted only where the animal by-product is in a place where access is difficult or where the quantity of by-product and the distance to premises in which disposal is otherwise permitted do not justify transporting it.
