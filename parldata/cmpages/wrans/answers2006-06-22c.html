 The Ministry of Defence keeps its estate under constant review to meet present and planned future requirements, with a view to disposing of surplus assets as quickly as possible. Pending a final decision and subsequent disposal action, any redundant sites will normally be closed and/or mothballed to reduce unnecessary expenditure. The need for financial support to assist the disposal of a site is considered on a case by case basis, usually to maintain the property to an appropriate standard to meet environmental and health and safety requirements, consistent with the most likely disposal strategy. Limited opportunities may also exist for temporary commercial or military training uses while in disposal.</p>

It is therefore the usual practice of the Ministry of Defence to work closely with the local authority and other stakeholders&#151;amongst others English Partnerships, Regional Development Agencies, and in Scotland the Scottish Executive, the Enterprise bodies and the Welsh Assembly in Wales&#151;to consider the most appropriate future use.</p>

 Reliable data about poverty in Burma are scarce, but Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia, comparable to Cambodia and Laos on available measures and is almost certainly not on track to achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals. A household survey from 1997 found that 23 per cent. of people (11.2 million) had an income below subsistence level. The percentage of poor people earning less than $1 US a day is likely to be significantly higher than this. The same Government survey found that 70 per cent. of household expenditure was on food, an indicator of the vulnerability of poor people in Burma. There is widespread malnutrition, with one in three children aged 5 being moderately to severely malnourished. In 2001, 109 of every 1,000 children died before they reached the age of 5, double the East Asia and Pacific regional average. Maternal mortality is among the highest in the region. Only 40 per cent. of children complete five years of primary education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="60622w0007.htm_para9"><a name="06062281000095">Social sector spending in Burma fell steadily during the 1990s and the authorities now spend less than $1 per person each year on basic health care and education combined. This is one of the lowest levels of public investment in the world. Public sector salaries are a long way below a living wage and teachers, doctors and other public servants are forced to either supplement their income through unofficial charges or undertake additional income earning activities. Most poor people rely on informal, private healthcare providers, often receiving poor quality or ineffective treatment as a result. Although education has traditionally been highly valued in Burma, its quality is being undermined by under-investment in the crumbling public education system. HIV/AIDS is a major public health risk in Burma. Burma is one of three countries in Asia with a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic: 420,000 people are estimated to be infected with the virus and prevalence continues to rise. Prevalence in pregnant women exceeds 2 per cent. indicating that the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups into the general population.</p>

For example, we are providing over &#163;60 million to support disaster preparedness in Orissa, India, and we are supporting the Government of Bangladesh&#146;s Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme. We have committed to allocating 10 per cent. of the value of our humanitarian response to each major natural disaster to prepare for and mitigate the impact of future disasters, where this can be done effectively. Under this policy, DFID has committed &#163;7.5 million in the tsunami-affected region.</p>

programme that provides people with advice and guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help through the 50-plus element of the working tax credit. Since April 2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000 older workers into employment, including 280 people in Rotherham. Once in work, new deal 50-plus customers can claim a training grant of up to &#163;1,500 for training of which up to &#163;300 can be used for life-long learning.</p>

People who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated on new deal 25-plus, are already required to attend the gateway stage of the new deal 25-plus programme. This is a period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help and support to improve job prospects.

Although 46 per cent. of those claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age, between 2000 and 2005 the number of people in the 50-plus age group fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity benefits caseload.</p>

 When the new Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was formed in 2002, the Human Resources (HR) function inherited different sets of legacy HR policies and terms and conditions; paper driven systems: HR Service Centres dominated by low value added data input; Business HR teams preoccupied with detailed transactional based advice; and Corporate HR focussed on developing and maintaining detailed and over-prescriptive HR guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="60622w0009.htm_para10"><a name="06062288000029">Working with colleagues from the DWP Businesses, the HR Senior Management Team designed a new HR Operating Model based on best practice in both the private and public sectors. The HR function now has in place a set of HR job roles common across the Department, delivering a uniform HR service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="60622w0009.htm_para11"><a name="06062288000030">This new HR Operating Model places the emphasis on self service for employees and line managers, with on-line access to HR processes through the new Resource Management IT system which will be fully implemented in 2007. This is supported by a telephone based advice and guidance service provided by integrated HR and Finance shared service centres, and accessed through a single telephone number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="60622w0009.htm_para12"><a name="06062288000031">The new Operating Model for HR in DWP has already allowed for a reduction in HR staff numbers from 5,500 to 3,000, and by March 2008 that number will be reduced by a further 500. This has freed up resources for front line work with our clients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="60622w0009.htm_para13"><a name="06062288000032">Business HR teams focus on working strategically with operational managers on the HR issues affecting business performance. Corporate HR has been restructured to form four new Centres of Expertise which have improved and simplified the Department&#146;s HR policies, making them easier for line managers to interpret and use.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]: </i>People suffering from mesothelioma due to exposure in the workplace can make a claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB), Constant Attendance Allowance (CAA) and Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance (ESDA). From July 2002 people suffering from mesothelioma were exempted from the need to be medically examined by the Department if clear evidence is already available to confirm their condition. Alongside that change regulations were introduced to automatically award IIDB at the 100 per cent. rate. Currently this is &#163;127.10. In addition CAA may also be payable dependant upon the level of the person&#146;s care needs. There are four rates of payment ranging from &#163;25.45 to &#163;101.80 a week. Where the two higher rates of CAA are in payment Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance (ESDA) may also be payable at the current weekly rate of &#163;50.90. Where the relevant employer is no longer in business the person may also make a claim under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Worker&#146;s Compensation) 1979 Act scheme where the current average payment is &#163;13,000.</p>

 Failure to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Act is not in itself a criminal offence. Criminal offences can be committed under section 17 (processing personal data without notification) and section 55 (unlawful obtaining and selling of personal data).</p>

These figures do not include all those who have breached the Act or been served with an enforcement notice for a breach which is not a criminal offence.</p>

 The number of sickness absence days is recorded by the Department; however while it is possible to extract information on absence spells from the data collection system currently in place, to do so would be a lengthy process, the cost of which would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold.</p>

The provisions were amended in the Child Support Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, to refer to &#147;scientific tests&#148; (reflecting the development of DNA technology which could be applied to bodily samples other than blood). References to &#147;paternity&#148; were replaced with &#147;parentage&#148; so as to be gender-neutral.</p>
</ul><a name="60622w0014.htm_brev9"><a name="06062292001324"><ul><p class="tabletext">Section 20 of the Family Law Reform Act 1969 provides that in any civil proceedings a court may give a direction for the use of scientific tests to ascertain whether such tests show that a party to the proceedings is or is not the father or mother of a person whose parentage falls to be determined. By virtue of subsection (1A), tests may only be carried out by a body which has been accredited for the purposes of section 20 by the Lord Chancellor, or a body appointed by him for the purpose. Section 20(2) of the 1969 Act provides that the individual carrying out court-directed scientific tests must report to the court stating the results, whether a person is excluded from parentage and (if not) the value of the results in determining parentage. The report is to be received as evidence of the matters stated. It must be in a prescribed form (subsection (3)). Any party may seek a written explanation or amplification, which is deemed to be part of the  <br>

Form 2 is called &#147;Report by Tester&#148; and is to be filled in by the tester. All of this is designed to ensure that the right people actually provide samples, that the same samples reach the tester, and that the nominated tester does the testing and reports to the court.</p>

ISO/IEC/17025 is an accreditation given to testing and calibration laboratories that meet certain competence requirements. There was no formal or public consultation on the criteria chosen for accreditation, but the 2001 Regulations, as a statutory instrument, had the approval of Parliament.

By virtue of subsection (1A), tests may only be carried out by a body which has been accredited for the purposes of section 20 by the Lord Chancellor, or a body appointed by him for the purpose. Section 20(2) of the 1969 Act provides that the individual carrying out court-directed scientific tests must report to the court stating the results, whether a person is excluded from parentage and (if not) the value of the results in determining parentage. The report is to be received as evidence of the matters stated. It must be in a prescribed form (subsection (3)). Any party may seek a written explanation or amplification, which is deemed to be part of the report (subsection (4)). A party must serve notice of an intention to call the tester within 14 days of receiving the report. It is expressly provided that where the tester is called as a witness the party is entitled to cross-examine him (subsection (5)).</p>

However, the Department has found no evidence that any individual or organisation has supplied misleading or incorrect information during the accreditation process and so further action taken against any individual or company would not be appropriate.</p>

 In May 2004, the international agency for research on cancer, part of the World Health Organisation, concluded that organised and quality controlled cervical screening can achieve an 80 per cent. reduction in the mortality of cervical cancer.

 Ear piercing businesses are regulated in England and Wales under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. This provides local authorities with powers to regulate ear piercing by requiring businesses to register and observe byelaws relating to the cleanliness and hygiene of premises, practitioners and equipment. It is an offence for a business to trade without being registered or to breach byelaws and such offences may lead to the suspension or cancellation of registration.</p>

 There is no statutory minimum age of consent for ear piercing.

 The expansion of manufacturing capacity is an ongoing process. Much depends on research and development results. One promising approach is the incorporation of adjuvants (agents to enhance the immune response), thereby allowing smaller quantities of the vaccine itself to be used, expanding the numbers of available doses. The Department is in close touch with both industry development plans and the international initiatives to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity.</p>

 Sir Jonathan expressed views on a one size fits all, centralised information technology (IT) solution for the national health service. However, it has been demonstrated by independent analysis that the aggregated procurement has saved over &#163;3.8 billion for the taxpayer over procurements by individual trusts. Moreover, the provision of a national information system architecture that makes patient information available at point of need will improve patient safety. In addition, it provides a common computer system interface which makes training easier and more economic across different trusts which should also improve accuracy and consistency in treatment. History suggests that the NHS does not have a good track record of procuring, developing or using IT at a local level. An accreditation programme has already enabled 46 local and previously incompatible systems to exchange data with and via national systems. A degree of local flexibility is important but good interoperability across the NHS is critical to patient care and this is what the national programme for IT will achieve.</p>

 The Respect programme places the emphasis on local agencies to use the tools and powers they have been given to swiftly and effectively tackle antisocial behaviour and its causes. The implementation of neighbourhood policing teams and the increase in the number of police community support officers means that there are more resources than ever before on the streets to respond appropriately to antisocial behaviour and there will be no excuse for inaction.</p>

To successfully tackle antisocial behaviour we need people to work in partnership with the police and local authorities. We want to encourage people to come forward, complain and take a stand, collect evidence and play an active part in residents' and community groups. The Respect &#147;Taking A Stand&#148; scheme continues to recognise members of the public for their courage in tackling disrespect and antisocial behaviour in their communities.</p>

And we are committed to introducing a &#145;community call for action&#146;, a power that will give local communities a formal way to request and ensure that action is taken by the police, local authorities and others in response to persistent antisocial behaviour or community safety problems, where action is not already being taken.</p>

 In 2004 the Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) published &#147;Defining and Measuring Antisocial behaviour&#148; which contained a typology of antisocial behaviour intended to provide a practical guide to the main categories of behaviour that are widely accepted to be antisocial by both practitioners and the public. This has been used to develop a standard focus for work aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour problems locally. The introduction of the antisocial behaviour hotline &#147;It's your call&#148; in 49 areas since January 2005 has encouraged the public to report incidents of antisocial behaviour and has helped to further standardise local agencies' reporting of antisocial behaviour. Building on &#147;It's your call&#148;, the single non-emergency number, 101, is currently being rolled out by local authorities and police partnerships across England and Wales and will provide the public with easy access to community safety and antisocial behaviour services, advice and information.

 There are five Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in Merseyside, of which only Liverpool is defined as a high crime area for the purposes of the Home Office Public Service Agreement 1. A range of measures have been put in place to reduce crime in Liverpool. It participates in targeted initiatives such as the Drugs Intervention Programme, the Tackling Violent Crime Programme and the Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign, as well as the Prolific and Priority Offenders Strategy, which has been rolled out to all local areas to enable them to deal with their most problematic offenders. Merseyside is also a Specialist Domestic Violence Court Programme roll out area with specialist courts, supported through funding by the Home Office, developing across the Criminal Justice Area. Further measures tackle burglary, robbery, vehicle crime, antisocial behaviour and hate crime.</p>

 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships have duties, rather than powers, under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Home Office has recently conducted a review of the relevant provisions of this Act in order further to strengthen the visibility, responsiveness, membership and role of CDRPs. Our aim is to make-them the most effective possible vehicle for tackling crime and disorder, substance misuse, antisocial behaviour, and environmental crime at a local level. The review findings were published on 25 January 2006.  A copy is available in the Library of the House. The legislative changes required to implement  the recommendations of the review are included in the Police and Justice Bill, currently before Parliament..</p>

 As my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary indicated on 19 June and I re-iterated when I met the hon. Member, among others, the following day, we remain of the view that the creation of strategic police forces is the best way to improve protective services while safeguarding dedicated neighbourhood policing. However, we want to engage in a further round of dialogue and discussion with the policing community to discuss the best way to achieve that outcome.</p>

 There has been no formal national evaluation of safer neighbourhoods work. However, Local Strategic Partnerships are encouraged to evaluate such projects in their area to identify &#147;what works&#148;, and to mainstream successful initiatives into their core programmes. National developments such as neighbourhood policing, Respect and the National Community Safety Plan all encourage neighbourhood level working to make communities safer places. It is too early to evaluate the impact of the National Community Safety Plan, given that it is a three year plan which has only been &#147;live&#148; for less than six months.</p>

 Witness intimidation is an offence by virtue of S.51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (in relation to criminal proceedings) and S.39 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (in relation to civil proceedings). The provisions cover intimidation of anyone who</p>

It must also ensure that necessary and appropriate precautions are taken to ensure that the trial itself will be fair. When exercising this discretion the court should be mindful of four factors; there must be real grounds for being fearful of the consequences of revealing the identity of the witness, the evidence must be sufficiently important to make it unfair to the prosecution to compel them to proceed without it, the prosecution must satisfy the court as to the creditworthiness of the witness and finally the court must be satisfied that no undue prejudice is caused to the defendant. Provided that appropriate safeguards are applied, and the judge is satisfied that a fair trial can take place, it may permit anonymity. In criminal cases, law enforcement agencies are responsible for providing support for intimidated witnesses and we are doing everything we can to ensure that they are assisted in doing so. We are working with them and other criminal justice agencies to ensure that intimidated witnesses are identified at an early stage and properly supported throughout the criminal justice process.</p>

We are planning to extend this support by facilitating access to a wider range of services through the establishment of a central services unit. We have also introduced new legislation which helps forces to secure the assistance they need from others to set up protection arrangements and provides additional safeguards for witnesses.

I have not yet been persuaded that the Task Force&#146;s legislative recommendations would make a significant contribution towards the five key outcomes for all our children described in &#145;Every Child Matters&#146;. The Government will continue to consider the recommendations, but will not take any measures that could compromise children&#146;s entitlement to education, sufficient rest, or appropriate leisure time.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 June 2006]:</i> Local authorities are placed under a duty, by section 22 of the Children Act 1989, to safeguard and promote the welfare of looked after children. The review of children&#146;s cases procedure, derived from section 26 of the 1989 Act, places a duty on local authorities to have in place a plan for the future care of looked after children and to appoint an Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO) to conduct the periodic statutory reviews of their cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="60622w0024.htm_para4"><a name="0606231000724">The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 is based on this care planning framework. As looked after children approach their 16th birthday, when they will become entitled to services as &#145;care leavers&#146;, their needs are required to be reassessed in order to inform the construction of their &#145;pathway plan&#146; (which should be based on their existing care plan). This plan sets out the services that are necessary to respond to the young person&#146;s needs, to prepare them for leaving care and then to support them after they have left care up until the age of 21, or longer, if they remain in an approved programme of education or training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="60622w0024.htm_para5"><a name="0606231000725">For young people with statements of special educational needs (SEN), including those who are looked after, there is a statutory transition planning process, which commences during Year 9 of their compulsory education. The purpose of this multi-professional process is to plan for young people&#146;s transition to adult life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="60622w0024.htm_para6"><a name="0606231000726">Where a child who is the subject of a SEN statement is also a looked after child, then their responsible local authority should co-ordinate the respective planning processes, in order to integrate their transition plan with their pathway plan, so that young people are provided with the necessary support in an integrated way before, during and after leaving care.</p>

The EU urged the Belarusian authorities to allow the people of Belarus to exercise their right of assembly and freedom of expression in line with their OSCE commitments and called upon the Belarusian authorities to immediately release those currently detained for exercising their political rights. This declaration was brought to the attention of the Belarusian authorities during the OSCE Permanent Council meeting 23 March.</p>

On 10 April, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a travel ban against 31 individuals deemed responsible for the fraudulent election and the subsequent crackdown on the opposition. On 18 May, EU Foreign Ministers agreed to impose further restrictive measures in the form of asset freezes on 36 individuals (including five people subject to earlier travel bans as a result of their involvement in the disappearances of opponents of the regime in 1999-2000 and the fraudulent parliamentary elections).

However, under a long standing agreement developing countries are currently shielded from paying the full costs of the safeguards component of the Regular Budget. The UK accordingly pays 6.137 per cent. of the total Regular Budget.</p>

 We are unable to provide a figure for the number of British citizens employed by private military companies. We estimate that there are around 40 private military and security companies registered in or operating from the UK who are engaged in activities overseas. Many companies operate with a core staff and employ others to fulfil contracts as and when required. They do not necessarily employ only British citizens.
