<a name="stpa_0">Controlled use of the hard shoulder during peak periods of traffic congestion is due to be implemented on the M42 in the West Midlands by March 2007 as part of the Highways Agency&#039;s Active Traffic Management pilot. In order to establish fully the effectiveness of these measures, the project will be monitored over a three-year period. Initial conclusions from operation of the scheme will be reviewed in 2008, but in the meantime it would be premature to develop a programme for the wider use of further hard shoulder running.

 The decision to float Qinetiq was taken by the Government, Carlyle and Qinetiq, informed by the advice from our joint financial advisers. This advice was given under contractually committed confidentiality agreements, and I am therefore unable to release it. It remains the Government&#039;s intention to retain a stake in Qinetiq after the flotation.

 The position regarding site closures will not change as a result of an Initial Private Offering. When QinetiQ vested as a company in 2001, MOD put arrangements in place to protect assets or capabilities that are of strategic importance to UK defence and security. These are enforced through the retention of a Government special share in QinetiQ, as well as through provisions in specific contracts such as the Long Term Partnering Agreement for test and evaluation.

Consequently, the receipts from the sale of assets go directly to the company. In relation to land sales, the Ministry of Defence put clawback arrangements in place to ensure that the taxpayer would benefit directly from any substantial subsequent increase in value.

1. The mean length of stay in (b1) is based on the patients that were resident in Surrey and Sussex Strategic Health Authority (SHA) area and (b2) is based on the patients that were treated in Surrey and Sussex SHA area.<br>

2. A length of spell is defined as a period of in-patient care within one health care provider that commences with the patient&#039;s admission and ends on the date of discharge. It may comprise of one or more finished consultant episodes.<br>

3. A length of stay (LOS) is calculated as the difference in days between the admission date and the discharge date, where both are given. LOS is based on hospital spells and only applies to ordinary admissions, i.e. day cases are excluded. Information relating to LOS figures, including discharge method or destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.<br>

This will include ensuring a robust risk analysis around activity, costs and income is consistent with the direction of modern health care delivery. This will incorporate the reduction of health inequalities, be clinically led and supported and be subject to full statutory public consultation.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are based on weighted data.<br>

2. The main source of data on the prevalence of obesity is the Health Survey for England (HSE). The sample size of the Health Survey does not allow figures to be produced to the level of parliamentary constituencies. For adults (aged 16 and over) figures are presented for England and Government office regions (GOR). Information is provided for the GOR which covers Westmorland and Lonsdale. For children (aged two to 15) national figures are presented using the national BMI percentile classification.<br>

3. The data presented are the most recent available. The available information is presented in this table, using the results of the HSE for 2002, 2003 and 2004. The method in which overweight and obesity is calculated is different for adults and for children (see background notes 3 and 4 for details).<br>

4. We are not able to identify how many people are estimated to be clinically obese, but are able to supply an estimate of the prevalence of obesity among children aged two to 15 and adults aged 16 and over.<br>

<sup>(28)</sup> For the total tenure dwellings, Council Tax Base 1 Supplement CTB1(S) return is used. It is regarded as the most reliable source but it does not have the tenure breakdown. It has been collected from 2000 but is considered to be only reliable from 2002 onwards. Hence HSSA is used for 2000 and 2001 figures. CTB1(S) data are for a specified date in November, which is different from both the HSSA (1 April) and RSR (31 March). The total figure may not equal to the sum of individual tenures&#039; figures if different sources were used or rounding has been applied. CTB1(S) data for 2005 are not yet available.<br>

<sup>(29)</sup> For the private sector tenure figures, before 2002, 1 April figures from HSSA are used. For the years 2002 through to 2004, to obtain the number of private sector (non RSLs) vacant dwellings LA, RSL and &quot;Other public sector&quot; figures were subtracted from the total vacant dwellings figure from the council tax data. This residual method is considered to be better than the less reliable private sector figure supplied in the HSSA return. (In order to adopt the residual method, CTBl&#039;s November figure has been taken to represent the data at 1 April. This assumes that the effect caused by these different snap-shot dates is insignificant. This is considered reasonable as properties become vacant and re-occupied and vice versa all the time i.e. there is a balancing effect. Hence over such a small period of time there should be minimal difference in the overall numbers between the two dates. The minute difference between 1 April and 31 March (from RSR) can also simply be ignored.)<br>

From April local authorities will have new powers to bring empty properties back into use.<br>

Although cultivation decreased significantly, the rise in yield in 2004&#150;05 was due to good weather and an absence of crop disease.

 Consular staff deal with some 4,000 deaths of British nationals overseas each year. Not all such deaths abroad are reported to the local British mission. But when a death is reported, and their next of kin (NoK) is not present, we will ask the UK police to inform them. If they are not in the UK, we will ask our consular staff in the country where they are to perform this duty. In exceptional circumstances, we may inform the NoK by telephone. Following initial notification, consular staff in London will normally write to the NoK in the UK with further information on how deaths are dealt with in the country concerned and providing a point of contact in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.

<a name="stpa_133">Consular staff in London can pass on to our staff overseas the NoK&#039;s wishes about dealing with the body. They will do their best to ensure that these are carried out. Responsibility for the treatment of bodies, including storage, post mortems and removal of organs, remains with the local authorities and practices may differ from the UK. Where this is the case, consular staff will inform the NoK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60120w24.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_134">Consular staff can advise on the cost of local burial or cremation, including providing a list of local funeral directors, or the transport of the body and personal property back to the UK. They can help transfer money from friends and relatives in the UK to pay any necessary costs. They cannot pay any burial, cremation or repatriation expenses or settle any debts.

<p>
<a name="60120w24.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">Where there is evidence of suspicious circumstances, consular staff can suggest to the NoK the best way to raise concerns with the local authorities. However, they cannot investigate deaths themselves. Consular staff will monitor the progress of investigations and, where applicable, any resulting court case. Consular staff can provide a list of lawyers if the NoK wish to appoint one to look after their interests in court.

 We regularly express our concern to the Cuban authorities about the treatment of dissidents and pro-democracy campaigners in Cuba. My noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister responsible for the Caribbean, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, raised this with the Cuban ambassador at the All Party Parliamentary Group Cuba meeting on 8 November 2005.

We carefully monitor the situation of a number of political prisoners and the UK, along with EU partners, continues to urge the Cuban Government to release all political prisoners.

 UK and EU policy is to encourage a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy in Cuba as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. As part of this policy we maintain a dialogue with pro-democracy campaigners in Cuba, as well as with members of the current regime.

 Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) who work on the front desk undertake a three-week induction course, which includes a half-day at the National Documentation Forgery Unit for an overview of forgery detection techniques. ECOs who have previously worked for the Home Office as Immigration Officers (IOs) attend a shorter course, as they already have a basic forgery detection background. Once ECOs arrive at the overseas Visa Section, further forgery and fraud detection training is conducted on an ad hoc basis, either by an Airline Liaison Officer, a local visa forgery specialist or by a Risk Assessment Unit as applicable. Administrative staff provide support such as undertaking employment, bank and documentation checks. Some checks may require local language skills, which many of our administrative staff are able to offer. They do not, however, have any decision-making powers though they do, nevertheless, receive local training as appropriate.
