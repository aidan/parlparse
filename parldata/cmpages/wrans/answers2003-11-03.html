<P>
<a name="31103w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Nottinghamshire is a very active member of the Local Criminal Justice Board and chairs two of its sub groups. One of these, which includes Victim Support, has engineered considerable improvements for dealing with vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. The group are now pioneering a system to provide updates and guidance to victims about their cases.
<P>

<a name="31103w01.html_para0">The Chief Crown Prosecutor also leads a group which is working on ways to improve communications between the agencies and the community. A regular bi-monthly bulletin is to be published for MPs and community groups which will explain the work of the board and the progress it is making in dealing with the offences that disrupt and disturb local communities. On behalf of the board, the Chief Crown Prosecutor is also leading an initiative to ensure all schools in Nottinghamshire are aware of the work and structure of the Local Criminal Justice Board.
<P>

<a name="31103w01.html_para1">The Crown Prosecution Service is also a major contributor to the board's delivery group which is tasked with narrowing the justice gap, bringing more persistent offenders to justice, and decreasing the cracked and ineffective trial rate.

<a name="31103w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Member states may request mutual legal assistance in gathering evidence by invoking the European Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance 1959. The UK prosecuting authorities can similarly seek assistance from other member states.
<P>

<a name="31103w01.html_para2">The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA) at the Home Office receives incoming requests for assistance. The Metropolitan Police, the Serious Fraud Office and Customs and Excise would gather evidence in England and Wales in response to an incoming request.
<P>

<a name="31103w01.html_para3">The European Community institutions established the European Anti Fraud Office (Office Europeen de lutte antifraude&#151;OLAF) in 1999 as a successor to the Task Force for the co-ordination of fraud prevention (UCLAF). It is an independent body, but remains part of the European Commission. This is the principle authority with responsibility for investigating fraud involving EU funds.

To ask the Solicitor-General, pursuant to her answer of 20 October,<i> Official Report</i>, column 352W, on Iraq, to the hon. Member for Medway, what constituted the effects in UN Security Council Resolutions 678 and 687 which, combined with Resolution 1441, provided a legal base for the use of force in Iraq.  [134468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave the hon. Member for Stone on 17 March, <i>Official Report</i>, column 515W.

To ask the Solicitor-General how many allegations of bribery of a foreign public official have been passed to the Serious Fraud Office since 14 February 2002; and how many of these allegations have resulted in an investigation; and whether any charges or arrests have been made under Part 12 since that date.  [132361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w01.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Part 12 of the Act came into force in February 2002. The Act is not retrospective and to prosecute under the provisions of Part 12, all elements of the overseas offence must have taken place after February 2002. The very nature of such offences is that they can take some time to surface, and as such a period where no prosecutions are instituted is to be expected.

 The DCA and Court Service take the health, safety and security of its employees very seriously. The Department has minimum security standards for county courts. The purpose of these standards is to ensure that appropriate security arrangements exist to protect staff, judiciary and court users. The Department undertakes a rolling programme of inspections to ensure that standards are being met. Security reviews also take place following any major incident. The standards are kept under review to ensure that they properly take account of any new or emerging risks and threats.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what action he has taken to remove circuit judges from the list of those permitted to try rape cases in the last two years.  [134939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie </B> 
: Section 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 states that the Lord Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor, can, by means of a practice direction, determine the cases or classes of cases suitable for allocation to High Court Judges, Circuit Judges and Recorders. From time to time successive Lord Chief Justices have issued such practice directions. In October 2001, the current Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, issued a practice direction entitled 'Directions by the Lord Chief Justice for the Classification of the business of the Crown Court and Allocation to Crown Court Centres'. This Practice Direction again determined that all High Court Judges and those Circuit Judges and Recorders, approved for that purpose by the Senior Presiding Judge, with the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice, can hear rape cases.
<P>

<a name="31103w02.html_para0">Judges trying rape cases are, of course, under constant public scrutiny. Where problems about judicial conduct become apparent to the Court of Appeal, the papers are referred to the relevant Presiding Judge, or to the Senior Presiding Judge personally. Any complaints, as well as any information suggesting possible inappropriate judicial behaviour, are immediately investigated, and reports in the media of judicial behaviour which, if correct, would give rise to concern, are checked for correctness and completeness by the Presiding Judges. It is, of course, open to the Lord Chief Justice, acting on his own initiative, or on the recommendation of the Senior Presiding Judge, to remove any individual authorisation. The Lord Chief Justice has not had occasion to do this in the last two years.

 The DTI is promoting the use of information technology solutions in a number of ways, both in conveying key messages to the business community and in the way the Department itself enables its own business processes.UK Online for Business was launched in September 2000 with the aim of promoting the benefits of information and communication technologies. The programme provides impartial advice on how e-business can help businesses reduce costs and increase efficiency by integrating their internal processes and working with customers and suppliers online. This core use of ICT and the more specific usage of e-business technologies to engage, for example, in e-procurement, accounts and collaborative design will provide business with the real potential to reduce and replace paper work.
<P>

<a name="31103w03.html_para1">The DTI is working with industry to establish a UK Oil Portal on the world wide web, which will enable all business processes associated with granting consents, approvals and regulatory reporting across all Government Departments to be undertaken electronically in a secure manner.

 The intention of the scheme to help those MPS members on the lowest pensions who left British Coal before or shortly after 1975 is to address the problem of retired mineworkers who receive very low pensions in spite of lengthy service in the industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w03.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Responsibility for the provision of mobile telephones for official purposes and for payment of the associated call charges was devolved to individual directorates, agencies and NDPBs at the end of March 1993. Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office for Government Commerce. This contract provides a call-off arrangement for DTI users at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is the total expenditure with DTI's main suppliers of mobile telephony. From the information currently available, expenditure last year was &#163;342,964 which included both equipment and call charges.

<P>
<P>

 The Clear Skies criterion does not stipulate the use of a digital thermometer where a differential temperature controller is used that can be set to limit the temperature of the water in the cylinder. Systems that do not employ this type of controller are required to use a digital thermometer as these give the clearest indication the system is working efficiently and also due to the high temperatures that can be reached give the most accurate temperature readings, therefore acting as a safety device to ensure individuals do not touch the system in error and get burnt in the process.

 The modelling shows that, with aviation fuel taxed at the same rate as motor vehicle fuel and with VAT imposed on all flights departing from UK airports, the number of passengers using UK airports would rise from 180 million in 2000 to around 315 million in 2030.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 11 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 372W, on runway capacity, what the net economic benefit would be from building a new wide spaced runway at Gatwick, counting only benefits to UK residents.  [135219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w04.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The net economic benefits, to UK residents only, of building a new wide spaced runway at Gatwick, over and above the benefits from maximum use of existing capacity at south east airports, is approximately &#163;2 billion, assuming all costs and benefits are discounted at 3.5 per cent. from 2000 to 2060. This estimate also takes into account a three year delay in benefits and includes a 44 per cent. increase in costs to reflect the risk in estimating costs for engineering works.

Furthermore the Secretary of State's Draft Priorities and Budget paper, which is currently out for consultation, proposes a new target for the Health and Personal Social Services designed to reduce the maximum waiting time for community care services for people who are medically fit for discharge so that by March 2006 no assessed person should wait for more than eight weeks in an acute hospital, other than in exceptional circumstances.

 By virtue of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, most Chagossians, together with most of the inhabitants of the other Overseas Territories, became British citizens (as well as Overseas Territories citizens) on the commencement of the Act on 21 May 2002. They thereby acquired the right to enter and take up residence in the UK. As regards their entitlement to state services the Chagossians who have come to the UK have the same rights, and are treated in the same way, as other British citizens coming here from overseas.

 In 2002, the Afghan Government considered it appropriate to offer a one-off programme of compensation payments to opium poppy farmers on the basis that the poppy crop had been planted during the Taliban regime. The UK provided financial assistance worth &#163;21.25 million in order to support the new regime's commitment to tackle drugs production but it was the responsibility of the Afghan authorities to

<a name="31103w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It has been possible since 1 August 1999 to export UK beef under the stringent rules of the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES). Beef exports resumed in September 2002 following the ending of foot and mouth disease restrictions and changes to the rules of DBES to make it easier for companies to participate. To date there are four slaughterhouses in the Scheme.
<P>

<a name="31103w07.html_para3">We submitted papers to the European Commission in support of our case for further changes to the DBES and our request for restrictions to be lifted so that the UK can trade on the same basis as other member states in April 2003 and June 2003 respectively. These papers as updated are currently being considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In addition, we have extended the period of rebates on DBES eligibility checks and Meat Hygiene Service supervision charges until the end of June 2004 for slaughterhouses entering the Scheme before the end of 2003. We have also identified with industry a number of key markets so that lobbying can be targetted effectively.

 The answer in respect of parts <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> parts (i) and (ii) for all Government Departs is shown in the attached table. Due to a number of 



<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 2003 : Column 412W</I><P>
uncertainties about the future structure of the Department arising from the Review of Rural Delivery and the Independent Review of Public Sector Relocation it is not possible to make accurate estimates of projected energy use in future years.
<P>

<a name="31103w07.html_para4">A number of measures are in place to reduce energy usage. From 1 November, all new contracts by central government department must meet minimum energy efficiency standards as well as value for money, when purchasing certain types of product. Types of products that must meet energy efficiency criteria include IT equipment, gas boilers, white goods (e.g. fridges and washing machines), televisions, lighting systems and light-bulbs.
<P>

<a name="31103w07.html_para5">All but the smallest Defra sites work to reducing energy below a site-specific benchmark. Energy audits are regularly commissioned for those above benchmark and remedial action is taken as necessary, On-going energy efficiency awareness campaigns seek co-operation from staff in economy of use.
<P>

<a name="31103w07.html_para6">In addition, new targets for energy use on the Government Estate are being developed under the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. Targets will be based on current Government policy on energy use and Will be published before the end of the year.

<i></i><i>Notes:</i><P>

<P>

<sup>(6)</sup> All data for fossil/heating energy is weather corrected to the 1990&#150;91 20 year degree day average This is for consistency sincere old campaign was weather corrected to the 1990&#150;91 20 year average and the new campaign to the 1999&#150;00 20 year average. This explains any differences between these figures and those published in the new campaign.<P>

<sup>(7)</sup> The Cabinet Office had four agencies transferred out of its control between 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01<P>

<sup>(8)</sup> The Cabinet Office had nine Regional Government Offices transferred to its estate between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02<P>

<sup>(9)</sup> Previously the Lord Chancellor's Department<P>

<sup>(10)</sup> The Department for Culture, Media and Sport have inconsistencies in their data for 2000&#150;01 and so 2001&#150;02 was used as their base year for the new campaign. This explains why their figures are the same for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 These inconsistencies also mean it is not meaningful to compare 2001&#150;02 with data prior to 1999&#150;2000<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> DFES use some heat that is produced by a CCL exempt source. This has been included with the fossil fuel<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs energy performances for the Main Estate and Laboratories in 2001&#150;02 include consumptions from the additional buildings and longer worked hours by staff dealing with the foot and mouth emergency The Main Estate also reflected additional fully air-conditioned buildings as part of a new Agency in DEFRA.



<P>

<sup>(13)</sup> The Department for International Development moved offices during 2001&#150;02, therefore their floor area for this year has been calculated based on the proportion of the year they were in each office<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> The Department for Trade and Industry had 3 Regional Government Offices transferred out of their estate in 2001&#150;02<P>

<P>

<sup>(15)</sup> The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions previously known as Department for the environment, Transport and the Regions.<P>

<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions had six Regional Government Offices transferred out of their estate in 2001&#150;02<P>

<P>

<sup>(17)</sup> The Department for Work and Pensions is the result of an amalgamation of the Department of Social Security and Employment Services which occurred in full in April 2002. Therefore previous separate returns for the two departments have been added together to allow comparison.<P>

<P>

<sup>(18)</sup> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office returns for 2000&#150;01 include their Wilton Park executive agency for the first time. This accounts for approximately 4 per cent. of the increase.<P>

<P>

<sup>(19)</sup> In 2000&#150;01 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office brought back into use the Old Admiralty Building, progressively relocating staff from 8 Cleveland Row, Cromwell House, 1 Palace Street and 20 Victoria Street. It retained reporting responsibilities for the vacated buildings until March 2001.<P>

<P>

<sup>(20)</sup> It was not possible to report consistently on a small proportion of prisons throughout the three years This was mainly due to missing or incomplete data on those specific prisons.<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> Inland Revenue 1999&#150;2000 data was fell to be too inconsistent to be used in the comparison, therefore 2000&#150;01 has been used in its place.<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> The Army included energy consumption from overseas bases other than Germany for the first time in 2001&#150;02; therefore this is entered separately<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> For the new campaign the financial year 2001&#150;02 is the baseline for the Army and this figure has been applied retrospectively to 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 but with energy consumption from 2 sites of the Joint Helicopter Command (Odiham and Benson) removed from the 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01. This therefore takes into account the fact that these two sites were transferred from the RAF to the Army in April 2001.<P>

<P>

Actual figures for these two sites have been used since they were recorded by the RAF prior to their transfer, hence the Army retrospective figure is not the same across these three years.<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> The Civil estate of the MOD figures do not include the London offices, with the exception of 3&#150;5 Scotland Yard This is due to difficulties in obtaining the data as these buildings are run under PFI contracts.<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> The civil estate of the MOD have not been able to provide figures prior to 2001&#150;02, therefore this is being used in previous years to allow comparisons 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 have been entered using figures from the last year the Civil estate completed a return<P>

<P>

<sup>(26)</sup> Defence Logistics Organisation were not in existence prior to 2000&#150;01, therefore the figures for 2000&#150;01 have been used in 1999&#150;2000 to allow comparison<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> In July 2001 the Defence Research Agency was split into DSTL and a private company, QinetiQ Therefore since July 2001 consumption in buildings used by QinetiQ have not been included<P>

<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> The RAF have made significant savings in 2001&#150;02 in part due to the transfer of two Joint Helicopter Command sites (Odiham and Benson) to the Army in April 2001<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what targets the Government have set for <i>(a)</i> energy efficiency in the UK, <i>(b)</i> waste minimisation, <i>(c)</i> marine pollution, <i>(d)</i> air quality, <i>(e)</i> climate change, <i>(f)</i> renewable energy, <i>(g)</i> fly-tipping, <i>(h)</i> packaging, <i>(i)</i> end of life vehicles, <i>(j)</i> the disposal of hazardous waste, <i>(k)</i> incineration, <i>(l)</i> recycling, <i>(m)</i> water quality, <i>(n)</i> coastal erosion, <i>(o)</i> fuel poverty, <i>(p)</i> flood defence, <i>(q)</i> wind power use, <i>(r)</i> domestic waste management, <i>(s)</i> industrial waste management, <i>(t)</i> landfill, <i>(u)</i> greenhouse gas emissions and <i>(v)</i> timber procurement.  [133258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Government's targets and goals include the following:
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para0">On climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy efficiency <i>(e, u, a),</i> the UK Climate Change Programme is designed to deliver our Kyoto Protocol target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12, as well as set us on a path towards our domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2010. The Government stated in the Energy White Paper our expectation for more than half the emissions reductions in the Programme to come from energy efficiency. In the White Paper, the Government also accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's recommendation that the UK should put itself on a path towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050.




<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 2003 : Column 416W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para1">For renewable energy and wind power use <i>(f, q)</i> the Government's aim is that by 2010, 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity should be supplied from renewable sources and our aspiration is that by 2020, to double renewables' share of electricity from our 2010 target. There are currently no specific targets for particular forms of renewable energy such as wind power.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para2">On fuel poverty <i>(o)</i> the goal of the Government and Devolved Administrations is the eradication of fuel poverty as far as reasonably practicable by 2016&#150;18, and in England and Wales for vulnerable households by 2010. In addition, in England we have a target to reduce fuel poverty among vulnerable households by improving the energy efficiency of 600,000 homes between 2001 and 2004.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para3">For domestic waste management, recycling and landfill <i>(l, r, t)</i> the targets are to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&#150;04 and 25 per cent. by 2005&#150;06 and, from the Landfill Directive, by 2010 to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995; by 2013 to 50 per cent. and by 2020 to 35 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para4">For waste minimisation and incineration <i>(b, k)</i> there are no set targets, but Government policy is to drive waste management up the waste hierarchy; this hierarchy has landfill at the bottom and minimisation at the top.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para5">For packaging <i>(h),</i> current (2002 and 2003) targets are 59 per cent. for recovery and 19 per cent. for material-specific recycling. A consultation on targets for 2004&#150;08 has just closed.




<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 2003 : Column 417W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para6">For the disposal of hazardous waste and industrial waste <i>(j, s)</i>, the Waste Strategy 2000 set a target to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of the 1998 level by 2005. This target includes hazardous waste.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para7">On end of life vehicles, the End of Life Vehicles Directive has not yet entered into force in the UK. The main targets will be 85 per cent. of all ELVs reused or recovered and 80 per cent. reused or recycled by January 2006, rising to 95 per cent. reused or recovered and 85 per cent. reused or recycled in 2015.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para8">There are currently no targets for fly-tipping <i>(g)</i>.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para9">For air quality <i>(d)</i>, the Air Quality Strategy sets targets for carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particles, sulphur dioxide, benzene and 1,3-butadiene.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para10">For water quality <i>(m)</i>, the Government has targets that at least 91 per cent. of English rivers achieve their river quality targets by 2005; and that at least 97 per cent. of bathing waters in England meet the mandatory coliform standards in the 2005 bathing season.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para11">For marine pollution <i>(c)</i>, the targets for reducing and eliminating marine pollution are generally those set out in the strategies on hazardous substances, radioactive substances and eutrophication agreed in the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic and relevant EC Directives.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para12">For coastal erosion and flood defence <i>(n, p)</i>, targets are to aim, by the encouragement of sustainable defence measures (including timely and effective flood warning systems), to have no loss of life through flooding; and by investing &#163;397 million over the Spending Review period (2003&#150;06), to reduce the risk of flooding to life, to major infrastructure, environment assets and to some 80,000 houses.
<P>

<a name="31103w08.html_para13">On timber procurement <i>(v)</i> the UK Government are committed to, seek to procure products made from timber that has been legally felled and grown in a forest or plantation managed to sustain biodiversity, productivity, vitality and to prevent harm to other ecosystems and indigenous or forest dependent people. Targets for sustainable public procurement will be published in early 2004 as part of the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate.

<a name="31103w09.html_para1">The functions of the GM Inspectorate at CSL are primarily to monitor compliance in England and Wales with consents issued under Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) both for placing on the market of GMOs as or in products (Part C) and for any other purpose (Part B) and to ensure that the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and related legislation are adhered to. The Inspectorate also conducts research to underpin its forensic work, and maintains links with inspectors elsewhere in the UK and throughout the EU.
<P>

<a name="31103w09.html_para2">The Inspectorate at HSE reports on the environmental aspects of contained uses of GMOs (other than GM micro-organisms) in England, Scotland and Wales, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and related legislation and monitors compliance with consents issued under Part B of Directive 2001/18 for clinical trials of GMOs.
<P>

<a name="31103w09.html_para3">The number of inspectors deployed reflects the numbers of consents and releases to be monitored, this varies from year to year. For example there are currently no GM crop trials taking place but there were over 120 crop trials in 2002.
<P>

<a name="31103w09.html_para4">The Inspectorates' performance is regularly monitored. A measure of their achievement is that there has been no evidence of harm to the environment from GM crop releases or from GMOs kept under contained use conditions.

 The Government see no need to amend the existing provisions under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which could be used to abate excessive noise from cars driven off road on public open spaces.

 Funding for surface water alleviation schemes comes from several different sources.

Grant paid to all authorities in England (in cash terms) is set out as follows. The figures in the table include items such as contributions to the Environment Agency for their work on flood warning including public awareness, catchment flood management plans and the new National Flood and Coastal Defence Database. They exclude supplementary credit approvals for local authorities and grant for projects to manage coastal erosion although significant flood risk benefits often arise from the latter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many coastal defence projects using timber are under way; how much funding her Department has provided for these projects; and what measures have been taken to ensure that this timber is from sustainable sources.  [134504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> Defra does not collect information on the materials used by operating authorities in coastal defence projects and it would involve disproportionate cost to do so.
<P>

<a name="31103w10.html_para0">Defra's guidance to operating authorities on the use of resources is that care should always be taken to minimise any detrimental impacts on biodiversity and the wider environment. It is preferable to use resources that are abundant rather than those that are scarce, and to use those resources as efficiently as possible. In addition, where timber is used, Defra encourages operating authorities to obtain tropical and native timbers from certified and sustainable sources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Plans for a central point of expertise on timber (CPET) are not yet finalised. I will make a further statement when the key decisions have been taken.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what responses her Department received to its consultations on the establishment of a central point of expertise on Government timber procurement regarding what type of central point of expertise on timber procurement should be established; and how she plans to act on these recommendations.  [134558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The concept of a central point of expertise on timber (CPET) was one of the recommendations made by consultants ERM in their scoping study report published on 6 August 2002. That 



<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 2003 : Column 425W</I><P>
report was made in the light of consultations with stakeholders, primarily at a meeting on 25 March 2002. A second consultation meeting was held on 2 September 2002 and written comments were received from various interested parties too. A record of the two meetings can be viewed on the Tropical Forest Forum's website at http://www.forestforum.org.uk/tradeb.htm
<P>

<a name="31103w10.html_para1">The recommendation for a CPET, which was broadly agreed by the stakeholders, suggested that the service could be provided either by a suitably qualified civil servant or by a commissioned service contract to an appropriately qualified consultant. Stakeholders generally held the view that they should be involved in the key decisions taken by a CPET to ensure transparency and a degree of independence.
<P>

<a name="31103w10.html_para2">Early in 2003 Defra held discussions with potential service providers to discuss how a commissioned service could be set up, how it would operate and what key outputs it would be expected to deliver. Following those discussions Defra has been considering the options available to ensure that the CPET would provide best value for money given the resources available. I will make a further statement when the key decisions have been taken.

[134577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since 1 September the Government have been reviewing options for establishing a central point of expertise on timber (CPET). Decisions on funding will be made when that review is completed and the CPET will be established as soon after that as possible.

 Although recent attacks in Iraq have received wide coverage, we should not forget that much of the country is remarkably stable. The vast majority of attacks against the coalition are concentrated in a limited area in and to the North West of Baghdad. Coalition forces, under US leadership, are working hard to counter these threats and will not be deflected from that mission. Across the country, meanwhile, increasing numbers of Iraqi police are on patrol, reconstruction continues and normal civil activities are pursued without incident.

 Servicemen in Baghdad are never off-duty, but the Baghdad Support Unit has been specifically set up to provide the support needed by all British Forces in Baghdad. Given the operational circumstances, all personnel are relatively comfortably accommodated. All United Kingdom staff have access to elements of the Operational Welfare Package including internet, welfare phones, radio, TV and sports equipment. Rest and Relaxation (R&R) is taken out of theatre, in either the UK or Germany.

 Force Protection is one of the highest priorities for United Kingdom Forces. Commanders on the ground employ appropriate Force Protection measures in accordance with threat assessments. The security situation is under constant review and Commanders adapt protection measures to reflect different circumstances. Coalition partners are responsible for the provision of their own force protection.

<a name="31103w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Greg Knight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many civilians in non-war situations have been rescued or aided by the British armed forces <i>(a)</i> in the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere in each of the last five years; and what the total cost to public funds was;  [129609]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The armed forces can rescue or aid civilians in a very wide range of circumstances, both at home and overseas.
<P>

<a name="31103w11.html_para4">With the exception of the RAF and Royal Navy's Search and Rescue (SAR) effort, information on the numbers of civilians rescued by the armed forces&#151;for example during land-based peace keeping operations, or routine deployments by RN ships at sea&#151;is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="31103w11.html_para5">Although the military SAR teams' primary purpose is to recover aircrew from crashed military aircraft, over 90 per cent. of callouts each year are to civilian incidents.

 There is no European Army or standing European Rapid Reaction Force nor any EU agreement to create one. Forces are offered by EU Member states for EU crisis management operations on a voluntary, case-by-case basis. This is no different from the arrangements for NATO crisis management operations. Member states have, however, set themselves a Headline Goal to be able to deploy within 60 days, and sustain for at least one year, some 50&#150;60,000 personnel on crisis management operations including smaller rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. I discussed the improvement of European military capabilities, in particular the creation of a European Defence Agency for capability development, with my EU counterparts at the Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers in Rome on 3&#150;4 October.

 The Ministry of Defence acts in concert with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Transport in seeking to tackle both piracy on the high seas, and maritime armed crime, which takes place in states' territorial waters. The Defence Intelligence Staff is actively engaged with national and international defence intelligence and maritime security communities, as well as commercial shipping and other organisations, to promote wider awareness, understanding, and co-operation in dealing with this growing world wide problem. The Defence Intelligence Staff also produces reports and analyses, including the "Worldwide Threat To Shipping", published on the World Wide Web at http://www. rnreference.mod.uk.
<P>

<a name="31103w13.html_para0">In addition, under international law, the Royal Navy, like all other navies, is obliged to render assistance to other mariners. The RN deploys ships worldwide on a range of tasks, and in the event that a RN ship encounters a clearly defined case of piracy on the high seas, RN policy is to counter the incident and arrest those responsible in accordance with the appropriate rules of engagement. Commanding Officers on all RN ships are given guidance on the threat, and on recommended courses of action. Responses to individual incidents of maritime armed crime in territorial waters are a matter for the State which holds jurisdiction.

<P>
<a name="31103w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) wrote to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence in March 2001 about allegations of fraud in connection with a sub-contractor to BAE Systems. The SFO informed the Permanent Secretary that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal investigation of the fraud allegations, but wished to bring it to his attention in case Government money might be involved. The Permanent Secretary established that the allegations were not of direct relevance to the Ministry of Defence, as they related to the role of a sub-contractor (Robert Lee International) to BAE Systems, and Government money had not been involved. Having been informed, however, that the Chairman of BAE Systems was already aware of this matter, the Permanent Secretary raised it with the Chairman, in the context of the Government's robust anti-fraud policy, for any further inquiries he deemed appropriate.
<P>

<a name="31103w13.html_para2">Since the allegations of fraud were not a matter for the Ministry of Defence, it was not considered necessary to bring them to the attention of the Secretary of State.

<P>
<a name="31103w14.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps his Department will take to encourage social landlords to take more enforcement measures against anti-social tenants; and what assessment he has made of the implications for the Anti-Social Behaviour Action Plan of the awarding of costs against the housing association in the case THCH v. Mr. Joseph Loomes.  [134580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w14.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is extending the range of tools that social landlords can use to tackle anti-social behaviour. These include broadening the range of landlords who can take out injunctions against tenants who behave in an anti-social manner, introducing a power for social landlords to demote secure and assured tenants to a less favourable form of tenancy, and generally ensuring that the responses to anti-social behaviour are appropriately focused on the needs of the community. In addition, social landlords will be required to prepare and publish policies and procedures in relation to anti-social behaviour, which will be available to tenants and other residents.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para2">It is the responsibility of social landlords to ensure that they use the appropriate enforcement measure to address the variety of anti-social behaviour cases that may arise. However, the general purpose of the measures in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill is to encourage and facilitate social landlords taking a more active approach in their dealings with anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para3">The definition of anti-social behaviour used in Part 2 of the Anti-social Behaviour Bill refers to conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance rather than behaviour which has actually caused nuisance or annoyance to named individuals. This makes it clear that landlords can use evidence from people other than the direct victims of the behaviour in proceedings for injunctions or demotion orders. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hopes that this will encourage more social landlords to be proactive in their management of such behaviour, for example by using professional witnesses in situations where individual victims are too scared or intimidated to give evidence.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para4">Regarding the specific case mentioned, it does not have any significant implications for the Anti-social Behaviour Action Plan, as the judgment is specific to that case. However, the broadening of injunctive powers included within the Anti-social Behaviour Bill mentioned earlier should make it easier for registered social landlords, including Tower Hamlets Community Homes, to undertake successful court action.

 I am not aware that any representations from Durham constabulary regarding problems with Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) have been received. We work closely with the Local Government Association and other interested parties concerning ASBOs.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para5">Legislative changes were introduced by the Police Reform Act 2002 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ASBOs in response to problems identified by the Home Office review of ASBOs published in April 2002. These changes were accompanied by Home Office guidance on both ASBOs and Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs) which was distributed to local authorities and police in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para6">The Anti-social Behaviour Bill builds on these improvements. The ASBO measures respond to the experiences of relevant authorities and the needs of witnesses and victims and are intended to close loopholes, making ASBOs more easily obtainable for all cases where they would be appropriate.

<P>
<a name="31103w14.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Government believes that there should be no change in the law relating to anonymity. In our view, informed and strengthened guidance to the police and the media is preferable to any change in legislation. The Police Code of Conduct provides that information which comes into the possession of the police should be treated as confidential. It should not be used for personal benefit and neither should it be divulged to other parties except in the proper course of police duty. Unauthorised disclosure of information on a suspect by a police officer is likely to be considered a breach of this Code. Such a breach would mean that an officer's conduct had not met the appropriate standard for the purposes of the Police (Conduct) Regulations, and disciplinary proceedings might commence. An officer could face dismissal or even prosecution, depending on the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para8">We have reached an agreement with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that it will amend its media and disciplinary guidelines to all forces to give greater prominence to the rules that govern the release of information about anyone suspected of, but not yet charged with, an offence.

<P>
<a name="31103w14.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> The Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative funded 684 CCTV schemes across England and Wales. The main areas covered by these schemes were town centres/shopping centres, car parks, residential areas, community shopping areas, hospitals, and rail stations.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para9">Under the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas (SRDA) Initiative, &#163;15 million was provided to improve security of small retailers, including the provision of CCTV where appropriate. In year one of the initiative (2001&#150;02) approximately 50 per cent. of the projects involved the installation or upgrading of CCTV in either individual shop units or covering shopping parades or precincts. In year two (2002&#150;03) it rose to almost 70 per cent. and in year three (2003&#150;04) it is 63 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para10">Both the CCTV and SRDA Initiatives are fully committed and drawing to a close. Future CCTV schemes can be financed through the Building Safer Communities (BSC) Fund, which is used to strategically tackle local crime reduction priorities through a number of interventions including CCTV. For 2003&#150;04 the fund provided local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships with &#163;72.3million.
<P>

<a name="31103w14.html_para11">Section 5 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires the responsible authorities of the CDRP to work in co-operation with other bodies, including education, in completing a crime and disorder audit and strategy. This engagement should ensure access to funding if it is considered a priority for the area. The CDRP can then consider whether installing CCTV cameras in schools and town centres fits with its local priorities.

 The Government takes very seriously the issue of trafficking people for sexual exploitation. At present, the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 contains an offence of trafficking for prostitution, which makes it an offence, punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment, to traffic someone (whether an adult or a child) into or out of the United Kingdom for the purposes of exploiting them in prostitution.




<P>
<P><I>3 Nov 2003 : Column 444W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31103w15.html_para7">The Sexual Offences Bill, introduced into the House of Lords on 28 January 2003 proposes new comprehensive offences of trafficking for sexual exploitation to replace the stop-gap offence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. These new offences tackle the movement of people into, within and out of the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and will also carry maximum penalties of 14 years imprisonment. The offence relating to trafficking within the UK applies equally to UK nationals trafficked from place to place in the UK, and to foreign nationals brought here and then moved around from place to place within the UK. This is the first time that the trafficking of UK nationals within the UK has been tackled in legislation.
<P>

<a name="31103w15.html_para8">Internationally, we are committed to addressing the issue of trafficking by our involvement with the EU Framework Decision on combating the trafficking of human beings, and the UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking.
<P>

<a name="31103w15.html_para9">We believe 14 years is the appropriate maximum penalty for trafficking an adult or child. This is the highest determinate penalty available to the courts and we consider that it provides a proportionate response to the range of criminal behaviour involved in trafficking. Where the trafficked person is also subjected to a sexual or violent offence, this can be charged in its own right and the offender will then additionally be liable for the penalties that attach to those offences.

There are 135 areas in Scotland which qualify for this relief, selected by reference to the national index of deprivation. The measure provides a major boost to businesses investing in commercial premises in Scotland.

 The UK is at the forefront of the international sporting community's fight against doping in sport The UK's national anti-doping policy is in line with the International Standard for Doping Control which requires sport's governing bodies to carry out a robust in and out of competition dope testing programme. This policy ensures that all sports in the UK have consistent anti-doping procedures and regulations that are transparent and fair to their athletes. It is a matter for the UK's national anti-doping agency, UK Sport, and sport's governing bodies to administer this policy.
<P>

<a name="31103w17.html_para2">UK Sport is working with sport's governing bodies, including the Football Association, on implementing the world anti-doping code into their drug testing programmes which will result in the harmonisation of anti-doping processes across countries by the 2004 Olympic games in Athens.

 The fair share initiative aims to ensure that those communities at greatest disadvantage do not lose out from Lottery funding. In its first year of operation, over &#163;31 million has been distributed through the Community Fund's grants programmes targeted at fair share areas; grants of between &#163;200,000 and &#163;2.2 million have been committed under the New Opportunities Fund's 'fair share: transforming your space' programme; and a &#163;50 million fair share Trust has been set up, to be delivered by the Community Foundation Network. The programme has achieved 90 per cent. of its projected funding target for 2002&#150;03. Now that these building blocks are in place, I expect to see a steady increase in the flow of funding over the remaining two years of the programme.

 The Olympics are not just about Sport; they will embrace the wider cultural life of the capital and of the country.

<a name="31103w17.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We are not aware of any such classification. In November 2002, the London Development Agency (LDA) report 'Improving the Quality of Visitor Accommodation in London' (commissioned by DCMS) estimated that 38 per cent. of London's serviced accommodation establishments were covered by the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) schemes for serviced accommodation. The LDA is working hard to encourage further subscription. The report also found that 57 per cent. of hotel rooms in London belonged to branded hotel chains.
<P>

<a name="31103w17.html_para9">This Department is committed to raising accommodation quality through the NQAS schemes, and through supporting skills and training in the industry. To tackle under-performing establishments that are ineligible for NQAS, we are currently piloting a 'Fitness for Purpose' initiative in six local authorities, including the London boroughs of Greenwich and Camden. The aim is to help failing accommodation providers to meet minimum legal requirements on health and safety, food hygiene, trading standards and fire safety.

 VisitBritain promotes Britain overseas as a tourist destination and it promotes England to the domestic market. The creative industries are an important element in its campaigns.

VisitBritain's current European "Short Breaks" campaign has a strong cultural message, taking advantage of the European Capital of Culture competition. Other examples of campaigns include a "movie map" which uses film locations to encourage tourism, campaigns based around individual films such as Harry Potter and Johnny English, the sponsorship of a forthcoming Britain-related fashion show in Argentina and the launch of an animated film in Japan based on the famous 'Moving Castles' Novel by Dianna Wynne Jones.

 No assessment has been made of the implications of access to fieldwork in schools for the promotion of environmental awareness. It is important to note, however, that there are requirements for Education for Sustainable Development both in Geography and in Science, including science GCSE and AS/A Level qualifications.
<P>

<a name="31103w18.html_para17">Although the National Curriculum is not designed to provide vocational training, under the proposed 14&#150;19 reforms set out in the Green Paper 'Excellence and Opportunity', young people would have greater flexibility in selecting their options, and may choose to pursue courses which cover environmental impacts.
<P>

<a name="31103w18.html_para18">No assessment has been made of whether the encouragement of fieldwork as a teaching method is adequately supported by teacher training courses. However, under the standards for qualified teacher status and requirements for initial teacher training, teacher trainers use non-school settings such as fieldwork, visits to museums and other off-site locations. All newly qualified teachers are now required to be able to plan opportunities for pupils to learn in out-of-school contexts. Teacher training providers can also take trainees' prior achievement into account. This means, for example, that a trainee teacher who has previously worked in a fieldwork centre can have this experience taken into account when their training needs are assessed.
<P>

<a name="31103w18.html_para19">In addition to this, we anticipate that, over time, our new Science Learning Centres, the preferred suppliers for six of which along with a national centre were recently announced, will help science teachers and technicians to develop their skills in out of the classroom teaching.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2003]:</i> Many primary teachers already receive non-contact time as part of their regular timetable.

<a name="31103w19.html_para0">The costs of implementing this contractual change in primary schools will vary. Many schools have already done so; others will need to take a rigorous look at how they use their existing resources. The more radical approach a school takes in pursuing workforce reform, the lower the cost is likely to be. Schools that abandon unnecessary tasks; reform their use of support staff; maximise the contribution of ICT and reduce reliance on expensive supply teachers will be able to deliver guaranteed PPA time from their base budgets.

 This Department has not made an assessment of the effect on the skills base if those on low incomes choose not to seek new employment. The recent Skills Strategy White Paper sets out a number of measures aimed at ensuring individuals have the skills they need to be employable, and work productively in a flexible labour market. In addition, the 'Department for Work and Pensions is committed to making work pay for all those who are able to work, and to supporting households, including low-income households, in sustaining employment.

The new working tax credit has been extended to people aged 25 and over without children. If people receive the child tax credit, this continues to be paid direct to the main carer throughout any changes in employment.

 Student loans are not commercial loans. The Government uprates the value of the outstanding loan in line with the general rate of inflation, to make sure that all borrowers pay back the same amount that they borrowed in real terms. We understand that some students believe that this precludes them from taking out such a loan. However, a recent survey of students by religious group, conducted for the report "Minority Ethnic Students in Higher Education", found that 64 per cent. of Muslims reported having a student loan; that was only slightly less than Hindu groups (66 per cent.), Sikh groups (66 per cent.) and Christian groups (69 per cent.) <sup>1</sup>

 The similar geography of teenage pregnancy and deprivation suggests that while there is still much work to do, the encouraging 10 per cent. decline in England's under 18 conception rate from 1998 to 2001 has been largely achieved through targeted work in deprived localities with high numbers of conceptions by:
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 13 February 2003, to the hon.

 The total proceeds from the sale of 395 tonnes of gold were US$3,496 million. At the afternoon fix on 31 October 2003, the total value of this gold was US$4,908 million. The gold sales between July 1999 and March 2002 reflected a prudent decision to reduce over-exposure to a single asset in the net reserves portfolio. Thus, the difference between these two figures quoted do not represent the real financial impact of the sales, as the proceeds from the gold sales were invested in euro, dollar and yen interest-bearing assets that have also increased in value over this period. The gold sales reduced risk by around 30 per cent. (as measured by value-at-risk) and are not expected to deliver a loss in return when measured over the medium to long-term; the appropriate time horizon for such a decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w23.html_spnew13"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 There have been no administrative problems which have significantly affected pensioners' ability to apply for Pension Credit. The Pension Credit application line (0800 99 1234), which is the main method of applying, is working well and has taken over 1.1 million calls since it became operational on 7 April. Calls are free (except for some mobile phones) and friends and family can use the application line and apply on pensioners' behalf if they are unable to make the call themselves. The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances, including a textphone number and a paper application form. An application form can be downloaded from the Pension Credit website at www.thepensionservice.gov.uk. Pensioners can also be put in touch with The Pension Service's local service and can be seen face to face either in a local surgery or, where appropriate, in the pensioner's home. Our marketing campaign, at the heart of which is a direct mail pack to pensioner households, is designed to produce a steady build up of Pension Credit applications. I refer the hon. Member to the written statement given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State (Mr. Andrew Smith) on 14 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 5WS.

1. Figures for 2010 onward are consistent with the Government Actuary's Quinquennial Review of the National Insurance Fund laid before parliament on 27 October 2003. 1997/98 is based on DWP outturn information and 2002&#150;03 is based on estimated outturn information.<P>

2. All figures expressed as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product<P>

3. Expenditure is for Great Britain<P>

4. The amounts shown for SERPS and Second State Pension in the above table only include projected expenditure on additional retirement pension. Amounts paid with incapacity benefit and widows'/survivors' benefits are excluded. Expenditure on contracted-out rebates, for employees who contract-out of second state pension, is not included in the figures shown above.<P>

5. All projections assume current government policy remains in place until the end of the period. The estimates for basic state pension are based on uprating (in April) of an average 0.25 per cent. above the relevant (previous September) 12 months' Retail Price Index. This is to reflect the current policy for uprating the basic state pension by 2.5 per cent. in years where RPI uprating would be lower than 2.5 per cent.<P>

We will monitor its impact and work with developing countries to ensure that its implementation helps promote access to essential medicines.

 Debt relief must be linked to poverty reduction. Each country that has qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' (HIPC) Initiative must develop and implement a nationally-owned and led poverty reduction strategy.

 The Baiji refinery provides more than half of Iraq's refined oil products. Major maintenance work on it is much needed and long overdue. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, the most urgent work will begin in December 2003, with one of the refinery's three units being taken out of service at a time. It is expected that the initial focus will be on the gasoline equipment, while keeping the diesel and kerosene plants working as far as possible throughout the winter. Major work is expected to be deferred until the spring in order to allow for additional fuel reserves to be built up. Taking the refinery off-line when demands are high and reserves are low could risk disrupting supplies significantly. Meanwhile, fuel is being imported to help meet current demand.

 UK forces are maintaining a long-term presence in the Arabian Gulf to intercept smugglers. Coalition forces have recently been supported by HMS Sutherland and HMS Kent. The UK is also training the Iraqi Riverine patrol service to monitor the Shatt al Arab waterway and Khawr Zubayr. Once trained, an element of this force may provide the core element of Iraqi Coastal Defence force.

<P>
<a name="31103w28.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 With the exception of kerosene, the supply of fuel in Iraq at the end of September was the best since the cessation of hostilities. This was largely due to extensive imports of gasoline, LPG and diesel by the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organisation. Imports are expected to continue into 2004 while Iraq's refining capacity recovers and the country regains self-sufficiency in fuel. The Ministry of Oil is also working towards establishing adequate reserve stocks to provide a buffer for unexpected disruptions in supply or surges in demand.
<P>

<a name="31103w28.html_para4">The distribution of fuel is a challenge. Pipelines are susceptible to sabotage and theft, and the dilapidated state of many limits their capacity. Road and rail transport, which is being used to help compensate for these problems, also faces capacity constraints.

 According to the Malian National Campaign Against Tuberculosis, the number of reported tuberculosis cases in Mali has risen from 1,886 cases per year in 1995 to 2,757 in 2002. This is partly due to the prevalence of the disease among HIV/AIDS sufferers. The Malian Government have recently launched a fresh initiative to persuade tuberculosis patients to come forward for treatment.

<a name="31103w29.html_para0">DFID does not have a direct development assistance programme to Mali. Our assistance is mostly channelled through multilateral agencies, including the EC, and amounted to an estimated &#163;12 million in 2001. However, DFID is playing a major role in supporting tuberculosis control worldwide. We support tuberculosis research programmes at the London and Liverpool Schools of Tropical Medicine, as well as providing significant contributions to the Medical Research Council and the World Health Organisation to tackle tuberculosis and other diseases. We have also committed US$280 million over seven years to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).

 DFID works with international partners to monitor global trends in progress towards the Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health and its associated target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75 per cent. between 1990 and 2015. The report on maternal mortality in 2000 published on 20 October by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and the UN Population Fund estimates that there were 529,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2000, with a maternal mortality ratio of 400 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The majority of the burden is borne in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
<P>

<a name="31103w29.html_para1">The report is important in highlighting the magnitude of the problem. Inadequate information systems in many poor countries mean there is a high degree of uncertainty around the estimates and so they are less useful in assessing trends over time. A proxy indicator for monitoring trends is the proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker. Skilled attendant coverage in developing countries increased from 42 per cent. in 1990 to 52 per cent. in 2000 but there was substantial variation between regions. Coverage rose significantly in East and South East Asia and in Northern Africa. It is highest in Latin America, at 85 per cent. In contrast, there has been little progress in

As a consequence of the temporary increase in funding for Iraq, which we expect to return to middle income status soon, we will also need to move a further estimated &#163;50 million from planned middle income country programmes to low income country programmes. This in line with our commitment to the 90 per cent. target. The reallocations of planned expenditure should be viewed in the context of a development assistance budget that will increase by &#163;900 million over the current spending review period 2003&#150;06.

 Since it declared independence from the southern Somalia, Somaliland has developed stability and greatly improved security. In December 2002 and April 2003, Somaliland organised successful municipal and presidential elections, which cemented its democratic credentials and helped to maintain security and stability. Unfortunately, in recent weeks there have been three murders of European expatriates in Somaliland including, on 20 October, the murder of two British schoolteachers in the town of Sheikh. There is no hard information on the motives for these killings and we await the outcome of on-going investigations by the Somaliland authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w30.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 As a result of earlier studies, which had identified high fuel costs of power generation and significant potential for wind energy, three wind turbines were installed on Deadwood Plain in St. Helena in 1999. The cost, which totalled approximately &#163;300,000, was met by DFID from our development assistance programme to St. Helena. Due to various technical problems, the turbines operated only intermittently until October 2002. Since then, they have not been in operation at all. Although this performance of the turbines has been extremely disappointing, fuel savings totalling some &#163;140,000 did accrue to St. Helena while they were operational. This suggests that wind power should be economically viable for St. Helena, under conditions of continuous wind turbine operation. With further DFID support, therefore, the St. Helena Government has commissioned work to investigate the problems that arose and to propose options for the future. The report, which should be available by the end of this year, will be carefully considered jointly by the St. Helena Government and DFID.

 All embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in St. Helena entails transit by launch between the harbour steps at Jamestown and ships anchored offshore. The St. Helena Government's policy, which we fully support, is that safety must be paramount in this process. All reasonable precautions are taken, and are regularly reviewed, to ensure that this is the case; and, on occasions where sea conditions are particularly difficult, passenger transit may be suspended altogether. Past studies have not demonstrated to DFID satisfaction that a breakwater, which could be costly to construct, would substantively improve the situation and/or be justifiable on technical and economic grounds. Although the St. Helena Government remains committed to the concept, therefore, we hitherto have not agreed to fund it. In their current proposals for possible European Union assistance, however, the St. Helena authorities are including plans for wharf improvements and an investigation of alternative options for passenger landing arrangements at Jamestown. We shall be monitoring this proposed work very carefully; and we will keep the matter under regular review, in consultation with the St. Helena Government.

 The Government acknowledges the damaging impact that dumping and trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries' agriculture sectors. We fully support the commitment made at the Doha Ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.

<a name="31103w30.html_para0">The UK has long advocated the reform of the CAP to reduce its trade distorting impacts and to enable farming in Europe to become more sustainable and market focussed. The deal agreed by EU Agriculture Ministers on 26 June this year marks a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The decoupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which results in dumping and harms developing countries. Proposals for reform to other EU commodity regimes, including cotton have been submitted and are currently under discussion.

A report by the Warwick Institute for Employment Research (IER) concluded that the use of the NES for calculating the ACA does not result in any significant bias as a consequence of the inability to standardise for education, because of the detailed information on the occupation and industry of survey participants contained in the NES.

There are 1,262 wards in England which qualify for this relief, representing the bottom 15 per cent. of the national index of deprivation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures he has taken to improve access to treatment for sufferers of chronic diseases.  [134803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w33.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Our substantial increased investment in the national health service will have the effect of improving access to treatment for all patients, including those with chronic diseases. Over the years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, expenditure on the NHS in England will increase on average by 7.4 per cent. a year over and above inflation&#151;a total increase over the period of 43 per cent. in real terms. This will take the total spent on the NHS in England from &#163;56 billion in 2002&#150;03 to over &#163;90 billion in 2007&#150;08 and lead to better services for all patients.
<P>

<a name="31103w33.html_para8">Maximum waiting times have fallen over the past few years and will continue to do so. By the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant will fall to three months and the maximum wait for in-patient treatment will fall to six months. This will help all NHS patients, including those with chronic disease.
<P>

<a name="31103w33.html_para9">We are also producing a national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. The NSF, which we hope to publish by December 2004, will concentrate on neurological conditions and also have generic value for people with other long-term conditions and disabilities and will inform the future planning of services.

 The 2003 reference cost collection exercise has for the first time included a requirement for the collection of data relating to services provided to national health service patients by the private sector. However, this does not include services commissioned from the voluntary and charitable sectors, and therefore it will not be possible to draw conclusions about the cost of activity carried out for the NHS by non-NHS providers as a whole.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health definition of an under-doctored primary care trust (PCT) is that its number of whole time equivalent (wte) NHS Plan general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 weighted population is less than the national average. As at the March 2003 workforce census the national average was 55.55 wte NHS Plan GPs per 100,000 weighted population.

<a name="31103w34.html_para1">PCTs have been given an average cash increase exceeding 30 per cent. over the three years 2003&#150;06. PCTs will be able to use these extra resources to deliver on both national and local priorities including recruiting additional staff in primary care. Guidance issued to PCTs entitled "Shifting the Balance of Power: New arrangements For Managing General Medical Practitioner Appointments" encouraged all PCTs to increase GP numbers, particularly in under-doctored areas. PCTs are also able to recruit additional GPs supported by general medical services non cash limited funds.

<a name="31103w34.html_para4">Under-doctored areas have also been prioritised in the distribution of the planned increase of 550 GP registrar training posts up to 2004.

 This Government recognise that to build quality services, the national health service relies upon the skill and dedication of staff, of whom over 70 per cent. are women.
<P>

<a name="31103w35.html_para0">Part-time working and extended maternity leave are well-established features of NHS employment, and have been for some time. However, as part of the drive to support all staff in the NHS, the NHS Plan, launched in July 2000 introduced the Improving Working Lives Standard, requiring a commitment by every NHS employer to offer a wide range of flexible employment opportunities by April 2003.
<P>

<a name="31103w35.html_para1">The NHS increasingly offers a wide variety of flexible working opportunities for all staff and supports this as a principle in all cases. A central requirement is to deliver practical measures which address the potential conflict between offering people the opportunity to work more flexibly and maintaining continuity of care on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis.
<P>

<a name="31103w35.html_para2">The NHS childcare strategy has provided central funding of over &#163;70 million over three years to develop up to 150 extra on-site nursery facilities by 2004. So far, 140 nursery schemes, including both new and extensions to existing nurseries have been funded. Funding has been provided to help trusts and primary care trusts to employ childcare co-ordinators. The Government have committed a further &#163;100 million to extend the NHS childcare strategy to ensure that the needs of all staff are met, including other forms of childcare for pre-school children and for older children, and to upgrade and subsidise existing NHS nurseries.

<P>
<a name="31103w35.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> Meat sold for human consumption at retail or in catering establishments has to comply with the Food Safety Act 1990 and regulations made under the Act. These regulations require animals slaughtered in licensed slaughterhouses to undergo veterinary ante-mortem inspection, and their carcasses to be subjected to post-mortem inspection and health marked, if found fit for human consumption, under the supervision of an official veterinarian. There are no specific regulations dealing with origin of meat served in restaurants. However, if origin information is provided it must not be false or misleading.

<P>
<a name="31103w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There will not be a specific allocation of capital to the financing facility. Monies disbursed will be a function of the aggregate of each national health service foundation trust's ability to borrow under the Prudential Borrowing Code and not of centrally allocated budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31103w35.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 No. The areas for the public constituency in question will be limited to England.

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 2003] :</i> The National Health Service University (NHSU) will provide additional high quality learning opportunities at all levels for people working in health and social care. It will not generally levy charges on students for the learning opportunities offered in its initial roll-out phase. The NHSU is currently working with local employers and commissioners, through strategic health authorities, to develop its longer-term business model, and expects to attract income from a wide range of public and private sources. Any decision to levy charges on NHS staff will take account of the need to increase and widen access to education and training within health and social care. There will be appropriate consultation on these matters with all the relevant stakeholders, including employers in the sector and trades unions.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2003]:</i> Mail order and internet-based pharmacies are governed by the provisions of the Medicines Act 1968 and, if they provide national health service pharmaceutical services, by the NHS Act 1977. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Medicines Act and related legislation which regulate the sale and supply of medicines. The MHRA does not routinely monitor internet-based pharmacies. However, its enforcement group investigates any allegations of illegal activity of which it is made aware.

 The national school fruit scheme will entitle every child aged four to six in local education authority schools to a free piece of fruit each school day. Children aged seven or three will also receive fruit where they share classes with children aged six or four. Region-wide pilots for the scheme have been introduced so far in four of the nine English regions, with funding from the New Opportunities Fund, and nearly half of all eligible children in England are in schools that are participating in the scheme. We are examining the practicalities of the scheme through these pilots before rolling it out nationally next year.

<P>

<a name="31103w39.html_para0">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. There was an increase of 2.4 million sight tests between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 in England. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.
<P>

<a name="31103w39.html_para1">However, some patients aged 60 and over will be eligible for sight tests for other reasons as well, for example, on income grounds. The classification for such patients will depend on the patient and the practitioner. The increase in the number of sight tests for those over 60 may therefore reflect an increasing awareness of the eligibility of over 60s.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> maximum waiting time in (i) England, (ii) each strategic health authority and (iii) each NHS trust for CT scans in each of the last six years.  [132781]

<a name="31103w39.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Data is not collected centrally on waiting times for computed tomography (CT) scans. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for a scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, dependent on the clinical priority of all patients waiting to be scanned.
<P>

<a name="31103w39.html_para3">Where a CT scan forms part of the diagnostic process for a patient urgently referred with suspected cancer, this will be covered by the target of a maximum two months wait from urgent referral to first treatment, which will be in place for all cancers by the end of 2005.
<P>

<a name="31103w39.html_para4">The Cancer Capital Modernisation Fund and the NHS Cancer Plan has provided funding for 200 new and replacement CT scanners to increase the capacity of diagnostic services by 2004.
