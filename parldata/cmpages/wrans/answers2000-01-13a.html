<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_wqn0"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service personnel who served in the Falklands conflict originated from Northern Ireland; and in which <i>(a)</i> regiments and <i>(b)</i> other parts of the services they served.  [104394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not hold a centrally collated record of the origins of servicemen and their individual deployments that contains the information requested for all three Services. Full details could be provided only at disproportionate cost, following detailed examination of individual records.
<P>

<a name="00113w01.html_para0">However I can advise that available data show that some 95 Army and 29 RAF individuals who served in the Falklands operations are recorded as having originated from Northern Ireland and I will write with further details concerning regiments and units in which they served.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 21 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 468W, concerning the move of the Defence Vetting Agency to York, if he will estimate the number of people living within 50 miles of York who will be working at the Defence Vetting Agency.  [104667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Agency is in the early stages of forming up at York. It will be taking on staff (mainly from HQ 2nd Division but also through local recruitment) at various points between now and early 2001, when the Agency will reach its full strength at York of 181. Many posts are still unfilled.
<P>

<a name="00113w01.html_para1">It is expected that all permanent staff working for the Agency at Imphal Barracks in the eventual workforce will live locally and commute daily. It is not our normal practice to check on the distance that individuals commute, but a random survey suggests that the overwhelming majority of our York-based workforce will live within 50 miles of York.
<P>

<a name="00113w01.html_para2">In my earlier answer I explained that, in addition to the 181 DVA staff who will be based at Imphal Barracks, the Agency would employ 130 Investigating Officers who would work from their homes. The location of these Officers is tied to the major areas of MOD employment across the UK. The Officers are tasked from, and report to the Agency at York, but will very rarely travel there.

<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the outcome of the feasibility study into compulsory mobilisation of the Territorial Army to sustain peace support operations in the Balkans.  [105415]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Feasibility Study has concluded that compulsory mobilisation is feasible in both legal and practical terms. This will enable the TA to make a major contribution to front-line operations and reflects and supports the intent of the Strategic Defence Review that the Territorial Army should be usable. At the same time, as a result of the reduction in UK force levels in the Balkans, we judge that compulsory mobilisation is not operationally necessary at this time. We will keep the possibility of compulsory mobilisation under constant review in the light of the prevailing operational conditions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Department asks the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for advice on all Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) applications with an agriculture element to ensure that there are no EC restrictions on projects being eligible for assistance in this respect. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible for decisions taken on awards of RSA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the level of IPPC charges in other EU member states; and if he will make a statement.  [104101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The system of IPPC charges, which is still under consideration, is the responsibility of the Environment Agency. The Agency consulted on an interim charging regime last autumn, and is considering the outcome of that consultation. The Agency will be monitoring the implementation of IPPC in other member states including their charging policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government received the Low Pay Commission's Report on the impact of implementation of the national minimum wage at the end of December. Once Ministers have had an opportunity to consider the Report's findings, both the Report and the Government's response to it will be published.

[104056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The service standards for applications involving a medical investigation are published in the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's Service Guide. This states that the Agency's Medical Unit aims to complete its investigations:

Under the agreement, plantings for the farm scale GM crop evaluations are limited to 20-25 fields per crop per year, subject to the advice and requirements of the independent Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the programme. This covers the plantings through to 2002 for the crops in the programme--GM fodder maize, and spring and winter oilseed rape, all modified to be tolerant to a herbicide. Subject to the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee, a fourth crop, beet modified to be tolerant to

 During my visit to CPS Merseyside in September last year, I was able to see at first hand the efforts made by the CPS and other local agencies to reduce the time it took to prosecute persistent young offenders.

<a name="00113w04.html_para0">The Review of the CPS led by Sir Iain Glidewell reported in June 1998. It recommended the creation of a new post, Director of Business and Information Systems. That post has been filled and an Information Systems Strategic Plan developed. This plan provides a two-step approach to delivering effective IT support to lawyers and caseworkers, as well as that needed for effective administration and control.
<P>

<a name="00113w04.html_para1">In July 1999, the CPS was awarded &#163;12 million from the Government's Capital Modernisation Fund. This money together with existing CPS resources will fund Step 1, the Connect 42 project. This will provide access for lawyers and caseworkers to networked PCs across the 42 CPS Areas. It will also enable secure electronic mail connections with its partners in the Criminal Justice System.
<P>

<a name="00113w04.html_para2">Step 2 of the Modernisation Programme, the Compass project, is procuring a Managed Service through a PFI contract. This will use the IT infrastructure of Step 1, and complement it with a case management system designed to meet the needs of front line CPS staff. It will provide the ability to work with electronic case files and allow information to be exchanged much more easily with other organisations in the criminal justice system through speedier electronic communications between computer systems.

 In February 1997 limited rights of audience were granted to employed solicitors, allowing them to appear alone in appeals and uncontested cases in the Crown Court or to act as juniors in cases in which leading counsel are instructed. CPS higher court advocates began to exercise those rights in August 1998, since then the volume of work undertaken by them has gradually increased.
<P>

<a name="00113w04.html_para5">The impression that the Attorney-General and I have gained from our visits to various parts of the country is that the higher court advocates have been well received by judges and the Bar.

<a name="00113w04.html_para6">By mid-2000 nearly 200 CPS solicitor higher court advocates will have been trained. The CPS is now considering its future strategy for deploying its lawyers in the Crown Court in the light of the Access to Justice Act 1999, which grants full rights of audience to all lawyers.

 After extensive consultation, the Lord Chancellor has decided to restore "price paid" to the Land Register. This is consistent with the Government's policy to improve the house buying process by making important information more readily available, particularly at an early stage of the process. Information included in the Land Register should be as comprehensive as is practical and proper--property value is of great interest to people and there is no good reason why it should not be available.
<P>

<a name="00113w05.html_para0">The information will not be inserted retrospectively. All applications received by the Land Registry on or after 1 April 2000 will have the price paid entered on the Land Register where it is practicable to do so. As with other data, the Land Register will provide the current information. Hence, on a subsequent change of ownership, the original price paid will be removed from the register.
<P>

<a name="00113w05.html_para1">This change in practice will bring the Land Register for England and Wales into line with many other jurisdictions where the price paid for property is a matter of public record. This includes most of Europe and, notably, Scotland where this information has been publicly available since 1617 without appearing to cause any problems.

 The Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, which is currently being considered by Parliament, will reinforce the link between rights to benefits and responsibilities to society. Offenders aged 18 to 59, who are referred to Court for breaching a specified community sentence, will be subject to a benefit sanction from the first practicable benefit payday after the relevant benefits office receives a notification from the Probation Service that court proceedings have been initiated.

 It is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of people who will have their benefit withdrawn or reduced following a breach of a community sentence. Data collected by the Home Office indicate that, in England and Wales, around 25,000 people a year are currently referred to Court for breach proceedings. No information is held about how many of these are in receipt of Social Security benefits.

Up to 31 December 1999, the Norwich offices have worked 313 hours in dealing with claims to Widows Benefits and 2,823 hours on Retirement Pensions. Not all the cases dealt with have had arrears of benefits due.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many ancillary workers affected by the Social Security Commissioner's decision CIS/14661/1996 of December 1997 have <i>(a)</i> inquired about ex-gratia payments and <i>(b)</i> been given ex-gratia payments; and for what average amounts.  [104104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w06.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 A total of 1,950 requests for ex-gratia payments have been received from ancillary workers affected by CIS/14661/1996. Of these, one ex-gratia payment of &#163;337.03 has been made and 206 cases remain outstanding.
<P>

<a name="00113w06.html_para8">Ex-gratia payments can be considered only where there has been a loss of statutory entitlement to benefit. Since subsequent legal decisions reversed the effect of CIS/14661/1996, the current position is that there was never any statutory entitlement to JSA during school holiday periods for this group. Further ex-gratia payments cannot therefore be made under the law as it currently stands.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what factors underlay his decision not to pay the Winter Fuel Payment for 1999 to 2000 to people who reach the age of 60 after September 1999 but before 31 March 2000; and if he will reconsider his policy.  [104082]<P>

 In order to issue Winter Fuel Payments automatically, without incurring disproportionate administration costs, most eligible people aged 60 and over are identified through official departmental computer records. These records hold the key information needed 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jan 2000 : Column: 228W</I><P>
to establish entitlement. The records are used to decide whether people are entitled for at least a day during a specified qualifying week.
<P>

<a name="00113w06.html_para9">The current process for identifying those who are entitled and determining the amount payable takes around 10 weeks. Therefore, to ensure people receive the payments in good time to help with their winter fuel bills, the qualifying week must precede the onset of winter. This winter the qualifying week began on 20 September. Making the payments as early as possible in the winter ensures that the very elderly, who will include the vast majority of those who are most frail, have their payment when they need it.

<a name="00113w06.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how men aged 60 to 64 will claim the winter fuel payment for 1999 to 2000 and previous years; and what is his estimate of the cost for 1999 to 2000 and previous years.  [104061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00113w06.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 It will be necessary to determine the names and addresses of people who are newly eligible for Winter Fuel Payments. As the information we hold may not be up to date, we will need to introduce a claims process for Winter Fuel Payments. This process will need to be developed carefully and appropriate IT systems built to deal with claims. The Benefits Agency are currently working on the operational issues for delivery.
<P>

<a name="00113w06.html_para11">There is no need for people newly eligible for Winter Fuel Payments to contact the Benefits Agency now. An announcement will be made, and an advertising campaign will begin in a matter of months.
<P>

<a name="00113w06.html_para12">Equalising the age of entitlement for Winter Fuel Payments at 60 for men and women will mean annual expenditure may increase by an estimated &#163;85 million. Backdating the payments to the start of the scheme for up to 1.9 million people will have an estimated one-off programme cost of &#163;115 million.

 Responsibility for financial support of 19-year-old students who are in full-time education rests primarily with the student support system.

2. Estimated numbers entitled to but not receiving benefit have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 cases. The sum of the components (the individual benefits) may not add up to the total due to rounding.<P>

3. A pensioner benefit unit is defined as a single person aged 60 or over or a couple (not necessarily married) at least one of whom is aged 60 or over.<P>

4. The estimates under "Total" in the table refer to the total of Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. They should be regarded as rough estimates only because they count recipients of more than one benefit more than once and count those entitled to but not receiving more than one benefit more than once. <P>

<a name="00113w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Some information is available from departmental and other surveys on levels of debt generally, although no specific assessment has been attempted which would link such data to information about pension provision and the stakeholder pensions target group. Stakeholder pension schemes will give up to 5 million people on moderate earnings the option of a secure, flexible and value-for-money funded pension. We believe that those who can afford to save for their retirement should do so, but the affordability of pension contributions in relation to other commitments is a matter for individual decision.

 The total debt stock of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries likely to qualify for relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative as having an unsustainable debt burden after traditional debt relief mechanisms is $143 billion. The enhanced HIPC initiative will reduce the debts owed by these countries by $100 billion, or two thirds.

<a name="00113w08.html_para0">We want the enhanced HIPC initiative to start a new virtuous cycle of debt relief, poverty alleviation and economic development. The transformation of the IMF's structural adjustment facility into the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility means that, for the first time, the IMF and World Bank have agreed to stand back and let countries develop their own poverty reduction strategies in partnership with the population and civil society.
<P>

<a name="00113w08.html_para1">Having helped to secure multilateral funding for the initiative, the Government have decided that the time is right to take the extra step of eliminating all the bilateral debts owned to us by the poorest countries. Our pledge of 100 per cent. debt relief for countries qualifying under the HIPC initiative will cover all debts (both pre cut-off date debt and post cut-off date debt) owed to ECGD by these countries.

 The National Health Service Pension Scheme only pays survivor benefits to legal spouses or dependent children.

The proportion increased with age up to retirement, and then reduced with increasing age thereafter, allowing for the likelihood that the spouse may have predeceased the member.
<P>

<a name="00113w08.html_para9">The actuarial assumptions are based on an analysis of the experience within the scheme. For the last report, it was assumed that on average 66 per cent. of contributing and deferred members would have an entitlement to a survivor's benefit, if death occurred in the following year. The assumption for pensioners was 50 per cent. These assumptions will be reviewed as part of the next report, which is expected to be available around mid-2001.

We will roll out this approach to other cancer sites so that by the end of 2000 we will make this high quality standard of care available for all suspected cancer requiring an urgent specialist appointment. We will also tackle patient uncertainty about the timing of their treatment through the cancer services collaborative, part of the booked admissions programme, which will improve patient access to diagnosis, treatment and care. The cancer services collaborative currently covers a population of 14 million. Lessons learned from the collaborative will be shared with the wider National Health Service from 2001.

 The Government have not published specific advice on the health benefits of organically grown produce. This is because at present there is little information available on which to make meaningful comparisons between nutrient contents or organic and conventional produce.
<P>

<a name="00113w09.html_para0">A study commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the nutritional composition of organically grown fruit and vegetables found only small differences in levels of some nutrients between organically grown and conventionally grown fruit and vegetables. However, it did note that confounding variables, such as differences in the variety grown and the age of samples, made it difficult to draw comparisons. A handful of similar studies have been published in the mainstream scientific literature since. In general, these have found no consistent or significant differences in nutrient content between organic and conventional produce.
